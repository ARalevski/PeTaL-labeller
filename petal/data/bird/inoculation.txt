Why is the flu vaccine so mediocre?
<p>With flu season around the corner in the United States and Europe, the push has begun once again to encourage people to receive their annual shots. But over the past few years, it's become increasingly clear that the level of protection offered by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e varies widely each flu season, from 10% to 60%. And new research has revealed surprising reasons for its lackluster performance. For decades, it appeared that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e had an efficacy of 70% to 90%, but scientists now know that's because they were using a misleading test—replaced in the 1990s—to assess whether it protected people. The traditional explanation for failure also has been revamped. The flu strains selected for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e change each year based on what's in circulation, and scientists long blamed failure on mutations that occur in the circulating viruses in the 6–8 months that pass between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e being manufactured and used. But these "mismatches" sometimes occur in years when there's solid protection, and some years with lots of failure have good matches. It turns out that other forces at work include mutations in the strain selected for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e during the manufacturing process, which grows the virus in eggs. People's prior exposure to influenza also can bias their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e system toward a response that undermines that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e-triggered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity. And the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e strain selection process itself relies heavily on the ferret animal model, which can mislead, too. There's an increasing call now to improve the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e and organize the research community to more collaboratively try to develop a "universal" flu shot that works against many strains and lasts for many years, if not a lifetime. </p>

Protein crystallization promotes type 2 immunity and is reversible by antibody treatment
<p>Although spontaneous protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization is a rare event in vivo, Charcot-Leyden <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s (CLCs) consisting of galectin-10 (Gal10) protein are frequently observed in eosinophilic diseases, such as asthma. We found that CLCs derived from patients showed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> packing and Gal10 structure identical to those of Gal10 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s grown in vitro. When administered to the airways, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>line Gal10 stimulated innate and adaptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity and acted as a type 2 adjuvant. By contrast, a soluble Gal10 mutein was inert. Antibodies directed against key epitopes of the CLC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization interface dissolved preexisting CLCs in patient-derived mucus within hours and reversed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>-driven inflammation, goblet-cell metaplasia, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>oglobulin E (IgE) synthesis, and bronchial hyperreactivity (BHR) in a humanized mouse model of asthma. Thus, protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s may promote hallmark features of asthma and are targetable by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>-dissolving antibodies.</p>

Genetic and phenotypically flexible components of seasonal variation in immune function
<p>Animals cope with seasonal variation in environmental factors by adjustments of physiology and life history. When seasonal variation is partly predictable, such adjustments can be based on a genetic component or be phenotypically flexible. Animals have to allocate limited resources over different demands, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e function. Accordingly, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e traits could change seasonally, and such changes could have a genetic component that differs between environments. We tested this hypothesis in genotypically distinct groups of a widespread songbird, the stonechat (<i>Saxicola torquata</i>). We compared variation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity during 1 year in long-distance migrants, short-distance migrants, tropical residents and hybrids in a common garden environment. Additionally, we investigated phenotypically flexible responses to temperature by applying different temperature regimes to one group. We assessed constitutive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity by measuring hemagglutination, hemolysis, haptoglobin and bactericidal ability against <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. Genotypic groups differed in patterns of variation of all measured <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e indices except haptoglobin. Hybrids differed from, but were rarely intermediate to, parental subspecies. Temperature treatment only influenced patterns of hemolysis and bactericidal ability against <i>E. coli.</i> We conclude that seasonal variation in constitutive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity has a genetic component, that heredity does not follow simple Mendelian rules, and that some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e measures are relatively rigid while others are more flexible. Furthermore, our results support the idea that seasonal variability in constitutive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity is associated with variability in environment and annual-cycle demands. This study stresses the importance of considering seasonal variation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e function in relation to the ecology and life history of the organism of interest.</p>

Upregulation of Human Endogenous Retrovirus-K Is Linked to Immunity and Inflammation in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e dysregulation has been linked to occlusive vascular remodeling in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) that is hereditary, idiopathic, or associated with other conditions. Circulating autoantibodies, lung perivascular lymphoid tissue, and elevated cytokines have been related to PAH pathogenesis but without a clear understanding of how these abnormalities are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ated, perpetuated, and connected in the progression of disease. We therefore set out to identify specific target antigens in PAH lung <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e complexes as a starting point toward resolving these issues to better inform future application of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>omodulatory therapies.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Lung <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e complexes were isolated and PAH target antigens were identified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, confirmed by enzyme-linked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>osorbent assay, and localized by confocal microscopy. One PAH antigen linked to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity and inflammation was pursued and a link to PAH pathophysiology was investigated by next-generation sequencing, functional studies in cultured monocytes and endothelial cells, and hemodynamic and lung studies in a rat.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>SAM domain and HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1), an innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e factor that suppresses HIV replication, was identified and confirmed as highly expressed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e complexes from 16 hereditary and idiopathic PAH versus 12 control lungs. Elevated SAMHD1 was localized to endothelial cells, perivascular dendritic cells, and macrophages, and SAMHD1 antibodies were prevalent in tertiary lymphoid tissue. An unbiased screen using metagenomic sequencing related SAMHD1 to increased expression of human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K) in PAH versus control lungs (n=4). HERV-K envelope and deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase mRNAs were elevated in PAH versus control lungs (n=10), and proteins were localized to macrophages. HERV-K deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase induced SAMHD1 and proinflammatory cytokines (eg, interleukin 6, interleukin 1β, and tumor necrosis factor α) in circulating monocytes, pulmonary arterial endothelial cells, and also activated B cells. Vulnerability of pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (PAEC) to apoptosis was increased by HERV-K deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase in an interleukin 6-independent manner. Furthermore, 3 weekly injections of HERV-K deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase induced hemodynamic and vascular changes of pulmonary hypertension in rats (n=8) and elevated interleukin 6.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our study reveals that upregulation of the endogenous retrovirus HERV-K could both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ate and sustain activation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e system and cause vascular changes associated with PAH.</p></sec>

A sweeter approach to vaccine design
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es have transformed human health. Yet, guided primarily by empiricism for centuries, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e design ultimately met its match in scourges such as HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria, which continue to plague global health. The elusive search for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es against such diseases has driven researchers of diverse expertise to forgo empirical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ology. Instead, they favor a reductionist approach inspired by how pathogens interact with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e system, which has evolved to distinguish foreign from self by sensing both physical (e.g, size) and chemical (e.g., foreign molecules) features of pathogens. This has guided the rational design of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es that mimic key pathogen properties, including arraying antigens on particles to increase recognition by antibody-producing B cells (<i>1</i>). However, the mechanisms by which multivalent antigen display on nanoparticles—either synthetic or natural—enhances <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity, and how this may influence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e design principles, remain unresolved. On page 649 of this issue, Tokatlian <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) help fill this knowledge gap by demonstrating that engineering nanoparticles with glycans—sugar molecules—is critical to potentiating antibody responses. This might lead to improved next-generation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es against a wide diversity of pathogens.</p>

Reducing the stochasticity of crystal nucleation to enable subnanosecond memory writing
<p>Operation speed is a key challenge in phase-change random-access memory (PCRAM) technology, especially for achieving subnanosecond high-speed cache memory. Commercialized PCRAM products are limited by the tens of nanoseconds writing speed, originating from the stochastic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nucleat</span></strong>ion during the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization of amorphous germanium antimony telluride<i> </i>(Ge<sub>2</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>5</sub>). Here, we demonstrate an alloying strategy to speed up the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization kinetics. The scandium antimony telluride (Sc<sub>0.2</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub>) compound that we designed allows a writing speed of only 700 picoseconds without preprogramming in a large conventional PCRAM device. This ultrafast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization stems from the reduced stochasticity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nucleat</span></strong>ion through geometrically matched and robust scandium telluride (ScTe) chemical bonds that stabilize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> precursors in the amorphous state. Controlling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nucleat</span></strong>ion through alloy design paves the way for the development of cache-type PCRAM technology to boost the working efficiency of computing systems.</p>

Ethics of maternal vaccination
<p>Innovations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e science have given us an incredible opportunity to leverage the maternal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e system to improve maternal, fetal, and infant health outcomes. Maternal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ation reduces the risk of infant infection primarily through the transfer of protective maternal antibodies to the fetus (<i>1</i>). Although a growing number of countries are adopting maternal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e programs against diseases like influenza and pertussis, and there is an increased focus on including pregnant women in trials for new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es, there is little discussion of the ethical underpinnings of maternal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e programs (<i>2</i>). We see the proposals thus far as being overly paternalistic, founded on a too-limited conception of risk-benefit analyses that has potential to derail the development and use of lifesaving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es. By contrast, an ethical approach focused on mothers' primary interests in protecting themselves and their children could serve as the basis of the ethical framework that guides <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e policies.</p>

Zika rewrites maternal immunization ethics
<p>Pregnant women long have been excluded from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e studies because researchers are wary of causing unintended harm to the highly vulnerable developing fetus. But a new report from a group that represents many disciplines contends that ethics demand pregnant women be included in the trial of experimental Zika <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es, which are designed to protect babies from brain damage and other maladies caused by that mosquito-borne virus. The report is careful to point out that risk/benefit ratios must be weighed for each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e and each trial on a case-by-case basis—and indeed the Zika <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e that has moved furthest in human studies rightly excludes pregnant women, says a co-author of the report. Other experimental maternal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>izations designed to protect babies are also being tested now, and one trial, for a respiratory syncytial virus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e, includes pregnant women. A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e against group B streptococcus has also moved along the development pipeline and may soon enter trials with pregnant women, too.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
A Subset of Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes Is Essential for Plant Immunity
<p>Of the three classes of enzymes involved in ubiquitination, ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2) have been often incorrectly considered to play merely an auxiliary role in the process, and few E2 enzymes have been investigated in plants. To reveal the role of E2 in plant innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity, we identified and cloned 40 tomato genes encoding ubiquitin E2 proteins. Thioester assays indicated that the majority of the genes encode enzymatically active E2. Phylogenetic analysis classified the 40 tomato E2 enzymes into 13 groups, of which members of group III were found to interact and act specifically with AvrPtoB, a <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>tomato</i> effector that uses its ubiquitin ligase (E3) activity to suppress host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity. Knocking down the expression of group III E2 genes in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> diminished the AvrPtoB-promoted degradation of the Fen kinase and the AvrPtoB suppression of host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity-associated programmed cell death. Importantly, silencing group III E2 genes also resulted in reduced pattern-triggered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity (PTI). By contrast, programmed cell death induced by several effector-triggered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity elicitors was not affected on group III-silenced plants. Functional characterization suggested redundancy among group III members for their role in the suppression of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity by AvrPtoB and in PTI and identified UBIQUITIN-CONJUGATING11 (UBC11), UBC28, UBC29, UBC39, and UBC40 as playing a more significant role in PTI than other group III members. Our work builds a foundation for the further characterization of E2s in plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity and reveals that AvrPtoB has evolved a strategy for suppressing host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity that is difficult for the plant to thwart.</p>

Crystal-clear treatment for allergic disease

On page 751 of this issue, Persson <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) confirm anecdotal evidence that CLCs are a key feature of severe asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. They demonstrate that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s, but not the soluble proteins, are powerful promoters of allergic inflammation and can be targeted with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>-dissolving antibodies to reverse disease symptoms.</p>

Immunity as a continuum of archetypes
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e system has long been recognized for its importance in eliminating pathogens. Recently, it has become appreciated for additional distinct roles in normal tissue biology, contributing to tissue development and maintenance. Further, it is being revealed as a major force in diseases as diverse as fibrosis, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as cancer. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e system is exquisitely selective; more than a billion different adaptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e lymphocytes (T cells and B cells) survey the body. These can individually be sensitized to antigens—for example, by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ation—leading to their expansion and to a rapid and protective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e response that destroys antigen-bearing cells upon reexposure. Alternatively, the system can become “tolerant” when antigen-specific T cells and/or B cells are deleted or inactivated. Historically, activation versus inaction (tolerance) have dominated views of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e system. These, however, should be considered the extremes of a continuum of “archetypal” response states that collections of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e cells can take, many of which serve to accommodate dynamic tissue function.</p>

Innate immune recognition of glycans targets HIV nanoparticle immunogens to germinal centers

We compared the fates of two different heavily glycosylated HIV antigens, a gp120-derived mini-protein and a large, stabilized envelope trimer, in protein nanoparticle or “free” forms after primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ization. Unlike monomeric antigens, nanoparticles were rapidly shuttled to the follicular dendritic cell (FDC) network and then concentrated in germinal centers in a complement-, mannose-binding lectin (MBL)–, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ogen glycan–dependent manner. Loss of FDC localization in MBL-deficient mice or via <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ogen deglycosylation significantly affected antibody responses.

Colossal grain growth yields single-crystal metal foils by contact-free annealing
<p>Single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> metals have distinctive properties owing to the absence of grain boundaries and strong anisotropy. Commercial single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> metals are usually synthesized by bulk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> growth</span></strong> or by deposition of thin films onto substrates, and they are expensive and small. We prepared extremely large single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> metal foils by “contact-free annealing” from commercial poly<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>line foils. The colossal grain growth (up to 32 square centimeters) is achieved by minimizing contact stresses, resulting in a preferred in-plane and out-of-plane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> orientation, and is driven by surface energy minimization during the rotation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> lattice followed by “consumption” of neighboring grains. Industrial-scale production of single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> metal foils is possible as a result of this discovery.</p>

Reovirus infection triggers inflammatory responses to dietary antigens and development of celiac disease
<p>Viral infections have been proposed to elicit pathological processes leading to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ation of T helper 1 (T<sub>H</sub>1) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity against dietary gluten and celiac disease (CeD). To test this hypothesis and gain insights into mechanisms underlying virus-induced loss of tolerance to dietary antigens, we developed a viral infection model that makes use of two reovirus strains that infect the intestine but differ in their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>opathological outcomes. Reovirus is an avirulent pathogen that elicits protective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity, but we discovered that it can nonetheless disrupt intestinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e homeostasis at inductive and effector sites of oral tolerance by suppressing peripheral regulatory T cell (pT<sub>reg</sub>) conversion and promoting T<sub>H</sub>1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity to dietary antigen. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ation of T<sub>H</sub>1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity to dietary antigen was dependent on interferon regulatory factor 1 and dissociated from suppression of pT<sub>reg</sub> conversion, which was mediated by type-1 interferon. Last, our study in humans supports a role for infection with reovirus, a seemingly innocuous virus, in triggering the development of CeD.</p>

Analysis of the ZAR1 Immune Complex Reveals Determinants for Immunity and Molecular Interactions<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plants depend on innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity to prevent disease. Plant pathogenic bacteria, like <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> and <i>Xanthomonas campestris</i>, use the type III secretion system as a molecular syringe to inject type III secreted effector (T3SE) proteins in plants. The primary function of most T3SEs is to suppress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity; however, the plant can evolve nucleotide-binding domain-leucine-rich repeat domain-containing proteins to recognize specific T3SEs. The AtZAR1 NLR induces strong defense responses against <i>P. syringae</i> and <i>X. campestris</i>. The <i>P. syringae</i> T3SE HopZ1a is an acetyltransferase that acetylates the pseudokinase AtZED1 and triggers recognition by AtZAR1. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that lead to AtZAR1-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity in response to HopZ1a. We established a transient expression system in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> to study detailed interactions among HopZ1a, AtZED1, and AtZAR1. We show that the AtZAR1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e pathway is conserved in <i>N. benthamiana</i> and identify AtZAR1 domains, and residues in AtZAR1 and AtZED1, that are important for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity and protein-protein interactions in planta and in yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>). We show that the coiled-coil domain of AtZAR1 oligomerizes, and this domain acts as a signal to induce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity. This detailed analysis of the AtZAR1-AtZED1 protein complex provides a better understanding of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e signaling hub controlled by AtZAR1.</p>

Immunogene and viral transcript dynamics during parasitic <i>Varroa destructor</i> mite infection of developing honey bee (<i>Apis mellifera</i>) pupae
<p>The ectoparasitic <i>Varroa destructor</i> mite is a major contributor to the ongoing honey bee health crisis. <i>Varroa</i> interacts with honey bee viruses, exacerbating their pathogenicity. In addition to vectoring viruses, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>osuppression of the developing honey bee hosts by <i>Varroa</i> has been proposed to explain the synergy between viruses and mites. However, the evidence for honey bee <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e suppression by <i>V. destructor</i> is contentious. We systematically studied the quantitative effects of experimentally introduced <i>V. destructor</i> mites on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e gene expression at five specific time points during the development of the honey bee hosts. Mites reproduced normally and were associated with increased titers of deformed wing virus in the developing bees. Our data on different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e genes show little evidence for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>osuppression of honey bees by <i>V. destructor</i>. Experimental wounding of developing bees increases relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e gene expression and deformed wing virus titers. Combined, these results suggest that mite feeding activity itself and not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>osuppression may contribute to the synergy between viruses and mites. However, our results also suggest that increased expression of honey bee <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e genes decreases mite reproductive success, which may be explored to enhance mite control strategies. Finally, our expression data for multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e genes across developmental time and different experimental treatments indicates co-regulation of several of these genes and thus improves our understanding of the understudied honey bee <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e system.</p>

Functional analysis of a zebrafish <i>myd88</i> mutant identifies key transcriptional components of the innate immune system

The zebrafish is increasingly used as a complementary model system for disease research and drug screening. Here, we describe a zebrafish line with a truncated version of MyD88 as the first zebrafish mutant for a TLR signaling component. We show that this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e-compromised mutant has a lower survival rate under standard rearing conditions and is more susceptible to challenge with the acute bacterial pathogens <i>Edwardsiella tarda</i> and <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i>. Microarray and quantitative PCR analysis revealed that expression of genes for transcription factors central to innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity (including NF-ĸB and AP-1) and the pro-inflammatory cytokine Il1b, is dependent on MyD88 signaling during these bacterial infections. Nevertheless, expression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e genes independent of MyD88 in the <i>myd88</i> mutant line was sufficient to limit growth of an attenuated <i>S. typhimurium</i> strain. In the case of infection with the chronic bacterial pathogen <i>Mycobacterium marinum</i>, we show that MyD88 signaling has an important protective role during early pathogenesis. During mycobacterial infection, the <i>myd88</i> mutant shows accelerated formation of granuloma-like aggregates and increased bacterial burden, with associated lower induction of genes central to innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity. This zebrafish <i>myd88</i> mutant will be a valuable tool for further study of the role of IL1R and TLR signaling in the innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity processes underlying infectious diseases, inflammatory disorders and cancer.</p>

Time to Epinephrine Administration and Survival From Nonshockable Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Among Children and Adults
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that earlier epinephrine administration is associated with improved survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with shockable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>al rhythms. However, the effect of epinephrine timing on patients with nonshockable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>al rhythms is unclear. The objective of this study was to measure the association between time to epinephrine administration and survival in adults and children with emergency medical services (EMS)–treated OHCA with nonshockable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>al rhythms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed a secondary analysis of OHCAs prospectively identified by the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium network from June 4, 2011, to June 30, 2015. We included patients of all ages with an EMS-treated OHCA and an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>al nonshockable rhythm. We excluded those with return of spontaneous circulation in <10 minutes. We conducted a subgroup analysis involving patients <18 years of age. The primary exposure was time (minutes) from arrival of the first EMS agency to the first dose of epinephrine. Secondary exposure was time to epinephrine dichotomized as early (<10 minutes) or late (≥10 minutes). The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. We adjusted for Utstein covariates and Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium study site.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>From 55 568 EMS-treated OHCAs, 32 101 patients with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>al nonshockable rhythms were included. There were 12 238 in the early group, 14 517 in the late group, and 5346 not treated with epinephrine. After adjusting for potential confounders, each minute from EMS arrival to epinephrine administration was associated with a 4% decrease in odds of survival for adults, odds ratio=0.96 (95% confidence interval, 0.95–0.98). A subgroup analysis (n=13 290) examining neurological outcomes showed a similar association (adjusted odds ratio, 0.94 per minute; 95% confidence interval, 0.89–0.98). When epinephrine was given late in comparison with early, odds of survival were 18% lower (odds ratio, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.68–0.98). In a pediatric analysis (n=595), odds of survival were 9% lower (odds ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.81–1.01) for each minute delay in epinephrine.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among OHCAs with nonshockable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>al rhythms, the majority of patients were administered epinephrine >10 minutes after EMS arrival. Each minute delay in epinephrine administration was associated with decreased survival and unfavorable neurological outcomes. EMS agencies should consider strategies to reduce epinephrine administration times in patients with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>al nonshockable rhythms.</p></sec>

Spin coating epitaxial films
<p>Spin-coated films, such as photoresists for lithography or perovskite films for solar cells, are either amorphous or poly<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>line. We show that epitaxial films of inorganic materials such as cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr<sub>3</sub>), lead(II) iodide (PbI<sub>2</sub>), zinc oxide (ZnO), and sodium chloride (NaCl) can be deposited onto a variety of single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> and single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>–like substrates by simply spin coating either solutions of the material or precursors to the material.

Single-crystal x-ray diffraction structures of covalent organic frameworks
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization problem is an outstanding challenge in the chemistry of porous covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Their structural characterization has been limited to modeling and solutions based on powder x-ray or electron diffraction data. Single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s of COFs amenable to x-ray diffraction characterization have not been reported. Here, we developed a general procedure to grow large single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s of three-dimensional imine-based COFs (COF-300, hydrated form of COF-300, COF-303, LZU-79, and LZU-111).

Genome-wide identification of interferon-sensitive mutations enables influenza vaccine design
<p>In conventional attenuated viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ogenicity is often suboptimal. Here we present a systematic approach for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e development that eliminates interferon (IFN)–modulating functions genome-wide while maintaining virus replication fitness. We applied a quantitative high-throughput genomics system to influenza A virus that simultaneously measured the replication fitness and IFN sensitivity of mutations across the entire genome. By incorporating eight IFN-sensitive mutations, we generated a hyper–interferon-sensitive (HIS) virus as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e candidate. HIS virus is highly attenuated in IFN-competent hosts but able to induce transient IFN responses, elicits robust humoral and cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e responses, and provides protection against homologous and heterologous viral challenges. Our approach, which attenuates the virus and promotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e responses concurrently, is broadly applicable for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e development against other pathogens.</p>

First flu is forever
<p>Influenza is a threat that has been with humans throughout history, fueled by a constant race between host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity and viral evolution. Control strategies rely on annual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>izations and require frequent updates of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e, an expensive, cumbersome, and not always foolproof process. Efforts are therefore under way to develop <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es that confer broadly cross-protective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity to diverse influenza strains. Cross-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity is pervasive in nature; in multistrain viral diseases such as influenza or dengue, response to a primary infection can profoundly influence response to the next strain encountered. Even unrelated viruses can be recognized by the same cross-reactive T cells. On page 722 of this issue (<i>1</i>), Gostic <i>et al.</i> show that severe infection with a bird flu virus depends on the individual's first encounter with influenza in childhood.</p>

BRASSINOSTEROID-SIGNALING KINASE5 Associates with Immune Receptors and Is Required for Immune Responses
<p>Plants utilize cell surface-localized pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to detect pathogen- or damage-associated molecular patterns (PAMP/DAMPs) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ate pattern-triggered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity (PTI). Here, we investigated the role of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) BRASSINOSTEROID-SIGNALING KINASE5 (BSK5), a member of the receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase subfamily XII, in PRR-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity. BSK5 localized to the plant cell periphery, interacted in yeast and in planta with multiple receptor-like kinases, including the ELONGATION FACTOR-TU RECEPTOR (EFR) and PEP1 RECEPTOR1 (PEPR1) PRRs, and was phosphorylated in vitro by PEPR1 and EFR in the kinase activation loop. Consistent with a role in PTI, <i>bsk5</i> mutant plants displayed enhanced susceptibility to the bacterial pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> and to the fungus <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>. Furthermore, <i>bsk5</i> mutant plants were impaired in several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e responses induced by the elf18, pep1, and flg22 PAMP/DAMPs, including resistance to <i>P. syringae</i> and <i>B. cinerea</i>, production of reactive oxygen species, callose deposition at the cell wall, and enhanced <i>PATHOGENESIS-RELATED1</i> gene expression. However, <i>bsk5</i> plants were not affected in PAMP/DAMP activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and expression of the <i>FLG22-INDUCED RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE1</i> or the WRKY domain-containing gene <i>WRKY29</i>. BSK5 variants mutated in the BSK5 myristoylation site, ATP-binding site, and kinase activation loop failed to complement defective PTI phenotypes of <i>bsk5</i> mutant plants, suggesting that localization to the cell periphery, kinase activity, and phosphorylation by PRRs are critical for the function of BSK5 in PTI. These findings demonstrate that BSK5 plays a role in PTI by interacting with multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e receptors.</p>

Roles of Receptor-Like Cytoplasmic Kinase VII Members in Pattern-Triggered Immune Signaling
<p>Pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), which consist of receptor kinases (RKs) and receptor-like proteins, sense microbe- and host-derived molecular patterns associated with pathogen infection to trigger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e responses in plants. Several kinases of the 46-member Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase (RLCK) subfamily VII play important roles in pattern-triggered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity, but it is unclear whether different RLCK VII members act specifically or redundantly in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e signaling. Here, we constructed nine higher order mutants of this subfamily (named <i>rlck vii-1</i> to <i>rlck vii-9</i>) and systematically characterized their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e phenotypes. The mutants <i>rlck vii-5</i>, -<i>7</i>, and -<i>8</i> had compromised reactive oxygen species production in response to all patterns tested, indicating that the corresponding members are broadly required for the signaling of multiple PRRs. However, <i>rlck vii-4</i> was defective specifically in chitin-induced reactive oxygen species production, suggesting that RCLK VII-4 members mediate the signaling of specific PRRs. Furthermore, RLCK VII-4 members were required for the chitin-triggered activation of MAPK, demonstrating that these kinases link a PRR to MAPK activation. Moreover, we found that RLCK VII-6 and -8 also were required for RK-mediated root growth. Together, these results show that numerous RLCK VII members are involved in pattern-triggered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e signaling and uncover both common and specific roles of these kinases in plant development and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity mediated by various RKs.</p>

Modulation of Plant Salicylic Acid-Associated Immune Responses via Glycosylation of Dihydroxybenzoic Acids
<p>Salicylic acid (SA) plays a crucial role in plant innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity. The deployment of SA-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e responses is primarily affected by SA concentration, which is determined by a balance between SA biosynthesis and catabolism. However, the mechanisms regulating SA homeostasis are poorly understood. In this study, we characterized a unique UDP-glycosyltransferase, UGT76D1, which plays an important role in SA homeostasis and associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e responses in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Expression of <i>UGT76D1</i> was induced by treatment with both the pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv. <i>tomato</i> (<i>Pst</i>) DC3000 and SA. Overexpression of <i>UGT76D1</i> resulted in high SA accumulation, significant up-regulation of pathogen-related genes, and a hypersensitive response (HR)-like lesion mimic phenotype. This HR-like phenotype was not observed following <i>UGT76D1</i> overexpression in SA-deficient <i>NahG</i> transgenic or <i>sid2</i> plants, suggesting that the phenotype is SA dependent. Biochemical assays showed that UGT76D1 glycosylated 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,3-DHBA) and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,5-DHBA), the major catabolic forms of SA, to their Glc and Xyl conjugates in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, in a mutant background blocked in the formation of 2,3-DHBA and 2,5-DHBA, <i>UGT76D1</i> overexpression did not cause a HR-like lesion mimic phenotype. Following infection with <i>Pst</i> DC3000, <i>UGT76D1</i> knockout mutants displayed a delayed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e response, with reduced levels of DHBA glycosides and SA, and down-regulated SA synthase expression. By contrast, <i>UGT76D1</i> overexpression lines showed an enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e response and increased SA biosynthesis before and after pathogen infection. Thus, we propose that UGT76D1 plays an important role in SA homeostasis and plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e responses by facilitating glycosylation of dihydroxybenzoic acids.</p>

Antiarrhythmic Drugs for Nonshockable-Turned-Shockable Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) commonly presents with nonshockable rhythms (asystole and pulseless electric activity). It is unknown whether antiarrhythmic drugs are safe and effective when nonshockable rhythms evolve to shockable rhythms (ventricular fibrillation/pulseless ventricular tachycardia [VF/VT]) during resuscitation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Adults with nontraumatic OHCA, vascular access, and VF/VT anytime after ≥1 shock(s) were prospectively randomized, double-blind, to receive amiodarone, lidocaine, or placebo by paramedics. Patients presenting with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>al shock-refractory VF/VT were previously reported. The current study was a prespecified analysis in a separate cohort that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ally presented with nonshockable OHCA and was randomized on subsequently developing shock-refractory VF/VT. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes included discharge functional status and adverse drug-related effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 37 889 patients with OHCA, 3026 with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>al VF/VT and 1063 with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>al nonshockable-turned-shockable rhythms were treatment-eligible, were randomized, and received their assigned drug. Baseline characteristics among patients with nonshockable-turned-shockable rhythms were balanced across treatment arms, except that recipients of a placebo included fewer men and were less likely to receive bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Active-drug recipients in this cohort required fewer shocks, supplemental doses of their assigned drug, and ancillary antiarrhythmic drugs than recipients of a placebo (<i>P</i><0.05). In all, 16 (4.1%) amiodarone, 11 (3.1%) lidocaine, and 6 (1.9%) placebo-treated patients survived to hospital discharge (<i>P</i>=0.24). No significant interaction between treatment assignment and discharge survival occurred with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ating OHCA rhythm (asystole, pulseless electric activity, or VF/VT). Survival in each of these categories was consistently higher with active drugs, although the trends were not statistically significant. Adjusted absolute differences (95% confidence interval) in survival from nonshockable-turned-shockable arrhythmias with amiodarone versus placebo were 2.3% (−0.3, 4.8), <i>P</i>=0.08, and for lidocaine versus placebo 1.2% (−1.1, 3.6), <i>P</i>=0.30.

IL-33 and ST2 mediate FAK-dependent antitumor immune evasion through transcriptional networks
<p>Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) mediates tumor cell–intrinsic behaviors that promote tumor growth and metastasis. We previously showed that FAK also induces the expression of inflammatory genes that inhibit antitumor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity in the microenvironment. We identified a crucial, previously unknown role for the dual-function cytokine interleukin-33 (IL-33) in FAK-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e evasion. In murine squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells, specifically nuclear FAK enhanced the expression of the genes encoding IL-33, the chemokine CCL5, and the soluble, secreted form of the IL-33 receptor, called soluble ST2 (sST2). The abundance of IL-33 and CCL5 was increased in FAK-positive SCC cells but not in normal keratinocytes. IL-33 associated with FAK in the nucleus, and the FAK–IL-33 complex interacted with a network of chromatin modifiers and transcriptional regulators, including TAF9, WDR82, and BRD4, which promote the activity of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and its induction of genes encoding chemokines, including CCL5. We did not detect secretion of IL-33 from FAK-positive SCC cells; thus, we propose that the increased production and secretion of sST2 likely sequesters IL-33 secreted by other cell types within the tumor environment, thus blocking its stimulatory effects on infiltrating host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e cells. Depleting FAK, IL-33, or sST2 from SCC cells before implantation induced tumor regression in syngeneic mice, except when CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were co-depleted. Our data provide mechanistic insight into how FAK controls the tumor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e environment, namely, through a transcriptional regulatory network mediated by nuclear IL-33. Targeting this axis may boost antitumor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity in patients.</p>

Cytoskeletal adaptivity regulates T cell receptor signaling
<p>The factors that govern T cell activation control the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ation and progression of adaptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e responses. T cells recognize their cognate antigen on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) through the T cell receptor, which results in the formation of a contact region (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e synapse) between the two cells and the activation of the T cells. Activated T cells proliferate and differentiate into effector T cells that secrete cytokines, provide help to B cells, and kill target cells. We asked whether the actin cytoskeleton governs differences in signaling in effector T cells versus naive (unstimulated) T cells. Using atomic force microscopy and quantitative confocal microscopy, we found that naive T cells had a mechanically stiffer cortical cytoskeleton than that of effector cells, which resulted in naive cells forming smaller <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e synapses with APCs. This suggests that the cytoskeletal stiffness of the T cell before it undergoes antigen stimulation predicts its subsequent dynamic engagement with APCs and its activation potential. Cytoskeletal rigidity depended on the activity of the actin-severing enzyme cofilin through a pathway requiring the small guanosine triphosphatase RhoA and the kinases ROCK (Rho-activated kinase) and LIMK. These findings suggest that the baseline cytoskeletal state controls T cell responses and that the underlying pathway could be a therapeutic target for modulating adaptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity.</p>

Steep drop in Zika cases undermines vaccine trial
<p>When Zika raced through the Americas in 2016, it caused widespread alarm because the usually mild infection led to brain damage in babies. An intense effort began to develop a Zika <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e, and in March 2017, the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases launched a $110 million trial of its most promising candidate. The trial, now taking place in nine countries in North and South America, has hit a wall: There are too few cases of Zika in the region—largely because vast swaths of populations were infected and now are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e—to assess whether the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e works.

This human challenge model, used for decades with other diseases, was dismissed as too risky by an ethics committee just last year, mainly because infected people can sexually transmit the virus to people who are not in the study. But given the drop in transmission, a better understanding about the duration of sexual transmission, and decreasing interest from industry in Zika <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e R&D, the human challenge model now looks like the best way to move the field forward.</p>

Congo rapidly curtails Ebola
<p>An outbreak of Ebola that surfaced in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) on 8 May has petered out and, for the first time, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e may have had a role in containing spread. To date, Ebola has struck 53 people in the DRC's Équateur province, killing 29. Most everyone lived in remote, difficult-to-reach villages, although four cases surfaced in the heavily populated city of Mbandaka, triggering serious concerns of an epidemic exploding. A vigorous, rapid effort to contain spread began immediately, with the DRC's Ministry of Public Health working with international partners to build treatment facilities, conduct surveillance, and trace contacts of cases. On 21 May, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e effort began that focused on creating a "ring" around cases by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ating people they may have come in contact with directly or indirectly.

CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> mononuclear phagocytes control immunity to intestinal fungi
<p>Intestinal fungi are an important component of the microbiota, and recent studies have unveiled their potential in modulating host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e homeostasis and inflammatory disease. Nonetheless, the mechanisms governing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity to gut fungal communities (mycobiota) remain unknown. We identified CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) as being essential for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ation of innate and adaptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e responses to intestinal fungi. CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> MNPs express antifungal receptors and activate antifungal responses in a Syk-dependent manner. Genetic ablation of CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> MNPs in mice led to changes in gut fungal communities and to severe colitis that was rescued by antifungal treatment. In Crohn’s disease patients, a missense mutation in the gene encoding CX3CR1 was identified and found to be associated with impaired antifungal responses. These results unravel a role of CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> MNPs in mediating interactions between intestinal mycobiota and host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity at steady state and during inflammatory disease.</p>

Safety concerns derail dengue vaccination program
<p>Efforts to control dengue suffered a major setback in late November when Sanofi Pasteur announced that its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e, the only one on the market, should only be given to those who have already had one infection with the mosquito-borne disease that affects millions of people in the tropics each year. The dengue virus comes in four serotypes. A first infection is usually mild, but a second infection with a different serotype puts the patient at risk of a serious, occasionally life-threatening illness. A retrospective analysis of those who participated in phase III trials in 2011 found that those who had never had a dengue infection at the time of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ation were in rare cases at risk of enhanced disease, although the Dengvaxia <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e did reduce infections and cases of serious illness in those who had previously suffered from dengue. The news caused an uproar in the Philippines, where a mass <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ation campaign was halted. And the incident is likely to lead health officials to carefully scrutinize other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es now in development.</p>

Mouse models of acute and chronic hepacivirus infection
<p>An estimated 71 million people worldwide are infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). The lack of small-animal models has impeded studies of antiviral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e mechanisms. Here we show that an HCV-related hepacivirus discovered in Norway rats can establish high-titer hepatotropic infections in laboratory mice with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ological features resembling those seen in human viral hepatitis. Whereas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e-compromised mice developed persistent infection, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e-competent mice cleared the virus within 3 to 5 weeks. Acute clearance was T cell dependent and associated with liver injury. Transient depletion of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells before infection resulted in chronic infection, characterized by high levels of intrahepatic regulatory T cells and expression of inhibitory molecules on intrahepatic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Natural killer cells controlled early infection but were not essential for viral clearance. This model may provide mechanistic insights into hepatic antiviral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity, a prerequisite for the development of HCV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es.</p>

The receptor kinase FER is a RALF-regulated scaffold controlling plant immune signaling
<p>In plants, perception of invading pathogens involves cell-surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e receptor kinases. Here, we report that the <i>Arabidopsis</i> SITE-1 PROTEASE (S1P) cleaves endogenous RAPID ALKALINIZATION FACTOR (RALF) propeptides to inhibit plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity. This inhibition is mediated by the malectin-like receptor kinase FERONIA (FER), which otherwise facilitates the ligand-induced complex formation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e receptor kinases EF-TU RECEPTOR (EFR) and FLAGELLIN-SENSING 2 (FLS2) with their co-receptor BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1–ASSOCIATED KINASE 1 (BAK1) to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e signaling.

A half-billion-dollar bid to head off emerging diseases
<p>In the wake of the Ebola crisis that erupted in West Africa in 2014, many public health leaders recognized that a more aggressive effort to develop <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es could have moved a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e forward more quickly and prevented that outbreak from becoming an epidemic. A new organization was formed last year, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), to speed development of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es against emerging infectious diseases—but it had no serious financial backing. Now, CEPI has attracted nearly a half-billion dollars in funding, as it planned to announce at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, this week. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust each donated $100 million, and the governments of Norway, Japan, and Germany make up the balance. CEPI also decided to focus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ally on three diseases—Lassa, Nipah, and Middle East respiratory syndrome–coronavirus—and it will soon seek proposals from academia and industry to make these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es and conduct early phase trials so that they're at the ready for a real-word efficacy test when these pathogens emerge.</p>

BRASSINOSTEROID-SIGNALING KINASE1 Phosphorylates MAPKKK5 to Regulate Immunity in Arabidopsis
<p>Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e receptor FLAGELLIN SENSING2 (FLS2) rapidly forms a complex to activate pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity (PTI) upon perception of the bacterial protein flagellin. The receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase BRASSINOSTEROID-SIGNALINGKINASE1 (BSK1) interacts with FLS2 and is critical for the activation of PTI. However, it is unknown how BSK1 transduces signals to activate downstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e responses. We identified MEK Kinase5 (MAPKKK5) as a potential substrate of BSK1 by whole-genome phosphorylation analysis. In addition, we demonstrated that BSK1 interacts with and phosphorylates MAPKKK5. In the <i>bsk1</i>-<i>1</i> mutant, the Ser-289 residue of MAPKKK5 was not phosphorylated as it was in the wild type. Similar to the <i>bsk1</i> mutant, the <i>mapkkk5</i> mutant displayed enhanced susceptibility to virulent and avirulent strains of the bacterial pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>tomato</i> DC3000, and to the fungal powdery mildew pathogen <i>Golovinomyces cichoracearum</i>. Phosphorylation of the Ser-289 residue is not involved in MAPKKK5-triggered cell death but is critical for MAPKKK5-mediated resistance to both bacterial and fungal pathogens. Furthermore, MAPKKK5 interacts with multiple MAPK kinases, including MKK1, MKK2, MKK4, MKK5, and MKK6. Overall, these results indicate that BSK1 regulates plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity by phosphorylating MAPKKK5 and suggest a direct regulatory mode of signaling from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e complex to the MAPK cascade.</p>

Different Modes of Negative Regulation of Plant Immunity by Calmodulin-Related Genes
<p>Plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e responses activated through the perception of microbe-associated molecular patterns, leading to pattern-triggered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity, are tightly regulated. This results in low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e responses in the absence of pathogens and a rapid return to the resting state following an activation event. Here, we show that two <i>CALMODULIN-LIKE</i> genes, <i>CML46</i> and <i>CML47</i>, negatively regulate salicylic acid accumulation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The double mutant <i>cml46 cml47</i> is highly resistant to the pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>maculicola</i> (<i>Pma</i>). The effects of <i>cml46 cml47</i> on <i>Pma</i> growth are genetically additive to that of <i>cbp60a</i>, a known negative regulator in the <i>CALMODULIN-BINDING PROTEIN60</i> (<i>CBP60</i>) family. Transcriptome profiling revealed the effects of <i>cbp60a</i> and <i>cml46 cml47</i> on both common and separate sets of genes, with the majorities of these differentially expressed genes being <i>Pma</i> responsive. <i>CBP60g</i>, a positive regulator of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity in the <i>CBP60</i> family, was found to be transcriptionally regulated by <i>CBP60a</i>, <i>CML46</i>, and <i>CML47</i>. Analysis of the flg22-induced mRNA levels of <i>CBP60g</i> in <i>cbp60a</i> and <i>cml46 cml47</i> revealed that <i>cml46 cml47</i> plants have higher induced expression while <i>cbp60a</i> plants retain elevated levels longer than wild-type plants. Assays for the effect of flg22 treatment on <i>Pma</i> growth showed that the effect is stronger in <i>cml46 cml47</i> plants and lasts longer in <i>cbp60a</i> plants. Thus, the expression pattern of <i>CBP60g</i> is reflected in flg22-induced resistance to <i>Pma</i>.</p>

RXLR Effector AVR2 Up-Regulates a Brassinosteroid-Responsive bHLH Transcription Factor to Suppress Immunity
<p>An emerging area in plant research focuses on antagonism between regulatory systems governing growth and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity. Such cross talk represents a point of vulnerability for pathogens to exploit. AVR2, an RXLR effector secreted by the potato blight pathogen <i>Phytophthora infestans</i>, interacts with potato BSL1, a putative phosphatase implicated in growth-promoting brassinosteroid (BR) hormone signaling. Transgenic potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>) plants expressing the effector exhibit transcriptional and phenotypic hallmarks of overactive BR signaling and show enhanced susceptibility to <i>P. infestans</i>. Microarray analysis was used to identify a set of BR-responsive marker genes in potato, all of which are constitutively expressed to BR-induced levels in AVR2 transgenic lines. One of these genes was a bHLH transcription factor, designated <i>StCHL1</i>, homologous to <i>AtCIB1</i> and <i>AtHBI1</i>, which are known to facilitate antagonism between BR and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e responses. Transient expression of either AVR2 or CHL1 enhanced leaf colonization by <i>P. infestans</i> and compromised <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e cell death activated by perception of the elicitin Infestin1 (INF1). Knockdown of <i>CHL1</i> transcript using Virus-Induced Gene Silencing (VIGS) reduced colonization of <i>P. infestans</i> on <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. Moreover, the ability of AVR2 to suppress INF1-triggered cell death was attenuated in <i>NbCHL1</i>-silenced plants, indicating that NbCHL1 was important for this effector activity. Thus, AVR2 exploits cross talk between BR signaling and innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity in <i>Solanum</i> species, representing a novel, indirect mode of innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e suppression by a filamentous pathogen effector.</p>

Capping Protein Modulates Actin Remodeling in Response to Reactive Oxygen Species during Plant Innate Immunity
<p>Plants perceive microbe-associated molecular patterns and damage-associated molecular patterns to activate innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e signaling events, such as bursts of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The actin cytoskeleton remodels during the first 5 min of innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e signaling in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis</i> <i>thaliana</i>) epidermal cells; however, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e signals that impinge on actin cytoskeleton and its response regulators remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that rapid actin remodeling upon elicitation with diverse microbe-associated molecular patterns and damage-associated molecular patterns represent a conserved plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e response. Actin remodeling requires ROS generated by the defense-associated NADPH oxidase, RBOHD. Moreover, perception of flg22 by its cognate receptor complex triggers actin remodeling through the activation of RBOHD-dependent ROS production. Our genetic studies reveal that the ubiquitous heterodimeric capping protein transduces ROS signaling to the actin cytoskeleton during innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity. Additionally, we uncover a negative feedback loop between actin remodeling and flg22-induced ROS production.</p>

Escaping the traps of your own hunters
<p>During the first days of an infection, protection is almost entirely provided by innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity, a large part of which consists of one type of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e cell—the neutrophil. Neutrophils form the largest group of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e cells in the body [humans produce ∼10<sup>11</sup> neutrophils daily (<i>1</i>)], and they carry out a number of defense mechanisms, including pathogen ingestion (phagocytosis) and the production of toxic chemicals that kill intruders directly. They can also cause severe hyperinflammatory diseases, such as lethal influenza-associated lung destruction (<i>2</i>, <i>3</i>). In 2004, another neutrophil defense system was discovered. In a final act of protection, dying neutrophils mix their nuclear DNA with toxic components from their cytosolic granules and release it explosively to form a neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) in the surrounding environment. This process is called NETosis (<i>4</i>). In addition to carrying genetic information, DNA is a very long (each nucleus contains ∼2 m of DNA) and sticky polyanionic molecule. Hence, DNA binds to surfaces such as bacterial cell walls by means of charge interactions (<i>5</i>). Through this immobilization on NETs, pathogens are brought into direct contact with cytotoxic molecules on the NET-DNA complex. However, free extracellular DNA is also a potent trigger of severe side effects in the body, for example, by forming <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e complexes with anti nuclear antibodies (antibodies that can bind to DNA) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (<i>6</i>) or by directly clogging blood vessels and establishing vessel-blocking thrombi (<i>7</i>). Consequently, finding mechanisms that mediate the degradation of NETs has been a matter of intense research. On page 1202 of this issue, Jiménez-Alcéázar <i>et al.</i> (<i>8</i>) describe two deoxyribonucleases (DNases) [DNase1 and DNase1-like 3 (DNase1L3)], which cleave DNA and together degrade freshly formed NETs. By doing so, they inhibit otherwise lethal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>opathologies such as thrombus-mediated organ failure.</p>

The structural basis of flagellin detection by NAIP5: A strategy to limit pathogen immune evasion
<p>Robust innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e detection of rapidly evolving pathogens is critical for host defense. Nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins function as cytosolic innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e sensors in plants and animals. However, the structural basis for ligand-induced NLR activation has so far remained unknown. NAIP5 (NLR family, apoptosis inhibitory protein 5) binds the bacterial protein flagellin and assembles with NLRC4 to form a multiprotein complex called an inflammasome. Here we report the cryo–electron microscopy structure of the assembled ~1.4-megadalton flagellin-NAIP5-NLRC4 inflammasome, revealing how a ligand activates an NLR. Six distinct NAIP5 domains contact multiple conserved regions of flagellin, prying NAIP5 into an open and active conformation. We show that innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e recognition of multiple ligand surfaces is a generalizable strategy that limits pathogen evolution and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e escape.</p>

Crystallization and vitrification of electrons in a glass-forming charge liquid
<p>Charge ordering (CO) is a phenomenon in which electrons in solids <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lize into a periodic pattern of charge-rich and charge-poor sites owing to strong electron correlations. This usually results in long-range order. In geometrically frustrated systems, however, a glassy electronic state without long-range CO has been observed. We found that a charge-ordered organic material with an isosceles triangular lattice shows charge dynamics associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization and vitrification of electrons, which can be understood in the context of an energy landscape arising from the degeneracy of various CO patterns. The dynamics suggest that the same <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nucleat</span></strong>ion and growth processes that characterize conventional glass-forming liquids guide the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization of electrons. These similarities may provide insight into our understanding of the liquid-glass transition.</p>

Angular momentum–induced delays in solid-state photoemission enhanced by intra-atomic interactions
<p>Attosecond time-resolved photoemission spectroscopy reveals that photoemission from solids is not yet fully understood. The relative emission delays between four photoemission channels measured for the van der Waals <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> tungsten diselenide (WSe<sub>2</sub>) can only be explained by accounting for both propagation and intra-atomic delays. The intra-atomic delay depends on the angular momentum of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>al localized state and is determined by intra-atomic interactions. For the studied case of WSe<sub>2</sub>, the photoemission events are time ordered with rising <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>al-state angular momentum. Including intra-atomic electron-electron interaction and angular momentum of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>al localized state yields excellent agreement between theory and experiment. This has required a revision of existing models for solid-state photoemission, and thus, attosecond time-resolved photoemission from solids provides important benchmarks for improved future photoemission models.</p>

Where has all the Zika gone?
<p>Only one case of locally transmitted Zika virus has been documented in the United States this year, a reflection of the fact that cases have plummeted in Latin America and the Caribbean. Experts say the cause of the drop has nothing to do with efforts to control the mosquitoes that spread the disease or the impact of climate on their populations. Rather, the rapid spread of the virus through the Americas—which had its first reported case in Brazil in April 2015—left large swaths of the population <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e. This so-called "herd <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity" has made it increasingly difficult for the Zika virus to find susceptible people, breaking the cycle of transmission between humans and mosquitoes. The drop in cases has not lessened the push to develop a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e against Zika, which caused widespread alarm after thousands of babies in Brazil were born with brain deformities that studies have shown are linked to the mothers being infected by the virus while they were pregnant. But with transmission in the region becoming scarce, it does complicate efforts of clinical trials that hope to show lower rates of transmission and disease in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ated people. One such trial is underway right now.</p>

Europe's top court alarms vaccine experts
<p>On 21 June, the European Court of Justice issued a ruling in the case of a French man who claimed his multiple sclerosis was triggered by a hepatitis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e. Some media stories suggested that from now on, "<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es can be blamed for illness without scientific proof," which alarmed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e advocates. But experts on liability law are divided on what the court's decision will mean for medical product liability in Europe. Some argue that rather than dealing a blow against science or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es, the court sought to balance individuals' rights against society's interest in preventing disease; others say the ruling leaves a worrying amount of room for judges in the European Union to ignore certain kinds of scientific evidence.</p>

Light-induced lattice expansion leads to high-efficiency perovskite solar cells
<p>Light-induced structural dynamics plays a vital role in the physical properties, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e performance, and stability of hybrid perovskite–based optoelectronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>es. We report that continuous light illumination leads to a uniform lattice expansion in hybrid perovskite thin films, which is critical for obtaining high-efficiency photovoltaic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>es. Correlated, in situ structural and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e characterizations reveal that light-induced lattice expansion benefits the performances of a mixed-cation pure-halide planar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e, boosting the power conversion efficiency from 18.5 to 20.5%. The lattice expansion leads to the relaxation of local lattice strain, which lowers the energetic barriers at the perovskite-contact interfaces, thus improving the open circuit voltage and fill factor. The light-induced lattice expansion did not compromise the stability of these high-efficiency photovoltaic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>es under continuous operation at full-spectrum 1-sun (100 milliwatts per square centimeter) illumination for more than 1500 hours.</p>

Left Ventricular Assist Device Malfunctions
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Reports of left ventricular assist <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e (LVAD) malfunction have focused on pump thrombosis. However, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e consists of the pump, driveline, and peripherals, all of which are potentially subject to failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Prospectively collected data were reviewed for all LVAD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e malfunctions (DMs) occurring in rotary LVADs implanted at a single center between April 2004 and May 2016. Durable LVADs included 108 Heartmate II (HM II) and 105 HeartWare VAD (HVAD). DM data were categorized according to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e type and into categories related to the component that failed: (1) controller, (2) peripheral components, and (3) implantable blood pump or its integral electric driveline. Pump-related events were analyzed as pump-specific (suspected or confirmed thrombosis) or nonpump-specific (driveline failure). DM rates were reported as events per 1000 patient-days, and Cox proportional hazard models were used for time-to-event analyses. Cumulative rates of malfunction were examined for the main components of each type of LVAD.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Types of DM included controller failure (30%), battery failure (19%), or patient cable failure (14%), whereas only 13% were because of pump failure. DMs were more common in the HM II <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e (3.73 per 1000 patient-days versus 3.06 per 1000 patient-days for the HVAD, <i>P</i><0.01). A higher rate of pump-specific malfunctions was discovered in those implanted with an HM II versus an HVAD (0.55 versus 0.39, respectively; <i>P</i><0.01) and peripheral malfunctions (2.32 versus 1.78 for the HM II and HVAD, respectively; <i>P</i><0.01); no difference occurred in the incidence of controller DM between the 2 LVADs. Patients with HVAD were 90% free of a pump-specific malfunction at 3 years compared with 56% for the HM II (log-rank <i>P</i><0.003). Only 74% of the patients with HM II were free of pump thrombosis at 3 years compared with 90% of the patients with HVAD. Freedom from failure of the integrated driveline was 79% at 3 years for the HM II but 100% for the HVAD (log-rank <i>P</i><0.02).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e malfunction is much broader than pump failure alone and occurs for different components at different rates based on the type of LVAD.</p></sec>

A Eu<sup>3+</sup>-Eu<sup>2+</sup> ion redox shuttle imparts operational durability to Pb-I perovskite solar cells
<p>The components with soft nature in the metal halide perovskite absorber usually generate lead (Pb)<sup>0</sup> and iodine (I)<sup>0</sup> defects during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e fabrication and operation. These defects serve as not only recombination centers to deteriorate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e efficiency but also degradation initiators to hamper <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e lifetimes. We show that the europium ion pair Eu<sup>3+</sup>-Eu<sup>2+</sup> acts as the “redox shuttle” that selectively oxidized Pb<sup>0</sup> and reduced I<sup>0</sup> defects simultaneously in a cyclical transition. The resultant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.52% (certified 20.52%) with substantially improved long-term durability. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>es retained 92% and 89% of the peak PCE under 1-sun continuous illumination or heating at 85°C for 1500 hours and 91% of the original stable PCE after maximum power point tracking for 500 hours, respectively.</p>

Derivation and Validation of a Novel Right-Sided Heart Failure Model After Implantation of Continuous Flow Left Ventricular Assist Devices
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The aim of the study was to derive and validate a novel risk score for early right-sided heart failure (RHF) after left ventricular assist <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e implantation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The EUROMACS (European Registry for Patients with Mechanical Circulatory Support) was used to identify adult patients undergoing continuous-flow left ventricular assist <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e implantation with mainstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>es. Eligible patients (n=2988) were randomly divided into derivation (n=2000) and validation (n=988) cohorts. The primary outcome was early (<30 days) severe postoperative RHF, defined as receiving short- or long-term right-sided circulatory support, continuous inotropic support for ≥14 days, or nitric oxide ventilation for ≥48 hours. The secondary outcome was all-cause mortality and length of stay in the intensive care unit. Covariates found to be associated with RHF (exploratory univariate <i>P</i><0.10) were entered into a multivariable logistic regression model. A risk score was then generated using the relative magnitude of the exponential regression model coefficients of independent predictors at the last step after checking for collinearity, likelihood ratio test, c index, and clinical weight at each step.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A 9.5-point risk score incorporating 5 variables (Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support class, use of multiple inotropes, severe right ventricular dysfunction on echocardiography, ratio of right atrial/pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, hemoglobin) was created. The mean scores in the derivation and validation cohorts were 2.7±1.9 and 2.6±2.0, respectively (<i>P</i>=0.32). RHF in the derivation cohort occurred in 433 patients (21.7%) after left ventricular assist <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e implantation and was associated with a lower 1-year (53% versus 71%; <i>P</i><0.001) and 2-year (45% versus 58%; <i>P</i><0.001) survival compared with patients without RHF. RHF risk ranged from 11% (low risk score 0–2) to 43.1% (high risk score >4; <i>P</i><0.0001). Median intensive care unit stay was 7 days (interquartile range, 4–15 days) versus 24 days (interquartile range, 14–38 days) in patients without versus with RHF, respectively (<i>P</i><0.001). The c index of the composite score was 0.70 in the derivation and 0.67 in the validation cohort. The EUROMACS-RHF risk score outperformed (<i>P</i><0.0001) previously published scores and known individual echocardiographic and hemodynamic markers of RHF.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This novel EUROMACS-RHF risk score outperformed currently known risk scores and clinical predictors of early postoperative RHF. This novel score may be useful for tailored risk-based clinical assessment and management of patients with advanced HF evaluated for ventricular assist <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e therapy.</p></sec>

Mortality and Cerebrovascular Events After Heart Rhythm Disorder Management Procedures
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Recognition of rates and causes of hard, patient-centered outcomes of death and cerebrovascular events (CVEs) after heart rhythm disorder management (HRDM) procedures is an essential step for the development of quality improvement programs in electrophysiology laboratories. Our primary aim was to assess and characterize death and CVEs (stroke or transient ischemic attack) after HRDM procedures over a 17-year period.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed a retrospective cohort study of all patients undergoing HRDM procedures between January 2000 and November 2016 at the Mayo Clinic. Patients from all 3 tertiary academic centers (Rochester, Phoenix, and Jacksonville) were included in the study. All in-hospital deaths and CVEs after HRDM procedures were identified and were further characterized as directly or indirectly related to the HRDM procedure. Subgroup analysis of death and CVE rates was performed for ablation, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e implantation, electrophysiology study, lead extraction, and defibrillation threshold testing procedures.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 48 913 patients (age, 65.7±6.6 years; 64% male) who underwent a total of 62 065 HRDM procedures were included in the study. The overall mortality and CVE rates in the cohort were 0.36% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31–0.42) and 0.12% (95% CI, 0.09–0.16), respectively. Patients undergoing lead extraction had the highest overall mortality rate at 1.9% (95% CI, 1.34–2.61) and CVE rate at 0.62% (95% CI, 0.32–1.07). Among patients undergoing HRDM procedures, 48% of deaths directly related to the HDRM procedure were among patients undergoing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e implantation procedures. Overall, cardiac tamponade was the most frequent direct cause of death (40%), and infection was the most common indirect cause of death (29%).

Outcomes Associated With Extraction Versus Capping and Abandoning Pacing and Defibrillator Leads
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Lead management is an increasingly important aspect of care in patients with cardiac implantable electronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>es; however, relatively little is known about long-term outcomes after capping and abandoning leads.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using the 5% Medicare sample, we identified patients with de novo cardiac implantable electronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e implantations between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2013, and with a subsequent lead addition or extraction ≥12 months after the de novo implantation. Patients who underwent extraction for infection were excluded. Using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models, we compared cumulative incidence of all-cause mortality, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e-related infection, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e revision, and lead extraction at 1 and 5 years for the extraction versus the cap and abandon group.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 6859 patients, 1113 (16.2%) underwent extraction, whereas 5746 (83.8%) underwent capping and abandonment. Extraction patients tended to be younger (median, 78 versus 79 years; <i>P</i><0.0001), were less likely to be male (65% versus 68%; <i>P</i>=0.05), and had shorter lead dwell time (median, 3.0 versus 4.0 years; <i>P</i><0.0001) and fewer comorbidities. Over a median follow-up of 2.4 years (25th, 75th percentiles, 1.0, 4.3 years), the overall 1-year and 5-year cumulative incidence of mortality was 13.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 12.7–14.4) and 54.3% (95% CI, 52.8–55.8), respectively.

Berlin Heart EXCOR Pediatric Ventricular Assist Device for Bridge to Heart Transplantation in US Children
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Recent data suggest that the Berlin Heart EXCOR Pediatric ventricular assist <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e is superior to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for bridge to heart transplantation. Published data are limited to 1 in 4 children who received the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e as part of the US clinical trial. We analyzed outcomes for all US children who received the EXCOR to characterize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e outcomes in an unselected cohort and to identify risk factors for mortality to facilitate patient selection.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>This multicenter, prospective cohort study involved all children implanted with the Berlin Heart EXCOR Pediatric ventricular assist <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e at 47 centers from May 2007 through December 2010. Multiphase nonproportional hazards modeling was used to identify risk factors for early (<2 months) and late mortality. Of 204 children supported with the EXCOR, the median duration of support was 40 days (range, 1–435 days). Survival at 12 months was 75%, including 64% who reached transplantation, 6% who recovered, and 5% who were alive on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e.

Twistable electronics with dynamically rotatable heterostructures
<p>In heterostructures of two-dimensional materials, electronic properties can vary dramatically with relative interlayer angle. This effect makes it theoretically possible to realize a new class of twistable electronics in which properties can be manipulated on demand by means of rotation. We demonstrate a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e architecture in which a layered heterostructure can be dynamically twisted in situ. We study graphene encapsulated by boron nitride, where, at small rotation angles, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e characteristics are dominated by coupling to a long-wavelength moirééé superlattice. The ability to investigate arbitrary rotation angle in a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e reveals features of the optical, mechanical, and electronic response in this system not captured in static rotation studies. Our results establish the capability to fabricate twistable electronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>es with dynamically tunable properties.</p>

Digitization of multistep organic synthesis in reactionware for on-demand pharmaceuticals
<p>Chemical manufacturing is often done at large facilities that require a sizable capital investment and then produce key compounds for a finite period. We present an approach to the manufacturing of fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals in a self-contained plastic reactionware <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e was designed and constructed by using a chemical to computer-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">autom</span></strong>ated design (ChemCAD) approach that enables the translation of traditional bench-scale synthesis into a platform-independent digital code. This in turn guides production of a three-dimensional printed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e that encloses the entire synthetic route internally via simple operations. We demonstrate the approach for the γ-aminobutyric acid receptor agonist, (±)-baclofen, establishing a concept that paves the way for the local manufacture of drugs outside of specialist facilities.</p>

Highly efficient electrocaloric cooling with electrostatic actuation
<p>Solid-state refrigeration offers potential advantages over traditional cooling systems, but few <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>es offer high specific cooling power with a high coefficient of performance (COP) and the ability to be applied directly to surfaces. We developed a cooling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e with a high intrinsic thermodynamic efficiency using a flexible electrocaloric (EC) polymer film and an electrostatic actuation mechanism. Reversible electrostatic forces reduce parasitic power consumption and allow efficient heat transfer through good thermal contacts with the heat source or heat sink. The EC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e produced a specific cooling power of 2.8 watts per gram and a COP of 13.

Deterministic generation of a cluster state of entangled photons
<p>Photonic cluster states are a resource for quantum computation based solely on single-photon measurements. We use semiconductor quantum dots to deterministically generate long strings of polarization-entangled photons in a cluster state by periodic timed excitation of a precessing matter qubit. In each period, an entangled photon is added to the cluster state formed by the matter qubit and the previously emitted photons. In our prototype <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e, the qubit is the confined dark exciton, and it produces strings of hundreds of photons in which the entanglement persists over five sequential photons. The measured process map characterizing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e has a fidelity of 0.81 with that of an ideal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e.

An entirely automated method to score DSS-induced colitis in mice by digital image analysis of pathology slides
<p>The DSS (dextran sulfate sodium) model of colitis is a mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease. Microscopic symptoms include loss of crypt cells from the gut lining and infiltration of inflammatory cells into the colon. An experienced pathologist requires several hours per study to score histological changes in selected regions of the mouse gut. In order to increase the efficiency of scoring, Definiens Developer software was used to devise an entirely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">autom</span></strong>ated method to quantify histological changes in the whole H&E slide. When the algorithm was applied to slides from historical drug-discovery studies, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">autom</span></strong>ated scores classified 88% of drug candidates in the same way as pathologists’ scores. In addition, another <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">autom</span></strong>ated image analysis method was developed to quantify colon-infiltrating macrophages, neutrophils, B cells and T cells in immunohistochemical stains of serial sections of the H&E slides. The timing of neutrophil and macrophage infiltration had the highest correlation to pathological changes, whereas T and B cell infiltration occurred later. Thus, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">autom</span></strong>ated image analysis enables quantitative comparisons between tissue morphology changes and cell-infiltration dynamics.</p>

Impact of Bystander Automated External Defibrillator Use on Survival and Functional Outcomes in Shockable Observed Public Cardiac Arrests
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Survival following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with shockable rhythms can be improved with early defibrillation. Although shockable OHCA accounts for only ≈25% of overall arrests, ≈60% of public OHCAs are shockable, offering the possibility of restoring thousands of individuals to full recovery with early defibrillation by bystanders. We sought to determine the association of bystander <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">autom</span></strong>ated external defibrillator use with survival and functional outcomes in shockable observed public OHCA.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>From 2011 to 2015, the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium prospectively collected detailed information on all cardiac arrests at 9 regional centers. The exposures were shock administration by a bystander-applied <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">autom</span></strong>ated external defibrillator in comparison with initial defibrillation by emergency medical services. The primary outcome measure was discharge with normal or near-normal (favorable) functional status defined as a modified Rankin Score ≤2. Survival to hospital discharge was the secondary outcome measure.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 49 555 OHCAs, 4115 (8.3%) observed public OHCAs were analyzed, of which 2500 (60.8%) were shockable. A bystander shock was applied in 18.8% of the shockable arrests. Patients shocked by a bystander were significantly more likely to survive to discharge (66.5% versus 43.0%) and be discharged with favorable functional outcome (57.1% versus 32.7%) than patients initially shocked by emergency medical services. After adjusting for known predictors of outcome, the odds ratio associated with a bystander shock was 2.62 (95% confidence interval, 2.07–3.31) for survival to hospital discharge and 2.73 (95% confidence interval, 2.17–3.44) for discharge with favorable functional outcome.

We obtained their geographic coordinates and hours of operation from Web sites, by phone, or in person. We determined the number of OHCAs that occurred within 100 m of each location when it was open (spatiotemporal coverage) for Toronto overall and downtown.

Long-term functional maintenance of primary human hepatocytes in vitro
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance of terminally differentiated cells, especially hepatocytes, in vitro has proven challenging. Here we demonstrated the long-term in vitro <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance of primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) by modulating cell signaling pathways with a combination of five chemicals (5C). 5C-cultured PHHs showed global gene expression profiles and hepatocyte-specific functions resembling those of freshly isolated counterparts. Furthermore, these cells efficiently recapitulated the entire course of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection over 4 weeks with the production of infectious viral particles and formation of HBV covalently closed circular DNA. Our study demonstrates that, with a chemical approach, functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance of PHHs supports long-term HBV infection in vitro, providing an efficient platform for investigating HBV cell biology and antiviral drug screening.</p>

A single-photon switch and transistor enabled by a solid-state quantum memory
<p>Single-photon switches and transistors generate strong photon-photon interactions that are essential for quantum circuits and networks. However, the deterministic control of an optical signal with a single photon requires strong interactions with a quantum memory, which has been challenging to achieve in a solid-state platform. We demonstrate a single-photon switch and transistor enabled by a solid-state quantum memory. Our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e consists of a semiconductor spin qubit strongly coupled to a nanophotonic cavity. The spin qubit enables a single 63-picosecond gate photon to switch a signal field containing up to an average of 27.7 photons before the internal state of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e resets. Our results show that semiconductor nanophotonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>es can produce strong and controlled photon-photon interactions that could enable high-bandwidth photonic quantum information processing.</p>

Hepatic thrombopoietin is required for bone marrow hematopoietic stem cell maintenance
<p>Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance depends on extrinsic cues. Currently, only local signals arising from the bone marrow niche have been shown to maintain HSCs. However, it is not known whether systemic factors also sustain HSCs. We assessed the physiological source of thrombopoietin (TPO), a key cytokine required for maintaining HSCs. Using <i>Tpo<sup>DsRed-CreER</sup></i> knock-in mice, we showed that TPO is expressed by hepatocytes but not by bone marrow cells. Deletion of <i>Tpo</i> from hematopoietic cells, osteoblasts, or bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells does not affect HSC number or function. However, when <i>Tpo</i> is deleted from hepatocytes, bone marrow HSCs are depleted. Thus, a cross-organ factor, circulating TPO made in the liver by hepatocytes, is required for bone marrow HSC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance. Our results demonstrate that systemic factors, in addition to the local niche, are a critical extrinsic component for HSC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance.</p>

Nuclear Prohibitin3 Maintains Genome Integrity and Cell Proliferation in the Root Meristem through Minichromosome Maintenance 2
<p>The nucleo-mitochondrial dual-localized proteins can act as gene expression regulators; however, few instances of these proteins have been described in plants. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) PROHIBITIN 3 (PHB3) is involved in stress responses and developmental processes, but it is unknown how these roles are achieved at the molecular level in the nucleus. In this study, we show that nucleo-mitochondrial PHB3 plays an essential role in regulating genome stability and cell proliferation. <i>PHB3</i> is up-regulated by DNA damage agents, and the stress-induced PHB3 proteins accumulate in the nucleus. Loss of function of <i>PHB3</i> results in DNA damage and defective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance of the root stem cell niche. Subsequently, the expression patterns and levels of the root stem cell regulators are altered and down-regulated, respectively. In addition, the <i>phb3</i> mutant shows aberrant cell division and altered expression of cell cycle–related genes, such as <i>CycB1</i> and <i>Cyclin dependent kinase 1</i>. Moreover, the minichromosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance (MCM) genes, e.g. <i>MCM2</i>, <i>MCM3</i>, <i>MCM4</i>, <i>MCM5</i>, <i>MCM6</i>, and <i>MCM7</i>, are up-regulated in the <i>phb3</i> mutant. Reducing the <i>MCM2</i> expression level substantially recovers the DNA damage in the <i>phb3</i> mutant and partially rescues the altered cell proliferation and root deficiency of <i>phb3</i> seedlings. PHB3 acts as a transcriptional coregulator that represses <i>MCM2</i> expression by competitively binding to the promoter E2F–cis-acting elements with E2Fa so as to modulate primary root growth. Collectively, these findings indicate that nuclear-localized PHB3 acts as a transcriptional coregulator that suppresses <i>MCM2</i> expression to sustain genome integrity and cell proliferation for stem cell niche <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance in Arabidopsis.</p>

A Light Harvesting Complex-Like Protein in Maintenance of Photosynthetic Components in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>
<p>Using a genetic approach, we have identified and characterized a novel protein, named Msf1 (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance factor for photosystem I), that is required for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance of specific components of the photosynthetic apparatus in the green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>. Msf1 belongs to the superfamily of light-harvesting complex proteins with three transmembrane domains and consensus chlorophyll-binding sites. Loss of Msf1 leads to reduced accumulation of photosystem I and chlorophyll-binding proteins/complexes. Msf1is a component of a thylakoid complex containing key enzymes of the tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway, thus revealing a possible link between Msf1 and chlorophyll biosynthesis. Protein interaction assays and greening experiments demonstrate that Msf1 interacts with Copper target homolog1 (CHL27B) and accumulates concomitantly with chlorophyll in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>, implying that chlorophyll stabilizes Msf1. Contrary to other light-harvesting complex-like genes, the expression of <i>Msf1</i> is not stimulated by high-light stress, but its protein level increases significantly under heat shock, iron and copper limitation, as well as in stationary cells. Based on these results, we propose that Msf1 is required for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance of photosystem I and specific protein-chlorophyll complexes especially under certain stress conditions.</p>

Assessment of Remote Heart Rhythm Sampling Using the AliveCor Heart Monitor to Screen for Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Asymptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF) is increasingly common in the aging population and implicated in many ischemic strokes. Earlier identification of AF with appropriate anticoagulation may decrease stroke morbidity and mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a randomized controlled trial of AF screening using an AliveCor Kardia monitor attached to a WiFi-enabled iPod to obtain ECGs (iECGs) in ambulatory patients. Patients ≥65 years of age with a CHADS-VASc score ≥2 free from AF were randomized to the iECG arm or routine care (RC). iECG participants acquired iECGs twice weekly over 12 months (plus additional iECGs if symptomatic) onto a secure study server with overread by an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">autom</span></strong>ated AF detection algorithm and by a cardiac physiologist and/or consultant cardiologist.

Nineteen patients in the iECG group were diagnosed with AF over the 12-month study period versus 5 in the RC arm (hazard ratio, 3.9; 95% confidence interval=1.4–10.4; <i>P</i>=0.007) at a cost per AF diagnosis of $10 780 (£8255).

Percutaneous Therapies for Peripheral Artery Disease
<p>Percutaneous therapies for peripheral artery disease continue to evolve with new techniques and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>es. Although guidelines-recommended therapies have impacted cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, endovascular interventions have been shown to reduce limb pain, improve quality of life, and prolong walking distance for those with claudication and to reduce amputation rates among those with critical limb ischemia. Novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>es such as drug-eluting stents and drug-coated balloons have improved patency for moderate-length lesions, whereas others allow treatment of heavily calcified and tortuous segments. New adjunctive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>es to cross lesions and reduce or modify associated plaque have also been developed, although level 1 data regarding their efficacy are sparse. There has also been a better mechanistic understanding of lower extremity endovascular treatment using tools such as intravascular ultrasound. This information has highlighted the need for better stent size selection for the femoropopliteal arterial segments and larger balloon diameters for the tibial arteries. Moreover, a wound perfusion approach with direct in-line flow, the so-called angiosome approach, and reconstruction of the pedal loop have been advocated for improved wound healing. Technical advances such as the tibiopedal access and reentry methods have allowed crossing of lesions that were considered no option for the endovascular approach in the past. Collectively, there has been increased awareness, interest, and commitment by various specialty societies and organizations to advance the treatment of peripheral artery disease and critical limb ischemia. This is also evident by the recent coalition of 7 professional societies and organizations that represented >150 000 allied health professionals and millions of patients with peripheral artery disease at the 2015 Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services Medicare Evidence Development and Coverage Analysis Committee meeting. The percutaneous therapies for peripheral artery disease continue to evolve with longer follow-up with randomized data and larger prospective registries. In the future, it is hopeful that we will treat the lower extremity arteries according to segments, taking into account plaque morphology, luminal versus subintimal crossing, location, and stenotic versus occlusive disease. Until then, we must identify the most cost-effective, efficacious, and safe treatment for each patient. The goal of this article is to aid the practicing vascular specialist consider the optimal choices for the management of patients with vascular disease.</p>

Quantized chiral edge conduction on domain walls of a magnetic topological insulator
<p>Electronic ordering in magnetic and dielectric materials forms domains with different signs of order parameters.

A generic interface to reduce the efficiency-stability-cost gap of perovskite solar cells

How “you” makes meaning
<p>“You” is one of the most common words in the English language.

Extremely efficient internal exciton dissociation through edge states in layered 2D perovskites

<p>High-performance top-gated carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CNT FETs) with a gate length of 5 nanometers can be fabricated that perform better than silicon complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) FETs at the same scale. A scaling trend study revealed that the scaled CNT-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>es, which use graphene contacts, can operate much faster and at much lower supply voltage (0.4 versus 0.7 volts) and with much smaller subthreshold slope (typically 73 millivolts per decade). The 5-nanometer CNT FETs approached the quantum limit of FETs by using only one electron per switching operation. In addition, the contact length of the CNT CMOS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>es was also scaled down to 25 nanometers, and a CMOS inverter with a total pitch size of 240 nanometers was also demonstrated.</p>

Depleting dietary valine permits nonmyeloablative mouse hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
<p>A specialized bone marrow microenvironment (niche) regulates hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal and commitment. For successful donor-HSC engraftment, the niche must be emptied via myeloablative irradiation or chemotherapy. However, myeloablation can cause severe complications and even mortality. Here we report that the essential amino acid valine is indispensable for the proliferation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance of HSCs. Both mouse and human HSCs failed to proliferate when cultured in valine-depleted conditions. In mice fed a valine-restricted diet, HSC frequency fell dramatically within 1 week. Furthermore, dietary valine restriction emptied the mouse bone marrow niche and afforded donor-HSC engraftment without chemoirradiative myeloablation. These findings indicate a critical role for valine in HSC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance and suggest that dietary valine restriction may reduce iatrogenic complications in HSC transplantation.</p>

Subthreshold Schottky-barrier thin-film transistors with ultralow power and high intrinsic gain
<p>The quest for low power becomes highly compelling in newly emerging application areas related to wearable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>es in the Internet of Things. Here, we report on a Schottky-barrier indium-gallium-zinc-oxide thin-film transistor operating in the deep subthreshold regime (i.e., near the OFF state) at low supply voltages (<1 volt) and ultralow power (<1 nanowatt). By using a Schottky-barrier at the source and drain contacts, the current-voltage characteristics of the transistor were virtually channel-length independent with an infinite output resistance. It exhibited high intrinsic gain (>400) that was both bias and geometry independent. The transistor reported here is useful for sensor interface circuits in wearable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>es where high current sensitivity and ultralow power are vital for battery-less operation.</p>

Improving efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells with photocurable fluoropolymers
<p>Organometal halide perovskite solar cells have demonstrated high conversion efficiency but poor long-term stability against ultraviolet irradiation and water. We show that rapid light–induced free-radical polymerization at ambient temperature produces multifunctional fluorinated photopolymer coatings that confer luminescent and easy-cleaning features on the front side of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>es, while concurrently forming a strongly hydrophobic barrier toward environmental moisture on the back contact side. The luminescent photopolymers re-emit ultraviolet light in the visible range, boosting perovskite solar cells efficiency to nearly 19% under standard illumination. Coated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>es reproducibly retain their full functional performance during prolonged operation, even after a series of severe aging tests carried out for more than 6 months.</p>

Quantum dot–induced phase stabilization of α-CsPbI<sub>3</sub> perovskite for high-efficiency photovoltaics
<p>We show nanoscale phase stabilization of CsPbI<sub>3</sub> quantum dots (QDs) to low temperatures that can be used as the active component of efficient optoelectronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>es. CsPbI<sub>3</sub> is an all-inorganic analog to the hybrid organic cation halide perovskites, but the cubic phase of bulk CsPbI<sub>3</sub> (α-CsPbI<sub>3</sub>)—the variant with desirable band gap—is only stable at high temperatures. We describe the formation of α-CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QD films that are phase-stable for months in ambient air. The films exhibit long-range electronic transport and were used to fabricate colloidal perovskite QD photovoltaic cells with an open-circuit voltage of 1.23 volts and efficiency of 10.77%. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>es also function as light-emitting diodes with low turn-on voltage and tunable emission.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
A Synthetic Oxygen Sensor for Plants Based on Animal Hypoxia Signaling
<p>Due to the involvement of oxygen in many essential metabolic reactions, all living organisms have developed molecular systems that allow adaptive physiological and metabolic transitions depending on oxygen availability. In mammals, the expression of hypoxia-response genes is controlled by the heterodimeric Hypoxia-Inducible Factor. The activity of this transcriptional regulator is linked mainly to the oxygen-dependent hydroxylation of conserved proline residues in its α-subunit, carried out by prolyl-hydroxylases, and subsequent ubiquitination via the E3 ligase von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor, which targets Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-α to the proteasome. By exploiting bioengineered versions of this mammalian oxygen sensor, we designed and optimized a synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e that drives gene expression in an oxygen-dependent fashion in plants. Transient assays in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mesophyll protoplasts indicated that a combination of the yeast Gal4/upstream activating sequence system and the mammalian oxygen sensor machinery can be used effectively to engineer a modular, oxygen-inducible transcriptional regulator. This synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e also was shown to be selectively controlled by oxygen in whole plants when its components were expressed stably in Arabidopsis seedlings. We envision the exploitation of our genetically encoded controllers to generate plants able to switch gene expression selectively depending on oxygen availability, thereby providing a proof of concept for the potential of synthetic biology to assist agricultural practices in environments with variable oxygen provision.</p>

Elongator Is Required for Root Stem Cell Maintenance by Regulating <i>SHORTROOT</i> Transcription
<p><i>SHORTROOT</i> (<i>SHR</i>) is essential for stem cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance and radial patterning in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) roots, but how its expression is regulated is unknown. Here, we report that the Elongator complex, which consists of six subunits (ELP1 to ELP6), regulates the transcription of <i>SHR</i>. Depletion of Elongator drastically reduced <i>SHR</i> expression and led to defective root stem cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance and radial patterning. The importance of the nuclear localization of Elongator for its functioning, together with the insensitivity of the <i>elp1</i> mutant to the transcription elongation inhibitor 6-azauracil, and the direct interaction of the ELP4 subunit with the carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, support the notion that Elongator plays important roles in transcription elongation. Indeed, we found that ELP3 associates with the premessenger RNA of <i>SHR</i> and that mutation of Elongator reduces the enrichment of RNA polymerase II on the <i>SHR</i> gene body. Moreover, Elongator interacted in vivo with SUPPRESSOR OF Ty4, a well-established transcription elongation factor that is recruited to the <i>SHR</i> locus. Together, these results demonstrate that Elongator acts in concert with SUPPRESSOR OF Ty4 to regulate the transcription of <i>SHR</i>.</p>

Dynamic Interplay between Nucleoid Segregation and Genome Integrity in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> Chloroplasts
<p>The chloroplast (cp) genome is organized as nucleoids that are dispersed throughout the cp stroma. Previously, a cp homolog of bacterial recombinase RecA (cpRECA) was shown to be involved in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance of cp genome integrity by repairing damaged chloroplast DNA and by suppressing aberrant recombination between short dispersed repeats in the moss <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. Here, overexpression and knockdown analysis of cpRECA in the green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> revealed that cpRECA was involved in cp nucleoid dynamics as well as having a role in maintaining cp genome integrity. Overexpression of <i>cpRECA</i> tagged with yellow fluorescent protein or hemagglutinin resulted in the formation of giant filamentous structures that colocalized exclusively to chloroplast DNA and cpRECA localized to cp nucleoids in a heterogenous manner. Knockdown of <i>cpRECA</i> led to a significant reduction in cp nucleoid number that was accompanied by nucleoid enlargement. This phenotype resembled those of gyrase inhibitor-treated cells and <i>monokaryotic chloroplast</i> mutant cells and suggested that cpRECA was involved in organizing cp nucleoid dynamics. The cp genome also was destabilized by induced recombination between short dispersed repeats in <i>cpRECA-</i>knockdown cells and gyrase inhibitor-treated cells. Taken together, these results suggest that cpRECA and gyrase are both involved in nucleoid dynamics and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance of genome integrity and that the mechanisms underlying these processes may be intimately related in <i>C. reinhardtii</i> cps.</p>

<i>pheno</i>Seeder - A Robot System for Automated Handling and Phenotyping of Individual Seeds
<p>The enormous diversity of seed traits is an intriguing feature and critical for the overwhelming success of higher plants. In particular, seed mass is generally regarded to be key for seedling development but is mostly approximated by using scanning methods delivering only two-dimensional data, often termed seed size. However, three-dimensional traits, such as the volume or mass of single seeds, are very rarely determined in routine measurements. Here, we introduce a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e named <i>pheno</i>Seeder, which enables the handling and phenotyping of individual seeds of very different sizes. The system consists of a pick-and-place robot and a modular setup of sensors that can be versatilely extended. Basic biometric traits detected for individual seeds are two-dimensional data from projections, three-dimensional data from volumetric measures, and mass, from which seed density is also calculated. Each seed is tracked by an identifier and, after phenotyping, can be planted, sorted, or individually stored for further evaluation or processing (e.g. in routine seed-to-plant tracking pipelines). By investigating seeds of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), rapeseed (<i>Brassica napus</i>), and barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), we observed that, even for apparently round-shaped seeds of rapeseed, correlations between the projected area and the mass of seeds were much weaker than between volume and mass. This indicates that simple projections may not deliver good proxies for seed mass. Although throughput is limited, we expect that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">autom</span></strong>ated seed phenotyping on a single-seed basis can contribute valuable information for applications in a wide range of wild or crop species, including seed classification, seed sorting, and assessment of seed quality.</p>

CTDGFinder: A Novel Homology-Based Algorithm for Identifying Closely Spaced Clusters of Tandemly Duplicated Genes
<p>Closely spaced clusters of tandemly duplicated genes (CTDGs) contribute to the diversity of many phenotypes, including chemosensation, snake venom, and animal body plans. CTDGs have traditionally been identified subjectively as genomic neighborhoods containing several gene duplicates in close proximity; however, CTDGs are often highly variable with respect to gene number, intergenic distance, and synteny. This lack of formal definition hampers the study of CTDG evolutionary dynamics and the discovery of novel CTDGs in the exponentially growing body of genomic data. To address this gap, we developed a novel homology-based algorithm, CTDGFinder, which formalizes and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">autom</span></strong>ates the identification of CTDGs by examining the physical distribution of individual members of families of duplicated genes across chromosomes. Application of CTDGFinder accurately identified CTDGs for many well-known gene clusters (e.g., Hox and beta-globin gene clusters) in the human, mouse and 20 other mammalian genomes. Differences between previously annotated gene clusters and our inferred CTDGs were due to the exclusion of nonhomologs that have historically been considered parts of specific gene clusters, the inclusion or absence of genes between the CTDGs and their corresponding gene clusters, and the splitting of certain gene clusters into distinct CTDGs. Examination of human genes showing tissue-specific enhancement of their expression by CTDGFinder identified members of several well-known gene clusters (e.g., cytochrome P450s and olfactory receptors) and revealed that they were unequally distributed across tissues. By formalizing and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">autom</span></strong>ating CTDG identification, CTDGFinder will facilitate understanding of CTDG evolutionary dynamics, their functional implications, and how they are associated with phenotypic diversity.</p>

Differential effects of vitamins E and C and carotenoids on growth, resistance to oxidative stress, fledging success and plumage colouration in wild great tits
<p>Oxidative stress is the imbalance between the production of reactive species and antioxidants, which causes damage to lipids, proteins and DNA. Antioxidants, like vitamins and carotenoids, can limit oxidative damage and can therefore regulate the trade-off between growth, which is a period of high reactive species production, and self-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance. However, the role of carotenoids as antioxidants <i>in vivo</i> has been debated, and it has been suggested that carotenoid-based signals indicate the availability of non-pigmentary antioxidants (e.g. vitamins) that protect carotenoids from oxidation, known as the ‘protection hypothesis’. To evaluate the importance of vitamins versus carotenoids as antioxidants during growth and to test the protection hypothesis, we supplemented nestling great tits, <i>Parus major</i>, 3, 5 and 7 days after hatching with a single dose of carotenoids and/or vitamins in a 2×2 full-factorial design. We subsequently measured body condition, antioxidant capacity, oxidative damage, fledging success and plumage reflectance. Vitamins enhanced antioxidant capacity, but did not affect oxidative damage. Vitamin-treated nestlings had higher growth rates and higher probability of fledging. In contrast, carotenoids did not affect any of these traits. Furthermore, carotenoid-based colouration increased over the breeding season in nestlings that received vitamins only. This study shows that vitamins are limiting for growth rate and fledging success, and suggests that vitamins could regulate the trade-off between growth and self-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance in favour of the former. Moreover, our results are consistent with the idea that carotenoids are minor antioxidants in birds, but they do not support the protection hypothesis.</p>

Tight junction protein gene expression patterns and changes in transcript abundance during development of model fish gill epithelia
<p>In vertebrates, tight junction (TJ) proteins play an important role in epithelium formation and development, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance of tissue integrity and regulation of TJ permeability. In this study, primary cultured model gill epithelia composed of pavement cells (PVCs) were used to examine TJ protein transcript abundance during the development of epithelium confluence and epithelium resistive properties. Differences in TJ protein expression patterns and transcript abundance between gill models composed of PVCs and models composed of PVCs and mitochondrion-rich cells (MRCs) were also examined. Marked alterations in TJ protein transcript abundance were observed as cells developed to confluence in flask-cultured model gill epithelia. In contrast, during the formation of tissue resistance in insert-cultured epithelia (i.e. epithelia cultured on a permeable substrate), changes in TJ protein mRNA abundance were conservative, despite paracellular marker flux decreasing by orders of magnitude. In both cases significant changes in <i>claudin-8b, -8d, -27b, -28b</i> and -<i>32a</i> transcript abundance were observed, suggesting that temporal alterations in the abundance of these genes are important end points of model gill epithelium integrity. When MRCs were present in cultured gill models, the mRNA abundance of several TJ proteins significantly altered and <i>claudin-10c, -10d</i> and -<i>33b</i> were only detected in preparations that included MRCs. These data provide insight into the role of select TJ proteins in the formation and development of gill epithelia and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance of gill barrier properties. In addition, observations reveal a heterogeneous distribution of claudin TJ proteins in the gill epithelial cells of rainbow trout.</p>

Changing climate shifts timing of European floods
<p>A warming climate is expected to have an impact on the magnitude and timing of river <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flood</span></strong>s; however, no consistent large-scale climate change signal in observed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flood</span></strong> magnitudes has been identified so far. We analyzed the timing of river <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flood</span></strong>s in Europe over the past five decades, using a pan-European database from 4262 observational hydrometric stations, and found clear patterns of change in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flood</span></strong> timing. Warmer temperatures have led to earlier spring snowmelt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flood</span></strong>s throughout northeastern Europe; delayed winter storms associated with polar warming have led to later winter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flood</span></strong>s around the North Sea and some sectors of the Mediterranean coast; and earlier soil moisture maxima have led to earlier winter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flood</span></strong>s in western Europe. Our results highlight the existence of a clear climate signal in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flood</span></strong> observations at the continental scale.</p>

Designing river flows to improve food security futures in the Lower Mekong Basin
<p>Rivers provide unrivaled opportunity for clean energy via hydropower, but little is known about the potential impact of dam-building on the food security these rivers provide. In tropical rivers, rainfall drives a periodic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flood</span></strong> pulse fueling fish production and delivering nutrition to more than 150 million people worldwide. Hydropower will modulate this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flood</span></strong> pulse, thereby threatening food security. We identified variance components of the Mekong River <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flood</span></strong> pulse that predict yield in one of the largest freshwater fisheries in the world. We used these variance components to design an algorithm for a managed hydrograph to explore future yields. This algorithm mimics attributes of discharge variance that drive fishery yield: prolonged low flows followed by a short <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flood</span></strong> pulse. Designed flows increased yield by a factor of 3.7 relative to historical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrolog</span></strong>y. Managing desired components of discharge variance will lead to greater efficiency in the Lower Mekong Basin food system.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Signal Dynamics and Interactions during Flooding Stress
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flood</span></strong>ing is detrimental for nearly all higher plants, including crops. The compound stress elicited by slow gas exchange and low light levels under water is responsible for both a carbon and an energy crisis ultimately leading to plant death. The endogenous concentrations of four gaseous compounds, oxygen, carbon dioxide, ethylene, and nitric oxide, change during the submergence of plant organs in water. These gases play a pivotal role in signal transduction cascades, leading to adaptive processes such as metabolic adjustments and anatomical features. Of these gases, ethylene is seen as the most consistent, pervasive, and reliable signal of early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flood</span></strong>ing stress, most likely in tight interaction with the other gases. The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in plant cells during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flood</span></strong>ing and directly after subsidence, during which the plant is confronted with high light and oxygen levels, is characteristic for this abiotic stress. Low, well-controlled levels of ROS are essential for adaptive signaling pathways, in interaction with the other gaseous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flood</span></strong>ing signals. On the other hand, excessive uncontrolled bursts of ROS can be highly damaging for plants. Therefore, a fine-tuned balance is important, with a major role for ROS production and scavenging. Our understanding of the temporal dynamics of the four gases and ROS is basal, whereas it is likely that they form a signature readout of prevailing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flood</span></strong>ing conditions and subsequent adaptive responses.</p>

An analysis of the best method for evaluating anteversion of the acetabular component after total hip replacement on plain radiographs
<p>Several radiological methods of measuring anteversion   of the acetabular component after total hip replacement (THR) have   been described. These studies used different definitions and reference   planes to compare methods, allowing for misinterpretation of the   results. We compared the reliability and accuracy of five current   methods using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plain</span></strong> radiographs (those of Lewinnek, Widmer, Liaw,   Pradhan, and Woo and Morrey) with CT measurements, using the same   definition and reference plane. We retrospectively studied the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plain</span></strong>   radiographs and CT scans in 84 hips of 84 patients who underwent   primary THR. Intra- and inter-observer reliability were high for   the measurement of inclination and anteversion with all methods   on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plain</span></strong> radiographs and CT scans. The measurements of inclination on   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plain</span></strong> radiographs were similar to the measurements using CT (p =   0.043). The mean difference between CT measurements was 0.6° (-5.9°   to 6.8°).</p><p>Measurements using Widmer’s method were the most similar to those   using CT (p = 0.088), with a mean difference between CT measurements   of -0.9° (-10.4° to 9.1°), whereas the other four methods differed   significantly from those using CT (p < 0.001).</p><p>This study has shown that Widmer’s method is the best for evaluating   the anteversion of the acetabular component on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plain</span></strong> radiographs.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014; 96-B:597–603.</p>

Glacial lake outburst floods as drivers of fluvial erosion in the Himalaya
<p>Himalayan rivers are frequently hit by catastrophic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flood</span></strong>s that are caused by the failure of glacial lake and landslide dams; however, the dynamics and long-term impacts of such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flood</span></strong>s remain poorly understood. We present a comprehensive set of observations that capture the July 2016 glacial lake outburst <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flood</span></strong> (GLOF) in the Bhotekoshi/Sunkoshi River of Nepal. Seismic records of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flood</span></strong> provide new insights into GLOF mechanics and their ability to mobilize large boulders that otherwise prevent channel erosion. Because of this boulder mobilization, GLOF impacts far exceed those of the annual summer monsoon, and GLOFs may dominate fluvial erosion and channel-hillslope coupling many tens of kilometers downstream of glaciated areas. Long-term valley evolution in these regions may therefore be driven by GLOF frequency and magnitude, rather than by precipitation.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Control of Adventitious Root Architecture in Rice by Darkness, Light, and Gravity
<p>Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) is a semiaquatic plant that is well adapted to partial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flood</span></strong>ing. Rice stems develop adventitious root (AR) primordia at each node that slowly mature but emerge only when the plant gets <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flood</span></strong>ed, leading to the formation of a whole new secondary root system upon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flood</span></strong>ing. AR growth is induced by ethylene that accumulates in submerged plant tissues due to its lowered diffusion rate in water. Here, we report that the architecture of the secondary root system in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flood</span></strong>ed rice plants is controlled not only by altered gas diffusion but also by gravity and light. While ethylene promotes the emergence and growth of ARs, gravity and light determine their gravitropic setpoint angle (i.e. the deviation of growth direction relative to vertical). ARs grow upward at about 120° in the dark and downward at 54° in the light. The upward growth direction is conserved in <i>indica</i> and <i>japonica</i> rice varieties, suggestive of a conserved trait in rice. Experiments with a klinostat and with inverted stem orientation revealed that gravity promotes upward growth by about 10°. Red, far-red, and blue light lead to negative phototropism in a dose-dependent manner, with blue light being most effective, indicating that phytochrome and blue light signaling control AR system architecture. The <i>cpt1</i> (<i>coleoptile phototropism1</i>) mutant, which lacks one of the phototropin-interacting CPT proteins, shows reduced sensitivity to blue light. Hence, the gravitropic setpoint angle of rice ARs is controlled by genetic and environmental factors that likely balance the need for oxygen supply (upward growth) with avoidance of root desiccation (downward growth).</p>

U-Pb constraints on pulsed eruption of the Deccan Traps across the end-Cretaceous mass extinction
<p>Temporal correlation between some continental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flood</span></strong> basalt eruptions and mass extinctions has been proposed to indicate causality, with eruptive volatile release driving environmental degradation and extinction. We tested this model for the Deccan Traps <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flood</span></strong> basalt province, which, along with the Chicxulub bolide impact, is implicated in the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) extinction approximately 66 million years ago. We estimated Deccan eruption rates with uranium-lead (U-Pb) zircon geochronology and resolved four high-volume eruptive periods. According to this model, maximum eruption rates occurred before and after the K-Pg extinction, with one such pulse initiating tens of thousands of years prior to both the bolide impact and extinction. These findings support extinction models that incorporate both catastrophic events as drivers of environmental deterioration associated with the K-Pg extinction and its aftermath.</p>

Quantification of drought during the collapse of the classic Maya civilization
<p>The demise of Lowland Classic Maya civilization during the Terminal Classic Period (~800 to 1000 CE) is a well-cited example of how past climate may have affected ancient societies. Attempts to estimate the magnitude of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrolog</span></strong>ic change, however, have met with equivocal success because of the qualitative and indirect nature of available climate proxy data. We reconstructed the past isotopic composition (δ<sup>18</sup>O, δD, <sup>17</sup>O-excess, and d-excess) of water in Lake Chichancanab, Mexico, using a technique that involves isotopic analysis of the structurally bound water in sedimentary gypsum, which was deposited under drought conditions. The triple oxygen and hydrogen isotope data provide a direct measure of past changes in lake <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrolog</span></strong>y. We modeled the data and conclude that annual precipitation decreased between 41 and 54% (with intervals of up to 70% rainfall reduction during peak drought conditions) and that relative humidity declined by 2 to 7% compared to present-day conditions.</p>

Ethylene-gibberellin signaling underlies adaptation of rice to periodic flooding
<p>Most plants do poorly when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flood</span></strong>ed. Certain rice varieties, known as deepwater rice, survive periodic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flood</span></strong>ing and consequent oxygen deficiency by activating internode growth of stems to keep above the water. Here, we identify the gibberellin biosynthesis gene, <i>SD1</i> (<i>SEMIDWARF1</i>), whose loss-of-function allele catapulted the rice Green Revolution, as being responsible for submergence-induced internode elongation. When submerged, plants carrying the deepwater rice–specific <i>SD1</i> haplotype amplify a signaling relay in which the <i>SD1</i> gene is transcriptionally activated by an ethylene-responsive transcription factor, OsEIL1a. The SD1 protein directs increased synthesis of gibberellins, largely GA<sub>4</sub>, which promote internode elongation. Evolutionary analysis shows that the deepwater rice–specific haplotype was derived from standing variation in wild rice and selected for deepwater rice cultivation in Bangladesh.</p>

Continental Diversification of an African Catfish Radiation (Mochokidae: <i>Synodontis</i>)
<p>Despite African rivers containing high species diversity, continental-scale studies investigating the mechanisms generating biological diversity of African riverine faunas are limited compared with lacustrine systems. To investigate the build-up of diversity in a tropical aquatic continental radiation, we test different models of lineage diversification and reconstruct the biogeographic history in a species-rich siluriform genus, <i>Synodontis</i> (~130 species), with a broad distribution across all major tropical African drainage basins. The resulting robust species-level phylogeny (~60% complete, based on a multigene data set) exhibits a near constant rate of lineage accumulation throughout the mid-Cenozoic to recent, irrespective of missing species and despite the changing environmental conditions that were prevalent during this time period. This pattern contrasts with the findings for species-level diversification of large clades that commonly show an early burst of cladogenesis followed by declining rates through time. The identification of distinct biogeographic clades demonstrates a correlation between river <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrolog</span></strong>y and cladogenesis, although there is evidence of recent repeat dispersal into the southern range of the focal group. We conclude that diverse freshwater fish radiations with tropical continental distributions represent important organisms to test hypotheses of diversification and investigate the effects of palaeo-landscapes and climates on present day biodiversity.

A target to suppress inflammation
<p>Tissues that are stressed by injury or by invading pathogens elicit signals for the recruitment of inflammatory immune cells such as macrophages and neutrophils, which consequently release reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) as part of the innate immune response (<i>1</i>). This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flood</span></strong> of RONS is important for directly attacking invading pathogens and for warding off infection of damaged tissue. But the efficiency of RONS in inactivating invading cells and viruses creates an Achilles heel of the innate immune response, namely that RONS are also able to kill and mutate cells in healthy tissues. Although inflammatory responses are usually counterbalanced over time by an opposing anti-inflammatory response, achieving the optimal balance with minimal collateral tissue damage is difficult even in healthy individuals, and virtually impossible in individuals with certain disease conditions such as ulcerative colitis and rheumatoid arthritis (<i>2</i>). Therefore, the development of anti-inflammatory drugs, targeting inflammation from a variety of different angles, has flourished in recent decades. On page 834 of this issue, Visnes <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) present an entirely new approach to suppressing the inflammatory response. Counter-intuitively, this approach involves the inhibition of the 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1 (OGG1) DNA repair enzyme that recognizes and initiates the base excision repair of 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG), one of the major types of DNA base damage induced by RONS.</p>

Seasonal water storage, stress modulation, and California seismicity
<p>Establishing what controls the timing of earthquakes is fundamental to understanding the nature of the earthquake cycle and critical to determining time-dependent earthquake hazard. Seasonal loading provides a natural laboratory to explore the crustal response to a quantifiable transient force. In California, water storage deforms the crust as snow and water accumulates during the wet winter months. We used 9 years of global positioning system (GPS) vertical deformation time series to constrain models of monthly hydrospheric loading and the resulting stress changes on fault planes of small earthquakes. The seasonal loading analysis reveals earthquakes occurring more frequently during stress conditions that favor earthquake rupture. We infer that California seismicity rates are modestly modulated by natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrolog</span></strong>ical loading cycles.</p>

On the deep-mantle origin of the Deccan Traps
<p>The Deccan Traps in west-central India constitute one of Earth’s largest continental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flood</span></strong> basalt provinces, whose eruption played a role in the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event. The unknown mantle structure under the Indian Ocean at the start of the Cenozoic presents a challenge for connecting the event to a deep mantle origin. We used a back-and-forth iterative method for time-reversed convection modeling, which incorporates tomography-based, present-day mantle heterogeneity to reconstruct mantle structure at the start of the Cenozoic. We show a very low-density, deep-seated upwelling that ascends beneath the Ršćééàéééšćéunion hot spot at the time of the Deccan eruptions. We found a second active upwelling below the Comores hot spot that likely contributed to the region of partial melt feeding the massive eruption.</p>

Airborne laser-guided imaging spectroscopy to map forest trait diversity and guide conservation
<p>Functional biogeography may bridge a gap between field-based biodiversity information and satellite-based Earth system studies, thereby supporting conservation plans to protect more species and their contributions to ecosystem functioning. We used airborne laser-guided imaging spectroscopy with environmental modeling to derive large-scale, multivariate forest canopy functional trait maps of the Peruvian Andes-to-Amazon biodiversity hotspot. Seven mapped canopy traits revealed functional variation in a geospatial pattern ex<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plain</span></strong>ed by geology, topography, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrolog</span></strong>y, and climate. Clustering of canopy traits yielded a map of forest beta functional diversity for land-use analysis. Up to 53% of each mapped, functionally distinct forest presents an opportunity for new conservation action. Mapping functional diversity advances our understanding of the biosphere to conserve more biodiversity in the face of land use and climate change.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Root Bending Is Antagonistically Affected by Hypoxia and ERF-Mediated Transcription via Auxin Signaling
<p>When plants encounter soil water logging or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flood</span></strong>ing, roots are the first organs to be confronted with reduced gas diffusion resulting in limited oxygen supply. Since roots do not generate photosynthetic oxygen, they are rapidly faced with oxygen shortage rendering roots particularly prone to damage. While metabolic adaptations to low oxygen conditions, which ensure basic energy supply, have been well characterized, adaptation of root growth and development have received less attention. In this study, we show that hypoxic conditions cause the primary root to grow sidewise in a low oxygen environment, possibly to escape soil patches with reduced oxygen availability. This growth behavior is reversible in that gravitropic growth resumes when seedlings are returned to normoxic conditions. Hypoxic root bending is inhibited by the group VII ethylene response factor (ERFVII) RAP2.12, as <i>rap2.12-1</i> seedlings show exaggerated primary root bending. Furthermore, overexpression of the ERFVII member <i>HRE2</i> inhibits root bending, suggesting that primary root growth direction at hypoxic conditions is antagonistically regulated by hypoxia and hypoxia-activated ERFVIIs. Root bending is preceded by the establishment of an auxin gradient across the root tip as quantified with DII-VENUS and is synergistically enhanced by hypoxia and the auxin transport inhibitor naphthylphthalamic acid. The protein abundance of the auxin efflux carrier PIN2 is reduced at hypoxic conditions, a response that is suppressed by RAP2.12 overexpression, suggesting antagonistic control of auxin flux by hypoxia and ERFVII. Taken together, we show that hypoxia triggers an escape response of the primary root that is controlled by ERFVII activity and mediated by auxin signaling in the root tip.</p>

Tuberculosis of the spine with severe angular kyphosis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To address the natural history of severe post-tuberculous (TB)   kyphosis, with focus upon the long-term neurological outcome, occurrence   of restrictive lung disease, and the effect on life expectancy. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This is a retrospective clinical review of prospectively collected   imaging data based at a single institute. A total of 24 patients   of Southern Chinese origin who presented with spinal TB with a mean   of 113° of kyphosis (65° to 159°) who fulfilled inclusion criteria   were reviewed. Plain radiographs were used to assess the degree   of spinal deformity. Myelography, CT and MRI were used when available   to assess the integrity of the spinal cord and canal. Patient demographics,   age of onset of spinal TB and interventions, types of surgical procedure,   intra- and post-operative complications, and neurological status   were assessed. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>All except one of the 24 patients were treated with anti-TB chemotherapy   when they were first diagnosed with spinal TB. They subsequently   received surgery either for neurological deterioration, or deformity   correction in later life. The mean follow-up was 34 years (11 to   59) since these surgical interventions. Some 16 patients (66.7%) suffered   from late neurological deterioration at a mean of 26 years (8 to   49) after the initial drug treatment. The causes of neurological   deterioration were healed disease in nine patients (56.2%),    re-activation in six patients (37.5%) and adjacent level spinal   stenosis in one patient (6.3%). The result of surgery was worse   in healed disease. Eight patients without neurological deterioration   received surgery to correct the kyphosis. The mean correction ranged   from 97° to 72°. Three patients who were clinically quiescent with   no neurological deterioration were found to have active TB of the   spine. Solid fusion was achieved in all cases and no patient suffered   from neurological deterioration after 42 years of follow-up. On   final follow-up, six patients were noted to have deceased (age range:   47 years to 75 years).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study presents one of the longest assessments of spinal TB   with severe kyphosis. Severe post-TB kyphosis may lead to significant   health problems many years following the initial drug treatment.   Early surgical correction of the kyphosis, solid fusion and regular   surveillance may avoid late complications. Paraplegia, restrictive   lung disease and early onset kyphosis might relate to early death.   Clinically quiescent disease does not mean cure. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1381–8.</p></sec>

Outcomes after extensive manual curettage and limited burring for atypical cartilaginous tumour of long bone
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Adjuvant treatment after intralesional curettage for atypical   cartilaginous tumours (ACTs) of long bones is widely accepted for   extending surgical margins. However, evaluating the isolated effect   of adjuvant treatment is difficult, and it is unclear whether not   using such adjuvants provides poor oncological outcomes. Hence,   we analyzed whether intralesional curettage without cryosurgery   or chemical adjuvants provides poor oncological outcomes in patients   with an ACT.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 24 patients (nine men, 15 women) (mean age 45 years;   18 to 62) were treated for ACTs of long bones and followed up for   a median of 66 months (interquartile range 50 to 84). All patients   were treated with extensive manual curettage and limited burring.   Bone cement and grafts were used to fill bone defects in 16 and eight   patients, respectively. No chemical adjuvants or cryosurgery were   used.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>No local recurrence was detectable on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plain</span></strong> radiographs and MRI   or CT images. At the last follow-up, there were no distant metastases   or disease-specific deaths. No procedure-related complications or   postoperative fractures developed.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Intralesional curettage without cryosurgery or chemical adjuvants   may provide excellent oncological outcomes for patients with ACTs   of long bones, without the risk of complications related to adjuvant   use. Our investigation suggests thorough curettage alone is a reasonable   treatment option for ACT. However, we acknowledge the limited size   of our investigation warrants a multicentre collaborative study   to confirm our findings.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:256–61.</p></sec>

Randomized Comparison of Paclitaxel-Eluting Balloon and Stenting Versus Plain Balloon Plus Stenting Versus Directional Atherectomy for Femoral Artery Disease (ISAR-STATH)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Atherosclerosis in the superficial femoral artery is common in patients suffering from peripheral artery disease. Paclitaxel-eluting balloon (PEB) angioplasty, stenting, and directional atherectomy (DA) have provided new options for the treatment of superficial femoral artery disease; however, the comparative efficacy of these interventional strategies remains uncertain.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>One hundred and fifty-five patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease due to de novo superficial femoral artery stenotic or occlusive lesions were randomized to treatment with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plain</span></strong> balloon angioplasty (BA) followed by PEB angioplasty and stenting (n=48), BA and stenting (n=52), or DA with distal protection and bailout stenting (n=55). The primary end point of the study was percentage diameter stenosis after 6 months measured by angiography. Other end points included target lesion revascularization, thrombosis, ipsilateral amputation, binary restenosis, and all-cause mortality at 6 and 24 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Baseline and lesion characteristics were comparable in all groups with a mean lesion length of 65.9±46.8 mm and 56% total occlusions. At 6 months angiography, the percent diameter stenosis was significantly lower in patients treated by PEB angioplasty and stenting (34±31%) as compared with BA angioplasty and stenting (56±29%, <i>P</i>=0.009) or DA (55±29%, <i>P</i>=0.007). Similarly, binary restenosis was significantly lower after treatment with PEB and stenting as compared with BA and stenting or DA. Clinical follow-up at 24 months revealed a lower risk for target lesion revascularization after PEB angioplasty and stenting as compared with BA and stenting or DA. We found no difference in terms of target lesion thrombosis and mortality among groups, and no patient underwent amputation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Treatment of de novo superficial femoral artery lesions with PEB angioplasty and stenting is superior to BA angioplasty and stenting or DA in terms of angiographic diameter stenosis at 6 months and target lesion revascularization at 24 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

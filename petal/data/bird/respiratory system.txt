Local and Systemic Metabolic Responses during Light-Induced Rapid Systemic Signaling
<p>Plants evolved multiple signaling pathways that transduce light-related signals between leaves. These are thought to improve light stress acclimation in a process termed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic acquired acclimation. Although responses to light stress have been studied extensively in local leaves, and to a lesser degree in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic leaves, little is known about the responses that occur in the different tissues that connect the local to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic leaves. These could be important in defining the specificity of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic response as well as in supporting the generation of different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic signals. Here, we report that local application of light stress to one rosette leaf of bolting Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants resulted in a metabolic response that encompassed local, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic and transport tissues (stem tissues that connect the local to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic tissues), demonstrating a high degree of physical and metabolic continuity between different tissues throughout the plant. Our results further indicate that the response of many of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ically altered metabolites is associated with the function of the reactive oxygen species wave and that the levels of eight different metabolites are altered in a similar manner in all tissues tested (local, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic, and transport). These compounds could define a core metabolic signature for light stress that propagates from the local to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic leaves. Our findings suggest that metabolic changes occurring in cells that connect the local and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic tissues play an important role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic acquired acclimation and could convey specificity to the rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic response of plants to light stress.</p>

Sheet-Like Remodeling of the Transverse Tubular System in Human Heart Failure Impairs Excitation-Contraction Coupling and Functional Recovery by Mechanical Unloading
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac recovery in response to mechanical unloading by left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) has been demonstrated in subgroups of patients with chronic heart failure (HF). Hallmarks of HF are depletion and dis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ization of the transverse tubular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> (t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>) in cardiomyocytes. Here, we investigated remodeling of the t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> in human end-stage HF and its role in cardiac recovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Left ventricular biopsies were obtained from 5 donors and 26 patients with chronic HF undergoing implantation of LVADs. Three-dimensional confocal microscopy and computational image analysis were applied to assess t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> structure, density, and distance of ryanodine receptor clusters to the sarcolemma, including the t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. Recovery of cardiac function in response to mechanical unloading was assessed by echocardiography during turndown of the LVAD.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The majority of HF myocytes showed remarkable t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> remodeling, particularly sheet-like invaginations of the sarcolemma. Circularity of t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> components was decreased in HF versus controls (0.37±0.01 versus 0.46±0.02; <i>P</i><0.01), and the volume/length ratio was increased in HF (0.36±0.01 versus 0.25±0.02 µm<sup>2</sup>; <i>P</i><0.0001). T-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> density was reduced in HF, leading to increased ryanodine receptor–sarcolemma distances (0.96±0.05 versus 0.64±0.1 µm; <i>P</i><0.01). Low ryanodine receptor–sarcolemma distances at the time of LVAD implantation predicted high post-LVAD left ventricular ejection fractions (<i>P</i><0.01) and ejection fraction increases during unloading (<i>P</i><0.01). Ejection fraction in patients with pre-LVAD ryanodine receptor–sarcolemma distances >1 µm did not improve after mechanical unloading. In addition, calcium transients were recorded in field-stimulated isolated human cardiomyocytes and analyzed with respect to local t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> density. Calcium release in HF myocytes was restricted to regions proximal to the sarcolemma. Local calcium upstroke was delayed (23.9±4.9 versus 10.3±1.7 milliseconds; <i>P</i><0.05) and more asynchronous (18.1±1.5 versus 8.9±2.2 milliseconds; <i>P</i><0.01) in HF cells with low t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> density versus cells with high t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> density.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> in end-stage human HF presents a characteristic novel phenotype consisting of sheet-like invaginations of the sarcolemma. Our results suggest that the remodeled t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> impairs excitation-contraction coupling and functional recovery during chronic LVAD unloading. An intact t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> at the time of LVAD implantation may constitute a precondition and predictor for functional cardiac recovery after mechanical unloading.</p></sec>

Existence, Functional Impairment, and Lung Repair Potential of Endothelial Colony-Forming Cells in Oxygen-Induced Arrested Alveolar Growth
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Bronchopulmonary dysplasia and emphysema are life-threatening diseases resulting from impaired alveolar development or alveolar destruction. Both conditions lack effective therapies. Angiogenic growth factors promote alveolar growth and contribute to alveolar maintenance. Endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) represent a subset of circulating and resident endothelial cells capable of self-renewal and de novo vessel formation. We hypothesized that resident ECFCs exist in the developing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong>, that they are impaired during arrested alveolar growth in experimental bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and that exogenous ECFCs restore disrupted alveolar growth.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Human fetal and neonatal rat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong>s contain ECFCs with robust proliferative potential, secondary colony formation on replating, and de novo blood vessel formation in vivo when transplanted into immunodeficient mice. In contrast, human fetal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> ECFCs exposed to hyperoxia in vitro and neonatal rat ECFCs isolated from hyperoxic alveolar growth–arrested rat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong>s mimicking bronchopulmonary dysplasia proliferated less, showed decreased clonogenic capacity, and formed fewer capillary-like networks.

Low ECFC engraftment and the protective effect of cell-free ECFC-derived conditioned media suggest a paracrine effect.

Kelch-like ECT2-interacting protein KLEIP regulates late-stage pulmonary maturation via Hif-2α in mice
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>atory distress syndrome (RDS) caused by preterm delivery is a major clinical problem with limited mechanistic insight. Late-stage embryonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> development is driven by hypoxia and the hypoxia-inducible transcription factors Hif-1α and Hif-2α, which act as important regulators for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> development. Expression of the BTB-and kelch-domain-containing (BTB-kelch) protein KLEIP (Kelch-like ECT2-interacting protein; also named Klhl20) is controlled by two hypoxia response elements, and KLEIP regulates stabilization and transcriptional activation of Hif-2α. Based on the available data, we hypothesized an essential role for KLEIP in murine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> development and function. Therefore, we have performed a functional, histological, mechanistic and interventional study in embryonic and neonatal <i>KLEIP</i><sup>−/−</sup> mice. Here, we show that about half of the <i>KLEIP<sup>−/−</sup></i> neonates die due to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>atory failure that is caused by insufficient aeration, reduced septal thinning, reduced glycogenolysis, type II pneumocyte immaturity and reduced surfactant production. Expression analyses in embryonic day (E) 18.5 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong>s identified KLEIP in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> capillaries, and showed strongly reduced mRNA and protein levels for Hif-2α and VEGF; such reduced levels are associated with embryonic endothelial cell apoptosis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> bleedings. Betamethasone injection in pregnant females prevented <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>atory failure in <i>KLEIP<sup>−/−</sup></i> neonates, normalized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> maturation, vascularization, aeration and function, and increased neonatal Hif-2α expression. Thus, the experimental study shows that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>atory failure in <i>KLEIP<sup>−/−</sup></i> neonates is determined by insufficient angiocrine Hif-2α–VEGF signaling and that betamethasone activates this newly identified signaling cascade in late-stage embryonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> development.</p>

Role of insulin signaling impairment, adiponectin and dyslipidemia in peripheral and central neuropathy in mice
<p>One of the tissues or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>s affected by diabetes is the nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, predominantly the peripheral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> (peripheral polyneuropathy and/or painful peripheral neuropathy) but also the central <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> with impaired learning, memory and mental flexibility. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the pre-diabetic or diabetic condition caused by a high-fat diet (HFD) can damage both the peripheral and central nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. Groups of C57BL6 and Swiss Webster mice were fed a diet containing 60% fat for 8 months and compared to control and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic groups that were fed a standard diet containing 10% fat. Aspects of peripheral nerve function (conduction velocity, thermal sensitivity) and central nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> function (learning ability, memory) were measured at assorted times during the study. Both strains of mice on HFD developed impaired glucose tolerance, indicative of insulin resistance, but only the C57BL6 mice showed statistically significant hyperglycemia. STZ-diabetic C57BL6 mice developed learning deficits in the Barnes maze after 8 weeks of diabetes, whereas neither C57BL6 nor Swiss Webster mice fed a HFD showed signs of defects at that time point. By 6 months on HFD, Swiss Webster mice developed learning and memory deficits in the Barnes maze test, whereas their peripheral nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> remained normal. In contrast, C57BL6 mice fed the HFD developed peripheral nerve dysfunction, as indicated by nerve conduction slowing and thermal hyperalgesia, but showed normal learning and memory functions. Our data indicate that STZ-induced diabetes or a HFD can damage both peripheral and central nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s, but learning deficits develop more rapidly in insulin-deficient than in insulin-resistant conditions and only in Swiss Webster mice. In addition to insulin impairment, dyslipidemia or adiponectinemia might determine the neuropathy phenotype.</p>

Upregulation of Human Endogenous Retrovirus-K Is Linked to Immunity and Inflammation in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Immune dysregulation has been linked to occlusive vascular remodeling in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) that is hereditary, idiopathic, or associated with other conditions. Circulating autoantibodies, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> perivascular lymphoid tissue, and elevated cytokines have been related to PAH pathogenesis but without a clear understanding of how these abnormalities are initiated, perpetuated, and connected in the progression of disease. We therefore set out to identify specific target antigens in PAH <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> immune complexes as a starting point toward resolving these issues to better inform future application of immunomodulatory therapies.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> immune complexes were isolated and PAH target antigens were identified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and localized by confocal microscopy. One PAH antigen linked to immunity and inflammation was pursued and a link to PAH pathophysiology was investigated by next-generation sequencing, functional studies in cultured monocytes and endothelial cells, and hemodynamic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> studies in a rat.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>SAM domain and HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1), an innate immune factor that suppresses HIV replication, was identified and confirmed as highly expressed in immune complexes from 16 hereditary and idiopathic PAH versus 12 control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong>s. Elevated SAMHD1 was localized to endothelial cells, perivascular dendritic cells, and macrophages, and SAMHD1 antibodies were prevalent in tertiary lymphoid tissue. An unbiased screen using metagenomic sequencing related SAMHD1 to increased expression of human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K) in PAH versus control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong>s (n=4). HERV-K envelope and deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase mRNAs were elevated in PAH versus control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong>s (n=10), and proteins were localized to macrophages. HERV-K deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase induced SAMHD1 and proinflammatory cytokines (eg, interleukin 6, interleukin 1β, and tumor necrosis factor α) in circulating monocytes, pulmonary arterial endothelial cells, and also activated B cells. Vulnerability of pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (PAEC) to apoptosis was increased by HERV-K deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase in an interleukin 6-independent manner. Furthermore, 3 weekly injections of HERV-K deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase induced hemodynamic and vascular changes of pulmonary hypertension in rats (n=8) and elevated interleukin 6.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our study reveals that upregulation of the endogenous retrovirus HERV-K could both initiate and sustain activation of the immune <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> and cause vascular changes associated with PAH.</p></sec>

Connecting neuronal circuits for movement
<p>Movement is the most common final output of nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> activity and is essential for survival. But what makes this seemingly trivial statement so scientifically challenging? Neurons that contribute to when and how our body moves are distributed throughout the nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. Thus, even a simple movement such as arm flexion requires the coordinated activation of many different neuronal populations across multiple brain regions. A key question is how the nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> produces diverse and precise actions aligned with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>isms' behavioral needs. These processes are affected in diseases such as Parkinson's or Huntington's, in which aberrant motor behavior dominates. Recent studies are transformative in how we think about the control of movement. A common denominator of these studies is that brain regions that contribute to motor behavior can no longer be considered as interacting boxes. Instead, deep circuit-level insight based on specific neuronal populations emerges as being critical to revealing motor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ization and understanding its function. It is likely that insights at this level can also help to design more specific and direct interventions for diseases of the motor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> and neuroprosthetics applied after injuries.</p>

Self-organization and progenitor targeting generate stable patterns in planarian regeneration
<p>During animal regeneration, cells must <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ize into discrete and functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. We show that self-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ization, along with patterning cues, govern progenitor behavior in planarian regeneration. Surgical paradigms allowed the manipulation of planarian eye regeneration in predictable locations and numbers, generating alternative stable neuro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anatomi</span></strong>cal states for wild-type animals with multiple functional ectopic eyes. We used animals with multiple ectopic eyes and eye transplantation to demonstrate that broad progenitor specification, combined with self-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ization, allows anatomy maintenance during regeneration. We propose a model for regenerative progenitors involving (i) migratory targeting cues, (ii) self-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ization into existing or regenerating eyes, and (iii) a broad zone, associated with coarse progenitor specification, in which eyes can be targeted by progenitors. These three properties help explain how tissues can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ized during regeneration.</p>

Independent Regulation of Symbiotic Nodulation by the SUNN Negative and CRA2 Positive Systemic Pathways
<p>Plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic signaling pathways allow the integration and coordination of shoot and root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong> metabolism and development at the whole-plant level depending on nutrient availability. In legumes, two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic pathways have been reported in the <i>Medicago truncatula</i> model to regulate root nitrogen-fixing symbiotic nodulation. Both pathways involve leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases acting in shoots and proposed to perceive signaling peptides produced in roots depending on soil nutrient availability. In this study, we characterized in the <i>M. truncatula</i> Jemalong A17 genotype a mutant allelic series affecting the Compact Root Architecture2 (CRA2) receptor. These analyses revealed that this pathway acts <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ically from shoots to positively regulate nodulation and is required for the activity of carboxyl-terminally encoded peptides (CEPs). In addition, we generated a double mutant to test genetic interactions of the CRA2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic pathway with the CLAVATA3/EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGION peptide (CLE)/Super Numeric Nodule (SUNN) receptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic pathway negatively regulating nodule number from shoots, which revealed an intermediate nodule number phenotype close to the wild type. Finally, we showed that the nitrate inhibition of nodule numbers was observed in <i>cra2</i> mutants but not in <i>sunn</i> and <i>cra2 sunn</i> mutants. Overall, these results suggest that CEP/CRA2 and CLE/SUNN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic pathways act independently from shoots to regulate nodule numbers.</p>

CyanoGate: A Modular Cloning Suite for Engineering Cyanobacteria Based on the Plant MoClo Syntax
<p>Recent advances in synthetic biology research have been underpinned by an exponential increase in available genomic information and a proliferation of advanced DNA assembly tools. The adoption of plasmid vector assembly standards and parts libraries has greatly enhanced the reproducibility of research and the exchange of parts between different labs and biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. However, a standardized modular cloning (MoClo) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> is not yet available for cyanobacteria, which lag behind other prokaryotes in synthetic biology despite their huge potential regarding biotechnological applications. By building on the assembly library and syntax of the Plant Golden Gate MoClo kit, we have developed a versatile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> called CyanoGate that unites cyanobacteria with plant and algal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. Here, we describe the generation of a suite of parts and acceptor vectors for making (1) marked/unmarked knock-outs or integrations using an integrative acceptor vector, and (2) transient multigene expression and repression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s using known and previously undescribed replicative vectors. We tested and compared the CyanoGate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> in the established model cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 and the more recently described fast-growing strain <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973. The UTEX 2973 fast-growth phenotype was only evident under specific growth conditions; however, UTEX 2973 accumulated high levels of proteins with strong native or synthetic promoters. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> is publicly available and can be readily expanded to accommodate other standardized MoClo parts to accelerate the development of reliable synthetic biology tools for the cyanobacterial community.</p>

Autophagy Deficiency Compromises Alternative Pathways of Respiration following Energy Deprivation in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>Under heterotrophic conditions, carbohydrate oxidation inside the mitochondrion is the primary energy source for cellular metabolism. However, during energy-limited conditions, alternative substrates are required to support <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation. Amino acid oxidation in plant cells plays a key role in this by generating electrons that can be transferred to the mitochondrial electron transport chain via the electron transfer flavoprotein/ubiquinone oxidoreductase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. Autophagy, a catabolic mechanism for macromolecule and protein recycling, allows the maintenance of amino acid pools and nutrient remobilization. Although the association between autophagy and alternative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>atory substrates has been suggested, the extent to which autophagy and primary metabolism interact to support plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation remains unclear. To investigate the metabolic importance of autophagy during development and under extended darkness, Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants with disruption of autophagy (<i>atg</i> mutants) were used. Under normal growth conditions, <i>atg</i> mutants showed lower growth and seed production with no impact on photosynthesis. Following extended darkness, <i>atg</i> mutants were characterized by signatures of early senescence, including decreased chlorophyll content and maximum photochemical efficiency of photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> II coupled with increases in dark <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation. Transcript levels of genes involved in alternative pathways of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation and amino acid catabolism were up-regulated in <i>atg</i> mutants. The metabolite profiles of dark-treated leaves revealed an extensive metabolic reprogramming in which increases in amino acid levels were partially compromised in <i>atg</i> mutants. Although an enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation in <i>atg</i> mutants was observed during extended darkness, autophagy deficiency compromises protein degradation and the generation of amino acids used as alternative substrates to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation.</p>

The Sites of Evaporation within Leaves
<p>The sites of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evapor</span></strong>ation within leaves are unknown, but they have drawn attention for decades due to their perceived implications for many factors, including patterns of leaf isotopic enrichment, the maintenance of mesophyll water status, stomatal regulation, and the interpretation of measured stomatal and leaf hydraulic conductances. We used a spatially explicit model of coupled water and heat transport outside the xylem, MOFLO 2.0, to map the distribution of net <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evapor</span></strong>ation across leaf tissues in relation to anatomy and environmental parameters. Our results corroborate earlier predictions that most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evapor</span></strong>ation occurs from the epidermis at low light and moderate humidity but that the mesophyll contributes substantially when the leaf center is warmed by light absorption, and more so under high humidity. We also found that the bundle sheath provides a significant minority of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evapor</span></strong>ation (15% in darkness and 18% in high light), that the vertical center of amphistomatous leaves supports net condensation, and that vertical temperature gradients caused by light absorption vary over 10-fold across species, reaching 0.3°C. We show that several hypotheses that depend on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evapor</span></strong>ating sites require revision in light of our findings, including that experimental measurements of stomatal and hydraulic conductances should be affected directly by changes in the location of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evapor</span></strong>ating sites. We propose a new conceptual model that accounts for mixed-phase water transport outside the xylem. These conclusions have far-reaching implications for inferences in leaf hydraulics, gas exchange, water use, and isotope physiology.</p>

The balance between immunity and inflammation
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong>s execute two critical functions that can be at odds with one another: eliminating harmful toxins, particulates, and microbes; and exchanging gas through uninflamed structures—alveoli—to collect oxygen and discharge carbon dioxide. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong>s have a multilayered response to unwanted invaders, offering physical barriers as well as arranging immune cells at airway surfaces. Yet, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong>s have the “Goldilocks” challenge of deploying this armory with just the right amount of inflammation. Consequently, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> immunity must be choreographed so that invaders are purged quickly, inflammation tempered, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s preserved. In this issue, two papers reveal how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> immunity handles these tasks and what happens when things go awry. Shlezinger <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) on page 1037 unveil a clever trick that neutrophils play on inhaled fungal spores to resist life-threatening infections. This may reveal new treatment strategies.

Localized aliphatic organic material on the surface of Ceres
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ic compounds occur in some chondritic meteorites, and their signatures on solar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> bodies have been sought for decades. Spectral signatures of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ics have not been unambiguously identified on the surfaces of asteroids, whereas they have been detected on cometary nuclei. Data returned by the Visible and InfraRed Mapping Spectrometer on board the Dawn spacecraft show a clear detection of an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ic absorption feature at 3.4 micrometers on dwarf planet Ceres. This signature is characteristic of aliphatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ic matter and is mainly localized on a broad region of ~1000 square kilometers close to the ~50-kilometer Ernutet crater. The combined presence on Ceres of ammonia-bearing hydrated minerals, water ice, carbonates, salts, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ic material indicates a very complex chemical environment, suggesting favorable environments to prebiotic chemistry.</p>

The Hydrogen Isotope Composition δ<sup>2</sup>H Reflects Plant Performance
<p>The stable carbon (δ<sup>13</sup>C) and oxygen (δ<sup>18</sup>O) isotope compositions in plant matter reflect photosynthetic and transpirative conditions in plants, respectively. However, the nature of hydrogen isotope composition (δ<sup>2</sup>H) and what it reflects of plant performance is poorly understood. Using durum wheat (<i>Triticum turgidum</i> var <i>durum</i>), this study evaluated the effect of different water and nitrogen growing field conditions on transpiration and how this effect influenced the performance of δ<sup>2</sup>H in autotrophic (flag leaf), mixotrophic (ears), and heterotrophic (grains and roots) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>s. Moreover, δ<sup>2</sup>H was compared with the δ<sup>13</sup>C and δ<sup>18</sup>O in the same <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>s. Isotope compositions were analyzed in dry matter, the water-soluble fraction, and in water from different tissues of a set of genotypes. Similar to δ<sup>13</sup>C, the δ<sup>2</sup>H correlated negatively with stomatal conductance, whereas no correlation was observed for δ<sup>18</sup>O. Moreover, δ<sup>2</sup>H was not only affected by changes in transpiration but also by photosynthetic reactions, probably as a consequence of NADPH formation in autotrophic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>s. Compared with the δ<sup>2</sup>H of stem water, plant δ<sup>2</sup>H was strongly diminished in photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>s such as the flag leaves, whereas it strongly increased in heterotrophic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>s such as grains and roots. In heterotrophic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>s, δ<sup>2</sup>H was associated with postphotosynthetic effects because there are several processes that lead to <sup>2</sup>H-enrichment of carbohydrates. In summary, δ<sup>2</sup>H exhibited specific features that inform about the water conditions of the wheat crop, together with the photosynthetic characteristics of the plant part considered. Moreover, correlations of δ<sup>2</sup>H with grain yield illustrate that this isotope can be used to assess plant performance under different growing conditions.</p>

A Mobile Auxin Signal Connects Temperature Sensing in Cotyledons with Growth Responses in Hypocotyls
<p>Plants have a remarkable capacity to adjust their growth and development to elevated ambient temperatures. Increased elongation growth of roots, hypocotyls, and petioles in warm temperatures are hallmarks of seedling thermomorphogenesis. In the last decade, significant progress has been made to identify the molecular signaling components regulating these growth responses. Increased ambient temperature utilizes diverse components of the light sensing and signal transduction network to trigger growth adjustments. However, it remains unknown whether temperature sensing and responses are universal processes that occur uniformly in all plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>s. Alternatively, temperature sensing may be confined to specific tissues or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>s, which would require a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic signal that mediates responses in distal parts of the plant. Here, we show that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings show <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>-specific transcriptome responses to elevated temperatures and that thermomorphogenesis involves both autonomous and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>-interdependent temperature sensing and signaling. Seedling roots can sense and respond to temperature in a shoot-independent manner, whereas shoot temperature responses require both local and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic processes. The induction of cell elongation in hypocotyls requires temperature sensing in cotyledons, followed by the generation of a mobile auxin signal. Subsequently, auxin travels to the hypocotyl, where it triggers local brassinosteroid-induced cell elongation in seedling stems, which depends upon a distinct, permissive temperature sensor in the hypocotyl.</p>

A Genetic Network for Systemic RNA Silencing in Plants
<p>Non-cell autonomous RNA silencing can spread from cell to cell and over long distances in animals and plants. However, the genetic requirements and signals involved in plant mobile gene silencing are poorly understood. Here, we identified a <i>DICER-LIKE2</i> (<i>DCL2</i>)<i>-</i>dependent mechanism for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic spread of posttranscriptional RNA silencing, also known as posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS), in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. Using a suite of transgenic <i>DCL</i> RNAi lines coupled with a GFP reporter, we demonstrated that <i>N. benthamiana</i> DCL1, DCL2, DCL3, and DCL4 are required to produce microRNAs and 22, 24, and 21nt small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), respectively. All investigated siRNAs produced in local incipient cells were present at low levels in distal tissues. Inhibition of <i>DCL2</i> expression reduced the spread of gene silencing, while suppression of <i>DCL3</i> or <i>DCL4</i> expression enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS. In contrast to <i>DCL4</i> RNAi lines, <i>DCL2</i>-<i>DCL4</i> double-RNAi lines developed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS similar to that observed in <i>DCL2</i> RNAi. We further showed that the 21 or 24 nt local siRNAs produced by DCL4 or DCL3 were not involved in long-distance gene silencing. Grafting experiments demonstrated that <i>DCL2</i> was required in the scion to respond to the signal, but not in the rootstock to produce/send the signal. These results suggest a coordinated <i>DCL</i> genetic pathway in which <i>DCL2</i> plays an essential role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS in <i>N. benthamiana</i>, while both <i>DCL4</i> and <i>DCL3</i> attenuate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS. We discuss the potential role of 21, 22, and 24 nt siRNAs in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS.</p>

Transcription Factor OsTGA10 Is a Target of the MADS Protein OsMADS8 and Is Required for Tapetum Development
<p>This study aimed at elucidating regulatory components behind floral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong> identity determination and tissue development. It remains unclear how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong> identity proteins facilitate development of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong> primordia into tissues with a determined identity, even though it has long been accepted that floral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong> identity is genetically determined by interaction of identity genes according to the ABC model. Using the chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing technique, we identified <i>OsTGA10</i>, encoding a bZIP transcription factor, as a target of the MADS box protein OsMADS8, which is annotated as an E-class <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong> identity protein. We characterized the function of OsTGA10 using genetic and molecular analyses. <i>OsTGA10</i> was preferentially expressed during stamen development, and mutation of <i>OsTGA10</i> resulted in male sterility. OsTGA10 was required for tapetum development and functioned by interacting with known tapetum genes. In addition, in <i>ostga10</i> stamens, the hallmark cell wall thickening of the endothecium was defective. Our findings suggest that OsTGA10 plays a mediator role between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong> identity determination and tapetum development in rice stamen development, between tapetum development and microspore development, and between various regulatory components required for tapetum development. Furthermore, the defective endothecium in <i>ostga10</i> implies that cell wall thickening of endothecium is dependent on tapetum development.</p>

Vocal production complexity correlates with neural instructions in the oyster toadfish (<i>Opsanus tau</i>)
<p>Sound communication is fundamental to many social interactions and essential to courtship and agonistic behaviours in many vertebrates. The swimbladder and associated muscles in batrachoidid fishes (midshipman and toadfish) is a unique vertebrate sound production <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, wherein fundamental frequencies are determined directly by the firing rate of a vocal-acoustic neural network that drives the contraction frequency of superfast swimbladder muscles. The oyster toadfish boatwhistle call starts with an irregular sound waveform that could be an emergent property of the peripheral nonlinear sound-producing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> or reflect complex encoding in the central nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. Here, we demonstrate that the start of the boatwhistle is indicative of a chaotic strange attractor, and tested whether its origin lies in the peripheral sound-producing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> or in the vocal motor network. We recorded sound and swimbladder muscle activity in awake, freely behaving toadfish during motor nerve stimulation, and recorded sound, motor nerve and muscle activity during spontaneous grunts. The results show that rhythmic motor volleys do not cause complex sound signals. However, arrhythmic recruitment of swimbladder muscle during spontaneous grunts correlates with complex sounds. This supports the hypothesis that the irregular start of the boatwhistle is encoded in the vocal pre-motor neural network, and not caused by peripheral interactions with the sound-producing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. We suggest that sound production <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> demands across vocal tetrapods have selected for muscles and motorneurons adapted for speed, which can execute complex neural instructions into equivalently complex vocalisations.</p>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
A new and clinically relevant murine model of solid-organ transplant aspergillosis
<p>Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are a major cause of death in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong> transplant patients. The murine hydrocortisone-mediated immunosuppression model of pulmonary aspergillosis is commonly used to characterise IFIs in these patients. However, this model does not take into account the effects of calcineurin inhibitors on transplant immunity to IFIs or the fungal calcineurin pathway, which is required for both virulence and antifungal drug resistance. To address these two issues, a new and clinically relevant transplant immunosuppression model of tacrolimus (FK506) and hydrocortisone-associated pulmonary aspergillosis was developed. We first characterised IFIs in 406 patients with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> transplant. This showed that all of the patients with pulmonary aspergillosis were immunosuppressed with calcineurin inhibitors and steroids. Murine pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that an ideal dose of 1 mg/kg/day of FK506 intraperitoneally produced blood trough levels in the human therapeutic range (5–12 ng/ml). There was increased mortality from pulmonary aspergillosis in a transplant-relevant immunosuppression model using both FK506 and hydrocortisone as compared with immunosuppression using hydrocortisone only. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> histopathology showed neutrophil invasion and tracheo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bronchi</span></strong>tis that was associated with reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> tumour necrosis factor-α (TNFα), JE (homologue of human MCP-1) and KC (homologue of human IL-8) at 24 hours, but increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lung</span></strong> TNFα, JE and KC at 48 hours when fungal burden was high. Furthermore, FK506 directly impaired fungal killing in alveolar macrophages <i>in vitro</i>, with FK506-mediated inhibition of the radial growth of <i>Aspergillus fumigatus in vitro</i> occurring at the low concentration of 5 ng/ml. Taken together, these findings show that the immunosuppressive activity of FK506 outweighs its antifungal activity <i>in vivo</i>. These observations demonstrate that FK506 impairs innate immune responses and leads to an incremental increase in susceptibility to IFIs when it is combined with steroids. This new and clinically relevant mouse model of invasive aspergillosis is a valuable addition to the further study of both fungal immunity and antifungal therapy in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong> transplantation.</p>

We developed a method to dilate a general parity-time–symmetric Hamiltonian into a Hermitian one.

Emergence of coexisting ordered states in active matter systems
<p>Active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s can produce a far greater variety of ordered patterns than conventional equilibrium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s.

However, coexistence between phases of different types of order has not been reported. We demonstrate the emergence of dynamic coexistence of ordered states with fluctuating nematic and polar symmetry in an actomyosin motility assay. Combining experiments with agent-based simulations, we identify sufficiently weak interactions that lack a clear alignment symmetry as a prerequisite for coexistence. Thus, the symmetry of macroscopic order becomes an emergent and dynamic property of the active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>.

The principles of cascading power limits in small, fast biological and engineered systems

Many biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s incorporate power-enhancing mechanisms enabling extraordinary accelerations at small sizes. We establish how power enhancement emerges through the dynamic coupling of motors, springs, and latches and reveal how each displays its own force-velocity behavior. We mathematically demonstrate a tunable performance space for spring-actuated movement that is applicable to biological and synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. Incorporating nonideal spring behavior and parameterizing latch dynamics allows the identification of critical transitions in mass and trade-offs in spring scaling, both of which offer explanations for long-observed scaling patterns in biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s.

Breaking Lorentz reciprocity to overcome the time-bandwidth limit in physics and engineering
<p>A century-old tenet in physics and engineering asserts that any type of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, having bandwidth Δω, can interact with a wave over only a constrained time period Δ<i>t</i> inversely proportional to the bandwidth (Δ<i>t</i>·Δω ~ 2π). This law severely limits the generic capabilities of all types of resonant and wave-guiding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s in photonics, cavity quantum electrodynamics and optomechanics, acoustics, continuum mechanics, and atomic and optical physics but is thought to be completely fundamental, arising from basic Fourier reciprocity. We propose that this “fundamental” limit can be overcome in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s where Lorentz reciprocity is broken. As a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> becomes more asymmetric in its transport properties, the degree to which the limit can be surpassed becomes greater. By way of example, we theoretically demonstrate how, in an astutely designed magnetized semiconductor heterostructure, the above limit can be exceeded by orders of magnitude by using realistic material parameters. Our findings revise prevailing paradigms for linear, time-invariant resonant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s, challenging the doctrine that high-quality resonances must invariably be narrowband and providing the possibility of developing devices with unprecedentedly high time-bandwidth performance.</p>

Vacuolar Phosphate Transporters Contribute to Systemic Phosphate Homeostasis Vital for Reproductive Development in Arabidopsis
<p>Vacuolar storage of phosphate (Pi) is essential for Pi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s in plants. Recent studies have identified a family of vacuolar Pi transporters, VPTs (PHT5s), responsible for vacuolar sequestration of Pi. We report here that both VPT1 and VPT3 contribute to cytosol-to-vacuole Pi partitioning. Although VPT1 plays a predominant role, VPT3 is particularly important when VPT1 is absent. Our data suggested that the <i>vpt1 vpt3</i> double mutant was more defective in Pi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s than the <i>vpt1</i> single mutant, as indicated by Pi accumulation capacity, vacuolar Pi influx, subcellular Pi allocation, and plant adaptability to changing Pi status. The remaining member of the VPT family, VPT2 (PHT5;2), did not appear to contribute to Pi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s in such assays. Particularly interesting is the finding that the <i>vpt1 vpt3</i> double mutant was impaired in reproductive development with shortened siliques and impaired seed set under sufficient Pi, and this phenotype was not found in the <i>vpt1 vpt2</i> and <i>vpt2 vpt3</i> double mutants. Measurements of Pi contents revealed Pi over-accumulation in the floral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>s of <i>vpt1 vpt3</i> as compared with the wild type. Further analysis identified excess Pi in the pistil as inhibitory to pollen tube growth, and thus seed yield, in the mutant plants. Reducing the Pi levels in culture medium or mutation of PHO1, a Pi transport protein responsible for root-shoot transport, restored the seed set of <i>vpt1 vpt3</i>. Thus, VPTs, through their function in vacuolar Pi sequestration, control the fine-tuning of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic Pi allocation, which is particularly important for reproductive development.</p>

EPFL Signals in the Boundary Region of the SAM Restrict Its Size and Promote Leaf Initiation
<p>The shoot apical meristem (SAM) enables the formation of new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>s throughout the life of a plant. ERECTA family (ERf) receptors restrict SAM size and promote initiation of leaves while simultaneously supporting establishment of correct phyllotaxy. In the epidermis and during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong> elongation ERf activity is regulated by a family of Epidermal Patterning Factor-Like (EPFL) secreted Cys-rich small proteins. Here we show that ERfs play a critical role in communication between the SAM leaf boundary and the central zone in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Ectopic expression of <i>ERECTA</i> in the central zone using the <i>CLAVATA3</i> promoter is sufficient to restrict meristem size and promote leaf initiation. Genetic analysis demonstrated that four putative ligands: EPFL1, EPFL2, EPFL4, and EPFL6 function redundantly in the SAM. These genes are expressed at the SAM-leaf boundary and in the peripheral zone. Previously EPFL4 and EPFL6 have been linked with elongation of aboveground <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>s. Here we demonstrate that EPFL1 and EPFL2 promote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong> elongation as well. In addition, we show that expression of <i>ERECTA</i> in the central zone of the SAM has a strong impact on elongation of internodes and pedicels and growth of leaves. These results suggest that ERfs can stimulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong> growth cell nonautonomously.</p>

The Microtubule-Associated Protein IQ67 DOMAIN5 Modulates Microtubule Dynamics and Pavement Cell Shape
<p>The dynamic arrangement of cortical microtubules (MTs) plays a pivotal role in controlling cell growth and shape formation in plants, but the mechanisms by which cortical MTs are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ized to regulate these processes are not well characterized. In particular, the dynamic behavior of cortical MTs is critical for their spatial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ization, yet the molecular mechanisms controlling MT dynamics remain poorly understood. In this study, we used the puzzle piece-shaped pavement cells of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves as a model <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> in which to study cortical MT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ization. We isolated an ethyl methanesulfonate mutant with reduced interdigitation of pavement cells in cotyledons. This line carried a mutation in <i>IQ67 DOMAIN5</i> (<i>IQD5</i>), which encodes a member of the plant-specific IQ motif protein family. Live-cell imaging and biochemical analyses demonstrated that IQD5 binds to MTs and promotes MT assembly. MT-depolymerizing drug treatment and in vivo MT dynamics assays suggested that IQD5 functions to stabilize MTs. Hence, our findings provide genetic, cell biological, and biochemical evidence that IQD5 regulates MT dynamics that affect MT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ization and subsequent cell shape formation.</p>

A Genetic Screen for Impaired Systemic RNAi Highlights the Crucial Role of DICER-LIKE 2
<p>Posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS) of transgenes involves abundant 21-nucleotide small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and low-abundance 22-nucleotide siRNAs produced from double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) by DCL4 and DCL2, respectively. However, DCL2 facilitates the recruitment of RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE 6 (RDR6) to ARGONAUTE 1-derived cleavage products, resulting in more efficient amplification of secondary and transitive dsRNA and siRNAs. Here, we describe a reporter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> where RDR6-dependent PTGS is initiated by restricted expression of an inverted-repeat dsRNA specifically in the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) root tip, allowing a genetic screen to identify mutants impaired in RDR6-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS. Our screen identified <i>dcl2</i> but not <i>dcl4</i> mutants. Moreover, grafting experiments showed that DCL2, but not DCL4, is required in both the source rootstock and the recipient shoot tissue for efficient RDR6-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS. Furthermore, <i>dcl4</i> rootstocks produced more DCL2-dependent 22-nucleotide siRNAs than the wild type and showed enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic movement of PTGS to grafted shoots. Thus, along with its role in recruiting RDR6 for further amplification of PTGS, DCL2 is crucial for RDR6-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS.</p>

OsHAD1, a Haloacid Dehalogenase-Like APase, Enhances Phosphate Accumulation
<p>Phosphorus (P) deficiency limits plant growth and yield. Since plants can absorb only the in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ic form of P (Pi), a large portion of soil P (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ic and in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ic P complexes) remains unused. Here, we identified and characterized a PHR2-regulated, novel low-Pi-responsive haloacid dehalogenase (HAD)-like hydrolase, <i>OsHAD1</i>. While OsHAD1 is a functional HAD protein having both acid phosphatase and phytase activities, it showed little homology with other known low-Pi-responsive HAD superfamily members. Recombinant OsHAD1 is active at acidic pH and dephosphorylates a broad range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ic and in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ic P-containing substrates, including phosphorylated serine and sodium phytate. Exogenous application of recombinant OsHAD1 protein in growth medium supplemented with phytate led to marked increases in growth and total P content of Pi-deficient wild-type rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) seedlings. Furthermore, overexpression of <i>OsHAD1</i> in rice resulted in enhanced phosphatase activity, biomass, and total and soluble P contents in Pi-deficient transgenic seedlings treated with phytate as a restricted Pi source. Gene expression and metabolite profiling revealed enhanced Pi starvation responses, such as up-regulation of multiple genes involved in Pi uptake and solubilization, accumulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ic acids, enhanced secretory phosphatase activity, and depletion of ATP in overexpression lines as compared with the wild type. To elucidate the underlying regulatory mechanisms of OsHAD1, we performed in vitro pull-down assays, which revealed the association of OsHAD1 with protein kinases such as OsNDPKs. We conclude that, besides dephosphorylation of cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ic P, OsHAD1 in coordination with kinases may regulate the phosphorylation status of downstream targets to accomplish Pi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s under limited Pi supply.</p>

A Viral Satellite DNA Vector (TYLCCNV) for Functional Analysis of miRNAs and siRNAs in Plants
<p>With experimental and bioinformatical methods, numerous small RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), have been found in plants, and they play vital roles in various biological regulation processes. However, most of these small RNAs remain to be functionally characterized. Until now, only several viral vectors were developed to overexpress miRNAs with limited application in plants. In this study, we report a new small RNA overexpression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> via viral satellite DNA associated with <i>Tomato yellow leaf curl China virus</i> (TYLCCNV) vector, which could highly overexpress not only artificial and endogenous miRNAs but also endogenous siRNAs in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. First, we constructed basic TYLCCNV-amiRPDS(319L) vector with widely used <i>AtMIR319a</i> backbone, but the expected photobleaching phenotype was very weak. Second, through comparing the effect of backbones (<i>AtMIR319a</i>, <i>AtMIR390a</i>, and <i>SlMIR159</i>) on specificity and significance of generating small RNAs, the <i>AtMIR390a</i> backbone was optimally selected to construct the small RNA overexpression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. Third, through sRNA-Seq and Degradome-Seq, the small RNAs from <i>AtMIR390a</i> backbone in TYLCCNV-amiRPDS(390) vector were confirmed to highly overexpress amiRPDS and specifically silence targeted <i>PDS</i> gene. Using this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, rapid functional analysis of endogenous miRNAs and siRNAs was carried out, including miR156 and <i>athTAS3a</i> 5′D8(+). Meanwhile, through designing corresponding artificial miRNAs, this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> could also significantly silence targeted endogenous genes and show specific phenotypes, including <i>PDS</i>, <i>Su</i>, and <i>PCNA</i>. These results demonstrated that this small RNA overexpression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> could contribute to investigating not only the function of endogenous small RNAs, but also the functional genes in plants.</p>

Periodic heartbeat reversals cause cardiogenic inspiration and expiration with coupled spiracle leakage in resting blowflies, <i>Calliphora vicina</i>
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation in insects is thought to be independent of the circulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> because insects typically lack <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>atory pigments and because oxygen transport occurs in the gaseous phase through a ramified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">trachea</span></strong>l <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> by diffusion and convection directly to the tissues. In the blowfly, as in other insects with periodic heartbeat reversal, the haemolymph is periodically shifted between the anterior body and abdomen, exerting alternating pressure changes on the compliant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">trachea</span></strong>e in the thorax and in the abdomen. Simultaneous pressure and O<sub>2</sub> optode measurements show that, during negative pressure periods, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">trachea</span></strong>l partial pressure of oxygen (<i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>) increases by 0.5 kPa. In the quiescent fly, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">trachea</span></strong>l <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> is rather high (17.5–18.9 kPa), although the thoracic spiracles remain constricted. Microscopic video recordings and reflectance measurements revealed that the dorsal soft edges of the valve lips of the second spiracle leave a very small leak, which is passively widened during backward pulses of the heart. Thus, negative pressure, combined with increased leakage of the spiracle Sp2 valve enable inspiration in the thorax. The positive pressure periods are correlated with a new type of convective CO<sub>2</sub> micro-bursts as shown in flow-through measurements. The bulk of the CO<sub>2</sub> is, however, released after longer interbursts in macro-bursts with actively opening valves reminiscent of the open phase in a cyclic gas exchange. When the valves open, the <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> in the thoracic air sacs unexpectedly drops by a mean of 2.75±1.09 kPa, suggesting a displacement of O<sub>2</sub> by the transient accumulation of CO<sub>2</sub> in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">trachea</span></strong>l <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> before its release.</p>

Glycolysis plays an important role in energy transfer from the base to the distal end of the flagellum in mouse sperm
<p>Many studies have been conducted to elucidate the relationship between energy metabolic pathways (glycolysis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation) and flagellar motility in mammalian sperm, but the contribution of glycolysis to sperm motility has not yet been fully elucidated. In the present study, we performed detailed analysis of mouse sperm flagellar motility for further understanding of the contribution of glycolysis to mammalian sperm motility. Mouse sperm maintained vigorous motility in the presence of substrates either for glycolysis or for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation. By contrast, inhibition of glycolysis by alpha-chlorohydrine caused a significant decrease in the bend angle of the flagellar bending wave, sliding velocity of outer doublet microtubules and ATP content even in the presence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>atory substrates (pyruvate or β-hydroxybutyrate). The decrease of flagellar bend angle and sliding velocity are prominent in the distal part of the flagellum, indicating that glycolysis inhibition caused the decrease in ATP concentration threrein. These results suggest that glycolysis potentially acts as a spatial ATP buffering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, transferring energy (ATP) synthesized by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation at the mitochondria located in the basal part of the flagellum to the distal part. In order to validate that glycolytic enzymes can transfer high energy phosphoryls, we calculated intraflagellar concentration profiles of adenine nucleotides along the flagellum by computer simulation analysis. The result demonstrated the involvement of glycolysis for maintaining the ATP concentration at the tip of the flagellum. It is likely that glycolysis plays a key role in energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s in mouse sperm not only through ATP production but also through energy transfer.</p>

Rapid cold hardening improves recovery of ion homeostasis and chill coma recovery time in the migratory locust, <i>Locusta migratoria</i>
<p>Chill tolerance of insects is defined as the ability to tolerate low temperature under circumstances not involving freezing of intracellular or extracellular fluids. For many insects chill tolerance is crucial for their ability to persist in cold environments and mounting evidence indicates that chill tolerance is associated with the ability to maintain ion and water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s, thereby ensuring muscular function and preventing chill injury at low temperature. The present study describes the relationship between muscle and haemolymph ion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s and time to regain posture following cold shock (CS, 2 h at −4°C) in the chill-susceptible locust <i>Locusta migratoria</i>. This relationship was examined in animals with and without a prior rapid cold-hardening treatment (RCH, 2 h at 0°C) to investigate the physiological underpinnings of RCH. CS elicited a doubling of haemolymph [K<sup>+</sup>] and this disturbance was greater in locusts pre-exposed to RCH. Recovery of ion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s was, however, markedly faster in RCH-treated animals, which correlated well with whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ism performance as hardened individuals regained posture faster than non-hardened individuals following CS. The present study indicates that loss and recovery of muscular function are associated with the resting membrane potential of excitable membranes as attested by the changes in the equilibrium potential for K<sup>+</sup> (<i>E</i><sub>K</sub>) following CS. Both hardened and non-hardened animals regained movement once K<sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s had recovered to a fixed level (<i>E</i><sub>K</sub>≈−41 mV). RCH is therefore not associated with altered sensitivity to ion disturbance but instead is correlated to a faster recovery of haemolymph [K<sup>+</sup>].</p>

Contribution of Impaired Parasympathetic Activity to Right Ventricular Dysfunction and Pulmonary Vascular Remodeling in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension

In addition, we investigated the effects of PYR (40 mg/kg per day) in experimental PH. PH was induced in male rats by SU5416 (25 mg/kg subcutaneously) injection followed by 4 weeks of hypoxia. In a subgroup, sympathetic/parasympathetic modulation was assessed by power spectral analysis. At week 6, PH status was confirmed by echocardiography, and rats were randomly assigned to vehicle or treatment (both n=12).

Also, the <i>kea4 kea5 kea6</i> mutant plants had a reduced luminal pH in the Golgi, trans-Golgi network, prevacuolar compartment, and vacuole, in accordance with the K/H exchange activity of KEA proteins.

A Rice Glutamyl-tRNA Synthetase Modulates Early Anther Cell Division and Patterning
<p>Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) have housekeeping roles in protein synthesis, but little is known about how these aaRSs are involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong> development. Here, we report that a rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (OsERS1) maintains proper somatic cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ization and limits the overproliferation of male germ cells during early anther development. The expression of <i>OsERS1</i> is specifically detectable in meristematic layer 2-derived cells of the early anther, and <i>osers1</i> anthers exhibit overproliferation and dis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ization of layer 2-derived cells, producing fused lobes and extra germ cells in early anthers. The conserved biochemical function of OsERS1 in ligating glutamate to tRNA<sup>Glu</sup> is enhanced by its cofactor aaRS OsARC. Furthermore, metabolomics profiling revealed that OsERS1 is an important node for multiple metabolic pathways, indicated by the accumulation of amino acids and tricarboxylic acid cycle components in <i>osers1</i> anthers. Notably, the anther defects of the <i>osers1</i> mutant are causally associated with the abnormal accumulation of hydrogen peroxide, which can reconstitute the <i>osers1</i> phenotype when applied to wild-type anthers. Collectively, these findings demonstrate how aaRSs affect male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong> development in plants, likely through protein synthesis, metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s, and redox status.</p>

Selective Targeting of Mobile mRNAs to Plasmodesmata for Cell-to-Cell Movement
<p>Many plant mRNAs move from cell to cell or long distance to execute non-cell-autonomous functions. These mobile mRNAs traffic through the phloem to regulate many developmental processes, but despite the burgeoning discovery of mobile mRNAs, little is known about the mechanism underlying the intracellular sorting of these mRNAs. Here, we exploited a fluorescence-based mRNA labeling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, using the bacteriophage coat protein MS2, fused to GFP (MS2-GFP) and an MS2 recognition site in the RNA of interest, to visualize the intracellular trafficking of mobile mRNAs in living plant cells of <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. We first improved this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> by using the nuclear localization sequence from FD, which substantially reduced the fluorescent background of MS2-GFP in the cytoplasm. The modified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> allowed us to observe the cytoplasmic fluorescent foci dependent on MS2-binding sites. Coexpressing the MS2-GFP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> with a virus movement protein, which is a plasmodesmata (PD)-localized nonspecific RNA-binding protein, targeted cytoplasmic fluorescent foci to the PD, suggesting that the cytoplasmic fluorescent foci contain mRNA and MS2-GFP. Our ex vivo RNA imaging revealed that mobile but not nonmobile mRNAs were selectively targeted to PD. Real-time images of intracellular translocation revealed that the translocation of mRNA and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>elles in the transvacuolar strands may be governed by the same mechanism. Our study suggests that PD targeting of mRNA is a selective step in determining mRNA cell-to-cell movement of mRNAs.</p>

Rice Morphology Determinant-Mediated Actin Filament Organization Contributes to Pollen Tube Growth
<p>For successful fertilization in angiosperms, rapid tip growth in pollen tubes delivers the male gamete into the ovules.

However, the mechanism underlying the polarity of the actin filament (F-actin) array and behaviors in pollen tube growth remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that an actin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>izing protein, Rice Morphology Determinant (RMD), a type II formin from rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), controls pollen tube growth by modulating the polarity and distribution of the F-actin array. The rice <i>rmd</i> mutant exhibits abnormal pollen tube growth and a decreased germination rate of the pollen grain in vitro and in vivo. The <i>rmd</i> pollen tubes display a dis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ized F-actin pattern with disrupted apical actin density and shank longitudinal cable direction/arrangement, indicating the novel role of RMD in F-actin polarity during tip growth. Consistent with this role, RMD localizes at the tip of the rice pollen tube, which is essential for pollen tube growth and polarity as well as F-actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ization. Furthermore, the direction and characteristics of the RMD-guided F-actin array positively regulate the deposition of cell wall components and the pattern and velocity of cytoplasmic streaming during rice pollen tube growth. Collectively, our results suggest that RMD is essential for the spatial regulation of pollen tube growth via modulating F-actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ization and array orientation in rice. This work provides insights into tip-focused cell growth and polarity.</p>

A New Barley Stripe Mosaic Virus Allows Large Protein Overexpression for Rapid Function Analysis
<p>Understanding the genetic and molecular bases of gene function is of increasing importance to harness their potential to produce plants with novel traits. One important objective is the improvement of plant productivity to meet future demands in food crop production. Gene function is mostly characterized through overexpression or silencing in transgenic plants. This approach is a lengthy procedure, especially in cereals. Plant viral expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s can be used for rapid expression of proteins. However, current <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s have a small cargo capacity and have mostly been used for gene silencing. Here, a four-component barley stripe mosaic virus-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> with high cargo capacity was constructed for the rapid and stable expression of recombinant proteins in different plant species, allowing function analyses at different stages of development. Fluorescent marker proteins are expressed at high levels within 1 week, and a proof of efficient function analysis is shown using the aluminum malate transporter1 gene. In addition to the ability of gene cotransformation, this work demonstrates that the four-component barley stripe mosaic virus-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> allows the overexpression of cDNAs of up to 2,100 nucleotides (encoding a protein of ∼78 kD), thereby providing an invaluable tool to accelerate functional genomics and proteomic research in monocot and dicot species.</p>

Converging Light, Energy and Hormonal Signaling Control Meristem Activity, Leaf Initiation, and Growth<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>The development of leaf primordia is subject to light control of meristematic activity. Light regulates the expression of thousands of genes with roles in cell proliferation, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong> development, and differentiation of photosynthetic cells. Previous work has highlighted roles for hormone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s and the energy-dependent Target of Rapamycin (TOR) kinase in meristematic activity, yet a picture of how these two regulatory mechanisms depend on light perception and interact with each other has yet to emerge. Their relevance beyond leaf initiation also is unclear. Here, we report the discovery that the dark-arrested meristematic region of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) experiences a local energy deprivation state and confirm previous findings that the PIN1 auxin transporter is diffusely localized in the dark. Light triggers a rapid removal of the starvation state and the establishment of PIN1 polar membrane localization consistent with auxin export, both preceding the induction of cell cycle- and cytoplasmic growth-associated genes. We demonstrate that shoot meristematic activity can occur in the dark through the manipulation of auxin and cytokinin activity as well as through the activation of energy signaling, both targets of photomorphogenesis action, but the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong> developmental outcomes differ: while TOR-dependent energy signals alone stimulate cell proliferation, the development of a normal leaf lamina requires photomorphogenesis-like hormonal responses. We further show that energy signaling adjusts the extent of cell cycle activity and growth of young leaves non-cellautonomously to available photosynthates and leads to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>s constituted of a greater number of cells developing under higher irradiance. This makes energy signaling perhaps the most important biomass growth determinant under natural, unstressed conditions.</p>

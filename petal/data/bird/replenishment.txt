Load-induced changes in bone stiffness and cancellous and cortical bone mass following tibial compression diminish with age in female mice
<p>The vertebrate skeleton is an adaptive structure that responds to mechanical stimuli by increasing bone mass under increased mechanical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>s. Although experimental animal models have shown the anabolic cortical bone response to applied <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong> decreases with age, no consensus exists regarding whether this adaptive mechanism is affected by age in cancellous bone, the tissue most impacted by age-related bone loss. We used an established murine <i>in vivo</i> tibial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing model to characterize the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>-induced cancellous, cortical and whole-bone responses to mechanical stimuli in growing and mature female mice at 6, 10 and 16 weeks of age. The effects of applied <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong> on tibial morphology and stiffness were determined using microcomputed tomography and <i>in vivo</i> bone strains measured at the medial tibial midshaft during applied <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing. At all ages, 2 weeks of applied <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong> produced larger midshaft cortical cross-sectional properties (+13–72%) and greater cancellous bone volume (+21–107%) and thicker trabeculae (+31–68%) in the proximal metaphyses of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ed tibiae. The relative anabolic response decreased from 6 to 16 weeks of age in both the cancellous and cortical envelopes. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>-induced tibial stresses decreased more in 6-week-old mice following <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing, which corresponded to increased <i>in vivo</i> tibial stiffness. Stiffness in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ed tibiae of 16-week-old mice decreased despite moderately increased cortical cross-sectional geometry, suggesting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>-induced changes in bone material properties. This study shows that the cancellous and cortical anabolic responses to mechanical stimuli decline with age into adulthood and that cortical cross-sectional geometry alone does not necessarily predict whole-bone functional stiffness.</p>

Storage Compartments for Capillary Water Rarely Refill in an Intact Woody Plant
<p>Water storage is thought to play an integral role in the maintenance of whole-plant water balance. The contribution of both living and dead cells to water storage can be derived from rehydration and water-release curves on excised plant material, but the underlying tissue-specific emptying/re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fill</span></strong>ing dynamics remain unclear. Here, we used x-ray computed microtomography to characterize the re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fill</span></strong>ing of xylem fibers, pith cells, and vessels under both excised and in vivo conditions in <i>Laurus nobilis</i>. In excised stems supplied with water, water uptake exhibited a biphasic response curve, and x-ray computed microtomography images showed that high water storage capacitance was associated with fiber and pith re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fill</span></strong>ing as driven by capillary forces: fibers re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fill</span></strong>ed more rapidly than pith cells, while vessel re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fill</span></strong>ing was minimal. In excised stems that were sealed, fiber and pith re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fill</span></strong>ing was associated with vessel emptying, indicating a link between tissue connectivity and water storage. In contrast, re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fill</span></strong>ing of fibers, pith cells, and vessels was negligible in intact saplings over two time scales, 24 h and 3 weeks. However, those compartments did re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fill</span></strong> slowly when the shoot was covered to prevent transpiration. Collectively, our data (1) provide direct evidence that storage compartments for capillary water re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fill</span></strong> in excised stems but rarely under in vivo conditions, (2) highlight that estimates of capacitance from excised samples should be interpreted with caution, as certain storage compartments may not be utilized in the intact plant, and (3) question the paradigm that fibers play a substantial role in daily discharge/recharge of stem capacitance in an intact tree.</p>

Bidirectional eukaryotic DNA replication is established by quasi-symmetrical helicase loading
<p>Bidirectional replication from eukaryotic DNA replication origins requires the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing of two ring-shaped minichromosome maintenance (MCM) helicases around DNA in opposite orientations. MCM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing is orchestrated by binding of the origin recognition complex (ORC) to DNA, but how ORC coordinates symmetrical MCM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing is unclear. We used natural budding yeast DNA replication origins and synthetic DNA sequences to show that efficient MCM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing requires binding of two ORC molecules to two ORC binding sites. The relative orientation of these sites, but not the distance between them, was found to be critical for MCM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing in vitro and origin function in vivo. We propose that quasi-symmetrical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing of individual MCM hexamers by ORC and directed MCM translocation into double hexamers acts as a unifying mechanism for the establishment of bidirectional replication in archaea and eukaryotes.</p>

Direct Comparison of Leaf Plasmodesma Structure and Function in Relation to Phloem-Loading Type
<p>The export of photosynthetically produced sugars from leaves depends on plasmodesmatal transport of sugar molecules from mesophyll to phloem. Traditionally, the density of plasmodesmata (PD) along this phloem-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing pathway has been used as a defining feature of different phloem-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing types, with species proposed to have either many or few PD between the phloem and surrounding cells of the leaf. However, quantitative determination of PD density has rarely been performed. Moreover, the structure of PD has not been considered, even though it could impact permeability, and functional data are only available for very few species. Here, a comparison of PD density, structure, and function using data from transmission electron microscopy and live-cell microscopy was conducted for all relevant cell–cell interfaces in leaves of nine species. These species represent the three principal phloem-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing types currently discussed in literature. Results show that relative PD density among the different cell-cell interfaces in one species, but not absolute PD density, is indicative of phloem-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing type. PD density data of single interfaces, even combined with PD diameter and length data, did not correlate with the intercellular diffusion capacity measured by the fluorescence loss in photobleaching method. This means that PD substructure not visible on standard transmission electron micrographs may have a strong influence on permeability. Furthermore, the results support a proposed passive symplasmic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing mechanism in the tree species horse chestnut (<i>Aesculus hippocastanum</i>), white birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>), orchard apple (<i>Malus domestica</i>), and gray poplar (<i>Populus x canescens</i>) as functional cell coupling and PD structure differed from active symplasmic and apoplasmic phloem-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing species.</p>

An atom-by-atom assembler of defect-free arbitrary two-dimensional atomic arrays
<p>Large arrays of individually controlled atoms trapped in optical tweezers are a very promising platform for quantum engineering applications. However, deterministic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing of the traps is experimentally challenging. We demonstrate the preparation of fully <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ed two-dimensional arrays of up to ~50 microtraps, each containing a single atom and arranged in arbitrary geometries. Starting from initially larger, half-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fill</span></strong>ed matrices of randomly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ed traps, we obtain user-defined target arrays at unit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fill</span></strong>ing. This is achieved with a real-time control system and a moving optical tweezers, which together enable a sequence of rapid atom moves depending on the initial distribution of the atoms in the arrays. These results open exciting prospects for quantum engineering with neutral atoms in tunable two-dimensional geometries.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Phloem Loading through Plasmodesmata: A Biophysical Analysis
<p>In many species, Suc en route out of the leaf migrates from photosynthetically active mesophyll cells into the phloem down its concentration gradient via plasmodesmata, i.e. symplastically. In some of these plants, the process is entirely passive, but in others phloem Suc is actively converted into larger sugars, raffinose and stachyose, and segregated (trapped), thus raising total phloem sugar concentration to a level higher than in the mesophyll. Questions remain regarding the mechanisms and selective advantages conferred by both of these symplastic-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing processes. Here, we present an integrated model—including local and global transport and kinetics of polymerization—for passive and active symplastic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing. We also propose a physical model of transport through the plasmodesmata. With these models, we predict that (1) relative to passive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing, polymerization of Suc in the phloem, even in the absence of segregation, lowers the sugar content in the leaf required to achieve a given export rate and accelerates export for a given concentration of Suc in the mesophyll and (2) segregation of oligomers and the inverted gradient of total sugar content can be achieved for physiologically reasonable parameter values, but even higher export rates can be accessed in scenarios in which polymers are allowed to diffuse back into the mesophyll. We discuss these predictions in relation to further studies aimed at the clarification of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing mechanisms, fitness of active and passive symplastic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing, and potential targets for engineering improved rates of export.</p>

Sucrose Transporter <i>ZmSut1</i> Expression and Localization Uncover New Insights into Sucrose Phloem Loading
<p>Sucrose transporters (SUTs) translocate sucrose (Suc) across cellular membranes, and in eudicots, multiple SUTs are known to function in Suc phloem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing in leaves. In maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), the <i>Sucrose Transporter1</i> (<i>ZmSut1</i>) gene has been implicated in Suc phloem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing based upon RNA expression in leaves, electrophysiological experiments, and phenotypic analysis of <i>zmsut1</i> mutant plants. However, no previous studies have examined the cellular expression of <i>ZmSut1</i> RNA or the subcellular localization of the ZmSUT1 protein to assess the gene’s hypothesized function in Suc phloem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing or to evaluate its potential roles, such as phloem un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing, in nonphotosynthetic tissues. To this end, we performed RNA in situ hybridization experiments, promoter-reporter gene analyses, and ZmSUT1 localization studies to elucidate the cellular expression pattern of the <i>ZmSut1</i> transcript and protein. These data showed that <i>ZmSut1</i> was expressed in multiple cell types throughout the plant and indicated that it functions in phloem companion cells to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong> Suc and also in other cell types to retrieve Suc from the apoplasm to prevent its accumulation and loss to the transpiration stream. Additionally, by comparing a phloem-mobile tracer with <i>ZmSut1</i> expression, we determined that developing maize leaves dynamically switch from symplasmic to apoplasmic phloem un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing, reconciling previously conflicting reports, and suggest that <i>ZmSut1</i> does not have an apparent function in either un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing process. A model for the dual roles for <i>ZmSut1</i> function (phloem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing and apoplasmic recycling), <i>Sut1</i> evolution, and its possible use to enhance Suc export from leaves in engineering C<sub>3</sub> grasses for C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis is discussed.</p>

Gastrointestinal and renal responses to variable water intake in whitebellied sunbirds and New Holland honeyeaters
<p>Nectarivores face a constant challenge in terms of water balance, experiencing water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing or dehydration when switching between food plants or between feeding and fasting. To understand how whitebellied sunbirds and New Holland honeyeaters meet the challenges of varying preformed water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>, we used the elimination of intramuscular-injected [<sup>14</sup>C]-<sc>l</sc>-glucose and <sup>3</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O to quantify intestinal and renal water handling on diets varying in sugar concentration. Both sunbirds and honeyeaters showed significant modulation of intestinal water absorption, allowing excess water to be shunted through the intestine when on dilute diets. Despite reducing their fractional water absorption, both species showed linear increases in water flux and fractional body water turnover as water intake increased (both afternoon and morning), suggesting that the modulation of fractional water absorption was not sufficient to completely offset dietary water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>s. In both species, glomerular filtration rate was independent of water gain (but was higher for the afternoon), as was renal fractional water reabsorption (measured in the afternoon). During the natural overnight fast, both sunbirds and honeyeaters arrested whole kidney function. Evaporative water loss in sunbirds was variable but correlated with water gain. Both sunbirds and honeyeaters appear to modulate intestinal water absorption as an important component of water regulation to help deal with massive preformed water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>s. Shutting down glomerular filtration rate during the overnight fast is another way of saving energy for osmoregulatory function. Birds maintain osmotic balance on diets varying markedly in preformed water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong> by varying both intestinal water absorption and excretion through the intestine and kidneys.</p>

Twenty-Year Outcome After Mitral Repair Versus Replacement for Severe Degenerative Mitral Regurgitation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Mitral valve (MV) repair is preferred over <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">replac</span></strong>ement in clinical guidelines and is an important determinant of the indication for surgery in degenerative mitral regurgitation. However, the level of evidence supporting current recommendations is low, and recent data cast doubts on its validity in the current era. Accordingly, the aim of the present study was to analyze very long-term outcome after MV repair and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">replac</span></strong>ement for degenerative mitral regurgitation with a flail leaflet.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>MIDA (Mitral Regurgitation International Database) is a multicenter registry enrolling patients with degenerative mitral regurgitation with a flail leaflet in 6 tertiary European and US centers. We analyzed the outcome after MV repair (n=1709) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">replac</span></strong>ement (n=213) overall, by propensity score matching, and by inverse probability-of-treatment weighting.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>At baseline, patients undergoing MV repair were younger, had more comorbidities, and were more likely to present with a posterior leaflet prolapse than those undergoing MV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">replac</span></strong>ement. After propensity score matching and inverse probability-of-treatment weighting, the 2 treatments groups were balanced, and absolute standardized differences were usually <10%, indicating adequate match. Operative mortality (defined as a death occurring within 30 days from surgery or during the same hospitalization) was lower after MV repair than after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">replac</span></strong>ement in both the entire population (1.3% versus 4.7%; <i>P</i><0.001) and the propensity-matched population (0.2% versus 4.4%; <i>P</i><0.001). During a mean follow-up of 9.2 years, 552 deaths were observed, of which 207 were of cardiovascular origin. Twenty-year survival was better after MV repair than after MV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">replac</span></strong>ement in both the entire population (46% versus 23%; <i>P</i><0.001) and the matched population (41% versus 24%; <i>P</i><0.001).

Spatially structured cell populations process multiple sensory signals in parallel in intact vascular endothelium
<p>Blood flow, blood clotting, angiogenesis, vascular permeability, and vascular remodeling are each controlled by a large number of variable, noisy, and interacting chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">input</span></strong>s to the vascular endothelium. The endothelium processes the entirety of the chemical composition to which the cardiovascular system is exposed, carrying out sophisticated computations that determine physiological output. Processing this enormous quantity of information is a major challenge facing the endothelium. We analyzed the responses of hundreds of endothelial cells to carbachol (CCh) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and found that the endothelium segregates the responses to these two distinct components of the chemical environment into separate streams of complementary information that are processed in parallel. Sensitivities to CCh and ATP mapped to different clusters of cells, and each agonist generated distinct signal patterns. The distinct signals were features of agonist activation rather than properties of the cells themselves. When there was more than one stimulus present, the cells communicated and combined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">input</span></strong>s to generate new distinct signals that were nonlinear combinations of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">input</span></strong>s. Our results demonstrate that the endothelium is a structured, collaborative sensory network that simplifies the complex environment using separate cell clusters that are sensitive to distinct aspects of the overall biochemical environment and interactively compute signals from diverse but interrelated chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">input</span></strong>s. These features enable the endothelium to selectively process separate signals and perform multiple computations in an environment that is noisy and variable.</p>

Observation of fractional Chern insulators in a van der Waals heterostructure

Seasonal water storage, stress modulation, and California seismicity

Spatiotemporal Coupling of Vessel Cavitation and Discharge of Stored Xylem Water in a Tree Sapling
<p>Water discharge from stem internal storage compartments is thought to minimize the risk of vessel cavitation. Based on this concept, one would expect that water storage compartments involved in the buffering of xylem tensions empty before the onset of vessel cavitation under drought stress, and potentially re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fill</span></strong> after soil saturation. However, scant in vivo data exist that elucidate this localized spatiotemporal coupling. In this study on intact saplings of American chestnut (<i>Castanea dentata</i>), x-ray computed microtomography (microCT) showed that the xylem matrix surrounding vessels releases stored water and becomes air-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fill</span></strong>ed either concurrent to or after vessel cavitation under progressive drought stress. Among annual growth rings, the xylem matrix of the current year remained largely water-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fill</span></strong>ed even under severe drought stress. In comparison, microtomography images collected on excised stems showed that applied pressures of much greater than 0 MPa were required to induce water release from the xylem matrix. Viability staining highlighted that water release from the xylem matrix was associated primarily with emptying of dead fibers. Re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fill</span></strong>ing of the xylem matrix and vessels was detected in intact saplings when the canopy was bagged and stem water potential was close to 0 MPa, and in leafless saplings over the winter period. In conclusion, this study indicates that the bulk of water stored in the xylem matrix is released after the onset of vessel cavitation, and suggests that capillary water contributes to overall stem water storage under drought but is not used primarily for the prevention of drought-induced vessel cavitation in this species.</p>

High-Sensitive Cardiac Troponin T as an Early Biochemical Signature for Clinical and Subclinical Heart Failure

Genetic diversity of tumors with mismatch repair deficiency influences anti–PD-1 immunotherapy response
<p>Tumors with mismatch repair deficiency (MMR-d) are characterized by sequence alterations in microsatellites and can accumulate thousands of mutations. This high mutational burden renders tumors immunogenic and sensitive to programmed cell death–1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitors. Yet, despite their tumor immunogenicity, patients with MMR-deficient tumors experience highly variable responses, and roughly half are refractory to treatment. We present experimental and clinical evidence showing that the degree of microsatellite instability (MSI) and resultant mutational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>, in part, underlies the variable response to PD-1 blockade immunotherapy in MMR-d human and mouse tumors. The extent of response is particularly associated with the accumulation of insertion-deletion (indel) mutational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>. This study provides a rationale for the genome-wide characterization of MSI intensity and mutational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong> to better profile responses to anti–PD-1 immunotherapy across MMR-deficient human cancers.</p>

A collicular visual cortex: Neocortical space for an ancient midbrain visual structure
<p>Visual responses in the cerebral cortex are believed to rely on the geniculate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">input</span></strong> to the primary visual cortex (V1). Indeed, V1 lesions substantially reduce visual responses throughout the cortex. Visual information enters the cortex also through the superior colliculus (SC), but the function of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">input</span></strong> on visual responses in the cortex is less clear. SC lesions affect cortical visual responses less than V1 lesions, and no visual cortical area appears to entirely rely on SC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">input</span></strong>s. We show that visual responses in a mouse lateral visual cortical area called the postrhinal cortex are independent of V1 and are abolished upon silencing of the SC. This area outperforms V1 in discriminating moving objects. We thus identify a collicular primary visual cortex that is independent of the geniculo-cortical pathway and is capable of motion discrimination.</p>

Legacy nitrogen may prevent achievement of water quality goals in the Gulf of Mexico
<p>In August 2017, the Gulf of Mexico’s hypoxic zone was declared to be the largest ever measured. It has been estimated that a 60% decrease in watershed nitrogen (N) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing may be necessary to adequately reduce eutrophication in the Gulf. However, to date there has been no rigorous assessment of the effect of N legacies on achieving water quality goals. In this study, we show that even if agricultural N use became 100% efficient, it would take decades to meet target N <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>s due to legacy N within the Mississippi River basin. Our results suggest that both long-term commitment and large-scale changes in agricultural management practices will be necessary to decrease Mississippi N <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>s and to meet current goals for reducing the size of the Gulf hypoxic zone.</p>

Behavioral time scale synaptic plasticity underlies CA1 place fields
<p>Learning is primarily mediated by activity-dependent modifications of synaptic strength within neuronal circuits. We discovered that place fields in hippocampal area CA1 are produced by a synaptic potentiation notably different from Hebbian plasticity. Place fields could be produced in vivo in a single trial by potentiation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">input</span></strong> that arrived seconds before and after complex spiking. The potentiated synaptic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">input</span></strong> was not initially coincident with action potentials or depolarization. This rule, named behavioral time scale synaptic plasticity, abruptly modifies <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">input</span></strong>s that were neither causal nor close in time to postsynaptic activation. In slices, five pairings of subthreshold presynaptic activity and calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) plateau potentials produced a large potentiation with an asymmetric seconds-long time course. This plasticity efficiently stores entire behavioral sequences within synaptic weights to produce predictive place cell activity.</p>

Eutrophication will increase during the 21st century as a result of precipitation changes
<p>Eutrophication, or excessive nutrient enrichment, threatens water resources across the globe. We show that climate change–induced precipitation changes alone will substantially increase (19 ± 14%) riverine total nitrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing within the continental United States by the end of the century for the “business-as-usual” scenario. The impacts, driven by projected increases in both total and extreme precipitation, will be especially strong for the Northeast and the corn belt of the United States. Offsetting this increase would require a 33 ± 24% reduction in nitrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">input</span></strong>s, representing a massive management challenge. Globally, changes in precipitation are especially likely to also exacerbate eutrophication in India, China, and Southeast Asia. It is therefore imperative that water quality management strategies account for the impact of projected future changes in precipitation on nitrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing.</p>

Decoding of position in the developing neural tube from antiparallel morphogen gradients
<p>Like many developing tissues, the vertebrate neural tube is patterned by antiparallel morphogen gradients. To understand how these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">input</span></strong>s are interpreted, we measured morphogen signaling and target gene expression in mouse embryos and chick ex vivo assays. From these data, we derived and validated a characteristic decoding map that relates morphogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">input</span></strong> to the positional identity of neural progenitors. Analysis of the observed responses indicates that the underlying interpretation strategy minimizes patterning errors in response to the joint <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">input</span></strong> of noisy opposing gradients. We reverse-engineered a transcriptional network that provides a mechanistic basis for the observed cell fate decisions and accounts for the precision and dynamics of pattern formation. Together, our data link opposing gradient dynamics in a growing tissue to precise pattern formation.</p>

Three-dimensional holey-graphene/niobia composite architectures for ultrahigh-rate energy storage
<p>Nanostructured materials have shown extraordinary promise for electrochemical energy storage but are usually limited to electrodes with rather low mass <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing (~1 milligram per square centimeter) because of the increasing ion diffusion limitations in thicker electrodes. We report the design of a three-dimensional (3D) holey-graphene/niobia (Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) composite for ultrahigh-rate energy storage at practical levels of mass <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing (>10 milligrams per square centimeter). The highly interconnected graphene network in the 3D architecture provides excellent electron transport properties, and its hierarchical porous structure facilitates rapid ion transport. By systematically tailoring the porosity in the holey graphene backbone, charge transport in the composite architecture is optimized to deliver high areal capacity and high-rate capability at high mass <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing, which represents a critical step forward toward practical applications.</p>

Mediolateral force distribution at the knee joint shifts across activities and is driven by tibiofemoral alignment
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Tibiofemoral alignment is important to determine the rate of   progression of osteoarthritis and implant survival after total knee   arthroplasty (TKA). Normally, surgeons aim for neutral tibiofemoral   alignment following TKA, but this has been questioned in recent   years. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether varus or valgus   alignment indeed leads to increased medial or lateral tibiofemoral   forces during static and dynamic weight-bearing activities.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Tibiofemoral contact forces and moments were measured in nine   patients with instrumented knee implants. Medial force ratios were   analysed during nine daily activities, including activities with   single-limb support (e.g. walking) and double-limb support (e.g.   knee bend). Hip-knee-ankle angles in the frontal plane were analysed   using full-leg coronal radiographs. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The medial force ratio strongly correlated with the tibiofemoral   alignment in the static condition of one-legged stance (R² = 0.88)   and dynamic single-limb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing (R² = 0.59) with varus malalignment   leading to increased medial force ratios of up to 88%. In contrast,   the correlation between leg alignment and magnitude of medial compartment force   was much less pronounced. A lateral shift of force occurred during   activities with double-limb support and higher knee flexion angles. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The medial force ratio depends on both the tibiofemoral alignment   and the nature of the activity involved. It cannot be generalised   to a single value. Higher medial ratios during single-limb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing   are associated with varus malalignment in TKA. The current trend   towards a ‘constitutional varus’ after joint <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">replac</span></strong>ement, in terms   of overall tibiofemoral alignment, should be considered carefully   with respect to the increased medial force ratio.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:779–87.</p></sec>

Assessing treatment outcomes using a single question
<p>Satisfaction with care is important to both patients   and to those who pay for it. The Net Promoter Score (NPS), widely   used in the service industries, has been introduced into the NHS   as the ‘friends and family test’; an overarching measure of patient   satisfaction. It assesses the likelihood of the patient recommending   the healthcare received to another, and is seen as a discriminator   of healthcare performance. We prospectively assessed 6186 individuals   undergoing primary lower limb joint <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">replac</span></strong>ement at a single university   hospital to determine the Net Promoter Score for joint <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">replac</span></strong>ements   and to evaluate which factors contributed to the response. </p><p>Achieving pain relief (odds ratio (OR) 2.13, confidence interval   (CI) 1.83 to 2.49), the meeting of pre-operative expectation (OR   2.57, CI 2.24 to 2.97), and the hospital experience (OR 2.33, CI   2.03 to 2.68) are the domains that explain whether a patient would   recommend joint <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">replac</span></strong>ement services. These three factors, combined   with the type of surgery undertaken (OR 2.31, CI 1.68 to 3.17),   drove a predictive model that was able to explain 95% of the variation   in the patient’s recommendation response. Though intuitively similar,   this ‘recommendation’ metric was found to be materially different   to satisfaction responses. The difference between THR (NPS 71) and   TKR (NPS 49) suggests that no overarching score for a department   should be used without an adjustment for case mix. However, the   Net Promoter Score does measure a further important dimension to   our existing metrics: the patient experience of healthcare delivery.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014;96-B:622–8.</p>

Hemiarthroplasty proximal femoral endoprostheses following tumour reconstruction
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Dislocation rates are reportedly lower in patients requiring   proximal femoral hemiarthroplasty than for patients undergoing hip   arthroplasty for neoplasia.

Hemodynamic and Echocardiographic Comparison of the Lotus and CoreValve Transcatheter Aortic Valves in Patients With High and Extreme Surgical Risk
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Comparative echocardiographic data on transcatheter aortic valve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">replac</span></strong>ement systems from randomized trials are limited. The REPRISE III trial (Repositionable Percutaneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">replac</span></strong>ement of Stenotic Aortic Valve through Implantation of Lotus Valve System – Randomized Clinical Evaluation) is a multicenter, randomized comparison of a mechanically expanded (Lotus) versus self-expanding (CoreValve) transcatheter aortic valve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">replac</span></strong>ement device. This analysis rigorously assesses Doppler-derived valve hemodynamics and the impact on outcomes at 1 year in patients with extreme/high surgical risk treated with Lotus and CoreValve from REPRISE III.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>REPRISE III includes patients with extreme- and high-risk aortic stenosis. Patients were enrolled at 55 centers. All transthoracic echocardiograms with Doppler were obtained following a standard protocol up to 12 months postimplant and analyzed by a core laboratory. Valve size, mean gradient, aortic valve area, and Doppler velocity index and their impact on clinical outcomes are reported. Additional parameters including paravalvular leak were evaluated using a multiparametric approach.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 912 patients were randomly assigned (2:1 ratio; 607 Lotus:305 CoreValve). Median age was 84 years, 51% of the patients were women, and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons score was 6.8±4.1. CoreValve demonstrated lower gradients and larger aortic valve area and Doppler velocity index than Lotus at discharge; the difference decreased in subsequent follow-up up to a year (all <i>P</i><0.01). Lotus had lower rates of paravalvular leak that persisted over time (<i>P</i><0.05). Similar outcomes were seen when comparing each valve type by size group (small, medium, large). The hemodynamic differences between valves did not translate into worse clinical outcomes. All-cause mortality was not different between the 2 groups in any of the 3 valve sizes. When comparing patients with normal valve gradients (<20 mm Hg, n=780) with those with abnormal gradients (>20 mm Hg, n=48) in the entire patient population, all-cause mortality was not different. This was also not significant when evaluating each valve type separately.

Protective Effects of Ticagrelor on Myocardial Injury After Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor antagonist ticagrelor has been shown to be clinically superior to clopidogrel. Although the underlying mechanisms remain elusive, ticagrelor may exert off-target effects through adenosine-related mechanisms. We aimed to investigate whether ticagrelor reduces myocardial injury to a greater extent than clopidogrel after myocardial infarction (MI) at a similar level of platelet inhibition and to determine the underlying mechanisms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Pigs received the following before MI induction: (1) placebo-control; (2) a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing dose of clopidogrel (600 mg); (3) a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing dose of ticagrelor (180 mg); or (4) a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing dose of ticagrelor followed by an adenosine A1/A2-receptor antagonist [8-(<i>p</i>-sulfophenyl)theophylline, 4 mg/kg intravenous] to determine the potential contribution of adenosine in ticagrelor-related cardioprotection. Animals received the corresponding maintenance doses of the antiplatelet agents during the following 24 hours and underwent 3T-cardiac MRI analysis. Platelet inhibition was monitored by ADP-induced platelet aggregation. In the myocardium, we assessed the expression and activation of proteins known to modulate edema formation, including aquaporin-4 and AMP-activated protein kinase and its downstream effectors CD36 and endothelial nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Clopidogrel and ticagrelor exerted a high and consistent antiplatelet effect (68.2% and 62.2% of platelet inhibition, respectively, on challenge with 20 μmol/L ADP) that persisted up to 24 hours post-MI (<i>P</i><0.05). All groups showed comparable myocardial area-at-risk and cardiac worsening after MI induction. 3T-Cardiac MRI analysis revealed that clopidogrel- and ticagrelor-treated animals had a significantly smaller extent of MI than placebo-control animals (15.7 g left ventricle and 12.0 g left ventricle versus 22.8 g left ventricle, respectively). Yet, ticagrelor reduced infarct size to a significantly greater extent than clopidogrel (further 23.5% reduction; <i>P</i>=0.0026), an effect supported by troponin-I assessment and histopathologic analysis (<i>P</i>=0.0021). Furthermore, in comparison with clopidogrel, ticagrelor significantly diminished myocardial edema by 24.5% (<i>P</i>=0.004), which correlated with infarct mass (<i>r</i>=0.73; <i>P</i><0.001). 8-(<i>p</i>-Sulfophenyl)theophylline administration abolished the cardioprotective effects of ticagrelor over clopidogrel. At a molecular level, aquaporin-4 expression decreased and the expression and activation of AMP-activated protein kinase signaling and cyclooxygenase-2 increased in the ischemic myocardium of ticagrelor- versus clopidogrel-treated animals (<i>P</i><0.05). These protein changes were not observed in those animals administered the adenosine receptor blocker 8-(<i>p</i>-sulfophenyl)theophylline.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Ticagrelor, beyond its antiplatelet efficacy, exerts cardioprotective effects by reducing necrotic injury and edema formation via adenosine-dependent mechanisms.</p></sec>

Inverse-designed metastructures that solve equations
<p>Metastructures hold the potential to bring a new twist to the field of spatial-domain optical analog computing: migrating from free-space and bulky systems into conceptually wavelength-sized elements. We introduce a metamaterial platform capable of solving integral equations using monochromatic electromagnetic fields. For an arbitrary wave as the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">input</span></strong> function to an equation associated with a prescribed integral operator, the solution of such an equation is generated as a complex-valued output electromagnetic field. Our approach is experimentally demonstrated at microwave frequencies through solving a generic integral equation and using a set of waveguides as the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">input</span></strong> and output to the designed metastructures. By exploiting subwavelength-scale light-matter interactions in a metamaterial platform, our wave-based, material-based analog computer may provide a route to achieve chip-scale, fast, and integrable computing elements.</p>

Crystal structure of a TAPBPR–MHC I complex reveals the mechanism of peptide editing in antigen presentation
<p>Central to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell–mediated immunity is the recognition of peptide–major histocompatibility complex class I (p–MHC I) proteins displayed by antigen-presenting cells. Chaperone-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing of high-affinity peptides onto MHC I is a key step in the MHC I antigen presentation pathway. However, the structure of MHC I with a chaperone that facilitates peptide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing has not been determined. We report the crystal structure of MHC I in complex with the peptide editor TAPBPR (TAP-binding protein–related), a tapasin homolog. TAPBPR remodels the peptide-binding groove of MHC I, resulting in the release of low-affinity peptide. Changes include groove relaxation, modifications of key binding pockets, and domain adjustments. This structure captures a peptide-receptive state of MHC I and provides insights into the mechanism of peptide editing by TAPBPR and, by analogy, tapasin.</p>

Interacting amino acid replacements allow poison frogs to evolve epibatidine resistance
<p>Animals that wield toxins face self-intoxication. Poison frogs have a diverse arsenal of defensive alkaloids that target the nervous system. Among them is epibatidine, a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonist that is lethal at microgram doses. Epibatidine shares a highly conserved binding site with acetylcholine, making it difficult to evolve resistance yet maintain nAChR function. Electrophysiological assays of human and frog nAChR revealed that one amino acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">replac</span></strong>ement, which evolved three times in poison frogs, decreased epibatidine sensitivity but at a cost of acetylcholine sensitivity. However, receptor functionality was rescued by additional amino acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">replac</span></strong>ements that differed among poison frog lineages.

21st-century rise in anthropogenic nitrogen deposition on a remote coral reef
<p>With the rapid rise in pollution-associated nitrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">input</span></strong>s to the western Pacific, it has been suggested that even the open ocean has been affected. In a coral core from Dongsha Atoll, a remote coral reef ecosystem, we observe a decline in the <sup>15</sup>N/<sup>14</sup>N of coral skeleton–bound organic matter, which signals increased deposition of anthropogenic atmospheric N on the open ocean and its incorporation into plankton and, in turn, the atoll corals. The first clear change occurred just before 2000 CE, decades later than predicted by other work. The amplitude of change suggests that, by 2010, anthropogenic atmospheric N deposition represented 20 ± 5% of the annual N <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">input</span></strong> to the surface ocean in this region, which appears to be at the lower end of other estimates.</p>

Rats and Humans Can Optimally Accumulate Evidence for Decision-Making
<sec><title>How to Make Decisions</title><p>Recently, a number of methods to probe internal properties of nonlinear neural systems have been developed. In these methods, highly variable stimuli are used to explore the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">input</span></strong> space of the system. Neural responses are then studied using models that take advantage of the known trial-by-trial stimulus information. <bold>Brunton <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 95) adapted this combined approach to decision-making. Both in rats and humans, the diffusion constant of the drift-diffusion model of decision-making was zero, implying that the noise is all in the processing of sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">input</span></strong> and not in the evidence accumulator. In addition, rats gradually accumulated evidence for decision-making, with strong effects of sensory adaptation on gradual accumulation of evidence.</p></sec>

Influence of HLA-C Expression Level on HIV Control
<sec><title>Thwarting HIV</title><p>Multiple genome-wide association studies have revealed that human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes of the major histocompatibility complex locus have the strongest impact on HIV. In particular, a single-nucleotide polymorphism 35 base pairs upstream of HLA-C shows significant association with viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong> and protection against HIV. How HLA-C mediates these effects is unknown. <bold>Apps <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 87) now demonstrate that increasing surface expression of HLA-C is associated with reduced viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong> and reduced rate of progression to low CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell counts in African and European Americans. High HLA-C expression likely promoted improved HIV control through a more effective cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response. In contrast to HIV infection, high HLA-C expression was associated with a higher risk of the inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease.</p></sec>

Glycolate Induces Redox Tuning Of Photosystem II in Vivo: Study of a Photorespiration Mutant
<p>Bicarbonate removal from the nonheme iron at the acceptor side of photosystem II (PSII) was shown recently to shift the midpoint potential of the primary quinone acceptor Q<sub>A</sub> to a more positive potential and lowers the yield of singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) production. The presence of Q<sub>A</sub><sup>−</sup> results in weaker binding of bicarbonate, suggesting a redox-based regulatory and protective mechanism where loss of bicarbonate or exchange of bicarbonate by other small carboxylic acids may protect PSII against <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> in vivo under photorespiratory conditions. Here, we compared the properties of Q<sub>A</sub> in the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) photorespiration mutant deficient in peroxisomal HYDROXYPYRUVATE REDUCTASE1 (<i>hpr1-1</i>), which accumulates glycolate in leaves, with the wild type. Photosynthetic electron transport was affected in the mutant, and chlorophyll fluorescence showed slower electron transport between Q<sub>A</sub> and Q<sub>B</sub> in the mutant. Glycolate induced an increase in the temperature maximum of thermoluminescence emission, indicating a shift of the midpoint potential of Q<sub>A</sub> to a more positive value. The yield of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> production was lowered in thylakoid membranes isolated from <i>hpr1-1</i> compared with the wild type, consistent with a higher potential of Q<sub>A</sub>/Q<sub>A</sub><sup>−</sup>. In addition, electron donation to photosystem I was affected in <i>hpr1-1</i> at higher light intensities, consistent with diminished electron transfer out of PSII. This study indicates that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">replac</span></strong>ement of bicarbonate at the nonheme iron by a small carboxylate anion occurs in plants in vivo. These findings suggested that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">replac</span></strong>ement of the bicarbonate on the nonheme iron by glycolate may represent a regulatory mechanism that protects PSII against photooxidative stress under low-CO<sub>2</sub> conditions.</p>

A <i>β</i>-Ketoacyl-CoA Synthase Is Involved in Rice Leaf Cuticular Wax Synthesis and Requires a CER2-LIKE Protein as a Cofactor
<p>Cuticular waxes are complex mixtures of very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) and their derivatives, forming a natural barrier on aerial surfaces of terrestrial plants against biotic and abiotic stresses. In VLCFA biosynthesis, β-ketoacyl-CoA synthase (KCS) is the key enzyme, catalyzing the first reaction in fatty acid elongation and determining substrate specificity. We isolated a rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) <i>wax crystal-sparse leaf 4</i> (<i>WSL4</i>) gene using a map-based cloning strategy. <i>WSL4</i> is predicted to encode a KCS, a homolog of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) CER6. Complementation of the mutant <i>wsl4-1</i> with <i>WSL4</i> genomic DNA rescued the cuticular wax-deficient phenotype, confirming the function of <i>WSL4</i>. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong> of wax components longer than 30 carbons (C30) and C28 were reduced markedly in <i>wsl4-1</i> and <i>wsl4-2</i> mutants, respectively. Overexpression of <i>WSL4</i> increased the cuticular wax <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong> in rice leaves. We further isolated a cofactor of WSL4, OsCER2, a homolog of Arabidopsis CER2, by coimmunoprecipitation and confirmed their physical interaction by split-ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid experiments. Expression of <i>WSL4</i> alone in <i>elo3</i> yeast cells resulted in increased C24 but did not produce VLCFAs of greater length, whereas expressing <i>OsCER2</i> alone showed no effect. Coexpression of <i>WSL4</i> and <i>OsCER2</i> in <i>elo3</i> yeast cells yielded fatty acids up to C30. OsCER2 with a mutated HxxxD motif (H172E, D176A, and D176H) interrupted its interaction with WSL4 and failed to elongate VLCFAs past C24 when expressed with WSL4 in <i>elo3</i> yeast cells. These results demonstrated that WSL4 was involved in VLCFA elongation beyond C22 and that elongation beyond C24 required the participation of OsCER2.</p>

Xylem Surfactants Introduce a New Element to the Cohesion-Tension Theory
<p>Vascular plants transport water under negative pressure without constantly creating gas bubbles that would disable their hydraulic systems. Attempts to replicate this feat in artificial systems almost invariably result in bubble formation, except under highly controlled conditions with pure water and only hydrophilic surfaces present. In theory, conditions in the xylem should favor bubble nucleation even more: there are millions of conduits with at least some hydrophobic surfaces, and xylem sap is saturated or sometimes supersaturated with atmospheric gas and may contain surface-active molecules that can lower surface tension. So how do plants transport water under negative pressure? Here, we show that angiosperm xylem contains abundant hydrophobic surfaces as well as insoluble lipid surfactants, including phospholipids, and proteins, a composition similar to pulmonary surfactants. Lipid surfactants were found in xylem sap and as nanoparticles under transmission electron microscopy in pores of intervessel pit membranes and deposited on vessel wall surfaces. Nanoparticles observed in xylem sap via nanoparticle-tracking analysis included surfactant-coated nanobubbles when examined by freeze-fracture electron microscopy. Based on their fracture behavior, this technique is able to distinguish between dense-core particles, liquid-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fill</span></strong>ed, bilayer-coated vesicles/liposomes, and gas-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fill</span></strong>ed bubbles. Xylem surfactants showed strong surface activity that reduces surface tension to low values when concentrated as they are in pit membrane pores. We hypothesize that xylem surfactants support water transport under negative pressure as explained by the cohesion-tension theory by coating hydrophobic surfaces and nanobubbles, thereby keeping the latter below the critical size at which bubbles would expand to form embolisms.</p>

Evidence for Hydraulic Vulnerability Segmentation and Lack of Xylem Refilling under Tension
<p>The vascular system of grapevine (<i>Vitis</i> spp.) has been reported as being highly vulnerable, even though grapevine regularly experiences seasonal drought. Consequently, stomata would remain open below water potentials that would generate a high loss of stem hydraulic conductivity via xylem embolism. This situation would necessitate daily cycles of embolism repair to restore hydraulic function. However, a more parsimonious explanation is that some hydraulic techniques are prone to artifacts in species with long vessels, leading to the overestimation of vulnerability. The aim of this study was to provide an unbiased assessment of (1) the vulnerability to drought-induced embolism in perennial and annual organs and (2) the ability to re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fill</span></strong> embolized vessels in two <i>Vitis</i> species X-ray micro-computed tomography observations of intact plants indicated that both <i>Vitis</i> <i>vinifera</i> and <i>Vitis</i> <i>riparia</i> were relatively vulnerable, with the pressure inducing 50% loss of stem hydraulic conductivity = −1.7 and −1.3 MPa, respectively. In <i>V. vinifera</i>, both the stem and petiole had similar sigmoidal vulnerability curves but differed in pressure inducing 50% loss of hydraulic conductivity (−1.7 and −1 MPa for stem and petiole, respectively). Re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fill</span></strong>ing was not observed as long as bulk xylem pressure remained negative (e.g. at the apical part of the plants; −0.11 ± 0.02 MPa) and change in percentage loss of conductivity was 0.02% ± 0.01%. However, positive xylem pressure was observed at the basal part of the plant (0.04 ± 0.01 MPa), leading to a recovery of conductance (change in percentage loss of conductivity = −0.24% ± 0.12%). Our findings provide evidence that grapevine is unable to repair embolized xylem vessels under negative pressure, but its hydraulic vulnerability segmentation provides significant protection of the perennial stem.</p>

Y Chromosome Analysis of Dingoes and Southeast Asian Village Dogs Suggests a Neolithic Continental Expansion from Southeast Asia Followed by Multiple Austronesian Dispersals
<p>Dogs originated more than 14,000 BP, but the location(s) where they first arose is uncertain. The earliest archeological evidence of ancient dogs was discovered in Europe and the Middle East, some 5–7 millennia before that from Southeast Asia. However, mitochondrial DNA analyses suggest that most modern dogs derive from Southeast Asia, which has fueled the controversial hypothesis that dog domestication originated in this region despite the lack of supporting archeological evidence. We propose and investigate with Y chromosomes an alternative hypothesis for the proximate origins of dogs from Southeast Asia—a massive Neolithic expansion of dogs from this region that largely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">replac</span></strong>ed more primitive dogs to the west and north. Previous attempts to test matrilineal findings with independent patrilineal markers have lacked the necessary genealogical resolution and mutation rate estimates. Here, we used Y chromosome genotypes, composed of 29 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) and 5 single tandem repeats (STRs), from 338 Australian dingoes, New Guinea singing dogs, and village dogs from Island Southeast Asia, along with modern European breed dogs, to estimate the evolutionary mutation rates of Y chromosome STRs based on calibration to the independently known age of the dingo population. Dingoes exhibited a unique haplogroup characterized by a single distinguishing SNP mutation and 14 STR haplotypes. The age of the European haplogroup was estimated to be only 1.7 times older than that of the dingo population, suggesting an origin during the Neolithic rather than the Paleolithic (as predicted by the Southeast Asian origins hypothesis). We hypothesize that isolation of Neolithic dogs from wolves in Southeast Asia was a key step accelerating their phenotypic transformation, enhancing their value in trade and as cargo, and enabling them to rapidly expand and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">replac</span></strong>e more primitive dogs to the West. Our findings also suggest that dingoes could have arrived in Australia directly from Taiwan, independently of later dispersals of dogs through Thailand to Island Southeast Asia.</p>

Unique function of a chemosensory protein in the proboscis of two <i>Helicoverpa</i> species
<p>Chemosensory proteins (CSPs) are soluble proteins found only in arthropods. Some of them <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fill</span></strong> the lumen of chemosensilla and are believed to play a role similar to that of odorant-binding proteins in the detection of semiochemicals. Other members of the CSP family have been reported to perform different functions, from delivery of pheromones to development. This report is focused on a member (CSP4) of the family that is highly and almost exclusively present in the proboscis of two sibling noctuid species, <i>Helicoverpa armigera</i> and <i>H. assulta</i>. We expressed the protein in bacteria and measured binding to terpenoids and related compounds. Using specific antibodies, we found that when the moths suck on a sugar solution, CSP4 is partly extruded from the proboscis. A solution of protein can also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fill</span></strong> a hydrophobic tube of same length and diameter as the proboscis by capillary action. On this basis, we suggest that CSP4 acts as a wetting agent to reduce the surface tension of aqueous solutions and consequently the pressure involved in sucking.</p>

Is limb salvage surgery safe for bone sarcomas identified after a previous surgical procedure?
<p>Bone sarcomas are rare cancers and orthopaedic   surgeons come across them infrequently, sometimes unexpectedly during   surgical procedures. We investigated the outcomes of patients who   underwent a surgical procedure where sarcomas were found unexpectedly   and were subsequently referred to our unit for treatment. We identified   95 patients (44 intra-lesional excisions, 35 fracture fixations,   16 joint <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">replac</span></strong>ements) with mean age of 48 years (11 to 83); 60%   were males (n = 57). Local recurrence arose in 40% who underwent   limb salvage surgery <i>versus</i> 12% who had an amputation.   Despite achieving local control, overall survival was worse for   patients treated with amputation rather than limb salvage (54% <i>vs</i> 75%   five-year survival). Factors that negatively influenced survival   were invasive primary surgery (fracture fixation, joint <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">replac</span></strong>ement),   a delay of greater than two months until referral to our oncology   service, and high-grade tumours. Survival in these circumstances   depends mostly on factors that are determined prior to definitive   treatment by a tertiary orthopaedic oncology unit. Limb salvage   in this group of patients is associated with a higher rate of inadequate   marginal surgery and, consequently, higher local recurrence rates   than amputation, but should still be attempted whenever possible,   as local control is not the primary determinant of survival. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014;96-B:665–72.</p>

Association of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection and Risk of Peripheral Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The effect of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) on the development of peripheral artery disease (PAD) remains unclear. We investigated whether HIV infection is associated with an increased risk of PAD after adjustment for traditional atherosclerotic risk factors in a large cohort of HIV-infected (HIV+) and demographically similar HIV-uninfected veterans.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied participants in the Veterans Aging Cohort Study from April 1, 2003 through December 31, 2014. We excluded participants with known prior PAD or prevalent cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary heart disease, and congestive heart failure) and analyzed the effect of HIV status on the risk of incident PAD events after adjusting for demographics, PAD risk factors, substance use, CD4 cell count, HIV-1 ribonucleic acid, and antiretroviral therapy. The primary outcome is incident peripheral artery disease events. Secondary outcomes include mortality and amputation in subjects with incident PAD events by HIV infection status, viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>, and CD4 count.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 91 953 participants, over a median follow up of 9.0 years, there were 7708 incident PAD events.

After adjustment for demographics, PAD risk factors, and other covariates, HIV+ veterans had an increased risk of incident PAD events compared with uninfected veterans (hazard ratio [HR], 1.19; 95% CI, 1.13–1.25). This risk was highest among those with time-updated HIV viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong> >500 copies/mL (HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.38–1.65) and CD4 cell counts <200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> (HR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.71–2.13).

Logistic regression and propensity score matching were used to adjust for unbalanced variables in group comparisons.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Patients undergoing AVR+ARE were more likely to be female (46% versus 34%, <i>P</i><0.001) and had higher rates of previous cardiac surgery (18% versus 12%, <i>P</i><0.001), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (5% versus 3%, <i>P</i>=0.004), urgent/emergent status (6% versus 4%, <i>P</i>=0.01), and worse New York Heart Association status (<i>P</i><0.001). Most patients received bioprosthetic valves (AVR+ARE: 73.4% versus AVR: 73.3%, <i>P</i>=0.98) and also underwent concomitant cardiac procedures (AVR+ARE: 68% versus AVR: 67%, <i>P</i>=0.31). Mean prosthesis size implanted was slightly smaller in patients requiring AVR+ARE versus AVR (23.4±2.1 versus 24.1±2.3, <i>P</i><0.001). In-hospital mortality was higher after AVR+ARE (4.3% versus 3.0%, <i>P</i>=0.008), although when the cohort was restricted to patients undergoing isolated aortic valve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">replac</span></strong>ement with or without root enlargement, mortality was not statistically different (AVR+ARE: 1.7% versus AVR: 1.1%, <i>P</i>=0.29). After adjustment for baseline characteristics, AVR+ARE was not associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality when compared with AVR (odds ratio, 1.03; 95% confidence interval, 0.75–1.41; <i>P</i>=0.85). Furthermore, AVR+ARE was not associated with an increased risk of postoperative adverse events. Results were similar if propensity matching was used instead of multivariable adjustments for baseline characteristics.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In the largest analysis to date, ARE was not associated with increased risk of mortality or adverse events. Surgical ARE is a safe adjunct to AVR in the modern era.</p></sec>

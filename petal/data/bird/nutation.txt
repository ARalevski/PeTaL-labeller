p53 dynamics in response to DNA damage vary across cell lines and are shaped by efficiency of DNA repair and activity of the kinase ATM
<p>Cellular systems show a wide range of signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics. Many of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics are highly stereotyped, such as oscillations at a fixed frequency. However, most studies looking at the role of signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics focus on one or a few cell lines, leaving the diversity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics across tissues or cell lines a largely unexplored question. We focused on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics of the tumor suppressor protein p53, which regulates cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to DNA damage. We established live-cell reporters for 12 cancer cell lines expressing wild-type p53 and quantified p53 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics in response to double-strand break–inducing DNA damage. In many of the tested cell lines, we found that p53 abundance oscillated in response to ionizing radiation or the DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic neocarzinostatin and that the periodicity of the oscillations was fixed. In other cell lines, p53 abundance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ically changed in different ways, such as a single broad pulse or a continuous induction. By combining single-cell assays of p53 signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics, small-molecule screening in live cells, and mathematical modeling, we identified molecules that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perturb</span></strong>ed p53 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics and determined that cell-specific variation in the efficiency of DNA repair and the activity of the kinase ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) controlled the signaling landscape of p53 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics. Because the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics of wild-type p53 varied substantially between cell lines, our study highlights the limitation of using one line as a model system and emphasizes the importance of studying the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics of other signaling pathways across different cell lines and genetic backgrounds.</p>

<i>In vivo</i> three-dimensional kinematics of normal knees during different high-flexion activities
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>In Asia and the Middle-East, people often flex their knees deeply   in order to perform activities of daily living. The purpose of this   study was to investigate the 3D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinemat</span></strong>ics of normal knees during   high-flexion activities. Our hypothesis was that the femorotibial   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion, varus-valgus angle, translations, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinemat</span></strong>ic pathway   of normal knees during high-flexion activities, varied according   to activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We investigated the <i>in vivo</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinemat</span></strong>ics of eight   normal knees in four male volunteers (mean age 41.8 years; 37 to   53) using 2D and 3D registration technique, and modelled the knees   with a computer aided design program. Each subject squatted, kneeled,   and sat cross-legged. We evaluated the femoral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion and varus-valgus   angle relative to the tibia and anteroposterior translation of the   medial and lateral side, using the transepicodylar axis as our femoral   reference relative to the perpendicular projection on to the tibial   plateau. This method evaluates the femur medially from what has   elsewhere been described as the extension facet centre, and differs   from the method classically applied. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>During squatting and kneeling, the knees displayed femoral external   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion. When sitting cross-legged, femurs displayed internal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion   from 10° to 100°. From 100°, femoral external <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion was observed.   No significant difference in varus-valgus angle was seen between   squatting and kneeling, whereas a varus position was observed from   140° when sitting cross-legged. The measure <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinemat</span></strong>ic pathway using   our methodology found during squatting a medial pivoting pattern   from 0° to 40° and bicondylar rollback from 40° to 150°. During   kneeling, a medial pivot pattern was evident. When sitting cross-legged,   a lateral pivot pattern was seen from 0° to 100°, and a medial pivot   pattern beyond 100°.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinemat</span></strong>ics of normal knees during high flexion are variable   according to activity. Nevertheless, our study was limited to a   small number of male patients using a different technique to report   the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinemat</span></strong>ics than previous publications.

Quantum correlations from a room-temperature optomechanical cavity
<p>The act of position measurement alters the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> of an object being measured. This quantum measurement backaction is typically much smaller than the thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> of a room-temperature object and thus difficult to observe. By shining laser light through a nanomechanical beam, we measure the beam’s thermally driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vibrat</span></strong>ions and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perturb</span></strong> its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> with optical force fluctuations at a level dictated by the Heisenberg measurement-disturbance uncertainty relation. We demonstrate a cross-correlation technique to distinguish optically driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> from thermally driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong>, observing this quantum backaction signature up to room temperature. We use the scale of the quantum correlations, which is determined by fundamental constants, to gauge the size of thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong>, demonstrating a path toward absolute thermometry with quantum mechanically ca<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">librat</span></strong>ed ticks.</p>

Effects of network modularity on the spread of perturbation impact in experimental metapopulations
<p>Networks with a modular structure are expected to have a lower risk of global failure. However, this theoretical result has remained untested until now. We used an experimental microarthropod metapopulation to test the effect of modularity on the response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perturb</span></strong>ation. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perturb</span></strong>ed one local population and measured the spread of the impact of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perturb</span></strong>ation, both within and between modules. Our results show the buffering capacity of modular networks. To assess the generality of our findings, we then analyzed a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ical model of our system. We show that in the absence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perturb</span></strong>ations, modularity is negatively correlated with metapopulation size. However, even when a small local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perturb</span></strong>ation occurs, this negative effect is offset by a buffering effect that protects the majority of the nodes from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perturb</span></strong>ation.</p>

Imaging rotational dynamics of nanoparticles in liquid by 4D electron microscopy
<p>In real time and space, four-dimensional electron microscopy (4D EM) has enabled observation of transient structures and morphologies of inorganic and organic materials. We have extended 4D EM to include liquid cells without the time resolution being limited by the response of the detector. Our approach permits the imaging of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> and morphological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics of a single, same particle on nanometer and ultrashort time scales. As a first application, we studied the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics of gold nanoparticles in aqueous solution. A full transition from the conventional diffusive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion to superdiffusive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion and further to a ballistic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion was observed with increasing asymmetry of the nanoparticle morphology. We explored the underlying physics both experimentally and theoretically according to the morphological asymmetry of the nanoparticles.</p>

From oncogenic mutation to dynamic code
<p>Signal transduction pathways (STPs) convert biochemical reactions into precise and reproducible biological outcomes. These functions are performed reliably and reproducibly against a background of noise (variation) arising from the stochastic nature of biochemical reactions (<i>1</i>). Indeed, information theory analysis of STPs indicates that they have a limited capacity to discriminate information, including different ligands or different activation states of components (<i>2</i>). However, this discrimination is dramatically enhanced by adding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic information, such as signal rise time, signal duration, amplitude, and decay rate (<i>3</i>). The observation that differential activation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway can determine whether rat pheochromocytoma cells proliferate or differentiate was reported more than 20 years ago (<i>4</i>), and evidence has since accumulated that STP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics control cell fate decisions. However, we are still struggling to understand how signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics is encoded and decoded and how pathological changes, such as the expression of mutant proteins, affect the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic STP code. On page 892 of this issue, Bugaj <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) make use of new tools with which to decipher this code and reveal how certain cancer-associated BRAF mutations can corrupt the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic STP code and trick cells into unlicensed proliferation.</p>

Twistable electronics with dynamically rotatable heterostructures
<p>In heterostructures of two-dimensional materials, electronic properties can vary dramatically with relative interlayer angle. This effect makes it theoretically possible to realize a new class of twistable electronics in which properties can be manipulated on demand by means of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion. We demonstrate a device architecture in which a layered heterostructure can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ically twisted in situ. We study graphene encapsulated by boron nitride, where, at small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion angles, the device characteristics are dominated by coupling to a long-wavelength moirééé superlattice. The ability to investigate arbitrary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion angle in a single device reveals features of the optical, mechanical, and electronic response in this system not captured in static <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion studies. Our results establish the capability to fabricate twistable electronic devices with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ically tunable properties.</p>

Hydraulically amplified self-healing electrostatic actuators with muscle-like performance
<p>Existing soft <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">actuat</span></strong>ors have persistent challenges that restrain the potential of soft robotics, highlighting a need for soft transducers that are powerful, high-speed, efficient, and robust. We describe a class of soft <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">actuat</span></strong>ors, termed hydraulically amplified self-healing electrostatic (HASEL) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">actuat</span></strong>ors, which harness a mechanism that couples electrostatic and hydraulic forces to achieve a variety of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">actuat</span></strong>ion modes. We introduce prototypical designs of HASEL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">actuat</span></strong>ors and demonstrate their robust, muscle-like performance as well as their ability to repeatedly self-heal after dielectric breakdown—all using widely available materials and common fabrication techniques. A soft gripper handling delicate objects and a self-sensing artificial muscle powering a robotic arm illustrate the wide potential of HASEL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">actuat</span></strong>ors for next-generation soft robotic devices.</p>

Locked synchronous rotor motion in a molecular motor
<p>Biological molecular motors translate their local directional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> into ordered movement of other parts of the system to empower controlled mechanical functions. The design of analogous geared systems that couple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> in a directional manner, which is pivotal for molecular machinery operating at the nanoscale, remains highly challenging. Here, we report a molecular rotary motor that translates light-driven unidirectional rotary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> to controlled movement of a connected biaryl rotor. Achieving coupled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> of the distinct parts of this multicomponent mechanical system required precise control of multiple kinetic barriers for isomerization and synchronous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong>, resulting in sliding and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion during a full rotary cycle, with the motor always facing the same face of the rotor.</p>

The Microtubule-Associated Protein IQ67 DOMAIN5 Modulates Microtubule Dynamics and Pavement Cell Shape
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic arrangement of cortical microtubules (MTs) plays a pivotal role in controlling cell growth and shape formation in plants, but the mechanisms by which cortical MTs are organized to regulate these processes are not well characterized. In particular, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic behavior of cortical MTs is critical for their spatial organization, yet the molecular mechanisms controlling MT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics remain poorly understood. In this study, we used the puzzle piece-shaped pavement cells of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves as a model system in which to study cortical MT organization. We isolated an ethyl methanesulfonate mutant with reduced interdigitation of pavement cells in cotyledons. This line carried a mutation in <i>IQ67 DOMAIN5</i> (<i>IQD5</i>), which encodes a member of the plant-specific IQ motif protein family. Live-cell imaging and biochemical analyses demonstrated that IQD5 binds to MTs and promotes MT assembly. MT-depolymerizing drug treatment and in vivo MT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics assays suggested that IQD5 functions to stabilize MTs. Hence, our findings provide genetic, cell biological, and biochemical evidence that IQD5 regulates MT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics that affect MT organization and subsequent cell shape formation.</p>

<sec><title>Aims</title><p>One goal of total hip arthroplasty is to restore normal hip anatomy.   The aim of this study was to compare <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">displac</span></strong>ement of the centre   of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion (COR) using a standard reaming technique with a technique   in which the acetabulum was reamed immediately peripherally and   referenced off the rim.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>In the first cohort the acetabulum was reamed to the floor followed   by sequentially larger reamers.

Large Cardiac Muscle Patches Engineered From Human Induced-Pluripotent Stem Cell–Derived Cardiac Cells Improve Recovery From Myocardial Infarction in Swine
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Here, we generated human cardiac muscle patches (hCMPs) of clinically relevant dimensions (4 cm × 2 cm × 1.25 mm) by suspending cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells that had been differentiated from human induced-pluripotent stem cells in a fibrin scaffold and then culturing the construct on a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic (rocking) platform.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In vitro assessments of hCMPs suggest maturation in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic culture stimulation. In vivo assessments were conducted in a porcine model of myocardial infarction (MI). Animal groups included: MI hearts treated with 2 hCMPs (MI+hCMP, n=13), MI hearts treated with 2 cell-free open fibrin patches (n=14), or MI hearts with neither experimental patch (n=15); a fourth group of animals underwent sham surgery (Sham, n=8). Cardiac function and infarct size were evaluated by MRI, arrhythmia incidence by implanted loop recorders, and the engraftment rate by calculation of quantitative polymerase chain reaction measurements of expression of the human Y chromosome. Additional studies examined the myocardial protein expression profile changes and potential mechanisms of action that related to exosomes from the cell patch.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The hCMPs began to beat synchronously within 1 day of fabrication, and after 7 days of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic culture stimulation, in vitro assessments indicated the mechanisms related to the improvements in electronic mechanical coupling, calcium-handling, and force generation, suggesting a maturation process during the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic culture. The engraftment rate was 10.9±1.8% at 4 weeks after the transplantation. The hCMP transplantation was associated with significant improvements in left ventricular function, infarct size, myocardial wall stress, myocardial hypertrophy, and reduced apoptosis in the periscar boarder zone myocardium. hCMP transplantation also reversed some MI-associated changes in sarcomeric regulatory protein phosphorylation. The exosomes released from the hCMP appeared to have cytoprotective properties that improved cardiomyocyte survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We have fabricated a clinically relevant size of hCMP with trilineage cardiac cells derived from human induced-pluripotent stem cells. The hCMP matures in vitro during 7 days of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic culture. Transplantation of this type of hCMP results in significantly reduced infarct size and improvements in cardiac function that are associated with reduction in left ventricular wall stress. The hCMP treatment is not associated with significant changes in arrhythmogenicity.</p></sec>

Exercise Dynamics in Secondary Mitral Regurgitation
<p>Secondary mitral valve regurgitation (MR) remains a challenging problem in the diagnostic workup and treatment of patients with heart failure. Although secondary MR is characteristically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic in nature and sensitive to changes in ventricular geometry and loading, current therapy is mainly focused on resting conditions. An exercise-induced increase in secondary MR, however, is associated with impaired exercise capacity and increased mortality. In an era where a multitude of percutaneous solutions are emerging for the treatment of patients with heart failure, it becomes important to address the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic component of secondary MR during exercise as well. A critical reappraisal of the underlying disease mechanisms, in particular the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic component during exercise, is of timely importance. This review summarizes the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic deterioration of secondary MR during exercise, its functional and prognostic impact, and the way current treatment options affect the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic lesion and exercise hemo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics in general.</p>

NF-κB signaling dynamics is controlled by a dose-sensing autoregulatory loop
<p>Over the last decade, multiple studies have shown that signaling proteins activated in different temporal patterns, such as oscillatory, transient, and sustained, can result in distinct gene expression patterns or cell fates. However, the molecular events that ensure appropriate stimulus- and dose-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics are not often understood and are difficult to investigate. Here, we used single-cell analysis to dissect the mechanisms underlying the stimulus- and dose-encoding patterns in the innate immune signaling network. We found that Toll-like receptor (TLR) and interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics relied on a dose-dependent, autoinhibitory loop that rendered cells refractory to further stimulation. Using inducible gene expression and optogenetics to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perturb</span></strong> the network at different levels, we identified IL-1R–associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) as the dose-sensing node responsible for limiting signal flow during the innate immune response. Although the kinase activity of IRAK1 was not required for signal propagation, it played a critical role in inhibiting the nucleocytoplasmic oscillations of the transcription factor NF-κB. Thus, protein activities that may be “dispensable” from a topological perspective can nevertheless be essential in shaping the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic response to the external environment.</p>

Educated natural killer cells show dynamic movement of the activating receptor NKp46 and confinement of the inhibitory receptor Ly49A
<p>Educated natural killer (NK) cells have inhibitory receptors specific for self major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules and kill cancer cells more efficiently than do NK cells that do not have such receptors (hyporesponsive NK cells). The mechanism behind this functional empowerment through education has so far not been fully described. In addition, distinctive phenotypic markers of educated NK cells at the single-cell level are lacking. We developed a refined version of the image mean square <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">displac</span></strong>ement (iMSD) method (called iMSD carpet analysis) and used it in combination with single-particle tracking to characterize the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics of the activating receptor NKp46 and the inhibitory receptor Ly49A on resting educated versus hyporesponsive murine NK cells. Most of the NKp46 and Ly49A molecules were restricted to microdomains; however, individual NKp46 molecules resided in these domains for shorter periods and diffused faster on the surface of educated, compared to hyporesponsive, NK cells. In contrast, the movement of Ly49A was more constrained in educated NK cells compared to hyporesponsive NK cells. Either disrupting the actin cytoskeleton or adding cholesterol to the cells prohibited activating signaling, suggesting that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics of receptor movements within the cell membrane are critical for the proper activation of NK cells. The faster and more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic movement of NKp46 in educated NK cells may facilitate a swifter response to interactions with target cells.</p>

Exotic states in a simple network of nanoelectromechanical oscillators
<p>Synchronization of oscillators, a phenomenon found in a wide variety of natural and engineered systems, is typically understood through a reduction to a first-order phase model with simplified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics. Here, by exploiting the precision and flexibility of nanoelectromechanical systems, we examined the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics of a ring of quasi-sinusoidal oscillators at and beyond first order. Beyond first order, we found exotic states of synchronization with highly complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics, including weak chimeras, decoupled states, traveling waves, and inhomogeneous synchronized states. Through theory and experiment, we show that these exotic states rely on complex interactions emerging out of networks with simple linear nearest-neighbor coupling. This work provides insight into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ical richness of complex systems with weak nonlinearities and local interactions.</p>

Asteroseismic detection of latitudinal differential rotation in 13 Sun-like stars

For the most significant detections, the stars’ equators <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>e approximately twice as fast as their midlatitudes. The latitudinal shear inferred from asteroseismology is much larger than predictions from numerical simulations.</p>

High parasite diversity accelerates host adaptation and diversification
<p>Host-parasite species pairs are known to coevolve, but how multiple parasites coevolve with their host is unclear. By using experimental coevolution of a host bacterium and its viral parasites, we revealed that diverse parasite communities accelerated host evolution and altered coevolutionary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics to enhance host resistance and decrease parasite infectivity. Increases in parasite diversity drove shifts in the mode of selection from fluctuating (Red Queen) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics to predominately directional (arms race) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics. Arms race <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics were characterized by selective sweeps of generalist resistance mutations in the genes for the host bacterium’s cell surface lipopolysaccharide (a bacteriophage receptor), which caused faster molecular evolution within host populations and greater genetic divergence among populations. These results indicate that exposure to multiple parasites influences the rate and type of host-parasite coevolution.</p>

Enzyme-free nucleic acid dynamical systems
<p>Chemistries exhibiting complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics—from inorganic oscillators to gene regulatory networks—have been long known but either cannot be reprogrammed at will or rely on the sophisticated enzyme chemistry underlying the central dogma. Can simpler molecular mechanisms, designed from scratch, exhibit the same range of behaviors? Abstract chemical reaction networks have been proposed as a programming language for complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics, along with their systematic implementation using short synthetic DNA molecules. We developed this technology for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ical systems by identifying critical design principles and codifying them into a compiler automating the design process. Using this approach, we built an oscillator containing only DNA components, establishing that Watson-Crick base-pairing interactions alone suffice for complex chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics and that autonomous molecular systems can be designed via molecular programming languages.</p>

Bloch oscillations in the absence of a lattice
<p>The interplay of strong quantum correlations and far-from-equilibrium conditions can give rise to striking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ical phenomena. We experimentally investigated the quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> of an impurity atom immersed in a strongly interacting one-dimensional Bose liquid and subject to an external force. We found that the momentum distribution of the impurity exhibits characteristic Bragg reflections at the edge of an emergent Brillouin zone. Although Bragg reflections are typically associated with lattice structures, in our strongly correlated quantum liquid they result from the interplay of short-range crystalline order and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinemat</span></strong>ic constraints on the many-body scattering processes in the one-dimensional system. As a consequence, the impurity exhibits periodic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics, reminiscent of Bloch oscillations, although the quantum liquid is translationally invariant. Our observations are supported by large-scale numerical simulations.</p>

Vibrationally Promoted Dissociation of Water on Ni(111)
<sec><title><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vibrat</span></strong>ing Water Apart</title><p>The main route for producing hydrogen for industrial chemical synthesis is steam reforming, in which water and methane react at high temperatures on nickel catalysts to produce hydrogen and carbon dioxide.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
A Model of Leaf Coordination to Scale-Up Leaf Expansion from the Organ to the Canopy
<p>Process-based crop growth models are popular tools with which to analyze and understand the impact of crop management, genotype-by-environment interactions, or climate change. The ability to predict leaf area development is critical to predict crop growth, particularly under conditions of limited resources. Here, we aimed at deciphering growth coordination rules between wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) plant organs (i.e. between leaves within a stem, between laminae and sheaths, and between the mainstem and axillary tillers) to model the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics of canopy development. We found a unique relationship between laminae area and leaf rank for the mainstem and its tillers, which was robust across a range of sowing dates and plant densities. Robust relationships between laminae and sheath areas also were found, highlighting the tight control of organ growth within and between phytomers. These relationships identified at the phytomer scale were used to develop a simulation model of leaf area <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics at the canopy level that was integrated in the wheat model SiriusQuality. The model was then evaluated using several independent experiments. The model accurately predicts leaf area <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics under different scenarios of nitrogen and water limitations. It accounted for 85%, 64%, and 73% of the variability of the surface area of leaf cohorts, total leaf area index, and total green area index, respectively. The process-based model of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics of leaf area described here is a key element to quantify the value of candidate traits for use in plant breeding and to project the impact of climate change on wheat growth.</p>

Anterior lateral line nerve encoding to tones and play-back vocalisations in free-swimming oyster toadfish, <i>Opsanus tau</i>
<p>In the underwater environment, sound propagates both as a pressure wave and as particle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong>, with particle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> dominating close to the source. At the receptor level, the fish ear and the neuromast hair cells act as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">displac</span></strong>ement detectors, and both are potentially stimulated by the particle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> component of sound. The encoding of the anterior lateral line nerve to acoustic stimuli in freely behaving oyster toadfish, <i>Opsanus tau</i>, was examined. Nerve sensitivity and directional responses were determined using spike rate and vector strength analysis, a measure of phase-locking of spike times to the stimulus waveform. All units showed greatest sensitivity to 100 Hz stimulus. While sensitivity was independent of stimuli orientation, the neuron's ability to phase-lock was correlated with stimuli origin. Two different types of units were classified, type 1 (tonic), and type 2 (phasic). The type 1 fibres were further classified into two sub-types based on their frequency response (type 1–1 and type 1–2), which was hypothesised to be related to canal (type 1–1) and superficial (type 1–2) neuromast innervation. Lateral line units also exhibited sensitivity and phase locking to boatwhistle vocalisations, with greatest spike rates exhibited at the onset of the call. These results provide direct evidence that oyster toadfish can use their lateral line to detect behaviourally relevant acoustic stimuli, which could provide a sensory pathway to aid in sound source localisation.</p>

Physiological correlates of symbiont migration during bleaching of two octocoral species
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perturb</span></strong>ed colonies of <i>Phenganax parrini</i> and <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. exhibit migration of symbionts of <i>Symbiodinium</i> spp. into the stolons. Densitometry and visual inspection indicated that polyps bleached while stolons did not. When migration was triggered by temperature, light and confinement, colonies of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. decreased rates of oxygen formation in the light (due to the effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perturb</span></strong>ation on photosynthesis and respiration) and increased rates of oxygen uptake in the dark (due to the effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perturb</span></strong>ation on respiration alone). Colonies of <i>P. parrini</i>, by contrast, showed no significant changes in either aspect of oxygen metabolism. When migration was triggered by light and confinement, colonies of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. showed decreased rates of oxygen formation in the light and increased rates of oxygen uptake in the dark, while colonies of <i>P. parrini</i> maintained the former and increased the latter. During symbiont migration into their stolons, colonies of both species showed dramatic increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS), as visualized with a fluorescent probe, with stolons of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. exhibiting a nearly immediate increase of ROS. Differences in symbiont type may explain the greater sensitivity of colonies of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. Using fluorescent probes, direct measurements of migrating symbionts in the stolons of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. showed higher levels of reactive nitrogen species and lower levels of ROS than the surrounding host tissue. As measured by native fluorescence, levels of NAD(P)H in the stolons were unaffected by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perturb</span></strong>ation. Symbiont migration thus correlates with dramatic physiological changes and may serve as a marker for coral condition.</p>

Convergence in morphology and masticatory function between the pharyngeal jaws of grass carp, <i>Ctenopharyngodon idella</i>, and oral jaws of amniote herbivores
<p>The cellulose-rich walls that protect plant cells are difficult to digest, and therefore mechanical food processing is a key aspect of herbivory across vertebrates. Cell walls are typically broken down by translation of flattened teeth in the occlusal plane (i.e. grinding) as part of a complex, rhythmic chewing stroke. The grass carp, <i>Ctenopharyngodon idella</i>, is a voracious, invasive herbivorous fish that relies solely on its pharyngeal teeth, located in the back of the throat, for mechanical processing of plant material. Here, we describe the musculoskeletal anatomy of the pharyngeal jaws of grass carp and use XROMM to quantify chewing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinemat</span></strong>ics and muscle strain. The pharyngeal jaws are suspended in a sling of 11 muscles and maintain no bony articulation with any other skeletal elements in the head. The jaws bear long, serrated teeth that are worn during use into flattened tooth cusps. Our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinemat</span></strong>ic data show that this wear is the result of the teeth being elevated into occlusion against the basioccipital process and keratinous chewing pad, not tooth-on-tooth occlusion. Pharyngeal jaw elevation results from large strains in the jaw elevator muscle, the levator arcus branchialis V, to drive a pulley-like mechanism that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>es the jaws about a pivot point at the symphysis between the left and right pharyngeal jaws. These complex, rhythmic jaw <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ions translate the teeth laterally across the chewing surface throughout the occlusion phase. The grass carp chewing system is strikingly similar in gross morphology and masticatory function to herbivorous chewing strategies in other vertebrates.</p>

Here we describe chemically-driven artificial rotary and linear molecular motors that operate through a fundamentally different type of mechanism. The directional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion of [2]- and [3]catenane rotary molecular motors and the transport of substrates away from equilibrium by a linear molecular pump are induced by acid-base oscillations. The changes simultaneously switch the binding site affinities and the labilities of barriers on the track, creating an energy ratchet. The linear and rotary molecular motors are driven by aliquots of a chemical fuel, trichloroacetic acid. A single fuel pulse generates 360° unidirectional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion of up to 87% of crown ethers in a [2]catenane rotary motor.</p>

Encoding of vinylidene isomerization in its anion photoelectron spectrum
<p>Vinylidene-acetylene isomerization is the prototypical example of a 1,2-hydrogen shift, one of the most important classes of isomerization reactions in organic chemistry. This reaction was investigated with quantum state specificity by high-resolution photoelectron spectroscopy of the vinylidene anions H<sub>2</sub>CC and D<sub>2</sub>CC and quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics calculations. Peaks in the photoelectron spectra are considerably narrower than in previous work and reveal subtleties in the isomerization <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics of neutral vinylidene, as well as vibronic coupling with an excited state of vinylidene. Comparison with theory permits assignment of most spectral features to eigenstates dominated by vinylidene character. However, excitation of the ν<sub>6</sub> in-plane rocking mode in H<sub>2</sub>CC results in appreciable tunneling-facilitated mixing with highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vibrat</span></strong>ionally excited states of acetylene, leading to broadening and/or spectral fine structure that is largely suppressed for analogous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vibrat</span></strong>ional levels of D<sub>2</sub>CC.</p>

Reconciling solar and stellar magnetic cycles with nonlinear dynamo simulations
<p>The magnetic fields of solar-type stars are observed to cycle over decadal periods—11 years in the case of the Sun. The fields originate in the turbulent convective layers of stars and have a complex dependency upon stellar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion rate. We have performed a set of turbulent global simulations that exhibit magnetic cycles varying systematically with stellar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion and luminosity. We find that the magnetic cycle period is inversely proportional to the Rossby number, which quantifies the influence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion on turbulent convection. The trend relies on a fundamentally nonlinear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>o process and is compatible with the Sun’s cycle and those of other solar-type stars.</p>

Mechanism of transmembrane signaling by sensor histidine kinases
<p>One of the major and essential classes of transmembrane (TM) receptors, present in all domains of life, is sensor histidine kinases, parts of two-component signaling systems (TCSs). The structural mechanisms of TM signaling by these sensors are poorly understood. We present crystal structures of the periplasmic sensor domain, the TM domain, and the cytoplasmic HAMP domain of the <i>Escherichia coli</i> nitrate/nitrite sensor histidine kinase NarQ in the ligand-bound and mutated ligand-free states. The structures reveal that the ligand binding induces rearrangements and pistonlike shifts of TM helices. The HAMP domain protomers undergo leverlike <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong>s and convert these pistonlike <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong>s into helical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ions. Our findings provide the structural framework for complete understanding of TM TCS signaling and for development of antimicrobial treatments targeting TCSs.</p>

Bragg coherent diffractive imaging of single-grain defect dynamics in polycrystalline films
<p>Polycrystalline material properties depend on the distribution and interactions of their crystalline grains. In particular, grain boundaries and defects are crucial in determining their response to external stimuli. A long-standing challenge is thus to observe individual grains, defects, and strain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics inside functional materials. Here we report a technique capable of revealing grain heterogeneity, including strain fields and individual dislocations, that can be used under operando conditions in reactive environments: grain Bragg coherent diffractive imaging (gBCDI). Using a polycrystalline gold thin film subjected to heating, we show how gBCDI resolves grain boundary and dislocation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics in individual grains in three-dimensional detail with 10-nanometer spatial and subangstrom <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">displac</span></strong>ement field resolution.

Real-time spectral interferometry probes the internal dynamics of femtosecond soliton molecules
<p>Solitons, particle-like excitations ubiquitous in many fields of physics, have been shown to exhibit bound states akin to molecules. The formation of such temporal soliton bound states and their internal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics have escaped direct experimental observation. By means of an emerging time-stretch technique, we resolve the evolution of femtosecond soliton molecules in the cavity of a few-cycle mode-locked laser. We track two- and three-soliton bound states over hundreds of thousands of consecutive cavity roundtrips, identifying fixed points and periodic and aperiodic molecular orbits. A class of trajectories acquires a path-dependent geometrical phase, implying that its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics may be topologically protected. These findings highlight the importance of real-time detection in resolving interactions in complex nonlinear systems, including the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics of soliton bound states, breathers, and rogue waves.</p>

The role of dimer asymmetry and protomer dynamics in enzyme catalysis
<p>Freeze-trapping x-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance, and computational techniques reveal the distribution of states and their interconversion rates along the reaction pathway of a bacterial homodimeric enzyme, fluoroacetate dehalogenase (FAcD). The crystal structure of apo-FAcD exhibits asymmetry around the dimer interface and cap domain, priming one protomer for substrate binding. This asymmetry is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ically averaged through conformational exchange on a millisecond time scale. During catalysis, the protomer conformational exchange rate becomes enhanced, the empty protomer exhibits increased local disorder, and water egresses. Computational studies identify allosteric pathways between protomers. Water release and enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics associated with catalysis compensate for entropic losses from substrate binding while facilitating sampling of the transition state. The studies provide insights into how substrate-coupled allosteric modulation of structure and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics facilitates catalysis in a homodimeric enzyme.</p>

Spectroscopic snapshots of the proton-transfer mechanism in water
<p>The Grotthuss mechanism explains the anomalously high proton mobility in water as a sequence of proton transfers along a hydrogen-bonded (H-bonded) network. However, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vibrat</span></strong>ional spectroscopic signatures of this process are masked by the diffuse nature of the key bands in bulk water. Here we report how the much simpler <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vibrat</span></strong>ional spectra of cold, composition-selected heavy water clusters, D<sup>+</sup>(D<sub>2</sub>O)<i><sub>n</sub></i>, can be exploited to capture clear markers that encode the collective reaction coordinate along the proton-transfer event.

Attosecond dynamics through a Fano resonance: Monitoring the birth of a photoelectron
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics of quantum systems are encoded in the amplitude and phase of wave packets. However, the rapidity of electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics on the attosecond scale has precluded the complete characterization of electron wave packets in the time domain. Using spectrally resolved electron interferometry, we were able to measure the amplitude and phase of a photoelectron wave packet created through a Fano autoionizing resonance in helium. In our setup, replicas obtained by two-photon transitions interfere with reference wave packets that are formed through smooth continua, allowing the full temporal reconstruction, purely from experimental data, of the resonant wave packet released in the continuum. In turn, this resolves the buildup of the autoionizing resonance on an attosecond time scale. Our results, in excellent agreement with ab initio time-dependent calculations, raise prospects for detailed investigations of ultrafast photoemission <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics governed by electron correlation, as well as coherent control over structured electron wave packets.</p>

Universal space-time scaling symmetry in the dynamics of bosons across a quantum phase transition
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics of many-body systems spanning condensed matter, cosmology, and beyond are hypothesized to be universal when the systems cross continuous phase transitions. The universal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics are expected to satisfy a scaling symmetry of space and time with the crossing rate, inspired by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. We test this symmetry based on Bose condensates in a shaken optical lattice. Shaking the lattice drives condensates across an effectively ferromagnetic quantum phase transition. After crossing the critical point, the condensates manifest delayed growth of spin fluctuations and develop antiferromagnetic spatial correlations resulting from the sub-Poisson distribution of the spacing between topological defects. The fluctuations and correlations are invariant in scaled space-time coordinates, in support of the scaling symmetry of quantum critical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics.</p>

Structural basis for the gating mechanism of the type 2 ryanodine receptor RyR2

Ultrafast many-body interferometry of impurities coupled to a Fermi sea
<p>The fastest possible collective response of a quantum many-body system is related to its excitations at the highest possible energy.

Screening in crystalline liquids protects energetic carriers in hybrid perovskites
<p>Hybrid lead halide perovskites exhibit carrier properties that resemble those of pristine nonpolar semiconductors despite static and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic disorder, but how carriers are protected from efficient scattering with charged defects and optical phonons is unknown. Here, we reveal the carrier protection mechanism by comparing three single-crystal lead bromide perovskites: CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbBr<sub>3</sub>, CH(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>PbBr<sub>3</sub>, and CsPbBr<sub>3</sub>. We observed hot fluorescence emission from energetic carriers with ~10<sup>2</sup>-picosecond lifetimes in CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbBr<sub>3</sub> or CH(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>PbBr<sub>3</sub>, but not in CsPbBr<sub>3</sub>. The hot fluorescence is correlated with liquid-like molecular reorientational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong>s, suggesting that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic screening protects energetic carriers via solvation or large polaron formation on time scales competitive with that of ultrafast cooling. Similar protections likely exist for band-edge carriers. The long-lived energetic carriers may enable hot-carrier solar cells with efficiencies exceeding the Shockley-Queisser limit.</p>

Tomography reveals buoyant asthenosphere accumulating beneath the Juan de Fuca plate
<p>The boundary between Earth’s strong lithospheric plates and the underlying mantle asthenosphere corresponds to an abrupt seismic velocity decrease and electrical conductivity increase with depth, perhaps indicating a thin, weak layer that may strongly influence plate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics. The behavior of such a layer at subduction zones remains unexplored.

Through simple geo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic arguments, we propose that this low-velocity feature is the accumulation of material from a thin, weak, buoyant layer present beneath the entire oceanic lithosphere.

Diurnal Variation in Nonstructural Carbohydrate Storage in Trees: Remobilization and Vertical Mixing
<p>Nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) storage plays a critical role in tree function and survival, but understanding and predicting local NSC storage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics is challenging because NSC storage pools are dispersed throughout the complex architecture of trees and continuously exchange carbon between source and sink organs at different time scales. To address these knowledge gaps, characterization and understanding of NSC diel variation are necessary. Here, we analyzed diurnal NSC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics in the overall architecture of almond (<i>Prunus dulcis</i>) trees. We also analyzed the allocation of newly assimilated carbon using isotopic labeling. We show that both components of NSC (i.e. soluble carbohydrates and starch) are highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic at the diurnal time scale and that these trends are influenced by tissue type, age, and/or position within the canopy. In leaves, starch reserves can be depleted completely during the night, while woody tissue starch levels may vary by more than 50% over a daily cycle. Recently assimilated carbon showed a dispersed downward allocation across the entire tree. NSC diurnal fluctuations within the tree’s structure in combination with dispersed carbon allocation patterns provide evidence for the presence of vertical mixing and suggest that the xylem acts as a secondary NSC redistribution pathway.</p>

The Causes of Leaf Hydraulic Vulnerability and Its Influence on Gas Exchange in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>The influence of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics of leaf hydraulic conductance (<i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub>) diurnally and during dehydration on stomatal conductance and photosynthesis remains unclear. Using the model species Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> ecotype Columbia-0), we applied a multitiered approach including physiological measurements, high-resolution x-ray microcomputed tomography, and modeling at a range of scales to characterize (1) <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> decline during dehydration; (2) its basis in the hydraulic conductances of leaf xylem and outside-xylem pathways (<i>K</i><sub>ox</sub>); (3) the dependence of its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics on irradiance; (4) its impact on diurnal patterns of stomatal conductance and photosynthetic rate; and (5) its influence on gas exchange and survival under simulated drought regimes. Arabidopsis leaves showed strong vulnerability to dehydration diurnally in both gas exchange and hydraulic conductance, despite lack of xylem embolism or conduit collapse above the turgor loss point, indicating a pronounced sensitivity of <i>K</i><sub>ox</sub> to dehydration. <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> increased under higher irradiance in well-hydrated leaves across the full range of water potential, but no shift in <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> vulnerability was observed. Modeling indicated that responses to dehydration and irradiance are likely attributable to changes in membrane permeability and that a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic <i>K</i><sub>ox</sub> would contribute strongly to stomatal closure, improving performance, survival, and efficient water use during drought. These findings for Columbia-0 provide a baseline for assessing variation across genotypes in hydraulic traits and their influence on gas exchange during dehydration.</p>

Hydrogen Sulfide Disturbs Actin Polymerization via <i>S</i>-Sulfhydration Resulting in Stunted Root Hair Growth
<p>Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) is an important signaling molecule in plants. Our previous report suggested that H<sub>2</sub>S signaling affects the actin cytoskeleton and root hair growth. However, the underlying mechanisms of its effects are not understood. <i>S</i>-Sulfhydration of proteins is regulated directly by H<sub>2</sub>S, which converts the thiol groups of cysteine (Cys) residues to persulfides and alters protein function. In this work, we studied the effects of <i>S</i>-sulfhydration on actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We generated transgenic plants overexpressing the H<sub>2</sub>S biosynthesis-related genes <i><sc>l</sc>-CYSTEINE DESULFHYDRASE</i> (<i>LCD</i>) and <i><sc>d</sc>-CYSTEINE DESULFHYDRASE</i> in the <i>O-acetylserine(thiol)lyase isoform a1</i> (<i>oasa1</i>) mutant and Columbia-0 backgrounds. The H<sub>2</sub>S content increased significantly in overexpressing <i>LCD</i>/<i>oasa1</i> plants. The density of filamentous actin (F-actin) bundles and the F-actin/globular actin ratio decreased in overexpressing <i>LCD</i>/<i>oasa1</i> plants. <i>S</i>-Sulfhydration also was enhanced in overexpressing <i>LCD</i>/<i>oasa1</i> plants. An analysis of actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics suggested that <i>S</i>-sulfhydration inhibited actin polymerization. We also found that ACTIN2 (ACT2) was <i>S</i>-sulfhydrated at Cys-287. Cys-287 is adjacent to the D-loop, which acts as a central region for hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions and stabilizes F-actin filaments. Overaccumulation of H<sub>2</sub>S caused the depolymerization of F-actin bundles and inhibited root hair growth. Introduction of <i>ACT2</i> carrying a Cys-287-to-Ser mutation into an <i>act2-1</i> mutant partially suppressed H<sub>2</sub>S-dependent inhibition of root hair growth. We conclude that H<sub>2</sub>S regulates actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics and affects root hair growth.</p>

BIG Regulates Dynamic Adjustment of Circadian Period in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>Circadian clocks drive rhythms with a period near 24 h, but the molecular basis of the regulation of the period of the circadian clockis poorly understood. We previously demonstrated that metabolites affect the free-running period of the circadian oscillator of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), with endogenous sugars acting as an accelerator and exogenous nicotinamide acting as a brake. Changes in circadian oscillator period are thought to adjust the timing of biological activities through the process of entrainment, in which the circadian oscillator becomes synchronized to rhythmic signals such as light and dark cycles as well as changes in internal metabolism. To identify the molecular components associated with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic adjustment of circadian period, we performed a forward genetic screen. We identified Arabidopsis mutants that were either period insensitive to nicotinamide (<i>sin</i>) or period oversensitive to nicotinamide (<i>son</i>). We mapped <i>son1</i> to <i>BIG</i>, a gene of unknown molecular function that was shown previously to play a role in light signaling. We found that <i>son1</i> has an early entrained phase, suggesting that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic alteration of circadian period contributes to the correct timing of biological events. Our data provide insight into how the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic period adjustment of circadian oscillators contributes to establishing a correct phase relationship with the environment and show that BIG is involved in this process.</p>

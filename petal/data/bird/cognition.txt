Ranking Businesses and Municipal Locations by Spatiotemporal Cardiac Arrest Risk to Guide Public Defibrillator Placement
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Efforts to guide automated external defibrillator placement for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) treatment have focused on identifying broadly defined location categories without considering hours of operation. Broad location categories may be composed of many businesses with varying accessibility. Identifying specific locations for automated external defibrillator deployment incorporating operating hours and time of OHCA occurrence may improve automated external defibrillator accessibility. We aim to identify specific businesses and municipal locations that maximize OHCA coverage on the basis of spatiotemporal assessment of OHCA risk in the immediate vicinity of franchise locations.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This study was a retrospective population-based cohort study using data from the Toronto Regional RescuNET Epistry cardiac arrest database. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed all nontraumatic public OHCAs occurring in Toronto, ON, Canada, from January 2007 through December 2015. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed 41 unique businesses and municipal location types with ≥20 locations in Toronto from the YellowPages, Canadian Franchise Association, and the City of Toronto Open Data Portal. We obtained their geographic coordinates and hours of operation from Web sites, by phone, or in person. We determined the number of OHCAs that occurred within 100 m of each location when it was open (spatiotemporal coverage) for Toronto overall and downtown. The businesses and municipal locations were then ranked by spatiotemporal OHCA coverage. To evaluate temporal stability of the rankings, we calculated intraclass correlation of the annual coverage values.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>There were 2654 nontraumatic public OHCAs. Tim Hortons ranked first in Toronto, covering 286 OHCAs. Starbucks ranked first in downtown, covering 110 OHCAs. Coffee shops and bank machines from the 5 largest Canadian banks occupied 8 of the top 10 spots in both Toronto and downtown. The rankings exhibited high temporal stability with intraclass correlation values of 0.88 (95% confidence interval, 0.83–0.93) in Toronto and 0.79 (95% confidence interval, 0.71–0.86) in downtown.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed and ranked businesses and municipal locations by spatiotemporal OHCA risk in their immediate vicinity. This approach may help policy makers and funders to identify and prioritize potential partnerships for automated external defibrillator deployment in public-access defibrillator programs.</p></sec>

Genetic and Functional Profiling of CD16-Dependent Natural Killer Activation Identifies Patients at Higher Risk of Cardiac Allograft Vasculopathy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac transplantation is an effective therapy for end-stage heart failure. Because cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the major cause of late mortality after heart transplant (HT), there is a need to identify markers that reflect inflammatory or cytotoxic immune mechanisms contributing to its onset. Noninvasive and early stratification of patients at risk remains a challenge for adapting individualized therapy. The CD16 (Fc-gamma receptor 3A [FCGR3A]) receptor was recently <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed as a major determinant of antibody-mediated natural killer (NK) cell activation in HT biopsies; however, little is known about the role of CD16 in promoting allograft vasculopathy. This study aimed to investigate whether markers that reflect CD16-dependent circulating NK cell activation may identify patients at higher risk of developing CAV after HT.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Blood samples were collected from 103 patients undergoing routine coronarography angiography for CAV diagnosis (median 5 years since HT). Genomic and phenotypic analyses of FCGR3A/CD16 Fc-receptor profiles were compared in CAV-positive (n=52) and CAV-free patients (n=51). The levels of CD16 expression and rituximab-dependent cell cytotoxic activity of peripheral NK cells in HT recipients were evaluated using a noninvasive NK-cellular humoral activation test.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Enhanced levels of CD16 expression and antibody-dependent NK cell cytotoxic function of HT recipients were associated with the FCGR3A-VV genotype. The frequency of the FCGR3A-VV genotype was significantly higher in the CAV<sup>+</sup> group (odds ratio, 3.9; <i>P</i>=0.0317) than in the CAV<sup>-</sup> group. The FCGR3A-VV genotype was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed as an independent marker correlated with the presence of CAV at the time of coronary angiography by using multivariate logistic regression models. The FCGR3A-VV genotype was also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed as a baseline-independent predictor of CAV risk (odds ratio, 4.7; <i>P</i>=0.023).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This study unravels a prominent role for the CD16-dependent NK cell activation pathway in the complex array of factors that favor the progression of transplant arteriosclerosis. It highlights the clinical potential of a noninvasive evaluation of FCGR3A/CD16 in the early stratification of CAV risk. The recognition of CD16 as a major checkpoint that controls immune surveillance may promote the design of individualized NK cell–targeted therapies to limit vascular damage in highly responsive sensitized patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Phenotypic Characterization of <i>EIF2AK4</i> Mutation Carriers in a Large Cohort of Patients Diagnosed Clinically With Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare disease with an emerging genetic basis. Heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding the bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 (<i>BMPR2</i>) are the commonest genetic cause of PAH, whereas biallelic mutations in the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 4 gene (<i>EIF2AK4</i>) are described in pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis. Here, we determine the frequency of these mutations and define the genotype-phenotype characteristics in a large cohort of patients diagnosed clinically with PAH.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Whole-genome sequencing was performed on DNA from patients with idiopathic and heritable PAH and with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis recruited to the National Institute of Health Research BioResource–Rare Diseases study. Heterozygous variants in <i>BMPR2</i> and biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> variants with a minor allele frequency of <1:10 000 in control data sets and predicted to be deleterious (by combined annotation-dependent depletion, PolyPhen-2, and <i>sorting intolerant from tolerant</i> predictions) were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed as potentially causal. Phenotype data from the time of diagnosis were also captured.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Eight hundred sixty-four patients with idiopathic or heritable PAH and 16 with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis were recruited. Mutations in <i>BMPR2</i> were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed in 130 patients (14.8%). Biallelic mutations in <i>EIF2AK4</i> were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed in 5 patients with a clinical diagnosis of pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis. Furthermore, 9 patients with a clinical diagnosis of PAH carried biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutations. These patients had a reduced transfer coefficient for carbon monoxide (K<sc>co</sc>; 33% [interquartile range, 30%–35%] predicted) and younger age at diagnosis (29 years; interquartile range, 23–38 years) and more interlobular septal thickening and mediastinal lymphadenopathy on computed tomography of the chest compared with patients with PAH without <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutations. However, radiological assessment alone could not accurately identify biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutation carriers. Patients with PAH with biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutations had a shorter survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutations are found in patients classified clinically as having idiopathic and heritable PAH. These patients cannot be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed reliably by computed tomography, but a low K<sc>co</sc> and a young age at diagnosis suggests the underlying molecular diagnosis. Genetic testing can identify these misclassified patients, allowing appropriate management and early referral for lung transplantation.</p></sec>

Truncation- and motif-based pan-cancer analysis reveals tumor-suppressing kinases
<p>A major challenge in cancer genomics is identifying “driver” mutations from the many neutral “passenger” mutations within a given tumor. To identify driver mutations that would otherwise be lost within mutational noise, we filtered genomic data by motifs that are critical for kinase activity. In the first step of our screen, we used data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia and The Cancer Genome Atlas to identify kinases with truncation mutations occurring within or before the kinase domain. The top 30 tumor-suppressing kinases were aligned, and hotspots for loss-of-function (LOF) mutations were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed on the basis of amino acid conservation and mutational frequency. The functional consequences of new LOF mutations were biochemically validated, and the top 15 hotspot LOF residues were used in a pan-cancer analysis to define the tumor-suppressing kinome. A ranked list revealed MAP2K7, an essential mediator of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, as a candidate tumor suppressor in gastric cancer, despite its mutational frequency falling within the mutational noise for this cancer type. The majority of mutations in MAP2K7 abolished its catalytic activity, and reactivation of the JNK pathway in gastric cancer cells harboring LOF mutations in MAP2K7 or the downstream kinase JNK suppressed clonogenicity and growth in soft agar, demonstrating the functional relevance of inactivating the JNK pathway in gastric cancer. Together, our data highlight a broadly applicable strategy to identify functional cancer driver mutations and define the JNK pathway as tumor-suppressive in gastric cancer.</p>

Single-cell methylomes identify neuronal subtypes and regulatory elements in mammalian cortex
<p>The mammalian brain contains diverse neuronal types, yet we lack single-cell epigenomic assays that are able to identify and characterize them. DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic mark that distinguishes cell types and marks regulatory elements. We generated >6000 methylomes from single neuronal nuclei and used them to identify 16 mouse and 21 human neuronal subpopulations in the frontal cortex. CG and non-CG methylation exhibited cell type–specific distributions, and we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed regulatory elements with differential methylation across neuron types.

Identification of Genes Related to Cold Tolerance and a Functional Allele That Confers Cold Tolerance
<p>Cold stress is a major factor limiting rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) production worldwide, especially at the seedling and booting stages. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>cation of genes associated with cold tolerance (CT) in rice is important for sustainable food production. Here, we report the results of a genome-wide association study to identify the genetic loci associated with CT by using a 1,033-accession diversity panel. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed five CT-related genetic loci at the booting stage. Accessions carrying multiple cold-tolerant alleles displayed a higher seed-setting rate than did accessions that had no cold-tolerant alleles or carried a single allele. At the seedling stage, eight genetic loci related to CT have been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed. Among these, <i>LOC_Os10g34840</i> was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed as the candidate gene for the <i>qPSR10</i> genetic locus that is associated with CT in rice seedlings. A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), SNP2<sup>G</sup>, at position 343 in <i>LOC_Os10g34840</i> is responsible for conferring CT at the seedling stage in rice. Further analysis of the haplotype network revealed that SNP2<sup>G</sup> was present in 80.08% of the temperate <i>japonica</i> accessions but only 3.8% of the <i>indica</i> ones. We used marker-assisted selection to construct a series of BC<sub>4</sub>F<sub>3</sub> near-isogenic lines possessing the cold-tolerant allele SNP2<sup>G</sup>. When subjected to cold stress, plants carrying SNP2<sup>G</sup> survived better as seedlings and showed higher grain weight than plants carrying the SNP2<sup>A</sup> allele. The CT-related loci <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed here and the functional verification of <i>LOC_Os10g34840</i> will provide genetic resources for breeding cold-tolerant varieties and for studying the molecular basis of CT in rice.</p>

MicroRNA-Based Therapy of GATA2-Deficient Vascular Disease

Endogenous short interfering RNA–mediated knockdown and lentiviral-based overexpression were applied to decipher the capacity of GATA2 in regulating cell viability and capillary formation. Next, the GATA2-dependent miR transcriptome was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed by using a profiling approach on the basis of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Transcriptional control of miR promoters was assessed via chromatin immunoprecipitation, luciferase promoter assays, and bisulfite sequencing analysis of sites in proximity.

Specifically, proangiogenic miR-126 was regulated by GATA2 transcriptionally and targeted antiangiogenic SPRED1 and FOXO3a contributing to GATA2-mediated formation of normal vascular structures, whereas GATA2 deficiency led to vascular abnormalities. In contrast to GATA2 deficiency, supplementation with miR-126 normalized vascular function and expression profiles of cytokines contributing to proangiogenic paracrine effects. GATA2 silencing resulted in endothelial DNA hypomethylation leading to induced expression of antiangiogenic miR-221 by GATA2-dependent demethylation of a putative CpG island in the miR-221 promoter. Mechanistically, a reverted GATA2 phenotype by endogenous suppression of miR-221 was mediated through direct proangiogenic miR-221 target genes ICAM1 and ETS1. In a mouse model of carotid injury, GATA2 was reduced, and systemic supplementation of miR-126–coupled nanoparticles enhanced miR-126 availability in the carotid artery and improved reendothelialization of injured carotid arteries in vivo.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>GATA2-mediated regulation of miR-126 and miR-221 has an important impact on endothelial biology.

CDK12-mediated transcriptional regulation of noncanonical NF-κB components is essential for signaling
<p>Members of the family of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) transcription factors are critical for multiple cellular processes, including regulating innate and adaptive immune responses, cell proliferation, and cell survival. Canonical NF-κB complexes are retained in the cytoplasm by the inhibitory protein IκBα, whereas noncanonical NF-κB complexes are retained by p100. Although activation of canonical NF-κB signaling through the IκBα kinase complex is well studied, few regulators of the NF-κB–inducing kinase (NIK)–dependent processing of noncanonical p100 to p52 and the subsequent nuclear translocation of p52 have been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed.

Proteomic analysis of S-nitrosylated nuclear proteins in rat cortical neurons
<p>Neurons modulate gene expression in response to extrinsic signals to enable brain development, cognition, and learning and to process stimuli that regulate systemic physiological functions. This signal-to-gene communication is facilitated by posttranslational modifications such as S-nitrosylation, the covalent attachment of a nitric oxide (NO) moiety to cysteine thiols. In the cerebral cortex, S-nitrosylation of histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) is required for gene transcription during neuronal development, but few other nuclear targets of S-nitrosylation have been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed to date. We used S-nitrosothiol resin-assisted capture on NO donor-treated nuclear extracts from rat cortical neurons and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed 614 S-nitrosylated nuclear proteins. Of these, 131 proteins have not previously been shown to be S-nitrosylated in any system, and 555 are previously un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed targets of S-nitrosylation in neurons. The sites of S-nitrosylation were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed for 59% of the targets, and motifs containing single lysines were found at 33% of these sites. In addition, lysine motifs were necessary for promoting the S-nitrosylation of HDAC2 and methyl-CpG binding protein 3 (MBD3). Moreover, S-nitrosylation of the histone-binding protein RBBP7 was necessary for dendritogenesis of cortical neurons in culture. Together, our findings characterize S-nitrosylated nuclear proteins in neurons and identify S-nitrosylation motifs that may be shared with other targets of NO signaling.</p>

Genome-wide functional analysis reveals central signaling regulators of lymphatic endothelial cell migration and remodeling
<p>Lymphatic vessels constitute a specialized vasculature that is involved in development, cancer, obesity, and immune regulation. The migration of lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) is critical for vessel growth (lymphangiogenesis) and vessel remodeling, processes that modify the lymphatic network in response to developmental or pathological demands. Using the publicly accessible results of our genome-wide siRNA screen, we characterized the migratome of primary human LECs and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed individual genes and signaling pathways that regulate LEC migration. We compared our data set with mRNA differential expression data from endothelial and stromal cells derived from two in vivo models of lymphatic vessel remodeling, viral infection and contact hypersensitivity–induced inflammation, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed genes selectively involved in regulating LEC migration and remodeling. We also characterized the top candidates in the LEC migratome in primary blood vascular endothelial cells to identify genes with functions common to lymphatic and blood vascular endothelium. On the basis of these analyses, we showed that <i>LGALS1</i>, which encodes the glycan-binding protein Galectin-1, promoted lymphatic vascular growth in vitro and in vivo and contributed to maintenance of the lymphatic endothelial phenotype. Our results provide insight into the signaling networks that control lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic remodeling and potentially identify therapeutic targets and biomarkers in disease specific to lymphatic or blood vessels.</p>

Comparative Transcriptomic Analysis Provides Insight into the Domestication and Improvement of Pear (<i>P. pyrifolia</i>) Fruit
<p>Knowledge of the genetic changes that occurred during the domestication and improvement of perennial trees at the RNA level is limited. Here, we used RNA sequencing analysis to compare representative sets of wild, landrace, and improved accessions of pear (<i>Pyrus pyrifolia</i>) to gain insight into the genetic changes associated with domestication and improvement. A close population relationship and similar nucleotide diversity was observed between the wild and landrace groups, whereas the improved group had substantially reduced nucleotide diversity. A total of 11.13 Mb of genome sequence was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed as bearing the signature of selective sweeps that occurred during pear domestication, whereas a distinct and smaller set of genomic regions (4.04 Mb) was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed as being associated with subsequent improvement efforts. The expression diversity of selected genes exhibited a 20.89% reduction from the wild group to the landrace group, but a 23.13% recovery was observed from the landrace to the improved group, showing a distinctly different pattern with variation of sequence diversity. Module-trait association analysis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed 16 distinct coexpression modules, six of which were highly associated with important fruit traits. The candidate trait-linked differentially expressed genes associated with stone cell formation, fruit size, and sugar content were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed in the selected regions, and many of these could also be mapped to the previously reported quantitative trait loci. Thus, our study reveals the specific pattern of domestication and improvement of perennial trees at the transcriptome level, and provides valuable genetic sources of fruit traits that could contribute to pear breeding and improvement.</p>

HCN Regulates Cellular Processes through Posttranslational Modification of Proteins by <i>S-</i>cyanylation
<p>Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) is coproduced with ethylene in plant cells and is primarily enzymatically detoxified by the mitochondrial β-CYANOALANINE SYNTHASE (CAS-C1). Permanent or transient depletion of CAS-C1 activity in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) results in physiological alterations in the plant that suggest that HCN acts as a gasotransmitter molecule. Label-free quantitative proteomic analysis of mitochondrially enriched samples isolated from the wild type and <i>cas-c1</i> mutant revealed significant changes in protein content, identifying 451 proteins that are absent or less abundant in <i>cas-c1</i> and 353 proteins that are only present or more abundant in <i>cas-c1</i>. Gene ontology classification of these proteins <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed proteomic changes that explain the root hairless phenotype and the altered immune response observed in the <i>cas-c1</i> mutant. The mechanism of action of cyanide as a signaling molecule was addressed using two proteomic approaches aimed at identifying the <i>S-</i>cyanylation of Cys as a posttranslational modification of proteins. Both the 2-imino-thiazolidine chemical method and the direct untargeted analysis of proteins using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed a set of 163 proteins susceptible to <i>S-</i>cyanylation that included SEDOHEPTULOSE 1,7-BISPHOSPHATASE (SBPase), the PEPTIDYL-PROLYL CIS-TRANS ISOMERASE 20-3 (CYP20-3), and ENOLASE2 (ENO2). In vitro analysis of these enzymes showed that <i>S-</i>cyanylation of SBPase Cys<sup>74</sup>, CYP20-3 Cys<sup>259</sup>, and ENO2 Cys<sup>346</sup> residues affected their enzymatic activity. Gene Ontology classification and protein-protein interaction cluster analysis showed that <i>S-</i>cyanylation is involved in the regulation of primary metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis, and the Calvin and <i>S</i>-adenosyl-Met cycles.</p>

MAPINS, a Highly Efficient Detection Method That Identifies Insertional Mutations and Complex DNA Rearrangements
<p>Insertional mutagenesis, in which a piece of exogenous DNA is integrated randomly into the genomic DNA of the recipient cell, is a useful method to generate new mutants with phenotypes of interest. The unicellular green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> is an outstanding model for studying many biological processes. We developed a new computational algorithm, MAPINS (mapping insertions), to efficiently identify insertion sites created by the integration of an <i>APHVIII</i> (<i>aminoglycoside 3′-phosphotransferase VIII</i>) cassette that confers paromomycin resistance. Using whole-genome sequencing data, this method eliminates the need for genomic DNA manipulation and retains all the sequencing information provided by paired-end sequencing. We experimentally verified 38 insertion sites out of 41 sites (93%) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed by MAPINS from 20 paromomycin-resistant strains. Using meiotic analysis of 18 of these strains, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed insertion sites that completely cosegregate with paromomycin resistance. In six of the seven strains with a mutant phenotype, we demonstrated complete cosegregation of the mutant phenotype and the verified insertion site. In addition, we provide direct evidence of complex rearrangements of genomic DNA in five strains, three of which involve the <i>APHVIII</i> insertion site. We suggest that strains obtained by insertional mutagenesis are more complicated than expected from previous analyses in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>. To map the locations of some complex insertions, we designed 49 molecular markers based on differences <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed via whole-genome sequencing between wild-type strains CC-124 and CC-125. Overall, MAPINS provides a low-cost, efficient method to characterize insertional mutants in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>.</p>

The G Protein <i>β</i>-Subunit, AGB1, Interacts with FERONIA in RALF1-Regulated Stomatal Movement
<p>Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding (G) proteins are composed of Gα, G<i>β</i>, and Gγ subunits and function as molecular switches in signal transduction. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), there are one canonical Gα (GPA1), three extra-large Gα (XLG1, XLG2, and XLG3), one G<i>β</i> (AGB1), and three Gγ (AGG1, AGG2, and AGG3) subunits. To elucidate AGB1 molecular signaling, we performed immunoprecipitation using plasma membrane-enriched proteins followed by mass spectrometry to identify the protein interactors of AGB1. After eliminating proteins present in the control immunoprecipitation, commonly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed contaminants, and organellar proteins, a total of 103 candidate AGB1-associated proteins were confidently <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed all of the G protein subunits except XLG1, receptor-like kinases, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling-related proteins, and 14-3-3-like proteins, all of which may couple with or modulate G protein signaling. We confirmed physical interaction between AGB1 and the receptor-like kinase FERONIA (FER) using bimolecular fluorescence complementation. The Rapid Alkalinization Factor (RALF) family of polypeptides have been shown to be ligands of FER. In this study, we demonstrate that RALF1 regulates stomatal apertures and does so in a G protein-dependent manner, inhibiting stomatal opening and promoting stomatal closure in Columbia but not in <i>agb1</i> mutants. We further show that AGGs and XLGs, but not GPA1, participate in RALF1-mediated stomatal signaling. Our results suggest that FER acts as a G protein-coupled receptor for plant heterotrimeric G proteins.</p>

The Conserved and Unique Genetic Architecture of Kernel Size and Weight in Maize and Rice
<p>Maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) is a major staple crop. Maize kernel size and weight are important contributors to its yield. Here, we measured kernel length, kernel width, kernel thickness, hundred kernel weight, and kernel test weight in 10 recombinant inbred line populations and dissected their genetic architecture using three statistical models. In total, 729 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed, many of which were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed in all three models, including 22 major QTLs that each can explain more than 10% of phenotypic variation. To provide candidate genes for these QTLs, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed 30 maize genes that are orthologs of 18 rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) genes reported to affect rice seed size or weight. Interestingly, 24 of these 30 genes are located in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed QTLs or within 1 Mb of the significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We further confirmed the effects of five genes on maize kernel size/weight in an independent association mapping panel with 540 lines by candidate gene association analysis. Lastly, the function of <i>ZmINCW1</i>, a homolog of rice <i>GRAIN INCOMPLETE FILLING1</i> that affects seed size and weight, was characterized in detail. <i>ZmINCW1</i> is close to QTL peaks for kernel size/weight (less than 1 Mb) and contains significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms affecting kernel size/weight in the association panel. Overexpression of this gene can rescue the reduced weight of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) homozygous mutant line in the <i>AtcwINV2</i> gene (Arabidopsis ortholog of <i>ZmINCW1</i>). These results indicate that the molecular mechanisms affecting seed development are conserved in maize, rice, and possibly Arabidopsis.</p>

Leaf Photosynthetic Parameters Related to Biomass Accumulation in a Global Rice Diversity Survey
<p>Mining natural variations is a major approach to identify new options to improve crop light use efficiency. So far, successes in identifying photosynthetic parameters positively related to crop biomass accumulation through this approach are scarce, possibly due to the earlier emphasis on properties related to leaf instead of canopy photosynthetic efficiency. This study aims to uncover rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) natural variations to identify leaf physiological parameters that are highly correlated with biomass accumulation, a surrogate of canopy photosynthesis. To do this, we systematically investigated 14 photosynthetic parameters and four morphological traits in a rice population, which consists of 204 U.S. Department of Agriculture-curated minicore accessions collected globally and 11 elite Chinese rice cultivars in both Beijing and Shanghai. To identify key components responsible for the variance of biomass accumulation, we applied a stepwise feature-selection approach based on linear regression models. Although there are large variations in photosynthetic parameters measured in different environments, we observed that photosynthetic rate under low light (A<sub>low</sub>) was highly related to biomass accumulation and also exhibited high genomic inheritability in both environments, suggesting its great potential to be used as a target for future rice breeding programs. Large variations in A<sub>low</sub> among modern rice cultivars further suggest the great potential of using this parameter in contemporary rice breeding for the improvement of biomass and, hence, yield potential.</p>

Genome-Wide Prediction of Metabolic Enzymes, Pathways, and Gene Clusters in Plants
<p>Plant metabolism underpins many traits of ecological and agronomic importance. Plants produce numerous compounds to cope with their environments but the biosynthetic pathways for most of these compounds have not yet been elucidated. To engineer and improve metabolic traits, we need comprehensive and accurate knowledge of the organization and regulation of plant metabolism at the genome scale. Here, we present a computational pipeline to identify metabolic enzymes, pathways, and gene clusters from a sequenced genome. Using this pipeline, we generated metabolic pathway databases for 22 species and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed metabolic gene clusters from 18 species. This unified resource can be used to conduct a wide array of comparative studies of plant metabolism. Using the resource, we discovered a widespread occurrence of metabolic gene clusters in plants: 11,969 clusters from 18 species. The prevalence of metabolic gene clusters offers an intriguing possibility of an untapped source for uncovering new metabolite biosynthesis pathways. For example, more than 1,700 clusters contain enzymes that could generate a specialized metabolite scaffold (signature enzymes) and enzymes that modify the scaffold (tailoring enzymes). In four species with sufficient gene expression data, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed 43 highly coexpressed clusters that contain signature and tailoring enzymes, of which eight were characterized previously to be functional pathways. Finally, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed patterns of genome organization that implicate local gene duplication and, to a lesser extent, single gene transposition as having played roles in the evolution of plant metabolic gene clusters.</p>

A Cysteine-Rich Protein Kinase Associates with a Membrane Immune Complex and the Cysteine Residues Are Required for Cell Death

We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed multiple receptor-like protein kinases changing in abundance, including cysteine (Cys)-rich receptor-like kinases (CRKs) that are up-regulated upon the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">percept</span></strong>ion of flagellin. CRKs possess extracellular Cys-rich domains and constitute a gene family consisting of 46 members in Arabidopsis. The single transfer DNA insertion lines <i>CRK28</i> and <i>CRK29</i>, two CRKs induced in response to flagellin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">percept</span></strong>ion, did not exhibit robust alterations in immune responses. In contrast, silencing of multiple bacterial flagellin-induced CRKs resulted in enhanced susceptibility to pathogenic <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i>, indicating functional redundancy in this large gene family. Enhanced expression of <i>CRK28</i> in Arabidopsis increased disease resistance to <i>P. syringae</i>. Expression of <i>CRK28</i> in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> induced cell death, which required intact extracellular Cys residues and a conserved kinase active site. CRK28-mediated cell death required the common receptor-like protein kinase coreceptor BAK1. CRK28 associated with BAK1 as well as the activated FLAGELLIN-SENSING2 (FLS2) immune receptor complex. CRK28 self-associated as well as associated with the closely related CRK29.

Identification of Phosphorylation Sites Altering Pollen Soluble Inorganic Pyrophosphatase Activity<xref><sup>[CC-BY]</sup></xref>
<p>Protein phosphorylation regulates numerous cellular processes. Identifying the substrates and protein kinases involved is vital to understand how these important posttranslational modifications modulate biological function in eukaryotic cells. Pyrophosphatases catalyze the hydrolysis of inorganic phosphate (PP<sub>i</sub>) to inorganic phosphate P<sub>i</sub>, driving biosynthetic reactions; they are essential for low cytosolic inorganic phosphate. It was suggested recently that posttranslational regulation of Family I soluble inorganic pyrophosphatases (sPPases) may affect their activity. We previously demonstrated that two pollen-expressed sPPases, Pr-p26.1a and Pr-p26.1b, from the flowering plant <i>Papaver rhoeas</i> were inhibited by phosphorylation. Despite the potential significance, there is a paucity of data on sPPase phosphorylation and regulation. Here, we used liquid chromatographic tandem mass spectrometry to map phosphorylation sites to the otherwise divergent amino-terminal extensions on these pollen sPPases. Despite the absence of reports in the literature on mapping phosphorylation sites on sPPases, a database survey of various proteomes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed a number of examples, suggesting that phosphorylation may be a more widely used mechanism to regulate these enzymes. Phosphomimetic mutants of Pr-p26.1a/b significantly and differentially reduced PPase activities by up to 2.5-fold at pH 6.8 and 52% in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and hydrogen peroxide over unmodified proteins. This indicates that phosphoregulation of key sites can inhibit the catalytic responsiveness of these proteins in concert with key intracellular events. As sPPases are essential for many metabolic pathways in eukaryotic cells, our findings identify the phosphorylation of sPPases as a potential master regulatory mechanism that could be used to attenuate metabolism.</p>

Identification and Characterization of Arabidopsis Seed Coat Mucilage Proteins
<p>Plant cell wall proteins are important regulators of cell wall architecture and function. However, because cell wall proteins are difficult to extract and analyze, they are generally poorly understood. Here, we describe the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>cation and characterization of proteins integral to the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed coat mucilage, a specialized layer of the extracellular matrix composed of plant cell wall carbohydrates that is used as a model for cell wall research. The proteins <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed in mucilage include those previously <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed by genetic analysis, and several mucilage proteins are reduced in mucilage-deficient mutant seeds, suggesting that these proteins are genuinely associated with the mucilage. Arabidopsis mucilage has both nonadherent and adherent layers. Both layers have similar protein profiles except for proteins involved in lipid metabolism, which are present exclusively in the adherent mucilage. The most abundant mucilage proteins include a family of proteins named TESTA ABUNDANT1 (TBA1) to TBA3; a less abundant fourth homolog was named TBA-LIKE (TBAL). <i>TBA</i> and <i>TBAL</i> transcripts and promoter activities were detected in developing seed coats, and their expression requires seed coat differentiation regulators. TBA proteins are secreted to the mucilage pocket during differentiation. Although reverse genetics failed to identify a function for TBAs/TBAL, the <i>TBA</i> promoters are highly expressed and cell type specific and so should be very useful tools for targeting proteins to the seed coat epidermis. Altogether, these results highlight the mucilage proteome as a model for cell walls in general, as it shares similarities with other cell wall proteomes while also containing mucilage-specific features.</p>

Validating Genome-Wide Association Candidates Controlling Quantitative Variation in Nodulation
<p>Genome-wide association (GWA) studies offer the opportunity to identify genes that contribute to naturally occurring variation in quantitative traits. However, GWA relies exclusively on statistical association, so functional validation is necessary to make strong claims about gene function. We used a combination of gene-disruption platforms (Tnt1 retrotransposons, hairpin RNA-interference constructs, and CRISPR/Cas9 nucleases) together with randomized, well-replicated experiments to evaluate the function of genes that an earlier GWA study in <i>Medicago truncatula</i> had <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed as candidates contributing to variation in the symbiosis between legumes and rhizobia. We evaluated ten candidate genes found in six clusters of strongly associated single nucleotide polymorphisms, selected on the basis of their strength of statistical association, proximity to annotated gene models, and root or nodule expression. We found statistically significant effects on nodule production for three candidate genes, each validated in two independent mutants. Annotated functions of these three genes suggest their contributions to quantitative variation in nodule production occur through processes not previously connected to nodulation, including phosphorous supply and salicylic acid-related defense response. These results demonstrate the utility of GWA combined with reverse mutagenesis technologies to discover and validate genes contributing to naturally occurring variation in quantitative traits. The results highlight the potential for GWA to complement forward genetics in identifying the genetic basis of ecologically and economically important traits.</p>

Systems Genetics Identifies a Novel Regulatory Domain of Amylose Synthesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>

A systems genetics approach that interrelates starch structure data from GWAS to functional pathways from a gene regulatory network <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed known genes with high correlation to the proportion of amylose and amylopectin. An SNP in the promoter region of <i>Granule Bound Starch Synthase I</i> was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed along with seven other SNPs to form haplotypes that discriminate samples into different phenotypic ranges of amylose. A GWAS peak on chromosome 7 between LOC_Os07g11020 and LOC_Os07g11520 indexed by a nonsynonymous SNP mutation on exon 5 of a bHLH transcription factor was found to elevate the proportion of amylose at the expense of reduced short-chain amylopectin. Linking starch structure with starch digestibility by determining the kinetics of cooked grain amylolysis of selected haplotypes revealed strong association of starch structure with estimated digestibility kinetics. Combining all results from grain quality genomics, systems genetics, and digestibility phenotyping, we propose target haplotypes for fine-tuning starch structure in rice through marker-assisted breeding that can be used to alter the digestibility of rice grain, thus offering rice consumers a new diet-based intervention to mitigate the impact of nutrition-related noncommunicable diseases.</p>

Genetic Architecture of Flowering-Time Variation in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i><xref><sup>1</sup></xref>

Here, we report new insights into the genetic control of natural variation in flowering time in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>, a nondomesticated pooid grass closely related to cereals such as wheat (<i>Triticum</i> spp.) and barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i> L.). A recombinant inbred line population derived from a cross between the rapid-flowering accession Bd21 and the delayed-flowering accession Bd1-1 were grown in a variety of environmental conditions to enable exploration of the genetic architecture of flowering time. A genotyping-by-sequencing approach was used to develop SNP markers for genetic map construction, and quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that control differences in flowering time were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed. Many of the flowering-time QTLs are detected across a range of photoperiod and vernalization conditions, suggesting that the genetic control of flowering within this population is robust. The two major QTLs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed in undomesticated <i>B. distachyon</i> colocalize with <i>VERNALIZATION1/PHYTOCHROME C</i> and <i>VERNALIZATION2</i>, loci <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed as flowering regulators in the domesticated crops wheat and barley. This suggests that variation in flowering time is controlled in part by a set of genes broadly conserved within pooid grasses.</p>

Analysis of Arabidopsis Accessions Hypersensitive to a Loss of Chloroplast Translation
<p>Natural accessions of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) differ in their ability to tolerate a loss of chloroplast translation. These differences can be attributed in part to variation in a duplicated nuclear gene (<i>ACC2</i>) that targets homomeric acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACCase) to plastids. This functional redundancy allows limited fatty acid biosynthesis to occur in the absence of heteromeric ACCase, which is encoded in part by the plastid genome. In the presence of functional <i>ACC2</i>, tolerant alleles of several nuclear genes, not yet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed, enhance the growth of seedlings and embryos disrupted in chloroplast translation. <i>ACC2</i> knockout mutants, by contrast, are hypersensitive. Here we describe an expanded search for hypersensitive accessions of Arabidopsis, evaluate whether all of these accessions are defective in <i>ACC2</i>, and characterize genotype-to-phenotype relationships for homomeric ACCase variants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed among 855 accessions with sequenced genomes. Null alleles with <i>ACC2</i> nonsense mutations, frameshift mutations, small deletions, genomic rearrangements, and defects in RNA splicing are included among the most sensitive accessions examined. By contrast, most missense mutations affecting highly conserved residues failed to eliminate ACC2 function. Several accessions were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed where sensitivity could not be attributed to a defect in either ACC2 or Tic20-IV, the chloroplast membrane channel required for ACC2 uptake. Overall, these results underscore the central role of <i>ACC2</i> in mediating Arabidopsis response to a loss of chloroplast translation, highlight future applications of this system to analyzing chloroplast protein import, and provide valuable insights into the mutational landscape of an important metabolic enzyme that is highly conserved throughout eukaryotes.</p>

Genetic Bases of Fungal White Rot Wood Decay Predicted by Phylogenomic Analysis of Correlated Gene-Phenotype Evolution
<p>Fungal decomposition of plant cell walls (PCW) is a complex process that has diverse industrial applications and huge impacts on the carbon cycle. White rot (WR) is a powerful mode of PCW decay in which lignin and carbohydrates are both degraded. Mechanistic studies of decay coupled with comparative genomic analyses have provided clues to the enzymatic components of WR systems and their evolutionary origins, but the complete suite of genes necessary for WR remains undetermined. Here, we use phylogenomic comparative methods, which we validate through simulations, to identify shifts in gene family diversification rates that are correlated with evolution of WR, using data from 62 fungal genomes. We detected 409 gene families that appear to be evolutionarily correlated with WR. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed gene families encode well-characterized decay enzymes, e.g., fungal class II peroxidases and cellobiohydrolases, and enzymes involved in import and detoxification pathways, as well as 73 gene families that have no functional annotation. About 310 of the 409 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed gene families are present in the genome of the model WR fungus <i>Phanerochaete chrysosporium</i> and 192 of these (62%) have been shown to be upregulated under ligninolytic culture conditions, which corroborates the phylogeny-based functional inferences. These results illuminate the complexity of WR and suggest that its evolution has involved a general elaboration of the decay apparatus, including numerous gene families with as-yet unknown exact functions.</p>

Intriguingly, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed unusual expanded long terminal repeats (LTRs) with higher nucleotide substitution rates than in many other teleosts, suggesting their more recent insertion into the <i>L. waleckii</i> genome. We also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed expansions in genes encoding egg coat proteins and natriuretic peptide receptors, possibly underlying the adaptation to extreme environmental stress. We further sequenced the genomes of 10 additional individuals from freshwater and 18 from Lake Dali Nur populations, and we detected a total of 7.6 million SNPs from both populations. In a genome scan and comparison of these two populations, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed a set of genomic regions under selective sweeps that harbor genes involved in ion homoeostasis, acid-base regulation, unfolded protein response, reactive oxygen species elimination, and urea excretion. Our findings provide comprehensive insight into the genomic mechanisms of teleost fish that underlie their adaptation to extreme alkaline environments.</p>

CTDGFinder: A Novel Homology-Based Algorithm for Identifying Closely Spaced Clusters of Tandemly Duplicated Genes
<p>Closely spaced clusters of tandemly duplicated genes (CTDGs) contribute to the diversity of many phenotypes, including chemosensation, snake venom, and animal body plans. CTDGs have traditionally been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed subjectively as genomic neighborhoods containing several gene duplicates in close proximity; however, CTDGs are often highly variable with respect to gene number, intergenic distance, and synteny. This lack of formal definition hampers the study of CTDG evolutionary dynamics and the discovery of novel CTDGs in the exponentially growing body of genomic data. To address this gap, we developed a novel homology-based algorithm, CTDGFinder, which formalizes and automates the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>cation of CTDGs by examining the physical distribution of individual members of families of duplicated genes across chromosomes. Application of CTDGFinder accurately <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed CTDGs for many well-known gene clusters (e.g., Hox and beta-globin gene clusters) in the human, mouse and 20 other mammalian genomes. Differences between previously annotated gene clusters and our inferred CTDGs were due to the exclusion of nonhomologs that have historically been considered parts of specific gene clusters, the inclusion or absence of genes between the CTDGs and their corresponding gene clusters, and the splitting of certain gene clusters into distinct CTDGs. Examination of human genes showing tissue-specific enhancement of their expression by CTDGFinder <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed members of several well-known gene clusters (e.g., cytochrome P450s and olfactory receptors) and revealed that they were unequally distributed across tissues. By formalizing and automating CTDG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>cation, CTDGFinder will facilitate understanding of CTDG evolutionary dynamics, their functional implications, and how they are associated with phenotypic diversity.</p>

Insights from the Shell Proteome: Biomineralization to Adaptation
<p>Bivalves have evolved a range of complex shell forming mechanisms that are reflected by their incredible diversity in shell mineralogy and microstructures. A suite of proteins exported to the shell matrix space plays a significant role in controlling these features, in addition to underpinning some of the physical properties of the shell itself. Although, there is a general consensus that a minimum basic protein tool kit is required for shell construction, to date, this remains undefined. In this study, the shell matrix proteins (SMPs) of four highly divergent bivalves (The Pacific oyster, <i>Crassostrea gigas</i>; the blue mussel, <i>Mytilus edulis</i>; the clam, <i>Mya truncata</i>, and the king scallop, <i>Pecten maximus</i>) were analyzed in an identical fashion using proteomics pipeline. This enabled us to identify the critical elements of a “basic tool kit” for calcification processes, which were conserved across the taxa irrespective of the shell morphology and arrangement of the crystal surfaces. In addition, protein domains controlling the crystal layers specific to aragonite and calcite were also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed. Intriguingly, a significant number of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed SMPs contained domains related to immune functions. These were often are unique to each species implying their involvement not only in immunity, but also environmental adaptation. This suggests that the SMPs are selectively exported in a complex mix to endow the shell with both mechanical protection and biochemical defense.</p>

The Evolution of Silicon Transport in Eukaryotes
<p>Biosilicification (the formation of biological structures from silica) occurs in diverse eukaryotic lineages, plays a major role in global biogeochemical cycles, and has significant biotechnological applications. Silicon (Si) uptake is crucial for biosilicification, yet the evolutionary history of the transporters involved remains poorly known. Recent evidence suggests that the SIT family of Si transporters, initially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed in diatoms, may be widely distributed, with an extended family of related transporters (SIT-Ls) present in some nonsilicified organisms. Here, we identify SITs and SIT-Ls in a range of eukaryotes, including major silicified lineages (radiolarians and chrysophytes) and also bacterial SIT-Ls. Our evidence suggests that the symmetrical 10-transmembrane-domain SIT structure has independently evolved multiple times via duplication and fusion of 5-transmembrane-domain SIT-Ls. We also identify a second gene family, similar to the active Si transporter Lsi2, that is broadly distributed amongst siliceous and nonsiliceous eukaryotes. Our analyses resolve a distinct group of Lsi2-like genes, including plant and diatom Si-responsive genes, and sequences unique to siliceous sponges and choanoflagellates. The SIT/SIT-L and Lsi2 transporter families likely contribute to biosilicification in diverse lineages, indicating an ancient role for Si transport in eukaryotes. We propose that these Si transporters may have arisen initially to prevent Si toxicity in the high Si Precambrian oceans, with subsequent biologically induced reductions in Si concentrations of Phanerozoic seas leading to widespread losses of SIT, SIT-L, and Lsi2-like genes in diverse lineages. Thus, the origin and diversification of two independent Si transporter families both drove and were driven by ancient ocean Si levels.</p>

A Photoreceptor Contributes to the Natural Variation of Diapause Induction in <i>Daphnia magna</i>
<p>Diapause is an adaptation that allows organisms to survive harsh environmental conditions. In species occurring over broad habitat ranges, both the timing and the intensity of diapause induction can vary across populations, revealing patterns of local adaptation. Understanding the genetic architecture of this fitness-related trait would help clarify how populations adapt to their local environments. In the cyclical parthenogenetic crustacean <i>Daphnia magna</i>, diapause induction is a phenotypic plastic life history trait linked to sexual reproduction, as asexual females have the ability to switch to sexual reproduction and produce resting stages, their sole strategy for surviving habitat deterioration. We have previously shown that the induction of resting stage production correlates with changes in photoperiod that indicate the imminence of habitat deterioration and have <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed a Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) responsible for some of the variation in the induction of resting stages. Here, new data allows us to anchor the QTL to a large scaffold and then, using a combination of a new mapping panel, targeted association mapping and selection analysis in natural populations, to identify candidate genes within the QTL. Our results show that variation in a rhodopsin photoreceptor gene plays a significant role in the variation observed in resting stage induction. This finding provides a mechanistic explanation for the link between diapause and day-length <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">percept</span></strong>ion that has been suggested in diverse arthropod taxa.</p>

The Developmental Brain Gene <i>NPAS3</i> Contains the Largest Number of Accelerated Regulatory Sequences in the Human Genome
<p>To identify the evolutionary genetic novelties that contributed to shape human-specific traits such as the use of a complex language, long-term planning and exceptional learning abilities is one of the ultimate frontiers of modern biology. Evolutionary signatures of functional shifts could be detected by comparing noncoding regions that are highly conserved across mammals or primates and rapidly accumulated nucleotide substitutions only in the lineage leading to humans. As gene loci densely populated with human-accelerated elements (HAEs) are more likely to have contributed to human-specific novelties, we sought to identify the transcriptional units and genomic 1 Mb intervals of the entire human genome carrying the highest number of HAEs. To this end, we took advantage of four available data sets of human genomic accelerated regions obtained through different comparisons and algorithms and performed a meta-analysis of the combined data. We found that the brain developmental transcription factor <i>neuronal PAS domain-containing protein 3</i> (<i>NPAS3</i>) contains the largest cluster of noncoding-accelerated regions in the human genome with up to 14 elements that are highly conserved in mammals, including primates, but carry human-specific nucleotide substitutions. We then tested the ability of the 14 HAEs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed at the <i>NPAS3</i> locus to act as transcriptional regulatory sequences in a reporter expression assay performed in transgenic zebrafish. We found that 11 out of the 14 HAEs present in <i>NPAS3</i> act as transcriptional enhancers during development, particularly within the nervous system. As <i>NPAS3</i> is known to play a crucial role during mammalian brain development, our results indicate that the high density of HAEs present in the human <i>NPAS3</i> locus could have modified the spatiotemporal expression pattern of <i>NPAS3</i> in the developing human brain and, therefore, contributed to human brain evolution.</p>

Unsatisfactory outcomes following unicompartmental knee arthroplasty in patients with partial thickness cartilage loss
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>While medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is indicated   for patients with full-thickness cartilage loss, it is occasionally   used to treat those with partial-thickness loss. The aim of this   study was to investigate the five-year outcomes in a consecutive   series of UKAs used in patients with partial thickness cartilage   loss in the medial compartment of the knee.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between 2002 and 2014, 94 consecutive UKAs were undertaken in   90 patients with partial thickness cartilage loss and followed up   independently for a mean of six years (1 to 13). These patients   had partial thickness cartilage loss either on both femur and tibia   (13 knees), or on either the femur or the tibia, with full thickness   loss on the other surface of the joint (18 and 63 knees respectively).   Using propensity score analysis, these patients were matched 1:2 based   on age, gender and pre-operative Oxford Knee Score (OKS) with knees   with full thickness loss on both the femur and tibia. The functional   outcomes, implant survival and incidence of re-operations were assessed   at one, two and five years post-operatively. A subgroup of 36 knees   in 36 patients with partial thickness cartilage loss, who had pre-operative   MRI scans, was assessed to identify whether there were any factors   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed on MRI that predicted the outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Knees with partial thickness cartilage loss had significantly   worse functional outcomes at one, two and five years post-operatively   compared with those with full thickness loss. A quarter of knees   with partial thickness loss had a fair or poor result and a fifth   failed to achieve a clinically significant improvement in OKS from   a baseline of four points or more; double that seen in knees with   full thickness loss. Whilst there was no difference in implant survival between   the groups, the rate of re-operation in knees with partial thickness   loss was three times higher. Most of the re-operations (three-quarters),   were arthroscopies for persistent pain.</p><p>Compared with those achieving good or excellent outcomes, patients   with partial thickness cartilage loss who achieved fair or poor   outcomes were younger and had worse pre-operative functional scores.   However, there were no other differences in the baseline demographics.   MRI findings of full thickness cartilage loss, subchondral oedema,   synovitis or effusion did not provide additional prognostic information.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Medial UKA should be reserved for patients with full thickness   cartilage loss on both the femur and tibia. Whilst some patients   with partial thickness loss achieve a good result we cannot currently   identify which these will be and in this situation MRI is unhelpful   and misleading.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:475–82.</p></sec>

Ultra-deep sequencing of ribosome-associated poly-adenylated RNA in early <i>Drosophila</i> embryos reveals hundreds of conserved translated sORFs
<p>There is growing recognition that small open reading frames (sORFs) encoding peptides shorter than 100 amino acids are an important class of functional elements in the eukaryotic genome, with several already <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed to play critical roles in growth, development, and disease. However, our understanding of their biological importance has been hindered owing to the significant technical challenges limiting their annotation. Here we combined ultra-deep sequencing of ribosome-associated poly-adenylated RNAs with rigorous conservation analysis to identify a comprehensive population of translated sORFs during early <i>Drosophila</i> embryogenesis. In total, we identify 399 sORFs, including those previously annotated but without evidence of translational capacity, those found within transcripts previously classified as non-coding, and those not previously known to be transcribed. Further, we find, for the first time, evidence for translation of many sORFs with different isoforms, suggesting their regulation is as complex as longer ORFs. Furthermore, many sORFs are found not associated with ribosomes in late-stage <i>Drosophila</i> S2 cells, suggesting that many of the translated sORFs may have stage-specific functions during embryogenesis. These results thus provide the first comprehensive annotation of the sORFs present during early <i>Drosophila</i> embryogenesis, a necessary basis for a detailed delineation of their function in embryogenesis and other biological processes.</p>

A Comprehensive Expression Profile of MicroRNAs and Other Classes of Non-Coding Small RNAs in Barley Under Phosphorous-Deficient and -Sufficient Conditions
<p>Phosphorus (P) is essential for plant growth. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a key role in phosphate homeostasis. However, little is known about P effect on miRNA expression in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i> L.). In this study, we used Illumina's next-generation sequencing technology to sequence small RNAs (sRNAs) in barley grown under P-deficient and P-sufficient conditions. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed 221 conserved miRNAs and 12 novel miRNAs, of which 55 were only present in P-deficient treatment while 32 only existed in P-sufficient treatment. Total 47 miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed between the two P treatments (|log<sub>2</sub>| > 1). We also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed many other classes of sRNAs, including sense and antisense sRNAs, repeat-associated sRNAs, transfer RNA (tRNA)-derived sRNAs and chloroplast-derived sRNAs, and some of which were also significantly differentially expressed between the two P treatments. Of all the sRNAs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed, antisense sRNAs were the most abundant sRNA class in both P treatments. Surprisingly, about one-fourth of sRNAs were derived from the chloroplast genome, and a chloroplast-encoded tRNA-derived sRNA was the most abundant sRNA of all the sRNAs sequenced. Our data provide valuable clues for understanding the properties of sRNAs and new insights into the potential roles of miRNAs and other classes of sRNAs in the control of phosphate homeostasis.</p>

WT1 regulates the development of the posterior taste field
<p>Despite the importance of taste in determining nutrient intake, our understanding of the processes that control the development of the peripheral taste system is lacking. Several early regulators of taste development have been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed, including sonic hedgehog, bone morphogenetic protein 4 and multiple members of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. However, the regulation of these factors, including their induction, remains poorly understood. Here, we identify a crucial role for the Wilms' tumor 1 protein (WT1) in circumvallate (CV) papillae development. WT1 is a transcription factor that is important in the normal development of multiple tissues, including both the olfactory and visual systems. In mice, WT1 expression is detectable by E12.5, when the CV taste placode begins to form. In mice lacking WT1, the CV fails to develop normally and markers of early taste development are dysregulated compared with wild type. We demonstrate that expression of the WT1 target genes <i>Lef1</i>, <i>Ptch1</i> and <i>Bmp4</i> is significantly reduced in developing tongue tissue derived from <i>Wt1</i> knockout mice and that, in normal tongue, WT1 is bound to the promoter regions of these genes. Moreover, siRNA knockdown of WT1 in cultured taste cells leads to a reduction in the expression of <i>Lef1</i> and <i>Ptch1</i>. Our data identify WT1 as a crucial transcription factor in the development of the CV through the regulation of multiple signaling pathways that have established roles in the formation and patterning of taste placodes.</p>

Resuscitation teams at top-performing hospitals demonstrated the following features: dedicated or designated resuscitation teams; participation of diverse disciplines as team members during IHCA; clear roles and responsibilities of team members; better communication and leadership during IHCA; and in-depth mock codes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Resuscitation teams at hospitals with high IHCA survival differ from non–top-performing hospitals. Our findings suggest core elements of successful resuscitation teams that are associated with better outcomes and form the basis for future work to improve IHCA.</p></sec>

Increased Cardiac Arrhythmogenesis Associated With Gap Junction Remodeling With Upregulation of RNA-Binding Protein FXR1
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Gap junction remodeling is well established as a consistent feature of human heart disease involving spontaneous ventricular arrhythmia. The mechanisms responsible for gap junction remodeling that include alterations in the distribution of, and protein expression within, gap junctions are still debated. Studies reveal that multiple transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulatory pathways are triggered in response to cardiac disease, such as those involving RNA-binding proteins. The expression levels of FXR1 (fragile X mental retardation autosomal homolog 1), an RNA-binding protein, are critical to maintain proper cardiac muscle function; however, the connection between FXR1 and disease is not clear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To identify the mechanisms regulating gap junction remodeling in cardiac disease, we sought to identify the functional properties of FXR1 expression, direct targets of FXR1 in human left ventricle dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) biopsy samples and mouse models of DCM through BioID proximity assay and RNA immunoprecipitation, how FXR1 regulates its targets through RNA stability and luciferase assays, and functional consequences of altering the levels of this important RNA-binding protein through the analysis of cardiac-specific FXR1 knockout mice and mice injected with 3xMyc-FXR1 adeno-associated virus.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>FXR1 expression is significantly increased in tissue samples from human and mouse models of DCM via Western blot analysis. FXR1 associates with intercalated discs, and integral gap junction proteins Cx43 (connexin 43), Cx45 (connexin 45), and ZO-1 (zonula occludens-1) were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed as novel mRNA targets of FXR1 by using a BioID proximity assay and RNA immunoprecipitation. Our findings show that FXR1 is a multifunctional protein involved in translational regulation and stabilization of its mRNA targets in heart muscle. In addition, introduction of 3xMyc-FXR1 via adeno-associated virus into mice leads to the redistribution of gap junctions and promotes ventricular tachycardia, showing the functional significance of FXR1 upregulation observed in DCM.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In DCM, increased FXR1 expression appears to play an important role in disease progression by regulating gap junction remodeling. Together this study provides a novel function of FXR1, namely, that it directly regulates major gap junction components, contributing to proper cell-cell communication in the heart.</p></sec>

High-Sensitivity Cardiac Troponin and the Risk Stratification of Patients With Renal Impairment Presenting With Suspected Acute Coronary Syndrome
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>High-sensitivity cardiac troponin testing may improve the risk stratification and diagnosis of myocardial infarction, but concentrations can be challenging to interpret in patients with renal impairment, and the effectiveness of testing in this group is uncertain.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a prospective multicenter study of consecutive patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome, we evaluated the performance of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I in those with and without renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>). The negative predictive value and sensitivity of troponin concentrations below the risk stratification threshold (5 ng/L) at presentation were reported for a primary outcome of index type 1 myocardial infarction, or type 1 myocardial infarction or cardiac death at 30 days. The positive predictive value and specificity at the 99th centile diagnostic threshold (16 ng/L in women, 34 ng/L in men) was determined for index type 1 myocardial infarction. Subsequent type 1 myocardial infarction and cardiac death were reported at 1 year.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 4726 patients <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed, 904 (19%) had renal impairment. Troponin concentrations <5 ng/L at presentation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed 17% of patients with renal impairment as low risk for the primary outcome (negative predictive value, 98.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 96.0%–99.7%; sensitivity 98.9%; 95%CI, 97.5%–99.9%), in comparison with 56% without renal impairment (<i>P</i><0.001) with similar performance (negative predictive value, 99.7%; 95% CI, 99.4%–99.9%; sensitivity 98.4%; 95% CI, 97.2%–99.4%). The positive predictive value and specificity at the 99th centile were lower in patients with renal impairment at 50.0% (95% CI, 45.2%–54.8%) and 70.9% (95% CI, 67.5%–74.2%), respectively, in comparison with 62.4% (95% CI, 58.8%–65.9%) and 92.1% (95% CI, 91.2%–93.0%) in those without. At 1 year, patients with troponin concentrations >99th centile and renal impairment were at greater risk of subsequent myocardial infarction or cardiac death than those with normal renal function (24% versus 10%; adjusted hazard ratio, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.54–3.11).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In suspected acute coronary syndrome, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed fewer patients with renal impairment as low risk and more as high risk, but with lower specificity for type 1 myocardial infarction. Irrespective of diagnosis, patients with renal impairment and elevated cardiac troponin concentrations had a 2-fold greater risk of a major cardiac event than those with normal renal function, and should be considered for further investigation and treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Primary Myocardial Fibrosis as an Alternative Phenotype Pathway of Inherited Cardiac Structural Disorders
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Myocardial fibrosis is a common postmortem finding among young individuals with sudden cardiac death. Because there is no known single cause, we tested the hypothesis that some cases of myocardial fibrosis in the absence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>able causes (primary myocardial fibrosis [PMF]) are associated with genetic variants.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Tissue was obtained at autopsy from 4031 consecutive individuals with sudden cardiac death in Northern Finland, among whom PMF was the only structural finding in 145 subjects with sudden cardiac death. We performed targeted next-generation sequencing using a panel of 174 genes associated with myocardial structure and ion channel function when autopsies did not identify a secondary basis for myocardial fibrosis. All variants with an effect on protein and with a minor allele frequency <0.01 were classified as pathogenic or variants of uncertain significance on the basis of American College of Medical Genetics consensus guidelines.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among the 96 specimens with DNA passing quality control (66%), postmortem genetic tests <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed 24 variants of known or uncertain significance in 26 subjects (27%). Ten were pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in 10 subjects (10%), and 14 were variants of uncertain significance in 11 genes among 16 subjects (17%). Five variants were in genes associated with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, 6 in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy–associated genes, and 11 in dilated cardiomyopathy–associated genes; 2 were not associated with these disorders. Four unique variants of uncertain significance cosegregated among multiple unrelated subjects with PMF. No pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants were detected in ion channel–encoding genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>A large proportion of subjects with PMF at autopsy had variants in genes associated with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy without autopsy findings of those diseases, suggesting that PMF can be an alternative phenotypic expression of structural disease–associated genetic variants or that risk-associated fibrosis was expressing before the primary disease. These findings have clinical implications for postmortem genetic testing and family risk profiling.</p></sec>

Prospective Countywide Surveillance and Autopsy Characterization of Sudden Cardiac Death
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Studies of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death (SCD) use emergency medical services records, death certificates, or definitions that infer cause of death; thus, the true incidence of SCD is unknown. Over 90% of SCDs occur out-of-hospital; nonforensic autopsies are rarely performed, and therefore causes of death are presumed. We conducted a medical examiner–based investigation to determine the precise incidence and autopsy-defined causes of all SCDs in an entire metropolitan area. We hypothesized that postmortem investigation would identify actual sudden arrhythmic deaths among presumed SCDs.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Between February 1, 2011, and March 1, 2014, we prospectively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed all incident deaths attributed to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (emergency medical services primary impression, cardiac arrest) between 18 to 90 years of age in San Francisco County for autopsy, toxicology, and histology via medical examiner surveillance of consecutive out-of-hospital deaths, all reported by law. We obtained comprehensive records to determine whether out-of-hospital cardiac arrest deaths met World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for SCD. We reviewed death certificates filed quarterly for missed SCDs. Autopsy-defined sudden arrhythmic deaths had no extracardiac cause of death or acute heart failure. A multidisciplinary committee adjudicated final cause.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>All 20 440 deaths were reviewed; 12 671 were unattended and reported to the medical examiner. From these, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed 912 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest deaths; 541 (59%) met WHO SCD criteria (mean 62.8 years, 69% male) and 525 (97%) were autopsied. Eighty-nine additional WHO-defined SCDs occurred within 3 weeks of active medical care with the death certificate signed by the attending physician, ineligible for autopsy but included in the countywide WHO-defined SCD incidence of 29.6/100 000 person-years, highest in black men (<i>P</i><0.0001). Of 525 WHO-defined SCDs, 301 (57%) had no cardiac history. Leading causes of death were coronary disease (32%), occult overdose (13.5%), cardiomyopathy (10%), cardiac hypertrophy (8%), and neurological (5.5%). Autopsy-defined sudden arrhythmic deaths were 55.8% (293/525) of overall, 65% (78/120) of witnessed, and 53% (215/405) of unwitnessed WHO-defined SCDs (<i>P</i>=0.024); 286 of 293 (98%) had structural cardiac disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Forty percent of deaths attributed to stated cardiac arrest were not sudden or unexpected, and nearly half of presumed SCDs were not arrhythmic. These findings have implications for the accuracy of SCDs as defined by WHO criteria or emergency medical services records in aggregate mortality data, clinical trials, and cohort studies.</p></sec>

Hospital Readmission After Perioperative Acute Myocardial Infarction Associated With Noncardiac Surgery
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a major cardiovascular complication of noncardiac surgery. We aimed to evaluate the frequency, causes, and outcomes of 30-day hospital readmission after perioperative AMI.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients who were diagnosed with AMI during hospitalization for major noncardiac surgery were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed using the 2014 US Nationwide Readmission Database. Rates, causes, and costs of 30-day readmissions after noncardiac surgery with and without perioperative AMI were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 3 807 357 hospitalizations for major noncardiac surgery, 8085 patients with perioperative AMI were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed. A total of 1135 patients (14.0%) with perioperative AMI died in-hospital during the index admission. Survivors of perioperative AMI were more likely to be readmitted within 30 days than surgical patients without perioperative AMI (19.1% versus 6.5%, <i>P</i><0.001). The most common indications for 30-day rehospitalization were management of infectious complications (30.0%), cardiovascular complications (25.3%), and bleeding (10.4%). In-hospital mortality during hospital readmission in the first 30 days after perioperative AMI was 11.3%. At 6 months, the risk of death was 17.6% and ≥1 hospital readmission was 36.2%.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among patients undergoing noncardiac surgery who develop a perioperative MI, ≈1 in 3 suffer from in-hospital death or hospital readmission in the first 30 days after discharge. Strategies to improve outcomes of surgical patients early after perioperative AMI are warranted.</p></sec>

Functional Metabolomics Characterizes a Key Role for <i>N</i>-Acetylneuraminic Acid in Coronary Artery Diseases
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>As new biomarkers of coronary artery diseases (CAD) emerge via metabolomics, the underlying functional mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Functional metabolomics aims to translate metabolomics-derived biomarkers to disease mechanisms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A cohort of 2324 patients who underwent coronary angiography from 4 independent centers was studied. A combination of ultra–performance liquid chromatography and quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry in the negative ion mode was used for untargeted analysis of metabolites in plasma. Significant differential metabolites were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed by cross-comparisons with and within CAD types, including normal coronary artery, nonobstructvie coronary atherosclerosis, stable angina, unstable angina, and acute myocardial infarction. A tandem liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry–based approach using isotope-labeled standard addition was subsequently performed for targeted analysis of the metabolic marker <i>N</i>-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac). A functional metabolomics strategy was proposed to investigate the role of Neu5Ac in the progression of CAD by using in vitro and in vivo models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed a total of 36 differential metabolites, 35 of which were confirmed with reference compounds. Elevation of Neu5Ac was observed in plasma during CAD progression in center 1 (<i>P</i>=4.0e-64, n=2019) and replicated in 3 independent centers (n=305). The increased level of Neu5Ac in plasma was confirmed by accurate targeted quantification. Mechanistically, Neu5Ac was able to trigger myocardial injury in vitro and in vivo by activation of the Rho/Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase signaling pathway through binding to RhoA and Cdc42, but not Rac1. Silencing neuraminidase-1, the enzyme that regulates Neu5Ac generation, ameliorated oxygen-glucose deprivation–induced injury in cardiomyocytes and ligation/isoprenaline-induced myocardial ischemia injury in rats. Pharmacological inhibition of neuraminidase by anti-influenza drugs, oseltamivir and zanamivir, also protected cardiomyocytes and the heart from myocardial injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Functional metabolomics <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed a key role for Neu5Ac in acute myocardial infarction, and targeting neuraminidase-1 may represent an unrecognized therapeutic intervention for CAD.</p></sec>

Discovering relationships between nuclear receptor signaling pathways, genes, and tissues in Transcriptomine
<p>We previously developed a web tool, Transcriptomine, to explore expression profiling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> sets involving small-molecule or genetic manipulations of nuclear receptor signaling pathways. We describe advances in biocuration, query interface design, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> visualization that enhance the discovery of uncharacterized biology in these pathways using this tool. Transcriptomine currently contains about 45 million <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> points encompassing more than 2000 experiments in a reference library of nearly 550 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> sets <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retriev</span></strong>ed from public archives and systematically curated. To make the underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> points more accessible to bench biologists, we classified experimental small molecules and gene manipulations into signaling pathways and experimental tissues and cell lines into physiological systems and organs. Incorporation of these mappings into Transcriptomine enables the user to readily evaluate tissue-specific regulation of gene expression by nuclear receptor signaling pathways. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> points from animal and cell model experiments and from clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> sets elucidate the roles of nuclear receptor pathways in gene expression events accompanying various normal and pathological cellular processes. In addition, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> sets targeting non-nuclear receptor signaling pathways highlight transcriptional cross-talk between nuclear receptors and other signaling pathways. We demonstrate with specific examples how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> points that exist in isolation in individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> sets validate each other when connected and made accessible to the user in a single interface. In summary, Transcriptomine allows bench biologists to routinely develop research hypotheses, validate experimental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong>, or model relationships between signaling pathways, genes, and tissues.</p>

Phylogenetic Signal Variation in the Genomes of <i>Medicago</i> (Fabaceae)
<p>Genome-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> offer the opportunity to clarify phylogenetic relationships that are difficult to resolve with few loci, but they can also identify genomic regions with evolutionary history distinct from that of the species history. We collected whole-genome sequence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> from 29 taxa in the legume genus <i>Medicago</i>, then aligned these sequences to the <i>Medicago truncatula</i> reference genome to confidently identify 87 596 variable homologous sites. We used this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> set to estimate phylogenetic relationships among <i>Medicago</i> species, to investigate the number of sites needed to provide robust phylogenetic estimates and to identify specific genomic regions supporting topologies in conflict with the genome-wide phylogeny. Our full genomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> set resolves relationships within the genus that were previously intractable. Subsampling the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> reveals considerable variation in phylogenetic signal and power in smaller subsets of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong>. Even when sampling 5000 sites, no random sample of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> supports a topology identical to that of the genome-wide phylogeny. Phylogenetic relationships estimated from 500-site sliding windows revealed genome regions supporting several alternative species relationships among recently diverged taxa, consistent with the expected effects of deep coalescence or introgression in the recent history of <i>Medicago</i>.

Construction and Optimization of a Large Gene Coexpression Network in Maize Using RNA-Seq Data
<p>With the emergence of massively parallel sequencing, genomewide expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> production has reached an unprecedented level. This abundance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> has greatly facilitated maize research, but may not be amenable to traditional analysis techniques that were optimized for other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> types. Using publicly available <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong>, a gene coexpression network (GCN) can be constructed and used for gene function prediction, candidate gene selection, and improving understanding of regulatory pathways. Several GCN studies have been done in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), mostly using microarray <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong>sets. To build an optimal GCN from plant materials RNA-Seq <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong>, parameters for expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> normalization and network inference were evaluated. A comprehensive evaluation of these two parameters and a ranked aggregation strategy on network performance, using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">librari</span></strong>es from 1266 maize samples, were conducted. Three normalization methods and 10 inference methods, including six correlation and four mutual information methods, were tested. The three normalization methods had very similar performance. For network inference, correlation methods performed better than mutual information methods at some genes. Increasing sample size also had a positive effect on GCN. Aggregating single networks together resulted in improved performance compared to single networks.</p>

Integrated in vivo multiomics analysis identifies p21-activated kinase signaling as a driver of colitis
<p>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic disorder of the gastrointestinal tract that has limited treatment options. To gain insight into the pathogenesis of chronic colonic inflammation (colitis), we performed a multiomics analysis that integrated RNA microarray, total protein mass spectrometry (MS), and phosphoprotein MS measurements from a mouse model of the disease. Because we collected all three types of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> from individual samples, we tracked information flow from RNA to protein to phosphoprotein and identified signaling molecules that were coordinately or discordantly regulated and pathways that had complex regulation in vivo. For example, the genes encoding acute-phase proteins were expressed in the liver, but the proteins were detected by MS in the colon during inflammation. We also ascertained the types of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> that best described particular facets of chronic inflammation. Using gene set enrichment analysis and trans-omics coexpression network analysis, we found that each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> set provided a distinct viewpoint on the molecular pathogenesis of colitis. Combining human transcriptomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> with the mouse multiomics <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> implicated increased p21-activated kinase (Pak) signaling as a driver of colitis. Chemical inhibition of Pak1 and Pak2 with FRAX597 suppressed active colitis in mice. These studies provide translational insights into the mechanisms contributing to colitis and identify Pak as a potential therapeutic target in IBD.</p>

Coupled ripple oscillations between the medial temporal lobe and neocortex retrieve human memory
<p>Episodic memory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retriev</span></strong>al relies on the recovery of neural representations of waking experience. This process is thought to involve a communication dynamic between the medial temporal lobe memory system and the neocortex. How this occurs is largely unknown, however, especially as it pertains to awake human memory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retriev</span></strong>al. Using intracranial electroencephalographic recordings, we found that ripple oscillations were dynamically coupled between the human medial temporal lobe (MTL) and temporal association cortex. Coupled ripples were more pronounced during successful verbal memory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retriev</span></strong>al and recover the cortical neural representations of remembered items. Together, these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> provide direct evidence that coupled ripples between the MTL and association cortex may underlie successful memory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retriev</span></strong>al in the human brain.</p>

Retrieval practice protects memory against acute stress
<p>More than a decade of research has supported a robust consensus: Acute stress impairs memory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retriev</span></strong>al. We aimed to determine whether a highly effective learning technique could strengthen memory against the negative effects of stress. To bolster memory, we used <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retriev</span></strong>al practice, or the act of taking practice tests. Participants first learned stimuli by either restudying or engaging in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retriev</span></strong>al practice. Twenty-four hours later, we induced stress in half of the participants and assessed subsequent memory performance. Participants who learned by restudying demonstrated the typical stress-related memory impairment, whereas those who learned by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retriev</span></strong>al practice were immune to the deleterious effects of stress. These results suggest that the effects of stress on memory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retriev</span></strong>al may be contingent on the strength of the memory representations themselves.</p>

Resolving Ambiguity of Species Limits and Concatenation in Multilocus Sequence Data for the Construction of Phylogenetic Supermatrices
<p>Public DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong>bases are becoming too large and too complex for manual methods to generate phylogenetic supermatrices from multiple gene sequences. Delineating the terminals based on taxonomic labels is no longer practical because species identifications are frequently incomplete and gene trees are incongruent with Linnaean binomials, which results in uncertainty about how to combine species units among unlinked loci. We developed a procedure that minimizes the problem of forming multilocus species units in a large phylogenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> set using algorithms from graph theory. An initial step established sequence clusters for each locus that broadly correspond to the species level. These clusters frequently include sequences labeled with various binomials and specimen identifiers that create multiple alternatives for concatenation. To choose among these possibilities, we minimize taxonomic conflict among the species units globally in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> set using a multipartite heuristic algorithm. The procedure was applied to all available GenBank <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> for Coleoptera (beetles) including > 10 500 taxon labels and > 23 500 sequences of 4 loci, which were grouped into 11 241 clusters or divergent singletons by the BlastClust software. Within each cluster, unidentified sequences could be assigned to a species name through the association with fully identified sequences, resulting in 510 new identifications (13.9% of total unidentified sequences) of which nearly half were “trans-locus” identifications by clustering of sequences at a secondary locus. The limits of DNA-based clusters were inconsistent with the Linnaean binomials for 1518 clusters (13.5%) that contained more than one binomial or split a single binomial among multiple clusters. By applying a scoring scheme for full and partial name matches in pairs of clusters, a maximum weight set of 7366 global species units was produced. Varying the match weights for partial matches had little effect on the number of units, although if partial matches were disallowed, the number increased greatly. Trees from the resulting supermatrices generally produced tree topologies in good agreement with the higher taxonomy of Coleoptera, with fewer terminals compared with trees generated according to standard filtering of sequences using species labels. The study illustrates a strategy for assembling the tree-of-life from an ever more complex primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong>base.

Geometric Morphometric Character Suites as Phylogenetic Data: Extracting Phylogenetic Signal from Gastropod Shells
<p>Despite being the objects of numerous macroevolutionary studies, many of the best represented constituents of the fossil record—including diverse examples such as foraminifera, brachiopods, and mollusks—have mineralized skeletons with limited discrete characteristics, making morphological phylogenies difficult to construct. In contrast to their paucity of phylogenetic characters, the mineralized structures (tests and shells) of these fossil groups frequently have distinctive shapes that have long proved useful for their classification. The recent introduction of methodologies for including continuous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> directly in a phylogenetic analysis has increased the number of available characters, making it possible to produce phylogenies based, in whole or part, on continuous character <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> collected from such taxa. Geometric morphometric methods provide tools for accurately characterizing shape variation and can produce quantitative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> that can therefore now be included in a phylogenetic matrix in a nonarbitrary manner. Here, the marine gastropod genus <i>Conus</i> is used to evaluate the ability of continuous characters—generated from a geometric morphometric analysis of shell shape—to contribute to a total evidence phylogenetic hypothesis constructed using molecular and morphological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong>. Furthermore, the ability of continuous characters derived from geometric morphometric analyses to place fossil taxa with limited discrete characters into a phylogeny with their extant relatives was tested by simulating the inclusion of fossil taxa. This was done by removing the molecular partition of individual extant species to produce a “cladistic pseudofossil” with only the geometric morphometric derived characters coded. The phylogenetic position of each cladistic pseudofossil taxon was then compared with its placement in the total evidence tree and a symmetric resampling tree to evaluate the degree to which morphometric characters alone can correctly place simulated fossil species. In 33–45% of the test cases (depending upon the approach used for measuring success), it was possible to place the pseudofossil taxon into the correct regions of the phylogeny using only the morphometric characters. This suggests that the incorporation of extinct <i>Conus</i> taxa into phylogenetic hypotheses will be possible, permitting a wide range of macroevolutionary questions to be addressed within this genus. This methodology also has potential to contribute to phylogenetic reconstructions for other major components of the fossil record that lack numerous discrete characters.

Learning-dependent chromatin remodeling highlights noncoding regulatory regions linked to autism
<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder that is associated with genetic risk factors. Most human disease-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are not located in genes but rather are in regulatory regions that control gene expression. The function of regulatory regions is determined through epigenetic mechanisms. Parallels between the cellular basis of development and the formation of long-term memory have long been recognized, particularly the role of epigenetic mechanisms in both processes. We analyzed how learning alters chromatin accessibility in the mouse hippocampus using a new high-throughput sequencing bioinformatics strategy we call DEScan (differential enrichment scan). DEScan, which enabled the analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> from epigenomic experiments containing multiple replicates, revealed changes in chromatin accessibility at 2365 regulatory regions—most of which were promoters. Learning-regulated promoters were active during forebrain development in mice and were enriched in epigenetic modifications indicative of bivalent promoters. These promoters were disproportionally intronic, showed a complex relationship with gene expression and alternative splicing during memory consolidation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retriev</span></strong>al, and were enriched in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> set relative to known ASD risk genes. Genotyping in a clinical cohort within one of these promoters (<i>SHANK3</i> promoter 6) revealed that the SNP rs6010065 was associated with ASD. Our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> support the idea that learning recapitulates development at the epigenetic level and demonstrate that behaviorally induced epigenetic changes in mice can highlight regulatory regions relevant to brain disorders in patients.</p>

Improving election prediction internationally
<p>This study reports the results of a multiyear program to predict direct executive elections in a variety of countries from globally pooled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong>. We developed prediction models by means of an election <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> set covering 86 countries and more than 500 elections, and a separate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> set with extensive polling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> from 146 election rounds. We also participated in two live forecasting experiments. Our models correctly predicted 80 to 90% of elections in out-of-sample tests. The results suggest that global elections can be successfully modeled and that they are likely to become more predictable as more information becomes available in future elections. The results provide strong evidence for the impact of political institutions and incumbent advantage. They also provide evidence to support contentions about the importance of international linkage and aid. Direct evidence for economic indicators as predictors of election outcomes is relatively weak. The results suggest that, with some adjustments, global polling is a robust predictor of election outcomes, even in developing states. Implications of these findings after the latest U.S. presidential election are discussed.</p>

Direct Comparison of Leaf Plasmodesma Structure and Function in Relation to Phloem-Loading Type
<p>The export of photosynthetically produced sugars from leaves depends on plasmodesmatal transport of sugar molecules from mesophyll to phloem. Traditionally, the density of plasmodesmata (PD) along this phloem-loading pathway has been used as a defining feature of different phloem-loading types, with species proposed to have either many or few PD between the phloem and surrounding cells of the leaf. However, quantitative determination of PD density has rarely been performed. Moreover, the structure of PD has not been considered, even though it could impact permeability, and functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> are only available for very few species. Here, a comparison of PD density, structure, and function using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> from transmission electron microscopy and live-cell microscopy was conducted for all relevant cell–cell interfaces in leaves of nine species. These species represent the three principal phloem-loading types currently discussed in literature. Results show that relative PD density among the different cell-cell interfaces in one species, but not absolute PD density, is indicative of phloem-loading type. PD density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> of single interfaces, even combined with PD diameter and length <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong>, did not correlate with the intercellular diffusion capacity measured by the fluorescence loss in photobleaching method. This means that PD substructure not visible on standard transmission electron micrographs may have a strong influence on permeability. Furthermore, the results support a proposed passive symplasmic loading mechanism in the tree species horse chestnut (<i>Aesculus hippocastanum</i>), white birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>), orchard apple (<i>Malus domestica</i>), and gray poplar (<i>Populus x canescens</i>) as functional cell coupling and PD structure differed from active symplasmic and apoplasmic phloem-loading species.</p>

Evaluating Topological Conflict in Centipede Phylogeny Using Transcriptomic Data Sets
<p>Relationships between the five extant orders of centipedes have been considered solved based on morphology. Phylogenies based on samples of up to a few dozen genes have largely been congruent with the morphological tree apart from an alternative placement of one order, the relictual Craterostigmomorpha, consisting of two species in Tasmania and New Zealand. To address this incongruence, novel transcriptomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> were generated to sample all five orders of centipedes and also used as a test case for studying gene-tree incongruence. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian mixture model analyses of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> set composed of 1,934 orthologs with 45% missing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong>, as well as the 389 orthologs in the least saturated, stationary quartile, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retriev</span></strong>e strong support for a sister-group relationship between Craterostigmomorpha and all other pleurostigmophoran centipedes, of which the latter group is newly named Amalpighiata. The Amalpighiata hypothesis, which shows little gene-tree incongruence and is robust to the influence of among-taxon compositional heterogeneity, implies convergent evolution in several morphological and behavioral characters traditionally used in centipede phylogenetics, such as maternal brood care, but accords with patterns of first appearances in the fossil record.</p>

<i>In vivo</i> cranial bone strain and bite force in the agamid lizard <i>Uromastyx geyri</i>
<p><i>In vivo</i> bone strain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> are the most direct evidence of deformation and strain regimes in the vertebrate cranium during feeding and can provide important insights into skull morphology. Strain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> have been collected during feeding across a wide range of mammals; in contrast, <i>in vivo</i> cranial bone strain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> have been collected from few sauropsid taxa.

Principal and shear strain magnitudes in <i>Uromastyx geyri</i> were lower than cranial bone strains recorded in <i>Alligator mississippiensis</i>, but higher than those reported from herbivorous mammals. Our results suggest that variations in principal strain orientations in the facial skeleton are largely due to differences in feeding behavior and bite location, whereas food type has little impact on strain orientations. Furthermore, mean principal strain orientations differ between male and female <i>Uromastyx</i> during feeding, potentially because of sexual dimorphism in skull morphology.</p>

Bloomsbury report on mouse embryo phenotyping: recommendations from the IMPC workshop on embryonic lethal screening
<p>Identifying genes that are important for embryo development is a crucial first step towards understanding their many functions in driving the ordered growth, differentiation and organogenesis of embryos. It can also shed light on the origins of developmental disease and congenital abnormalities. Current international efforts to examine gene function in the mouse provide a unique opportunity to pinpoint genes that are involved in embryogenesis, owing to the emergence of embryonic lethal knockout mutants. Through internationally coordinated efforts, the International Knockout Mouse Consortium (IKMC) has generated a public resource of mouse knockout strains and, in April 2012, the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC), supported by the EU InfraCoMP programme, convened a workshop to discuss developing a phenotyping pipeline for the investigation of embryonic lethal knockout lines. This workshop brought together over 100 scientists, from 13 countries, who are working in the academic and commercial research sectors, including experts and opinion leaders in the fields of embryology, animal imaging, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> capture, quality control and annotation, high-throughput mouse production, phenotyping, and reporter gene analysis. This article summarises the outcome of the workshop, including (1) the vital scientific importance of phenotyping embryonic lethal mouse strains for basic and translational research; (2) a common framework to harmonise international efforts within this context; (3) the types of phenotyping that are likely to be most appropriate for systematic use, with a focus on 3D embryo imaging; (4) the importance of centralising <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> in a standardised form to facilitate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> mining; and (5) the development of online tools to allow open access to and dissemination of the phenotyping <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong>.</p>

Opposing microtubule motors control motility, morphology and cargo segregation during ER-to-Golgi transport
<p>We recently demonstrated that dynein and kinesin motors drive multiple aspects of endosomal function in mammalian cells. These functions include driving motility, maintaining morphology (notably through providing longitudinal tension to support vesicle fission), and driving cargo sorting. Microtubule motors drive bidirectional motility during traffic between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi. Here, we have examined the role of microtubule motors in transport carrier motility, morphology, and domain organization during ER-to-Golgi transport. We show that, consistent with our findings for endosomal dynamics, microtubule motor function during ER-to-Golgi transport of secretory cargo is required for motility, morphology, and cargo sorting within vesicular tubular carriers <i>en route</i> to the Golgi. Our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> are consistent with previous findings that defined roles for dynein-1, kinesin-1 (KIF5B) and kinesin-2 in this trafficking step. Our high resolution tracking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> identify some intriguing aspects. Depletion of kinesin-1 reduces the number of motile structures seen, which is in line with other findings relating to the role of kinesin-1 in ER export. However, those transport carriers that were produced had a much greater run length suggesting that this motor can act as a brake on anterograde motility. Kinesin-2 depletion did not significantly reduce the number of motile transport carriers but did cause a similar increase in run length. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> suggest that kinesins act as negative regulators of ER-to-Golgi transport. Depletion of dynein not only reduced the number of motile carriers formed but also caused tubulation of carriers similar to that seen for sorting nexin-coated early endosomes. Our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> indicated that the previously observed anterograde–retrograde polarity of transport carriers in transit to the Golgi from the ER is maintained by microtubule motor function.</p>

Comprehensive single-cell transcriptional profiling of a multicellular organism
<p>To resolve cellular heterogeneity, we developed a combinatorial indexing strategy to profile the transcriptomes of single cells or nuclei, termed sci-RNA-seq (single-cell combinatorial indexing RNA sequencing). We applied sci-RNA-seq to profile nearly 50,000 cells from the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> at the L2 larval stage, which provided >50-fold “shotgun” cellular coverage of its somatic cell composition. From these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong>, we defined consensus expression profiles for 27 cell types and recovered rare neuronal cell types corresponding to as few as one or two cells in the L2 worm. We integrated these profiles with whole-animal chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> to deconvolve the cell type–specific effects of transcription factors. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> generated by sci-RNA-seq constitute a powerful resource for nematode biology and foreshadow similar atlases for other organisms.</p>

Time-Course Transcriptome Analysis of Arabidopsis Siliques Discloses Genes Essential for Fruit Development and Maturation
<p>Fruits protect the developing seeds of angiosperms and actively contribute to seed dispersion.

In doing so, we have generated a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> set of differentially regulated genes that will help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that underpin the initial phase of fruit growth and, subsequently, trigger fruit maturation. The robustness of our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> set has been tested by functional genomic studies.

Consensus Coexpression Network Analysis Identifies Key Regulators of Flower and Fruit Development in Wild Strawberry
<p>The diploid strawberry, <i>Fragaria vesca</i>, is a developing model system for the economically important Rosaceae family. Strawberry fleshy fruit develops from the floral receptacle and its ripening is nonclimacteric. The external seed configuration of strawberry fruit facilitates the study of seed-to-fruit cross tissue communication, particularly phytohormone biosynthesis and transport. To investigate strawberry fruit development, we previously generated spatial and temporal transcriptome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> profiling <i>F. vesca</i> flower and fruit development pre- and postfertilization. In this study, we combined 46 of our existing RNA-seq <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">librari</span></strong>es to generate coexpression networks using the Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis package in R. We then applied a post-hoc consensus clustering approach and used bootstrapping to demonstrate consensus clustering’s ability to produce robust and reproducible clusters. Further, we experimentally tested hypotheses based on the networks, including increased iron transport from the receptacle to the seed postfertilization and characterized a <i>F. vesca</i> floral mutant and its candidate gene. To increase their utility, the networks are presented in a web interface (<ext-link>www.fv.rosaceaefruits.org</ext-link>) for easy exploration and identification of coexpressed genes. Together, the work reported here illustrates ways to generate robust networks optimized for the mining of large transcriptome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> sets, thereby providing a useful resource for hypothesis generation and experimental design in strawberry and related Rosaceae fruit crops.</p>

EZ-Root-VIS: A Software Pipeline for the Rapid Analysis and Visual Reconstruction of Root System Architecture
<p>If we want to understand how the environment has shaped the appearance and behavior of living creatures, we need to compare groups of individuals that differ in genetic makeup and environment experience. For complex phenotypic features, such as body posture or facial expression in humans, comparison is not straightforward because some of the contributing factors cannot easily be quantified or averaged across individuals. Therefore, computational methods are used to reconstruct representative prototypes using a range of algorithms for filling in missing information and calculating means. The same problem applies to the root system architecture (RSA) of plants. Several computer programs are available for extracting numerical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> from root images, but they usually do not offer customized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> analysis or visual reconstruction of RSA. We developed Root-VIS, a free software tool that facilitates the determination of means and variance of many different RSA features across user-selected sets of root images. Furthermore, Root-VIS offers several options to generate visual reconstructions of root systems from the averaged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> to enable screening and modeling. We confirmed the suitability of Root-VIS, combined with a new version of EZ-Rhizo, for the rapid characterization of genotype-environment interactions and gene discovery through genome-wide association studies in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>).</p>

A New Phenotyping Pipeline Reveals Three Types of Lateral Roots and a Random Branching Pattern in Two Cereals
<p>Recent progress in root phenotyping has focused mainly on increasing throughput for genetic studies, while identifying root developmental patterns has been comparatively underexplored. We introduce a new phenotyping pipeline for producing high-quality spatiotemporal root system development <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> and identifying developmental patterns within these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong>. The SmartRoot image-analysis system and temporal and spatial statistical models were applied to two cereals, pearl millet (<i>Pennisetum glaucum</i>) and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). Semi-Markov switching linear models were used to cluster lateral roots based on their growth rate profiles. These models revealed three types of lateral roots with similar characteristics in both species. The first type corresponds to fast and accelerating roots, the second to rapidly arrested roots, and the third to an intermediate type where roots cease elongation after a few days. These types of lateral roots were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retriev</span></strong>ed in different proportions in a maize mutant affected in auxin signaling, while the first most vigorous type was absent in maize plants exposed to severe shading. Moreover, the classification of growth rate profiles was mirrored by a ranking of anatomical traits in pearl millet. Potential dependencies in the succession of lateral root types along the primary root were then analyzed using variable-order Markov chains. The lateral root type was not influenced by the shootward neighbor root type or by the distance from this root. This random branching pattern of primary roots was remarkably conserved, despite the high variability of root systems in both species. Our phenotyping pipeline opens the door to exploring the genetic variability of lateral root developmental patterns.</p>

Generation of a Collection of Mutant Tomato Lines Using Pooled CRISPR Libraries
<p>The high efficiency of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-mediated mutagenesis in plants enables the development of high-throughput mutagenesis strategies. By transforming pooled CRISPR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">librari</span></strong>es into tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>), collections of mutant lines were generated with minimal transformation attempts and in a relatively short period of time. Identification of the targeted gene(s) was easily determined by sequencing the incorporated guide RNA(s) in the primary transgenic events. From a single transformation with a CRISPR library targeting the immunity-associated leucine-rich repeat subfamily XII genes, heritable mutations were recovered in 15 of the 54 genes targeted. To increase throughput, a second CRISPR library was made containing three guide RNAs per construct to target 18 putative transporter genes. This resulted in stable mutations in 15 of the 18 targeted genes, with some primary transgenic plants having as many as five mutated genes. Furthermore, the redundancy in this collection of plants allowed for the association of aberrant T0 phenotypes with the underlying targeted genes. Plants with mutations in a homolog of an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) boron efflux transporter displayed boron deficiency phenotypes. The strategy described here provides a technically simple yet high-throughput approach for generating a collection of lines with targeted mutations and should be applicable to any plant transformation system.</p>

ChloroKB: A Web Application for the Integration of Knowledge Related to Chloroplast Metabolic Network
<p>Higher plants, as autotrophic organisms, are effective sources of molecules. They hold great promise for metabolic engineering, but the behavior of plant metabolism at the network level is still incompletely described. Although structural models (stoichiometry matrices) and pathway <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong>bases are extremely useful, they cannot describe the complexity of the metabolic context, and new tools are required to visually represent integrated biocurated knowledge for use by both humans and computers. Here, we describe ChloroKB, a Web application (<ext-link>http://chlorokb.fr/</ext-link>) for visual exploration and analysis of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) metabolic network in the chloroplast and related cellular pathways. The network was manually reconstructed through extensive biocuration to provide transparent traceability of experimental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong>. Proteins and metabolites were placed in their biological context (spatial distribution within cells, connectivity in the network, participation in supramolecular complexes, and regulatory interactions) using CellDesigner software. The network contains 1,147 reviewed proteins (559 localized exclusively in plastids, 68 in at least one additional compartment, and 520 outside the plastid), 122 proteins awaiting biochemical/genetic characterization, and 228 proteins for which genes have not yet been identified. The visual presentation is intuitive and browsing is fluid, providing instant access to the graphical representation of integrated processes and to a wealth of refined qualitative and quantitative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong>. ChloroKB will be a significant support for structural and quantitative kinetic modeling, for biological reasoning, when comparing novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> with established knowledge, for computer analyses, and for educational purposes.

In particular, seed mass is generally regarded to be key for seedling development but is mostly approximated by using scanning methods delivering only two-dimensional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong>, often termed seed size. However, three-dimensional traits, such as the volume or mass of single seeds, are very rarely determined in routine measurements. Here, we introduce a device named <i>pheno</i>Seeder, which enables the handling and phenotyping of individual seeds of very different sizes. The system consists of a pick-and-place robot and a modular setup of sensors that can be versatilely extended. Basic biometric traits detected for individual seeds are two-dimensional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> from projections, three-dimensional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> from volumetric measures, and mass, from which seed density is also calculated. Each seed is tracked by an identifier and, after phenotyping, can be planted, sorted, or individually stored for further evaluation or processing (e.g. in routine seed-to-plant tracking pipelines). By investigating seeds of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), rapeseed (<i>Brassica napus</i>), and barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), we observed that, even for apparently round-shaped seeds of rapeseed, correlations between the projected area and the mass of seeds were much weaker than between volume and mass. This indicates that simple projections may not deliver good proxies for seed mass. Although throughput is limited, we expect that automated seed phenotyping on a single-seed basis can contribute valuable information for applications in a wide range of wild or crop species, including seed classification, seed sorting, and assessment of seed quality.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Ethylene-Regulated Glutamate Dehydrogenase Fine-Tunes Metabolism during Anoxia-Reoxygenation
<p>Ethylene is an essential hormone in plants that is involved in low-oxygen and reoxygenation responses. As a key transcription factor in ethylene signaling, ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3) activates targets that trigger various responses. However, most of these targets are still poorly characterized. Through analyses of our microarray <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> and the published Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) EIN3 chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> set, we inferred the putative targets of EIN3 during anoxia-reoxygenation. Among them, <i>GDH2</i>, which encodes one subunit of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), was chosen for further studies for its role in tricarboxylic acid cycle replenishment. We demonstrated that both <i>GDH1</i> and <i>GDH2</i> are induced during anoxia and reoxygenation and that this induction is mediated via ethylene signaling. In addition, the results of enzymatic assays showed that the level of GDH during anoxia-reoxygenation decreased in the ethylene-insensitive mutants <i>ein2-5</i> and <i>ein3eil1</i>. Global metabolite analysis indicated that the deamination activity of GDH might regenerate 2-oxoglutarate, which is a cosubstrate that facilitates the breakdown of alanine by alanine aminotransferase when reoxygenation occurs. Moreover, ineffective tricarboxylic acid cycle replenishment, disturbed carbohydrate metabolism, reduced phytosterol biosynthesis, and delayed energy regeneration were found in <i>gdh1gdh2</i> and ethylene mutants during reoxygenation. Taken together, these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> illustrate the essential role of EIN3-regulated GDH activity in metabolic adjustment during anoxia-reoxygenation.</p>

Reconstruction of Haplotype-Blocks Selected during Experimental Evolution
<p>The genetic analysis of experimentally evolving populations typically relies on short reads from pooled individuals (Pool-Seq). While this method provides reliable allele frequency estimates, the underlying haplotype structure remains poorly characterized. With small population sizes and adaptive variants that start from low frequencies, the interpretation of selection signatures in most Evolve and Resequencing studies remains challenging. To facilitate the characterization of selection targets, we propose a new approach that reconstructs selected haplotypes from replicated time series, using Pool-Seq <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong>. We identify selected haplotypes through the correlated frequencies of alleles carried by them. Computer simulations indicate that selected haplotype-blocks of several Mb can be reconstructed with high confidence and low error rates, even when allele frequencies change only by 20% across three replicates. Applying this method to real <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> from <i>D. melanogaster</i> populations adapting to a hot environment, we identify a selected haplotype-block of 6.93 Mb. We confirm the presence of this haplotype-block in evolved populations by experimental haplotyping, demonstrating the power and accuracy of our haplotype reconstruction from Pool-Seq <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong>. We propose that the combination of allele frequency estimates with haplotype information will provide the key to understanding the dynamics of adaptive alleles.</p>

Fine-Tuning Motile Cilia and Flagella: Evolution of the Dynein Motor Proteins from Plants to Humans at High Resolution
<p>The flagellum is a key innovation linked to eukaryogenesis. It provides motility by regulated cycles of bending and bend propagation, which are thought to be controlled by a complex arrangement of seven distinct dyneins in repeated patterns of outer- (OAD) and inner-arm dynein (IAD) complexes. Electron tomography showed high similarity of this axonemal repeat pattern across ciliates, algae, and animals, but the diversity of dynein sequences across the eukaryotes has not yet comprehensively been resolved and correlated with structural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong>. To shed light on the evolution of the axoneme I performed an exhaustive analysis of dyneins using the available sequenced genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong>. Evidence from motor domain phylogeny allowed expanding the current set of nine dynein subtypes by eight additional isoforms with, however, restricted taxonomic distributions. I confirmed the presence of the nine dyneins in all eukaryotic super-groups indicating their origin predating the last eukaryotic common ancestor. The comparison of the N-terminal tail domains revealed a most likely axonemal dynein origin of the new classes, a group of chimeric dyneins in plants/algae and Stramenopiles, and the unique domain architecture and origin of the outermost OADs present in green algae and ciliates but not animals. The correlation of sequence and structural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> suggests the single-headed class-8 and class-9 dyneins to localize to the distal end of the axonemal repeat and the class-7 dyneins filling the region up to the proximal heterodimeric IAD. Tracing dynein gene duplications across the eukaryotes indicated ongoing diversification and fine-tuning of flagellar functions in extant taxa and species.</p>

Fast, Accurate and Automatic Ancient Nucleosome and Methylation Maps with epiPALEOMIX
<p>The first epigenomes from archaic hominins (AH) and ancient anatomically modern humans (AMH) have recently been characterized, based, however, on a limited number of samples. The extent to which ancient genome-wide epigenetic landscapes can be reconstructed thus remains contentious. Here, we present epiPALEOMIX, an open-source and user-friendly pipeline that exploits post-mortem DNA degradation patterns to reconstruct ancient methylomes and nucleosome maps from shotgun and/or capture-enrichment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong>. Applying epiPALEOMIX to the sequence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> underlying 35 ancient genomes including AMH, AH, equids and aurochs, we investigate the temporal, geographical and preservation range of ancient epigenetic signatures. We first assess the quality of inferred ancient epigenetic signatures within well-characterized genomic regions. We find that tissue-specific methylation signatures can be obtained across a wider range of DNA preparation types than previously thought, including when no particular experimental procedures have been used to remove deaminated cytosines prior to sequencing. We identify a large subset of samples for which DNA associated with nucleosomes is protected from post-mortem degradation, and nucleosome positioning patterns can be reconstructed. Finally, we describe parameters and conditions such as DNA damage levels and sequencing depth that limit the preservation of epigenetic signatures in ancient samples. When such conditions are met, we propose that epigenetic profiles of CTCF binding regions can be used to help <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> authentication. Our work, including epiPALEOMIX, opens for further investigations of ancient epigenomes through time especially aimed at tracking possible epigenetic changes during major evolutionary, environmental, socioeconomic, and cultural shifts.</p>

TCS: A New Multiple Sequence Alignment Reliability Measure to Estimate Alignment Accuracy and Improve Phylogenetic Tree Reconstruction
<p>Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is a key modeling procedure when analyzing biological sequences. Homology and evolutionary modeling are the most common applications of MSAs. Both are known to be sensitive to the underlying MSA accuracy. In this work, we show how this problem can be partly overcome using the transitive consistency score (TCS), an extended version of the T-Coffee scoring scheme. Using this local evaluation function, we show that one can identify the most reliable portions of an MSA, as judged from BAliBASE and PREFAB structure-based reference alignments. We also show how this measure can be used to improve phylogenetic tree reconstruction using both an established simulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> set and a novel empirical yeast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> set. For this purpose, we describe a novel lossless alternative to site filtering that involves overweighting the trustworthy columns. Our approach relies on the T-Coffee framework; it uses <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">librari</span></strong>es of pairwise alignments to evaluate any third party MSA. Pairwise projections can be produced using fast or slow methods, thus allowing a trade-off between speed and accuracy. We compared TCS with Heads-or-Tails, GUIDANCE, Gblocks, and trimAl and found it to lead to significantly better estimates of structural accuracy and more accurate phylogenetic trees. The software is available from <ext-link>www.tcoffee.org/Projects/tcs</ext-link>.</p>

Hierarchical and Spatially Explicit Clustering of DNA Sequences with BAPS Software
<p>Phylogeographical analyses have become commonplace for a myriad of organisms with the advent of cheap DNA sequencing technologies. Bayesian model-based clustering is a powerful tool for detecting important patterns in such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> and can be used to decipher even quite subtle signals of systematic differences in molecular variation. Here, we introduce two upgrades to the Bayesian Analysis of Population Structure (BAPS) software, which enable 1) spatially explicit modeling of variation in DNA sequences and 2) hierarchical clustering of DNA sequence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> to reveal nested genetic population structures. We provide a direct interface to map the results from spatial clustering with Google Maps using the portal <ext-link>http://www.spatialepidemiology.net/</ext-link> and illustrate this approach using sequence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> from <i>Borrelia burgdorferi</i>. The usefulness of hierarchical clustering is demonstrated through an analysis of the metapopulation structure within a bacterial population experiencing a high level of local horizontal gene transfer. The tools that are introduced are freely available at <ext-link>http://www.helsinki.fi/bsg/software/BAPS/</ext-link>.</p>

Dislocation following total hip arthroplasty using dual mobility acetabular components
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this systematic review was to report the rate of dislocation   following the use of dual mobility (DM) acetabular components in   primary and revision total hip arthroplasty (THA).</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A systematic review of the literature according to the Preferred   Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines   was performed. A comprehensive search of Pubmed/Medline, Cochrane   Library and Embase (Scopus) was conducted for English articles between   January 1974 and March 2016 using various combinations of the keywords “dual   mobility”, “dual-mobility”, “tripolar”, “double-mobility”, “double   mobility”, “hip”, “cup”, “socket”. The following <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> were extracted   by two investigators independently: demographics, whether the operation   was a primary or revision THA, length of follow-up, the design of   the components, diameter of the femoral head, and type of fixation   of the acetabular component.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In all, 59 articles met our inclusion criteria.

Non-invasive long-term fluorescence live imaging of <i>Tribolium castaneum</i> embryos
<p>Insect development has contributed significantly to our understanding of metazoan development. However, most information has been obtained by analyzing a single species, the fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Embryonic development of the red flour beetle <i>Tribolium castaneum</i> differs fundamentally from that of <i>Drosophila</i> in aspects such as short-germ development, embryonic leg development, extensive extra-embryonic membrane formation and non-involuted head development. Although <i>Tribolium</i> has become the second most important insect model organism, previous live imaging attempts have addressed only specific questions and no long-term live imaging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> of <i>Tribolium</i> embryogenesis have been available. By combining light sheet-based fluorescence microscopy with a novel mounting method, we achieved complete, continuous and non-invasive fluorescence live imaging of <i>Tribolium</i> embryogenesis at high spatiotemporal resolution. The embryos survived the 2-day or longer imaging process, developed into adults and produced fertile progeny. Our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong> all morphogenetic processes from the rearrangement of the uniform blastoderm to the onset of regular muscular movement in the same embryo and in four orientations, contributing significantly to the understanding of <i>Tribolium</i> development. Furthermore, we created a comprehensive chronological table of <i>Tribolium</i> embryogenesis, integrating most previous work and providing a reference for future studies. Based on our observations, we provide evidence that serosa window closure and serosa opening, although deferred by more than 1 day, are linked. All our long-term imaging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong>sets are available as a resource for the community. <i>Tribolium</i> is only the second insect species, after <i>Drosophila</i>, for which non-invasive long-term fluorescence live imaging has been achieved.</p>

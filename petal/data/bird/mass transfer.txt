Brain Emboli After Left Ventricular Endocardial Ablation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Catheter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ion for ventricular tachycardia and premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) is common. Catheter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ion of atrial fibrillation is associated with a risk of cerebral emboli attributed to cardioversions and numerous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ion lesions in the low-flow left atrium, but cerebral embolic risk in ventricular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ion has not been evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We enrolled 18 consecutive patients meeting study criteria scheduled for ventricular tachycardia or PVC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ion over a 9-month period. Patients undergoing left ventricular (LV) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ion were compared with a control group of those undergoing right ventricular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ion only. Patients were excluded if they had implantable cardioverter defibrillators or permanent pacemakers. Radiofrequency energy was used for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ion in all cases and heparin was administered with goal-activated clotting times of 300 to 400 seconds for all LV procedures. Pre- and postprocedural brain MRI was performed on each patient within a week of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ion procedure. Embolic infarcts were defined as new foci of reduced diffusion and high signal intensity on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery brain MRI within a vascular distribution.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The mean age was 58 years, half of the patients were men, half had a history of hypertension, and the majority had no known vascular disease or heart failure. LV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ion was performed in 12 patients (ventricular tachycardia, n=2; PVC, n=10) and right ventricular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ion was performed exclusively in 6 patients (ventricular tachycardia, n=1; PVC, n=5). Seven patients (58%) undergoing LV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ion experienced a total of 16 cerebral emboli, in comparison with zero patients undergoing right ventricular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ion (<i>P</i>=0.04).

Interhospital Transfer Before Thrombectomy Is Associated With Delayed Treatment and Worse Outcome in the STRATIS Registry (Systematic Evaluation of Patients Treated With Neurothrombectomy Devices for Acute Ischemic Stroke)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Endovascular treatment with mechanical thrombectomy (MT) is beneficial for patients with acute stroke suffering a large-vessel occlusion, although treatment efficacy is highly time-dependent. We hypothesized that interhospital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> to endovascular-capable centers would result in treatment delays and worse clinical outcomes compared with direct presentation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>STRATIS (Systematic Evaluation of Patients Treated With Neurothrombectomy Devices for Acute Ischemic Stroke) was a prospective, multicenter, observational, single-arm study of real-world MT for acute stroke because of anterior-circulation large-vessel occlusion performed at 55 sites over 2 years, including 1000 patients with severe stroke and treated within 8 hours. Patients underwent MT with or without intravenous tissue plasminogen activator and were admitted to endovascular-capable centers via either interhospital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> or direct presentation. The primary clinical outcome was functional independence (modified Rankin Score 0–2) at 90 days. We assessed (1) real-world time metrics of stroke care delivery, (2) outcome differences between direct and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> patients undergoing MT, and (3) the potential impact of local hospital bypass.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 984 patients were analyzed. Median onset-to-revascularization time was 202.0 minutes for direct versus 311.5 minutes for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> patients (<i>P</i><0.001). Clinical outcomes were better in the direct group, with 60.0% (299/498) achieving functional independence compared with 52.2% (213/408) in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> group (odds ratio, 1.38; 95% confidence interval, 1.06–1.79; <i>P</i>=0.02). Likewise, excellent outcome (modified Rankin Score 0–1) was achieved in 47.4% (236/498) of direct patients versus 38.0% (155/408) of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> patients (odds ratio, 1.47; 95% confidence interval, 1.13–1.92; <i>P</i>=0.005). Mortality did not differ between the 2 groups (15.1% for direct, 13.7% for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>; <i>P</i>=0.55). Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator did not impact outcomes. Hypothetical bypass modeling for all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>red patients suggested that intravenous tissue plasminogen activator would be delayed by 12 minutes, but MT would be performed 91 minutes sooner if patients were routed directly to endovascular-capable centers. If bypass is limited to a 20-mile radius from onset, then intravenous tissue plasminogen activator would be delayed by 7 minutes and MT performed 94 minutes earlier.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In this large, real-world study, interhospital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> was associated with significant treatment delays and lower chance of good outcome. Strategies to facilitate more rapid identification of large-vessel occlusion and direct routing to endovascular-capable centers for patients with severe stroke may improve outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

In 113 patients, mean age 48.5±18.1 years, 68 female, atypical AVNRT or coexistent atypical and typical AVNRT without other concomitant arrhythmia was diagnosed. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ion data and outcomes were compared with a group of age- and sex-matched control patients with typical AVNRT.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Fluoroscopy and radiofrequency current delivery times were not different in the atypical and typical groups, 20.3±12.2 versus 20.8±12.9 minutes (<i>P</i>=0.730) and 5.9±5.0 versus 5.5±4.5 minutes (<i>P</i>=0.650), respectively. Slow pathway <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ion was accomplished from the right septum in 110 patients, and from the left septum in 3 patients, in the atypical group. There was no need for additional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ion lesions at other anatomic sites, and no cases of atrioventricular block were encountered.

Systematic Biology
Lateral Gene Transfer from the Dead
<p>In phylogenetic studies, the evolution of molecular sequences is assumed to have taken place along the phylogeny traced by the ancestors of extant species. In the presence of lateral gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>, however, this may not be the case, because the species lineage from which a gene was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>red may have gone extinct or not have been sampled. Because it is not feasible to specify or reconstruct the complete phylogeny of all species, we must describe the evolution of genes outside the represented phylogeny by modeling the speciation dynamics that gave rise to the complete phylogeny. We demonstrate that if the number of sampled species is small compared with the total number of existing species, the overwhelming majority of gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>s involve speciation to and evolution along extinct or unsampled lineages. We show that the evolution of genes along extinct or unsampled lineages can to good approximation be treated as those of independently evolving lineages described by a few global parameters. Using this result, we derive an algorithm to calculate the probability of a gene tree and recover the maximum-likelihood reconciliation given the phylogeny of the sampled species. Examining 473 near-universal gene families from 36 cyanobacteria, we find that nearly a third of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> events (28%) appear to have topological signatures of evolution along extinct species, but only approximately 6% of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>s trace their ancestry to before the common ancestor of the sampled cyanobacteria.

Inflammation boosts bacteriophage transfer between <i>Salmonella</i> spp.
<p>Bacteriophage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> (lysogenic conversion) promotes bacterial virulence evolution. There is limited understanding of the factors that determine lysogenic conversion dynamics within infected hosts. A murine <i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium (<i>S</i>.Tm) diarrhea model was used to study the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> of SopEΦ, a prophage from <i>S</i>.Tm SL1344, to <i>S</i>.Tm ATCC14028S. Gut inflammation and enteric disease triggered >55% lysogenic conversion of ATCC14028S within 3 days. Without inflammation, SopEΦ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> was reduced by up to 10<sup>5</sup>-fold. This was because inflammation (e.g., reactive oxygen species, reactive nitrogen species, hypochlorite) triggers the bacterial SOS response, boosts expression of the phage antirepressor Tum, and thereby promotes free phage production and subsequent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>. Mucosal vaccination prevented a dense intestinal <i>S</i>.Tm population from inducing inflammation and consequently abolished SopEΦ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>. Vaccination may be a general strategy for blocking pathogen evolution that requires disease-driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> of temperate bacteriophages.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
The Nonspecific Lipid Transfer Protein AtLtpI-4 Is Involved in Suberin Formation of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> Crown Galls
<p>Nonspecific lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> proteins reversibly bind different types of lipid molecules in a hydrophobic cavity. They facilitate phospholipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> between membranes in vitro, play a role in cuticle and possibly in suberin formation, and might be involved in plant pathogen defense signaling. This study focuses on the role of the lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> protein <i>AtLTPI-4</i> in crown gall development. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) crown gall tumors, which develop upon infection with the virulent <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i> strain C58, highly expressed <i>AtLTPI-4</i>. Crown galls of the <i>atltpI-4</i> loss-of-function mutant were much smaller compared with those of wild-type plants. The gene expression pattern and localization of the protein to the plasma membrane pointed to a function of AtLTPI-4 in cell wall suberization. Since Arabidopsis crown galls are covered by a suberin-containing periderm instead of a cuticle, we analyzed the suberin composition of crown galls and found a reduction in the amounts of long-chain fatty acids (C<sub>18:0</sub>) in the <i>atltpI-4</i> mutant. To demonstrate the impact of AtLtpI-4 on extracellular lipid composition, we expressed the protein in Arabidopsis epidermis cells. This led to a significant increase in the very-long-chain fatty acids C<sub>24</sub> and C<sub>26</sub> in the cuticular wax fraction. Homology modeling and lipid-protein-overlay assays showed that AtLtpI-4 protein can bind these very-long-chain fatty acids. Thus, AtLtpI-4 protein may facilitate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> of long-chain as well as very-long-chain fatty acids into the apoplast, depending on the cell type in which it is expressed. In crown galls, which endogenously express AtLtpI-4, it is involved in suberin formation.</p>

The distribution of heat in bone during radiofrequency ablation of an <i>ex vivo</i> bovine model of osteoid osteoma
<p>Osteoid osteoma is treated primarily by radiofrequency   (RF) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ion. However, there is little information about the distribution   of heat in bone during the procedure and its safety. We constructed   a model of osteoid osteoma to assess the distribution of heat in   bone and to define the margins of safety for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ion. Cavities   were drilled in cadaver bovine bones and filled with a liver homogenate   to simulate the tumour matrix. Temperature-sensing probes were placed   in the bone in a radial fashion away from the cavities. RF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ion   was performed 107 times in tumours < 10 mm in diameter (72 of   which were in cortical bone, 35 in cancellous bone), and 41 times   in cortical bone with models > 10 mm in diameter. Significantly   higher temperatures were found in cancellous bone than in cortical   bone (p < 0.05). For lesions up to 10 mm in diameter, in both   bone types, the temperature varied directly with the size of the   tumour (p < 0.05), and inversely with the distance from it. Tumours   of > 10 mm in diameter showed a trend similar to those of smaller   lesions. No temperature rise was seen beyond 12 mm from the edge   of a cortical tumour of any size. Formulae were developed to predict   the expected temperature in the bone during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ion.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014; 96-B:677–83</p>

Binding of FUN14 Domain Containing 1 With Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptor in Mitochondria-Associated Endoplasmic Reticulum Membranes Maintains Mitochondrial Dynamics and Function in Hearts in Vivo
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>FUN14 domain containing 1 (FUNDC1) is a highly conserved outer mitochondrial membrane protein.

Consistently, <i>Fundc1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ion increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in ER, whereas <i>Fundc1</i> overexpression lowered ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. Further, <i>Fundc1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ion in cardiomyocytes elongated mitochondria and compromised mitochondrial functions. Mechanistically, we found that <i>Fundc1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ion-induced reduction of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels suppressed mitochondrial fission 1 protein (<i>Fis1</i>) expression and mitochondrial fission by reducing the binding of the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) in the <i>Fis1</i> promoter. <i>Fundc1</i><sup><i>f/Y</i></sup><i>/Cre</i><sup><i>αMyHC+/−</i></sup> mice but not their littermate control mice (<i>Fundc1</i><sup><i>wt/Y</i></sup><i>/Cre</i><sup><i>αMyHC+/−</i></sup>) exhibited cardiac dysfunction.

Dual enhancement of T and NK cell function by pulsatile inhibition of SHIP1 improves antitumor immunity and survival
<p>The success of immunotherapy in some cancer patients has revealed the profound capacity for cytotoxic lymphocytes to eradicate malignancies. Various immunotherapies work by blocking key checkpoint proteins that suppress immune cell activity. The phosphatase SHIP1 (SH2-containing inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase) limits signaling from receptors that activate natural killer (NK) cells and T cells. However, unexpectedly, genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ion studies have shown that the effector functions of SHIP1-deficient NK and T cells are compromised in vivo. Because chronic activation of immune cells renders them less responsive to activating signals (a host mechanism to avoid autoimmunity), we hypothesized that the failure of SHIP1 inhibition to induce antitumor immunity in those studies was caused by the permanence of genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ion. Accordingly, we found that reversible and pulsatile inhibition of SHIP1 with 3-α-aminocholestane (3AC; “SHIPi”) increased the antitumor response of NK and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in vitro and in vivo. Transient SHIP1 inhibition in mouse models of lymphoma and colon cancer improved the median and long-term tumor-free survival rates. Adoptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> assays showed evidence of immunological memory to the tumor in hematolymphoid cells from SHIPi-treated, long-term surviving mice. The findings suggest that a pulsatile regimen of SHIP1 inhibition might be an effective immunotherapy in some cancer patients.</p>

Role of AcrAB-TolC multidrug efflux pump in drug-resistance acquisition by plasmid transfer
<p>Drug-resistance dissemination by horizontal gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> remains poorly understood at the cellular scale. Using live-cell microscopy, we reveal the dynamics of resistance acquisition by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> of the <i>Escherichia coli</i> fertility factor–conjugation plasmid encoding the tetracycline-efflux pump TetA. The entry of the single-stranded DNA plasmid into the recipient cell is rapidly followed by complementary-strand synthesis, plasmid-gene expression, and production of TetA. In the presence of translation-inhibiting antibiotics, resistance acquisition depends on the AcrAB-TolC multidrug efflux pump, because it reduces tetracycline concentrations in the cell. Protein synthesis can thus persist and TetA expression can be initiated immediately after plasmid acquisition. AcrAB-TolC efflux activity can also preserve resistance acquisition by plasmid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> in the presence of antibiotics with other modes of action.</p>

Structural basis for blue-green light harvesting and energy dissipation in diatoms
<p>Diatoms are abundant photosynthetic organisms in aquatic environments and contribute 40% of its primary productivity. An important factor that contributes to the success of diatoms is their fucoxanthin chlorophyll a/c-binding proteins (FCPs), which have exceptional light-harvesting and photoprotection capabilities. Here, we report the crystal structure of an FCP from the marine diatom <i>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</i>, which reveals the binding of seven chlorophylls (Chls) a, two Chls c, seven fucoxanthins (Fxs), and probably one diadinoxanthin within the protein scaffold. Efficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">energy transf</span></strong>er pathways can be found between Chl a and c, and each Fx is surrounded by Chls, enabling the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">energy transf</span></strong>er and quenching via Fx highly efficient.

A mechanism for preventing asymmetric histone segregation onto replicating DNA strands
<p>How parental histone (H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> tetramers, the primary carriers of epigenetic modifications, are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>red onto leading and lagging strands of DNA replication forks for epigenetic inheritance remains elusive. Here we show that parental (H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> tetramers are assembled into nucleosomes onto both leading and lagging strands, with a slight preference for lagging strands. The lagging-strand preference increases markedly in budding yeast cells lacking Dpb3 and Dpb4, two subunits of the leading strand DNA polymerase, Pol ε, owing to the impairment of parental (H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> to leading strands. Dpb3-Dpb4 binds H3-H4 in vitro and participates in the inheritance of heterochromatin.

The observed ion distributions are not symmetric around the magnetic field direction but are in phase with the plasma wave fields.

Plants send small RNAs in extracellular vesicles to fungal pathogen to silence virulence genes
<p>Some pathogens and pests deliver small RNAs (sRNAs) into host cells to suppress host immunity.

Although sRNA trafficking has been observed in a wide variety of interactions, how sRNAs are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>red, especially from hosts to pathogens and pests, is still unknown. Here, we show that host <i>Arabidopsis</i> cells secrete exosome-like extracellular vesicles to deliver sRNAs into fungal pathogen <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>. These sRNA-containing vesicles accumulate at the infection sites and are taken up by the fungal cells. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>red host sRNAs induce silencing of fungal genes critical for pathogenicity. Thus, <i>Arabidopsis</i> has adapted exosome-mediated cross-kingdom RNA interference as part of its immune responses during the evolutionary arms race with the pathogen.</p>

Mediating ER-mitochondrial cross-talk
<p>Cellular function and survival require the highly ordered subcellular localization of organelles. In particular, there is considerable interest in understanding the interconnectedness of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria. The direct interaction of ER and mitochondrial membranes is referred to as tethering, typically defined as an interorganelle distance of less than 30 nm. Tethering has been implicated in numerous physiological processes, including lipid synthesis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>, coupling of Ca<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>, autophagosome formation, inflammatory signaling, mitochondrial morphology, and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) synthesis and distribution (<i>1</i>–<i>5</i>). Although the functional relevance of ER-mitochondrial tethering is widely accepted, identification of the proteins that constitute these interconnected structures has remained elusive. On page 623 of this issue, Hirabayashi <i>et al.</i> (<i>6</i>) show that PDZ domain containing protein 8 (PDZD8) is required for the tethering of ER and mitochondrial membranes and is critical for Ca<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> from ER to mitochondria.</p>

Learning-enhanced coupling between ripple oscillations in association cortices and hippocampus
<p>Consolidation of declarative memories requires hippocampal-neocortical communication. Although experimental evidence supports the role of sharp-wave ripples in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>ring hippocampal information to the neocortex, the exact cortical destinations and the physiological mechanisms of such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> are not known. We used a conducting polymer-based conformable microelectrode array (NeuroGrid) to record local field potentials and neural spiking across the dorsal cortical surface of the rat brain, combined with silicon probe recordings in the hippocampus, to identify candidate physiological patterns. Parietal, midline, and prefrontal, but not primary cortical areas, displayed localized ripple (100 to 150 hertz) oscillations during sleep, concurrent with hippocampal ripples. Coupling between hippocampal and neocortical ripples was strengthened during sleep following learning. These findings suggest that ripple-ripple coupling supports hippocampal-association cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> of memory traces.</p>

Plants transfer lipids to sustain colonization by mutualistic mycorrhizal and parasitic fungi
<p>Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi facilitate plant uptake of mineral nutrients and draw organic nutrients from the plant. Organic nutrients are thought to be supplied primarily in the form of sugars. Here we show that the AM fungus <i>Rhizophagus irregularis</i> is a fatty acid auxotroph and that fatty acids synthesized in the host plants are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>red to the fungus to sustain mycorrhizal colonization. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> is dependent on RAM2 (REQUIRED FOR ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZATION 2) and the ATP binding cassette transporter–mediated plant lipid export pathway. We further show that plant fatty acids can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>red to the pathogenic fungus <i>Golovinomyces cichoracerum</i> and are required for colonization by pathogens. We suggest that the mutualistic mycorrhizal and pathogenic fungi similarly recruit the fatty acid biosynthesis program to facilitate host invasion.</p>

Photosensitized, energy transfer-mediated organometallic catalysis through electronically excited nickel(II)
<p>Transition metal catalysis has traditionally relied on organometallic complexes that can cycle through a series of ground-state oxidation levels to achieve a series of discrete yet fundamental fragment-coupling steps. The viability of excited-state organometallic catalysis via direct photoexcitation has been demonstrated. Although the utility of triplet sensitization by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">energy transf</span></strong>er has long been known as a powerful activation mode in organic photochemistry, it is surprising to recognize that photosensitization mechanisms to access excited-state organometallic catalysts have lagged far behind. Here, we demonstrate excited-state organometallic catalysis via such an activation pathway: <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">energy transf</span></strong>er from an iridium sensitizer produces an excited-state nickel complex that couples aryl halides with carboxylic acids. Detailed mechanistic studies confirm the role of photosensitization via <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">energy transf</span></strong>er.</p>

Spectroscopic snapshots of the proton-transfer mechanism in water
<p>The Grotthuss mechanism explains the anomalously high proton mobility in water as a sequence of proton <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>s along a hydrogen-bonded (H-bonded) network. However, the vibrational spectroscopic signatures of this process are masked by the diffuse nature of the key bands in bulk water. Here we report how the much simpler vibrational spectra of cold, composition-selected heavy water clusters, D<sup>+</sup>(D<sub>2</sub>O)<i><sub>n</sub></i>, can be exploited to capture clear markers that encode the collective reaction coordinate along the proton-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> event.

The Hydrogen Isotope Composition δ<sup>2</sup>H Reflects Plant Performance
<p>The stable carbon (δ<sup>13</sup>C) and oxygen (δ<sup>18</sup>O) isotope compositions in plant matter reflect photosynthetic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transpir</span></strong>ative conditions in plants, respectively. However, the nature of hydrogen isotope composition (δ<sup>2</sup>H) and what it reflects of plant performance is poorly understood. Using durum wheat (<i>Triticum turgidum</i> var <i>durum</i>), this study evaluated the effect of different water and nitrogen growing field conditions on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transpir</span></strong>ation and how this effect influenced the performance of δ<sup>2</sup>H in autotrophic (flag leaf), mixotrophic (ears), and heterotrophic (grains and roots) organs. Moreover, δ<sup>2</sup>H was compared with the δ<sup>13</sup>C and δ<sup>18</sup>O in the same organs. Isotope compositions were analyzed in dry matter, the water-soluble fraction, and in water from different tissues of a set of genotypes. Similar to δ<sup>13</sup>C, the δ<sup>2</sup>H correlated negatively with stomatal conductance, whereas no correlation was observed for δ<sup>18</sup>O. Moreover, δ<sup>2</sup>H was not only affected by changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transpir</span></strong>ation but also by photosynthetic reactions, probably as a consequence of NADPH formation in autotrophic organs. Compared with the δ<sup>2</sup>H of stem water, plant δ<sup>2</sup>H was strongly diminished in photosynthetic organs such as the flag leaves, whereas it strongly increased in heterotrophic organs such as grains and roots. In heterotrophic organs, δ<sup>2</sup>H was associated with postphotosynthetic effects because there are several processes that lead to <sup>2</sup>H-enrichment of carbohydrates. In summary, δ<sup>2</sup>H exhibited specific features that inform about the water conditions of the wheat crop, together with the photosynthetic characteristics of the plant part considered. Moreover, correlations of δ<sup>2</sup>H with grain yield illustrate that this isotope can be used to assess plant performance under different growing conditions.</p>

Paralogs of the C-Terminal Domain of the Cyanobacterial Orange Carotenoid Protein Are Carotenoid Donors to Helical Carotenoid Proteins
<p>The photoactive Orange Carotenoid Protein (OCP) photoprotects cyanobacteria cells by quenching singlet oxygen and excess excitation energy. Its N-terminal domain is the active part of the protein, and the C-terminal domain regulates the activity. Recently, the characteristics of a family of soluble carotenoid-binding proteins (Helical Carotenoid Proteins [HCPs]), paralogs of the N-terminal domain of OCP, were described. Bioinformatics studies also revealed the existence of genes coding for homologs of CTD. Here, we show that the latter genes encode carotenoid proteins (CTDHs). This family of proteins contains two subgroups with distinct characteristics. One CTDH of each clade was further characterized, and they proved to be very good singlet oxygen quenchers. When synthesized in <i>Escherichia coli</i> or <i>Synechocystis</i> PCC 6803, CTDHs formed dimers that share a carotenoid molecule and are able to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> their carotenoid to apo-HCPs and apo-OCP. The CTDHs from clade 2 have a cysteine in position 103. A disulfide bond is easily formed between the monomers of the dimer preventing carotenoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>. This suggests that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> of the carotenoid could be redox regulated in clade 2 CTDH. We also demonstrate here that apo-OCPs and apo-CTDHs are able to take the carotenoid directly from membranes, while HCPs are unable to do so. HCPs need the presence of CTDH to become holo-proteins. We propose that, in cyanobacteria, the CTDHs are carotenoid donors to HCPs.</p>

Glycolysis plays an important role in energy transfer from the base to the distal end of the flagellum in mouse sperm
<p>Many studies have been conducted to elucidate the relationship between energy metabolic pathways (glycolysis and respiration) and flagellar motility in mammalian sperm, but the contribution of glycolysis to sperm motility has not yet been fully elucidated. In the present study, we performed detailed analysis of mouse sperm flagellar motility for further understanding of the contribution of glycolysis to mammalian sperm motility. Mouse sperm maintained vigorous motility in the presence of substrates either for glycolysis or for respiration. By contrast, inhibition of glycolysis by alpha-chlorohydrine caused a significant decrease in the bend angle of the flagellar bending wave, sliding velocity of outer doublet microtubules and ATP content even in the presence of respiratory substrates (pyruvate or β-hydroxybutyrate). The decrease of flagellar bend angle and sliding velocity are prominent in the distal part of the flagellum, indicating that glycolysis inhibition caused the decrease in ATP concentration threrein. These results suggest that glycolysis potentially acts as a spatial ATP buffering system, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>ring energy (ATP) synthesized by respiration at the mitochondria located in the basal part of the flagellum to the distal part. In order to validate that glycolytic enzymes can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> high energy phosphoryls, we calculated intraflagellar concentration profiles of adenine nucleotides along the flagellum by computer simulation analysis. The result demonstrated the involvement of glycolysis for maintaining the ATP concentration at the tip of the flagellum. It is likely that glycolysis plays a key role in energy homeostasis in mouse sperm not only through ATP production but also through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">energy transf</span></strong>er.</p>

Fkbp1a controls ventricular myocardium trabeculation and compaction by regulating endocardial Notch1 activity
<p>Trabeculation and compaction of the embryonic myocardium are morphogenetic events crucial for the formation and function of the ventricular walls. Fkbp1a (FKBP12) is a ubiquitously expressed <i>cis</i>-<i>trans</i> peptidyl-prolyl isomerase. <i>Fkbp1a</i>-deficient mice develop ventricular hypertrabeculation and noncompaction. To determine the physiological function of Fkbp1a in regulating the intercellular and intracellular signaling pathways involved in ventricular trabeculation and compaction, we generated a series of <i>Fkbp1a</i> conditional knockouts. Surprisingly, cardiomyocyte-restricted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ion of <i>Fkbp1a</i> did not give rise to the ventricular developmental defect, whereas endothelial cell-restricted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ion of <i>Fkbp1a</i> recapitulated the ventricular hypertrabeculation and noncompaction observed in <i>Fkbp1a</i> systemically deficient mice, suggesting an important contribution of Fkbp1a within the developing endocardia in regulating the morphogenesis of ventricular trabeculation and compaction. Further analysis demonstrated that Fkbp1a is a novel negative modulator of activated Notch1. Activated Notch1 (N1ICD) was significantly upregulated in <i>Fkbp1a</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ed endothelial cells <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>. Overexpression of Fkbp1a significantly reduced the stability of N1ICD and direct inhibition of Notch signaling significantly reduced hypertrabeculation in <i>Fkbp1a</i>-deficient mice. Our findings suggest that Fkbp1a-mediated regulation of Notch1 plays an important role in intercellular communication between endocardium and myocardium, which is crucial in controlling the formation of the ventricular walls.</p>

Interferon Regulatory Factor 4 Inhibits Neointima Formation by Engaging Krüppel-Like Factor 4 Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The mechanisms underlying neointima formation remain unclear. Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), which are key innate immune regulators, play important roles in cardiometabolic diseases. However, the function of IRF4 in arterial restenosis is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>IRF4 expression was first detected in human and mouse restenotic arteries. Then, the effects of IRF4 on neointima formation were evaluated with universal IRF4-deficient mouse and rat carotid artery injury models. We performed immunostaining to identify IRF4-expressing cells in the lesions. Smooth muscle cell (SMC)–specific IRF4-knockout (KO) and -transgenic (TG) mice were generated to evaluate the effects of SMC-IRF4 on neointima formation. We used microarray, bioinformatics analysis, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay to identify the downstream signals of IRF4 and to verify the targets in vitro. We compared SMC-IRF4-KO/Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4)–TG mice with SMC-IRF4-KO mice and SMC-specific IRF4-TG/KLF4-KO mice with SMC-specific IRF4-TG mice to investigate whether the effect of IRF4 on neointima formation is KLF4-dependent. The effect of IRF4 on SMC phenotype switching was also evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>IRF4 expression in both the human and mouse restenotic arteries is eventually downregulated. Universal IRF4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ion potentiates neointima formation in both mice and rats. Immunostaining indicated that IRF4 was expressed primarily in SMCs in restenotic arteries. After injury, SMC-IRF4-KO mice developed a thicker neointima than control mice. This change was accompanied by increased SMC proliferation and migration. However, SMC-specific IRF4-TG mice exhibited the opposite phenotype, demonstrating that IRF4 exerts protective effects against neointima formation. The mechanistic study indicated that IRF4 promotes KLF4 expression by directly binding to its promoter. Genetic overexpression of KLF4 in SMCs largely reversed the neointima-promoting effect of IRF4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ion, whereas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ion of KLF4 abolished the protective function of IRF4, indicating that the protective effects of IRF4 against neointima formation are KLF4-dependent.

Optogenetic manipulation of stomatal kinetics improves carbon assimilation, water use, and growth
<p>Stomata serve dual and often conflicting roles, facilitating carbon dioxide influx into the plant leaf for photosynthesis and restricting water efflux via <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transpir</span></strong>ation. Strategies for reducing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transpir</span></strong>ation without incurring a cost for photosynthesis must circumvent this inherent coupling of carbon dioxide and water vapor diffusion. We expressed the synthetic, light-gated K<sup>+</sup> channel BLINK1 in guard cells surrounding stomatal pores in <i>Arabidopsis</i> to enhance the solute fluxes that drive stomatal aperture. BLINK1 introduced a K<sup>+</sup> conductance and accelerated both stomatal opening under light exposure and closing after irradiation. Integrated over the growth period, BLINK1 drove a 2.2-fold increase in biomass in fluctuating light without cost in water use by the plant. Thus, we demonstrate the potential of enhancing stomatal kinetics to improve water use efficiency without penalty in carbon fixation.</p>

Our findings demonstrate direct communication between a resident gut microbe and the host and show that under physiological conditions, IECs acquire antigens from commensal bacteria for generation of T cell responses to the resident microbiota.</p>

<p>Toxic proteins are prime targets for molecular farming (the generation of pharmacologically active or biotechnologically usable compounds in plants) and are also efficient tools for targeted cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ion in genetics, developmental biology, and biotechnology. However, achieving conditional activity of cytotoxins and maintaining the toxin-expressing plants as stably transformed lines remain challenging. Here, we produce a switchable version of the highly cytotoxic bacterial RNase barnase by fusing the protein to a portable protein degradation cassette, the low-temperature degron cassette. This method allows conditional genetics based on conditional protein degradation via the N-end rule or N-degron pathway and has been used to vice versa accumulate and/or deplete a diverse variety of highly active, unstable or stable target proteins in different living multicellular organisms and cell systems. Moreover, we expressed the barnase fusion under control of the trichome-specific <i>TRIPTYCHON</i> promoter. This enabled efficient temperature-dependent control of protein accumulation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaf hairs (trichomes). By tuning the levels of the protein, we were able to control the fate of trichomes in vivo. The on-demand formation of trichomes through manipulating the balance between stabilization and destabilization of barnase provides proof of concept for a robust and powerful tool for conditional switchable cell arrest. We present this tool as a potential strategy for the manufacture and accumulation of cytotoxic proteins and toxic high-value products in plants or for conditional genetic cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ion.</p>

Measurement of Gross Photosynthesis, Respiration in the Light, and Mesophyll Conductance Using H<sub>2</sub><sup>18</sup>O Labeling
<p>A fundamental challenge in plant physiology is independently determining the rates of gross O<sub>2</sub> production by photosynthesis and O<sub>2</sub> consumption by respiration, photorespiration, and other processes. Previous studies on isolated chloroplasts or leaves have separately constrained net and gross O<sub>2</sub> production (NOP and GOP, respectively) by labeling ambient O<sub>2</sub> with <sup>18</sup>O while leaf water was unlabeled. Here, we describe a method to accurately measure GOP and NOP of whole detached leaves in a cuvette as a routine gas-exchange measurement. The petiole is immersed in water enriched to a δ<sup>18</sup>O of ∼9,000‰, and leaf water is labeled through the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transpir</span></strong>ation stream. Photosynthesis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>s <sup>18</sup>O from H<sub>2</sub>O to O<sub>2</sub>. GOP is calculated from the increase in δ<sup>18</sup>O of O<sub>2</sub> as air passes through the cuvette. NOP is determined from the increase in O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>. Both terms are measured by isotope ratio mass spectrometry. CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation and other standard gas-exchange parameters also were measured. Reproducible measurements are made on a single leaf for more than 15 h. We used this method to measure the light response curve of NOP and GOP in French bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>) at 21% and 2% O<sub>2</sub>. We then used these data to examine the O<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> ratio of net photosynthesis, the light response curve of mesophyll conductance, and the apparent inhibition of respiration in the light (Kok effect) at both oxygen levels. The results are discussed in the context of evaluating the technique as a tool to study and understand leaf physiological traits.</p>

Autophagy Deficiency Compromises Alternative Pathways of Respiration following Energy Deprivation in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>Under heterotrophic conditions, carbohydrate oxidation inside the mitochondrion is the primary energy source for cellular metabolism. However, during energy-limited conditions, alternative substrates are required to support respiration. Amino acid oxidation in plant cells plays a key role in this by generating electrons that can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>red to the mitochondrial electron transport chain via the electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> flavoprotein/ubiquinone oxidoreductase system. Autophagy, a catabolic mechanism for macromolecule and protein recycling, allows the maintenance of amino acid pools and nutrient remobilization. Although the association between autophagy and alternative respiratory substrates has been suggested, the extent to which autophagy and primary metabolism interact to support plant respiration remains unclear. To investigate the metabolic importance of autophagy during development and under extended darkness, Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants with disruption of autophagy (<i>atg</i> mutants) were used. Under normal growth conditions, <i>atg</i> mutants showed lower growth and seed production with no impact on photosynthesis. Following extended darkness, <i>atg</i> mutants were characterized by signatures of early senescence, including decreased chlorophyll content and maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II coupled with increases in dark respiration. Transcript levels of genes involved in alternative pathways of respiration and amino acid catabolism were up-regulated in <i>atg</i> mutants. The metabolite profiles of dark-treated leaves revealed an extensive metabolic reprogramming in which increases in amino acid levels were partially compromised in <i>atg</i> mutants. Although an enhanced respiration in <i>atg</i> mutants was observed during extended darkness, autophagy deficiency compromises protein degradation and the generation of amino acids used as alternative substrates to the respiration.</p>

Acyl-CoA:Lysophosphatidylethanolamine Acyltransferase Activity Regulates Growth of Arabidopsis
<p>Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) contains two enzymes (encoded by the <i>At1g80950</i> and <i>At2g45670</i> genes) preferentially acylating lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE) with acyl-coenzyme A (CoA), designated LYSOPHOSPHATIDYLETHANOLAMINE ACYL<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>ASE1 (LPEAT1) and LPEAT2. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> DNA insertion mutant lpeat2 and the double mutant lpeat1 lpeat2 showed impaired growth, smaller leaves, shorter roots, less seed setting, and reduced lipid content per fresh weight in roots and seeds and large increases in LPE and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) contents in leaves. Microsomal preparations from leaves of these mutants showed around 70% decrease in acylation activity of LPE with 16:0-CoA compared with wild-type membranes, whereas the acylation with 18:1-CoA was much less affected, demonstrating that other lysophospholipid acyl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>ases than the two LPEATs could acylate LPE. The above-mentioned effects were less pronounced in the single lpeat1 mutant. Overexpression of either LPEAT1 or LPEAT2 under the control of the 35S promotor led to morphological changes opposite to what was seen in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> DNA mutants. Acyl specificity studies showed that LPEAT1 utilized 16:0-CoA at the highest rate of 11 tested acyl-CoAs, whereas LPEAT2 utilized 20:0-CoA as the best acyl donor. Both LPEATs could acylate either <i>sn</i> position of ether analogs of LPC. The data show that the activities of LPEAT1 and LPEAT2 are, in a complementary way, involved in growth regulation in Arabidopsis. It is shown that LPEAT activity (especially LPEAT2) is essential for maintaining adequate levels of phosphatidylethanolamine, LPE, and LPC in the cells.</p>

Two Trichome Birefringence-Like Proteins Mediate Xylan Acetylation, Which Is Essential for Leaf Blight Resistance in Rice
<p>Acetylation is a ubiquitous modification on cell wall polymers, which play a structural role in plant growth and stress defenses. However, the mechanisms for how crop plants accomplish cell wall polymer <i>O</i>-acetylation are largely unknown. Here, we report on the isolation and characterization of two <i>trichome birefringence-like</i> (<i>tbl</i>) mutants in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), which are affected in xylan <i>O</i>-acetylation. <i>ostbl1</i> and <i>ostbl2</i> single mutant and the <i>tbl1 tbl2</i> double mutant displayed a stunted growth phenotype with varied degree of dwarfism. As shown by chemical assays, the wall acetylation level is affected in the mutants and the knock-down and overexpression transgenic plants. Furthermore, NMR spectroscopy analyses showed that all those mutants have varied decreases in xylan monoacetylation. The divergent expression levels of <i>OsTBL1</i> and <i>OsTBL2</i> explained the chemotype difference and indicated that <i>OsTBL1</i> is a functionally dominant gene. OsTBL1 was found to be Golgi-localized. The recombinant OsTBL1 protein incorporates acetyl groups onto xylan. By using xylopentaose, a preferred acceptor substrate, OsTBL1 can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> up to four acetyl residues onto xylopentaose, and this activity showed saturable kinetics. 2D-NMR spectroscopy showed that OsTBL1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>s acetate to both 2-<i>O</i> and 3-<i>O</i> sites of xylosyl residues. In addition, <i>ostbl1</i> and <i>tbl1 tbl2</i> displayed susceptibility to rice blight disease, indicating that this xylan modification is required for pathogen resistance. This study identifies the major genes responsible for xylan acetylation in rice plants.</p>

Methyl Transfer in Glucosinolate Biosynthesis Mediated by Indole Glucosinolate <i>O</i>-Methyltransferase 5
<p>Indole glucosinolates (IGs) are plant secondary metabolites that are derived from the amino acid tryptophan. The product of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) IG core biosynthesis, indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate (I3M), can be modified by hydroxylation and subsequent methoxylation of the indole ring in position 1 (1-IG modification) or 4 (4-IG modification). Products of the 4-IG modification pathway mediate plant-enemy interactions and are particularly important for Arabidopsis innate immunity. While <i>CYP81F</i>s encoding cytochrome P450 monooxygenases and <i>IGMT</i>s encoding indole glucosinolate <i>O</i>-methyl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>ases have been identified as key genes for IG modification, our knowledge about the IG modification pathways is not complete. In particular, it is unknown which enzyme is responsible for methyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> in the 1-IG modification pathway and whether this pathway plays a role in defense, similar to 4-IG modification. Here, we analyze two Arabidopsis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> DNA insertion lines with targeted metabolomics. We show that biosynthesis of 1-methoxyindol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate (1MOI3M) from I3M involves the predicted unstable intermediate 1-hydroxyindol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate (1OHI3M) and that <i>IGMT5</i>, a gene with moderate similarity to previously characterized <i>IGMT</i>s, encodes the methyl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>ase that is responsible for the conversion of 1OHI3M to 1MOI3M. Disruption of IGMT5 function increases resistance against the root-knot nematode <i>Meloidogyne javanica</i> and suggests a potential role for the 1-IG modification pathway in Arabidopsis belowground defense.</p>

Reversible Leaf Xylem Collapse: A Potential “Circuit Breaker” against Cavitation
<p>We report a novel form of xylem dysfunction in angiosperms: reversible collapse of the xylem conduits of the smallest vein orders that demarcate and intrusively irrigate the areoles of red oak (<i>Quercus rubra</i>) leaves. Cryo-scanning electron microscopy revealed gradual increases in collapse from approximately −2 MPa down to −3 MPa, saturating thereafter (to −4 MPa). Over this range, cavitation remained negligible in these veins. Imaging of rehydration experiments showed spatially variable recovery from collapse within 20 s and complete recovery after 2 min. More broadly, the patterns of deformation induced by desiccation in both mesophyll and xylem suggest that cell wall collapse is unlikely to depend solely on individual wall properties, as mechanical constraints imposed by neighbors appear to be important. From the perspective of equilibrium leaf water potentials, petioles, whose vessels extend into the major veins, showed a vulnerability to cavitation that overlapped in the water potential domain with both minor vein collapse and buckling (turgor loss) of the living cells. However, models of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transpir</span></strong>ation transients showed that minor vein collapse and mesophyll capacitance could effectively buffer major veins from cavitation over time scales relevant to the rectification of stomatal wrong-way responses. We suggest that, for angiosperms, whose subsidiary cells give up large volumes to allow large stomatal apertures at the cost of potentially large wrong-way responses, vein collapse could make an important contribution to these plants’ ability to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transpir</span></strong>e near the brink of cavitation-inducing water potentials.</p>

Flexible strategies for flight control: an active role for the abdomen
<p>Moving animals orchestrate myriad motor systems in response to multimodal sensory inputs. Coordinating movement is particularly challenging in flight control, where animals deal with potential instability and multiple degrees of freedom of movement. Prior studies have focused on wings as the primary flight control structures, for which changes in angle of attack or shape are used to modulate lift and drag forces. However, other actuators that may impact flight performance are reflexively activated during flight. We investigated the visual–abdominal reflex displayed by the hawkmoth <i>Manduca sexta</i> to determine its role in flight control. We measured the open-loop stimulus–response characteristics (measured as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> function) between the visual stimulus and abdominal response in tethered moths. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> function reveals a 41 ms delay and a high-pass filter behavior with a pass band starting at ~0.5 Hz. We also developed a simplified mathematical model of hovering flight wherein articulation of the thoracic–abdominal joint redirects an average lift force provided by the wings. We show that control of the joint, subject to a high-pass filter, is sufficient to maintain stable hovering, but with a slim stability margin. Our experiments and models suggest a novel mechanism by which articulation of the body or ‘airframe’ of an animal can be used to redirect lift forces for effective flight control. Furthermore, the small stability margin may increase flight agility by easing the transition from stable flight to a more maneuverable, unstable regime.</p>

Genome-Wide Development and Use of Microsatellite Markers for Large-Scale Genotyping Applications in Foxtail Millet [<i>Setaria italica</i> (L.)]
<p>The availability of well-validated informative co-dominant microsatellite markers and saturated genetic linkage map has been limited in foxtail millet (<i>Setaria italica</i> L.). In view of this, we conducted a genome-wide analysis and identified 28 342 microsatellite repeat-motifs spanning 405.3 Mb of foxtail millet genome. The trinucleotide repeats (∼48%) was prevalent when compared with dinucleotide repeats (∼46%). Of the 28 342 microsatellites, 21 294 (∼75%) primer pairs were successfully designed, and a total of 15 573 markers were physically mapped on 9 chromosomes of foxtail millet. About 159 markers were validated successfully in 8 accessions of <i>Setaria</i> sp. with ∼67% polymorphic potential. The high percentage (89.3%) of cross-genera <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>ability across millet and non-millet species with higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>ability percentage in bioenergy grasses (∼79%, Switchgrass and ∼93%, Pearl millet) signifies their importance in studying the bioenergy grasses. <i>In silico</i> comparative mapping of 15 573 foxtail millet microsatellite markers against the mapping data of sorghum (16.9%), maize (14.5%) and rice (6.4%) indicated syntenic relationships among the chromosomes of foxtail millet and target species. The results, thus, demonstrate the immense applicability of developed microsatellite markers in germplasm characterization, phylogenetics, construction of genetic linkage map for gene/quantitative trait loci discovery, comparative mapping in foxtail millet, including other millets and bioenergy grass species.</p>

Cardioprotective Role of Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells in Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a heterogeneous population of cells that expand in cancer, inflammation, and infection and negatively regulate inflammation and the immune response. Heart failure (HF) is a complex clinical syndrome wherein inflammation induction and incomplete resolution can potentially contribute to HF development and progression. However, the role of MDSCs in HF remains unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The percentage of MDSCs in patients with HF and in mice with pressure overload–induced HF using isoproterenol infusion or transverse aortic constriction (TAC) was detected by flow cytometry. The effects of MDSCs on isoproterenol- or TAC-induced HF were observed on depleting MDSCs with 5-fluorouracil (50 mg/kg) or gemcitabine (120 mg/kg), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong>ring purified MDSCs, or enhancing endogenous MDSCs with rapamycin (2 mg·kg<sup>−1</sup>·d<sup>−1</sup>). Hypertrophic markers and inflammatory factors were detected by ELISA, real-time polymerase chain reaction, or Western blot. Cardiac functions were determined by echocardiography and hemodynamic analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The percentage of human leukocyte antigen-D–related (HLA-DR)<sup>−</sup>CD33<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> MDSCs in the blood of patients with HF was significantly increased and positively correlated with disease severity and increased plasma levels of cytokines, including interleukin-6, interleukin-10, and transforming growth factor–β. Furthermore, MDSCs derived from patients with HF inhibited T-cell proliferation and interferon-γ secretion. Similar results were observed in TAC- and isoproterenol-induced HF in mice. Pharmaceutical depletion of MDSCs significantly exacerbated isoproterenol- and TAC-induced pathological cardiac remodeling and inflammation, whereas adoptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer</span></strong> of MDSCs prominently rescued isoproterenol- and TAC-induced HF. Consistently, administration of rapamycin significantly increased endogenous MDSCs by suppressing their differentiation and improved isoproterenol- and TAC-induced HF, but MDSC depletion mostly blocked beneficial rapamycin-mediated effects. Mechanistically, MDSC-secreted molecules suppressed isoproterenol-induced hypertrophy and proinflammatory gene expression in cardiomyocytes in a coculture system. Neutralization of interleukin-10 blunted both monocytic MDSC- and granulocytic MDSC–mediated anti-inflammatory and antihypertrophic effects, but treatment with a nitric oxide inhibitor only partially blocked the antihypertrophic effect of monocytic MDSCs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings revealed a cardioprotective role of MDSCs in HF by their antihypertrophic effects on cardiomyocytes and anti-inflammatory effects through interleukin-10 and nitric oxide. Pharmacological targeting of MDSCs by rapamycin constitutes a promising therapeutic strategy for HF.</p></sec>

CD301b/MGL2<sup>+</sup> Mononuclear Phagocytes Orchestrate Autoimmune Cardiac Valve Inflammation and Fibrosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Valvular heart disease is common and affects the mitral valve (MV) most frequently. Despite the prevalence of MV disease (MVD), the cellular and molecular pathways that initiate and perpetuate it are not well understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>K/B.g7 T-cell receptor transgenic mice spontaneously develop systemic autoantibody-associated autoimmunity, leading to fully penetrant fibroinflammatory MVD and arthritis. We used multiparameter flow cytometry, intracellular cytokine staining, and immunofluorescent staining to characterize the cells in inflamed K/B.g7 MVs. We used genetic approaches to study the contribution of mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) to MVD in this model. Specifically, we generated K/B.g7 mice in which either CX3CR1 or CD301b/macrophage galactose <i>N</i>-acetylgalactosamine–specific lectin 2 (MGL2)–expressing MNPs were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ed. Using K/B.g7 mice expressing <i>Cx3Cr1</i>-Cre, we conditionally deleted critical inflammatory molecules from MNPs, including the Fc-receptor signal-transducing tyrosine kinase Syk and the cell adhesion molecule very late antigen–4. We performed complementary studies using monoclonal antibodies to block key inflammatory molecules. We generated bone marrow chimeric mice to define the origin of the inflammatory cells present in the MV and to determine which valve cells respond to the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Finally, we examined specimens from patients with rheumatic heart disease to correlate our findings to human pathology.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>MNPs comprised the vast majority of MV-infiltrating cells; these MNPs expressed CX3CR1 and CD301b/MGL2.

K/B.g7 mice lacking CX3CR1 or in which CD301b/MGL2-expressing MNPs were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ed were protected from MVD. The valve-infiltrating CD301b/MGL2<sup>+</sup> MNPs expressed tissue-reparative molecules including arginase-1 and resistin-like molecule α. These MNPs also expressed the proinflammatory cytokines TNF and interleukin-6, and antibody blockade of these cytokines prevented MVD. Deleting Syk from CX3CR1-expressing MNPs reduced their TNF and interleukin-6 production and also prevented MVD. TNF acted through TNF receptor–1 expressed on valve-resident cells to increase the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule–1. Conditionally deleting the vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ligand very late antigen–4 from CX3CR1-expressing MNPs prevented MVD.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>CD301b/MGL2<sup>+</sup> MNPs are key drivers of autoimmune MVD in K/B.g7 mice and are also present in human rheumatic heart disease.

Clinical Profile and Consequences of Atrial Fibrillation in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common sustained arrhythmia in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), is capable of producing symptoms that impact quality of life and is associated with risk for embolic stroke. However, the influence of AF on clinical course and outcome in HCM remains incompletely resolved.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Records of 1558 consecutive patients followed at the Tufts Medical Center Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Institute for 4.8±3.4 years (from 2004 to 2014) were accessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of the 1558 patients with HCM, 304 (20%) had episodes of AF, of which 226 (74%) were confined to symptomatic paroxysmal AF (average, 5±5; range, 1 to >20), whereas 78 (26%) developed permanent AF, preceded by 7±6 paroxysmal AF episodes. At last evaluation, 277 patients (91%) are alive at 62±13 years of age, including 89% in New York Heart Association class I or II. No difference was found in outcome measures for patients with AF and age- and sex-matched patients with HCM without AF. Four percent of patients with AF died of HCM-related causes (n=11), with annual mortality 0.7%; mortality directly attributable to AF (thromboembolism without prophylactic anticoagulation) was 0.1% per year (n=2 patients). Patients were treated with antiarrhythmic drugs (most commonly amiodarone [n=103] or sotalol [n=78]) and AF catheter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ablat</span></strong>ion (n=49) or the Maze procedure at surgical myectomy (n=72).

AF is an uncommon primary cause of death in HCM virtually limited to embolic stroke, supporting a low threshold for initiating anticoagulation therapy.</p></sec>

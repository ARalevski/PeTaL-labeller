Ceramic-on-ceramic bearing fractures in total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Ceramic-on-ceramic (CoC) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>ings in total hip arthroplasty (THA)   are commonly used, but concerns exist regarding ceramic fracture.   This study aims to report the risk of revision for fracture of modern   CoC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>ings and identify factors that might influence this risk,   using data from the National Joint Registry (NJR) for England, Wales, Northern   Ireland and the Isle of Man.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We analysed data on 223 362 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>ings from 111 681 primary CoC   THAs and 182 linked revisions for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>ing fracture recorded in the   NJR. We used implant codes to identify ceramic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>ing composition   and generated Kaplan-Meier estimates for implant survivorship. Logistic   regression analyses were performed for implant size and patient specific   variables to determine any associated risks for revision.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 222 852 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>ings (99.8%) were CeramTec Biolox products.   Revisions for fracture were linked to seven of 79 442 (0.009%) Biolox   Delta heads, 38 of 31 982 (0.119%) Biolox Forte heads, 101 of 80   170 (0.126%) Biolox Delta liners and 35 of 31 258 (0.112%) Biolox   Forte liners. Regression analysis of implant size revealed smaller   heads had significantly higher odds of fracture (chi-squared 68.0,   p < 0.001). The highest fracture risk was observed in the 28 mm   Biolox Forte subgroup (0.382%). There were no fractures in the 40   mm head group for either ceramic type. Liner thickness was not predictive   of fracture (p = 0.67). Body mass index (BMI) was independently   associated with revision for both head fractures (odds ratio (OR)   1.09 per unit increase, p = 0.031) and liner fractures (OR 1.06   per unit increase, p = 0.006). </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We report the largest independent study of CoC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>ing fractures   to date. The risk of revision for CoC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>ing fracture is very low   but previous studies have underestimated this risk. There is good   evidence that the latest generation of ceramic has greatly reduced   the odds of head fracture but not of liner fracture. Small head   size and high patient BMI are associated with an increased risk   of ceramic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>ing fracture.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1012–19.</p></sec>

Brown and Polar Bear Y Chromosomes Reveal Extensive Male-Biased Gene Flow within Brother Lineages
<p>Brown and polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>s have become prominent examples in phylogeography, but previous phylogeographic studies relied largely on maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or were geographically restricted. The male-specific Y chromosome, a natural counterpart to mtDNA, has remained underexplored. Although this paternally inherited chromosome is indispensable for comprehensive analyses of phylogeographic patterns, technical difficulties and low variability have hampered its application in most mammals. We developed 13 novel Y-chromosomal sequence and microsatellite markers from the polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong> genome and screened these in a broad geographic sample of 130 brown and polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>s. We also analyzed a 390-kb-long Y-chromosomal scaffold using sequencing data from published male ursine genomes. Y chromosome evidence support the emerging understanding that brown and polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>s started to diverge no later than the Middle Pleistocene. Contrary to mtDNA patterns, we found 1) brown and polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>s to be reciprocally monophyletic sister (or rather brother) lineages, without signals of introgression, 2) male-biased gene flow across continents and on phylogeographic time scales, and 3) male dispersal that links the Alaskan ABC islands population to mainland brown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>s. Due to female philopatry, mtDNA provides a highly structured estimate of population differentiation, while male-biased gene flow is a homogenizing force for nuclear genetic variation. Our findings highlight the importance of analyzing both maternally and paternally inherited loci for a comprehensive view of phylogeographic history, and that mtDNA-based phylogeographic studies of many mammals should be reevaluated. Recent advances in sequencing technology render the analysis of Y-chromosomal variation feasible, even in nonmodel organisms.</p>

‘Modern’ distal femoral locking plates allow safe, early weight-bearing with a high rate of union and low rate of failure
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Fractures of the distal femur can be challenging to manage and   are on the increase in the elderly osteoporotic population. Management   with casting or bracing can unacceptably limit a patient’s ability   to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong> weight, but historically, operative fixation has been associated   with a high rate of re-operation. In this study, we describe the outcomes   of fixation using modern implants within a strategy of early return   to function.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>All patients treated at our centre with lateral distal femoral   locking plates (LDFLP) between 2009 and 2014 were identified. Fracture   classification and operative information including weight-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>ing   status, rates of union, re-operation, failure of implants and mortality   rate, were recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 127 fractures were identified in 122 patients. The   mean age was 72.8 years (16 to 101) and 92 of the patients (75%)   were female.

In total 107 patients (84%) were allowed to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong> full weight immediately.   The rate of clinical and radiological union was 81/85 (95%) and   only four fractures of 127 (3%) fractures required re-operation   for failure of surgery.

Multivalent counterions diminish the lubricity of polyelectrolyte brushes
<p>Polyelectrolyte brushes provide wear protection and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lubric</span></strong>ation in many technical, medical, physiological, and biological applications. Wear resistance and low friction are attributed to counterion osmotic pressure and the hydration layer surrounding the charged polymer segments. However, the presence of multivalent counterions in solution can strongly affect the interchain interactions and structural properties of brush layers. We evaluated the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lubric</span></strong>ation properties of polystyrene sulfonate brush layers sliding against each other in aqueous solutions containing increasing concentrations of counterions. The presence of multivalent ions (Y<sup>3+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Ba<sup>2+</sup>), even at minute concentrations, markedly increases the friction forces between brush layers owing to electrostatic bridging and brush collapse. Our results suggest that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lubric</span></strong>ating properties of polyelectrolyte brushes in multivalent solution are hindered relative to those in monovalent solution.</p>

High-energy, high-fat lifestyle challenges an Arctic apex predator, the polar bear
<p>Regional declines in polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong> (<i>Ursus maritimus</i>) populations have been attributed to changing sea ice conditions, but with limited information on the causative mechanisms. By simultaneously measuring field metabolic rates, daily activity patterns, body condition, and foraging success of polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>s moving on the spring sea ice, we found that high metabolic rates (1.6 times greater than previously assumed) coupled with low intake of fat-rich marine mammal prey resulted in an energy deficit for more than half of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>s examined. Activity and movement on the sea ice strongly influenced metabolic demands. Consequently, increases in mobility resulting from ongoing and forecasted declines in and fragmentation of sea ice are likely to increase energy demands and may be an important factor explaining observed declines in body condition and survival.</p>

Preventing mussel adhesion using lubricant-infused materials
<p>Mussels are opportunistic macrofouling organisms that can attach to most immersed solid surfaces, leading to serious economic and ecological consequences for the maritime and aquaculture industries. We demonstrate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lubric</span></strong>ant-infused coatings exhibit very low preferential mussel attachment and ultralow adhesive strengths under both controlled laboratory conditions and in marine field studies. Detailed investigations across multiple length scales—from the molecular-scale characterization of deposited adhesive proteins to nanoscale contact mechanics to macroscale live observations—suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lubric</span></strong>ant infusion considerably reduces fouling by deceiving the mechanosensing ability of mussels, deterring secretion of adhesive threads, and decreasing the molecular work of adhesion. Our study demonstrates that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lubric</span></strong>ant infusion represents an effective strategy to mitigate marine biofouling and provides insights into the physical mechanisms underlying adhesion prevention.</p>

Ten-year follow-up study of three alternative bearing surfaces used in total hip arthroplasty in young patients
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We present the ten-year data of a cohort of patients, aged between   18 and 65 years (mean age 52.7 years; 19 to 64), who underwent total   hip arthroplasty. Patients were randomised to be treated with a   cobalt-chrome (CoCr) femoral head with an ultra-high molecular weight   polyethylene (UHMWPE), highly cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) or   ceramic-on-ceramic (CoC) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>ing surface.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 102 hips (91 patients) were randomised into the three   groups.

There were six patients   with UHMWPE who had non-progressive osteolysis and none in the XLPE   group.

Formyl-methionine as an N-degron of a eukaryotic N-end rule pathway
<p>In bacteria, nascent proteins <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong> the pretranslationally generated N-terminal (Nt) formyl-methionine (fMet) residue. Nt-fMet of bacterial proteins is a degradation signal, termed fMet/N-degron. By contrast, proteins synthesized by cytosolic ribosomes of eukaryotes were presumed to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong> unformylated Nt-Met. Here we found that the yeast formyltransferase Fmt1, although imported into mitochondria, could also produce Nt-formylated proteins in the cytosol. Nt-formylated proteins were strongly up-regulated in stationary phase or upon starvation for specific amino acids. This up-regulation strictly required the Gcn2 kinase, which phosphorylates Fmt1 and mediates its retention in the cytosol. We also found that the Nt-fMet residues of Nt-formylated proteins act as fMet/N-degrons and identified the Psh1 ubiquitin ligase as the recognition component of the eukaryotic fMet/N-end rule pathway, which destroys Nt-formylated proteins.</p>

Egocentric coding of external items in the lateral entorhinal cortex
<p>Episodic memory, the conscious recollection of past events, is typically experienced from a first-person (egocentric) perspective. The hippocampus plays an essential role in episodic memory and spatial cognition. Although the allocentric nature of hippocampal spatial coding is well understood, little is known about whether the hippocampus receives egocentric information about external items. We recorded in rats the activity of single neurons from the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) and medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), the two major inputs to the hippocampus. Many LEC neurons showed tuning for egocentric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>ing of external items, whereas MEC cells tended to represent allocentric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>ing. These results demonstrate a fundamental dissociation between the reference frames of LEC and MEC neural representations.</p>

Perivascular dendritic cells elicit anaphylaxis by relaying allergens to mast cells via microvesicles
<p>Anaphylactic reactions are triggered when allergens enter the blood circulation and activate immunoglobulin E (IgE)–sensitized mast cells (MCs), causing systemic discharge of prestored proinflammatory mediators. As MCs are extravascular, how they perceive circulating allergens remains a conundrum. Here, we describe the existence of a CD301b<sup>+</sup> perivascular dendritic cell (DC) subset that continuously samples blood and relays antigens to neighboring MCs, which vigorously degranulate and trigger anaphylaxis. DC antigen transfer involves the active discharge of surface-associated antigens on 0.5- to 1.0-micrometer microvesicles (MVs) generated by vacuolar protein sorting 4 (VPS4). Antigen sharing by DCs is not limited to MCs, as neighboring DCs also acquire antigen-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>ing MVs. This capacity of DCs to distribute antigen-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>ing MVs to various immune cells in the perivascular space potentiates inflammatory and immune responses to blood-borne antigens.</p>

The Vertebral Column of <i>Australopithecus sediba</i>
<p>Two partial vertebral columns of <i>Australopithecus sediba</i> grant insight into aspects of early hominin spinal mobility, lumbar curvature, vertebral formula, and transitional vertebra position. <i>Au. sediba</i> likely possessed five non–rib-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>ing lumbar vertebrae and five sacral elements, the same configuration that occurs modally in modern humans. This finding contrasts with other interpretations of early hominin regional vertebral numbers. Importantly, the transitional vertebra is distinct from and above the last rib-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>ing vertebra in <i>Au. sediba</i>, resulting in a functionally longer lower back. This configuration, along with a strongly wedged last lumbar vertebra and other indicators of lordotic posture, would have contributed to a highly flexible spine that is derived compared with earlier members of the genus <i>Australopithecus</i> and similar to that of the Nariokotome <i>Homo erectus</i> skeleton.</p>

Global Analysis of Gene Expression in Response to Whole-Chromosome Aneuploidy in Hexaploid Wheat
<p>Aneuploidy, a condition of unbalanced chromosome content, represents a large-effect mutation that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>s significant relevance to human health and microbe adaptation. As such, extensive studies of aneuploidy have been conducted in unicellular model organisms and cancer cells. Aneuploidy also frequently is associated with plant polyploidization, but its impact on gene expression and its relevance to polyploid genome evolution/functional innovation remain largely unknown. Here, we used a panel of diverse types of whole-chromosome aneuploidy of hexaploid wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>), all under the common genetic background of cv Chinese Spring, to systemically investigate the impact of aneuploidy on genome-, subgenome-, and chromosome-wide gene expression. Compared with prior findings in haploid or diploid aneuploid systems, we unravel additional and novel features of alteration in global gene expression resulting from the two major impacts of aneuploidy, cis- and trans-regulation, as well as dosage compensation. We show that the expression-altered genes map evenly along each chromosome, with no evidence for coregulating aggregated expression domains. However, chromosomes and subgenomes in hexaploid wheat are unequal in their responses to aneuploidy with respect to the number of genes being dysregulated. Strikingly, homeologous chromosomes do not differ from nonhomologous chromosomes in terms of aneuploidy-induced trans-acting effects, suggesting that the three constituent subgenomes of hexaploid wheat are largely uncoupled at the transcriptional level of gene regulation. Together, our findings shed new insights into the functional interplay between homeologous chromosomes and interactions between subgenomes in hexaploid wheat, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong> implications to further our understanding of allopolyploid genome evolution and efforts in breeding new allopolyploid crops.</p>

The use of femoral stems with exchangeable necks in primary total hip arthroplasty increases the rate of revision
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Femoral stems with exchangeable (modular) necks were introduced   to offer surgeons an increased choice when determining the version,   offset and length of the femoral neck during total hip arthroplasty   (THA). It was hoped that this would improve outcomes and reduce   complications, particularly dislocation. In 2010, the Australian Orthopaedic   Association National Joint Replacement Registry (AOANJRR) first   reported an increased rate of revision after primary THA using femoral   stems with an exchangeable neck. The aim of this study was to provide   a more comprehensive up-to-date analysis of primary THA using femoral   stems with exchangeable and fixed necks.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The data included all primary THA procedures performed for osteoarthritis   (OA), reported to the AOANJRR between 01 September 1999 and 31 December   2014.

Anterior knee pain and evidence of osteoarthritis of the patellofemoral joint should not be considered contraindications to mobile-bearing unicompartmental knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>It is not clear whether anterior knee pain and osteoarthritis   (OA) of the patellofemoral joint (PFJ) are contraindications to   medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA). Our aim was to   investigate the long-term outcome of a consecutive series of patients,   some of whom had anterior knee pain and PFJ OA managed with UKA.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We assessed the ten-year functional outcomes and 15-year implant   survival of 805 knees (677 patients) following medial mobile-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>ing   UKA. The intra-operative status of the PFJ was documented and, with   the exception of bone loss with grooving to the lateral side, neither   the clinical or radiological state of the PFJ nor the presence of   anterior knee pain were considered a contraindication. The impact   of radiographic findings and anterior knee pain was studied in a   subgroup of 100 knees (91 patients).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was no relationship between functional outcomes, at a mean   of ten years, or 15-year implant survival, and pre-operative anterior   knee pain, or the presence or degree of cartilage loss documented   intra-operatively at the medial patella or trochlea, or radiographic   evidence of OA in the medial side of the PFJ. In 6% of cases there   was full thickness cartilage loss on the lateral side of the patella.   In these cases, the overall ten-year function and 15-year survival   was similar to those without cartilage loss; however they had slightly   more difficulty with descending stairs.

Less   severe damage to the lateral side of the PFJ and damage to the medial   side, however severe, does not compromise the overall function or   survival, so should not be considered to be a contraindication. However,   if a patient does have full thickness cartilage loss on the lateral   side of the PFJ they may have a slight compromise in their ability   to descend stairs. Pre-operative anterior knee pain also does not   compromise the functional outcome or survival and should not be   considered to be a contraindication.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:632–9</p></sec>

One brain, many genomes
<p>We each begin life as a single cell harboring a single genome, which—over the course of development—gives rise to the trillions of cells that make up the body. From skin cells to heart cells to neurons of the brain, each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>s a copy of the original cell's genome. But as anyone who has used a copy machine or played the childhood game of “telephone” knows, copies are never perfect. Every cell in an individual actually has a unique genome, an imperfect copy of its cellular ancestor differentiated by inevitable somatic mutations arising from errors in DNA replication and other mutagenic forces (<i>1</i>). Somatic mutation is the fundamental process leading to all genetic diseases, including cancer; every inherited genetic disease also has its origins in such mutation events that occurred in an ancestor's germline cells. Yet how many and what kinds of somatic mutations accumulate in our cells as we develop and age has long been unknown and a blind spot in our understanding of the origins of genetic disease.</p>

FoxP influences the speed and accuracy of a perceptual decision in <i>Drosophila</i>
<p>Decisions take time if information gradually accumulates to a response threshold, but the neural mechanisms of integration and thresholding are unknown. We characterized a decision process in <i>Drosophila</i> that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>s the behavioral signature of evidence accumulation. As stimulus contrast in trained odor discriminations decreased, reaction times increased and perceptual accuracy declined, in quantitative agreement with a drift-diffusion model. <i>FoxP</i> mutants took longer than wild-type flies to form decisions of similar or reduced accuracy, especially in difficult, low-contrast tasks. RNA interference with <i>FoxP</i> expression in αβ core Kenyon cells, or the overexpression of a potassium conductance in these neurons, recapitulated the <i>FoxP</i> mutant phenotype. A mushroom body subdomain whose development or function require the transcription factor FoxP thus supports the progression of a decision toward commitment.</p>

Global rates of marine sulfate reduction and implications for sub–sea-floor metabolic activities
<p>Sulfate reduction is a globally important redox process in marine sediments, yet global rates are poorly quantified. We developed an artificial neural network trained with 199 sulfate profiles, constrained with geomorphological and geochemical maps to estimate global sulfate-reduction rate distributions. Globally, 11.3 teramoles of sulfate are reduced yearly (~15% of previous estimates), accounting for the oxidation of 12 to 29% of the organic carbon flux to the sea floor. Combined with global cell distributions in marine sediments, these results indicate a strong contrast in sub–sea-floor prokaryote habitats: In continental margins, global cell numbers in sulfate-depleted sediment exceed those in the overlying sulfate-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>ing sediment by one order of magnitude, whereas in the abyss, most life occurs in oxic and/or sulfate-reducing sediments.</p>

Comparative Transcriptomic Analysis Provides Insight into the Domestication and Improvement of Pear (<i>P. pyrifolia</i>) Fruit
<p>Knowledge of the genetic changes that occurred during the domestication and improvement of perennial trees at the RNA level is limited. Here, we used RNA sequencing analysis to compare representative sets of wild, landrace, and improved accessions of pear (<i>Pyrus pyrifolia</i>) to gain insight into the genetic changes associated with domestication and improvement. A close population relationship and similar nucleotide diversity was observed between the wild and landrace groups, whereas the improved group had substantially reduced nucleotide diversity. A total of 11.13 Mb of genome sequence was identified as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>ing the signature of selective sweeps that occurred during pear domestication, whereas a distinct and smaller set of genomic regions (4.04 Mb) was identified as being associated with subsequent improvement efforts. The expression diversity of selected genes exhibited a 20.89% reduction from the wild group to the landrace group, but a 23.13% recovery was observed from the landrace to the improved group, showing a distinctly different pattern with variation of sequence diversity. Module-trait association analysis identified 16 distinct coexpression modules, six of which were highly associated with important fruit traits. The candidate trait-linked differentially expressed genes associated with stone cell formation, fruit size, and sugar content were identified in the selected regions, and many of these could also be mapped to the previously reported quantitative trait loci. Thus, our study reveals the specific pattern of domestication and improvement of perennial trees at the transcriptome level, and provides valuable genetic sources of fruit traits that could contribute to pear breeding and improvement.</p>

Antagonistic Actions of FPA and IBM2 Regulate Transcript Processing from Genes Containing Heterochromatin
<p>Repressive epigenetic marks, such as DNA and histone methylation, are sometimes located within introns. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), INCREASE IN BONSAI METHYLATION2 (IBM2), an RNA-binding protein containing a bromo-adjacent homology domain, is required to process functional transcript isoforms of genes carrying intronic heterochromatin. In a genetic screen for suppressors of the <i>ibm2</i> mutation, we identified FPA, an RNA-binding protein that promotes use of proximal polyadenylation sites in genes targeted by IBM2, including <i>IBM1</i> encoding an essential H3K9 histone demethylase and the disease resistance gene <i>RECOGNITION OF PERONOSPORA PARASITICA7</i>. Both IBM2 and FPA are involved in the processing of their common mRNA targets: Transcription of IBM2 target genes is restored when <i>FPA</i> is mutated in <i>ibm2</i> and impaired in transgenic plants overexpressing <i>FPA</i>. By contrast, transposons targeted by IBM2 and localized outside introns are not under this antagonistic control. The DNA methylation patterns of some genes and transposons are modified in <i>fpa</i> plants, including the large intron of <i>IBM1</i>, but these changes are rather limited and reversed when the mutant is complemented, indicating that FPA has a restricted role in mediating silencing. These data reveal a complex regulation by IBM2 and FPA pathways in processing mRNAs of genes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>ing heterochromatic marks.</p>

Functional Analysis of Short Linear Motifs in the Plant Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor SIAMESE
<p>Endoreplication, a modified cell cycle in which DNA is replicated without subsequent cell division, plays an important but poorly understood role in plant growth and in plant responses to biotic and abiotic stress. The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>SIAMESE</i> (<i>SIM</i>) gene encodes the first identified member of the SIAMESE-RELATED (SMR) family of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. <i>SIM</i> controls endoreplication during trichome development, and <i>sim</i> mutant trichomes divide several times instead of endoreplicating their DNA. The SMR family is defined by several short linear amino acid sequence motifs of largely unknown function, and family members have little sequence similarity to any known protein functional domains. Here, we investigated the roles of the conserved motifs in <i>SIM</i> site-directed Arabidopsis mutants using several functional assays. We identified a potential cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-binding site, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>s no resemblance to other known CDK interaction motifs. We also identified a potential site of phosphorylation and two redundant nuclear localization sequences. Surprisingly, the only motif with similarity to the other family of plant CDK inhibitors, the INHIBITOR/INTERACTOR OF CDC2 KINASE/KIP-RELATED PROTEIN proteins, is not required for <i>SIM</i> function in vivo. Because even highly divergent members of the <i>SMR</i> family are able to replace <i>SIM</i> function in Arabidopsis trichomes, it is likely that the results obtained here for <i>SIM</i> will apply to other members of this plant-specific family of CDK inhibitors.</p>

Identification of Novel Growth Regulators in Plant Populations Expressing Random Peptides
<p>The use of chemical genomics approaches allows the identification of small molecules that integrate into biological systems, thereby changing discrete processes that influence growth, development, or metabolism. Libraries of chemicals are applied to living systems, and changes in phenotype are observed, potentially leading to the identification of new growth regulators. This work describes an approach that is the nexus of chemical genomics and synthetic biology. Here, each plant in an extensive population synthesizes a unique small peptide arising from a transgene composed of a randomized nucleic acid sequence core flanked by translational start, stop, and cysteine-encoding (for disulfide cyclization) sequences. Ten and 16 amino acid sequences, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>ing a core of six and 12 random amino acids, have been synthesized in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants. Populations were screened for phenotypes from the seedling stage through senescence. Dozens of phenotypes were observed in over 2,000 plants analyzed. Ten conspicuous phenotypes were verified through separate transformation and analysis of multiple independent lines. The results indicate that these populations contain sequences that often influence discrete aspects of plant biology. Novel peptides that affect photosynthesis, flowering, and red light response are described. The challenge now is to identify the mechanistic integrations of these peptides into biochemical processes. These populations serve as a new tool to identify small molecules that modulate discrete plant functions that could be produced later in transgenic plants or potentially applied exogenously to impart their effects. These findings could usher in a new generation of agricultural growth regulators, herbicides, or defense compounds.</p>

Synthesis and Self-Assembly of Cellulose Microfibrils from Reconstituted Cellulose Synthase
<p>Cellulose, the major component of plant cell walls, can be converted to bioethanol and is thus highly studied. In plants, cellulose is produced by cellulose synthase, a processive family-2 glycosyltransferase. In plant cell walls, individual β-1,4-glucan chains polymerized by CesA are assembled into microfibrils that are frequently bundled into macrofibrils. An in vitro system in which cellulose is synthesized and assembled into fibrils would facilitate detailed study of this process. Here, we report the heterologous expression and partial purification of His-tagged CesA5 from <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. Immunoblot analysis and mass spectrometry confirmed enrichment of PpCesA5. The recombinant protein was functional when reconstituted into liposomes made from yeast total lipid extract. The functional studies included incorporation of radiolabeled Glc, linkage analysis, and imaging of cellulose microfibril formation using transmission electron microscopy. Several microfibrils were observed either inside or on the outer surface of proteoliposomes, and strikingly, several thinner fibrils formed ordered bundles that either covered the surfaces of proteoliposomes or were spawned from liposome surfaces. We also report this arrangement of fibrils made by proteoliposomes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>ing CesA8 from hybrid aspen. These observations describe minimal systems of membrane-reconstituted CesAs that polymerize β-1,4-glucan chains that coalesce to form microfibrils and higher-ordered macrofibrils. How these micro- and macrofibrils relate to those found in primary and secondary plant cell walls is uncertain, but their presence enables further study of the mechanisms that govern the formation and assembly of fibrillar cellulosic structures and cell wall composites during or after the polymerization process controlled by CesA proteins.</p>

Manipulation of a Senescence-Associated Gene Improves Fleshy Fruit Yield
<p>Senescence is the process that marks the end of a leaf’s lifespan. As it progresses, the massive macromolecular catabolism dismantles the chloroplasts and, consequently, decreases the photosynthetic capacity of these organs. Thus, senescence manipulation is a strategy to improve plant yield by extending the leaf’s photosynthetically active window of time. However, it remains to be addressed if this approach can improve fleshy fruit production and nutritional quality. One way to delay senescence initiation is by regulating key transcription factors (TFs) involved in triggering this process, such as the NAC TF ORESARA1 (ORE1). Here, three senescence-related NAC TFs from tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) were identified, namely SlORE1S02, SlORE1S03, and SlORE1S06. All three genes were shown to be responsive to senescence-inducing stimuli and posttranscriptionally regulated by the microRNA <i>miR164</i>. Moreover, the encoded proteins interacted physically with the chloroplast maintenance-related TF SlGLKs. This characterization led to the selection of a putative tomato <i>ORE1</i> as target gene for RNA interference knockdown. Transgenic lines showed delayed senescence and enhanced carbon assimilation that, ultimately, increased the number of fruits and their total soluble solid content. Additionally, the fruit nutraceutical composition was enhanced. In conclusion, these data provide robust evidence that the manipulation of leaf senescence is an effective strategy for yield improvement in fleshy fruit-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>ing species.</p>

Adaptor Protein-3-Dependent Vacuolar Trafficking Involves a Subpopulation of COPII and HOPS Tethering Proteins
<p>Plant vacuoles are versatile organelles critical for plant growth and responses to environment. Vacuolar proteins are transported from the endoplasmic reticulum via multiple routes in plants. Two classic routes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong> great similarity to other phyla with major regulators known, such as COPII and Rab5 GTPases. By contrast, vacuolar trafficking mediated by adaptor protein-3 (AP-3) or that independent of the Golgi has few recognized cargos and none of the regulators. In search of novel regulators for vacuolar trafficking routes and by using a fluorescence-based forward genetic screen, we demonstrated that the multispan transmembrane protein, Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) PROTEIN <i>S</i>-ACYL TRANSFERASE10 (PAT10), is an AP-3-mediated vacuolar cargo. We show that the tonoplast targeting of PAT10 is mediated by the AP-3 complex but independent of the Rab5-mediated post-Golgi trafficking route. We also report that AP-3-mediated vacuolar trafficking involves a subpopulation of COPII and requires the vacuolar tethering complex HOPS. In addition, we have identified two novel mutant alleles of <i>AP-3δ</i>, whose point mutations interfered with the formation of the AP-3 complex as well as its membrane targeting. The results presented here shed new light on the vacuolar trafficking route mediated by AP-3 in plant cells.</p>

The Plastid Genome of <i>Polytoma uvella</i> Is the Largest Known among Colorless Algae and Plants and Reflects Contrasting Evolutionary Paths to Nonphotosynthetic Lifestyles
<p>The loss of photosynthesis is frequently associated with parasitic or pathogenic lifestyles, but it also can occur in free-living, plastid-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>ing lineages. A common consequence of becoming nonphotosynthetic is the reduction in size and gene content of the plastid genome. In exceptional circumstances, it can even result in the complete loss of the plastid DNA (ptDNA) and its associated gene expression system, as reported recently in several lineages, including the nonphotosynthetic green algal genus <i>Polytomella</i>. Closely related to <i>Polytomella</i> is the polyphyletic genus <i>Polytoma</i>, the members of which lost photosynthesis independently of <i>Polytomella</i>. Species from both genera are free-living organisms that contain nonphotosynthetic plastids, but unlike <i>Polytomella</i>, <i>Polytoma</i> members have retained a genome in their colorless plastid. Here, we present the plastid genome of <i>Polytoma uvella</i>: to our knowledge, the first report of ptDNA from a nonphotosynthetic chlamydomonadalean alga. The <i>P. uvella</i> ptDNA contains 25 protein-coding genes, most of which are related to gene expression and none are connected to photosynthesis. However, despite its reduced coding capacity, the <i>P. uvella</i> ptDNA is inflated with short repeats and is tens of kilobases larger than the ptDNAs of its closest known photosynthetic relatives, <i>Chlamydomonas leiostraca</i> and <i>Chlamydomonas applanata</i>. In fact, at approximately 230 kb, the ptDNA of <i>P. uvella</i> represents the largest plastid genome currently reported from a nonphotosynthetic alga or plant. Overall, the <i>P. uvella</i> and <i>Polytomella</i> plastid genomes reveal two very different evolutionary paths following the loss of photosynthesis: expansion and complete deletion, respectively. We hypothesize that recombination-based DNA-repair mechanisms are at least partially responsible for the different evolutionary outcomes observed in such closely related nonphotosynthetic algae.</p>

Illuminating the Base of the Annelid Tree Using Transcriptomics
<p>Annelida is one of three animal groups possessing segmentation and is central in considerations about the evolution of different character traits. It has even been proposed that the bilaterian ancestor resembled an annelid. However, a robust phylogeny of Annelida, especially with respect to the basal relationships, has been lacking. Our study based on transcriptomic data comprising 68,750–170,497 amino acid sites from 305 to 622 proteins resolves annelid relationships, including Chaetopteridae, Amphinomidae, Sipuncula, Oweniidae, and Magelonidae in the basal part of the tree. Myzostomida, which have been indicated to belong to the basal radiation as well, are now found deeply nested within Annelida as sister group to Errantia in most analyses. On the basis of our reconstruction of a robust annelid phylogeny, we show that the basal branching taxa include a huge variety of life styles such as tube dwelling and deposit feeding, endobenthic and burrowing, tubicolous and filter feeding, and errant and carnivorous forms. Ancestral character state reconstruction suggests that the ancestral annelid possessed a pair of either sensory or grooved palps, bicellular eyes, biramous parapodia <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>ing simple chaeta, and lacked nuchal organs. Because the oldest fossil of Annelida is reported for Sipuncula (520 Ma), we infer that the early diversification of annelids took place at least in the Lower Cambrian.</p>

Convergence in morphology and masticatory function between the pharyngeal jaws of grass carp, <i>Ctenopharyngodon idella</i>, and oral jaws of amniote herbivores
<p>The cellulose-rich walls that protect plant cells are difficult to digest, and therefore mechanical food processing is a key aspect of herbivory across vertebrates. Cell walls are typically broken down by translation of flattened teeth in the occlusal plane (i.e. grinding) as part of a complex, rhythmic chewing stroke. The grass carp, <i>Ctenopharyngodon idella</i>, is a voracious, invasive herbivorous fish that relies solely on its pharyngeal teeth, located in the back of the throat, for mechanical processing of plant material. Here, we describe the musculoskeletal anatomy of the pharyngeal jaws of grass carp and use XROMM to quantify chewing kinematics and muscle strain. The pharyngeal jaws are suspended in a sling of 11 muscles and maintain no bony articulation with any other skeletal elements in the head. The jaws <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong> long, serrated teeth that are worn during use into flattened tooth cusps. Our kinematic data show that this wear is the result of the teeth being elevated into occlusion against the basioccipital process and keratinous chewing pad, not tooth-on-tooth occlusion. Pharyngeal jaw elevation results from large strains in the jaw elevator muscle, the levator arcus branchialis V, to drive a pulley-like mechanism that rotates the jaws about a pivot point at the symphysis between the left and right pharyngeal jaws. These complex, rhythmic jaw rotations translate the teeth laterally across the chewing surface throughout the occlusion phase. The grass carp chewing system is strikingly similar in gross morphology and masticatory function to herbivorous chewing strategies in other vertebrates.</p>

Gut microbiota dictates the metabolic response of <i>Drosophila</i> to diet
<p>Animal nutrition is profoundly influenced by the gut microbiota, but knowledge of the scope and core mechanisms of the underlying animal–microbiota interactions is fragmentary. To investigate the nutritional traits shaped by the gut microbiota of <i>Drosophila</i>, we determined the microbiota-dependent response of multiple metabolic and performance indices to systematically varied diet composition. Diet-dependent differences between <i>Drosophila</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>ing its unmanipulated microbiota (conventional flies) and experimentally deprived of its microbiota (axenic flies) revealed evidence for: microbial sparing of dietary B vitamins, especially riboflavin, on low-yeast diets; microbial promotion of protein nutrition, particularly in females; and microbiota-mediated suppression of lipid/carbohydrate storage, especially on high sugar diets. The microbiota also sets the relationship between energy storage and body mass, indicative of microbial modulation of the host signaling networks that coordinate metabolism with body size. This analysis identifies the multiple impacts of the microbiota on the metabolism of <i>Drosophila</i>, and demonstrates that the significance of these different interactions varies with diet composition and host sex.</p>

Which factors influence the rate of failure following metal-on-metal hip arthroplasty revision surgery performed for adverse reactions to metal debris?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To determine the outcomes following revision surgery of metal-on-metal   hip arthroplasties (MoMHA) performed for adverse reactions to metal   debris (ARMD), and to identify factors predictive of re-revision.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We performed a retrospective observational study using National   Joint Registry (NJR) data on 2535 MoMHAs undergoing revision surgery   for ARMD between 2008 and 2014. The outcomes studied following revision were   intra-operative complications, mortality and re-revision surgery.   Predictors of re-revision were identified using competing-risk regression   modelling.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Intra-operative complications occurred in 40 revisions (1.6%).   The cumulative five-year patient survival rate was 95.9% (95% confidence   intervals (CI) 92.3 to 97.8). Re-revision surgery was performed   in 192 hips (7.6%). The cumulative five-year implant survival rate   was 89.5% (95% CI 87.3 to 91.3). Predictors of re-revision were   high body mass index at revision (subhazard ratio (SHR) 1.06 per   kg/m<sup>2 </sup>increase, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.09), modular component   only revisions (head and liner with or without taper adapter; SHR   2.01, 95% CI 1.19 to 3.38), ceramic-on-ceramic revision <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>ings   (SHR 1.86, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.80), and acetabular bone grafting (SHR   2.10, 95% CI 1.43 to 3.07). These four factors remained predictive   of re-revision when the missing data were imputed.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The short-term risk of re-revision following MoMHA revision surgery   performed for ARMD was comparable with that reported in the NJR   following all-cause non-MoMHA revision surgery. However, the factors   predictive of re-revision included those which could be modified   by the surgeon, suggesting that rates of failure following ARMD revision   may be reduced further.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1020–7.</p></sec>

Mediolateral force distribution at the knee joint shifts across activities and is driven by tibiofemoral alignment
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Tibiofemoral alignment is important to determine the rate of   progression of osteoarthritis and implant survival after total knee   arthroplasty (TKA). Normally, surgeons aim for neutral tibiofemoral   alignment following TKA, but this has been questioned in recent   years. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether varus or valgus   alignment indeed leads to increased medial or lateral tibiofemoral   forces during static and dynamic weight-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>ing activities.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Tibiofemoral contact forces and moments were measured in nine   patients with instrumented knee implants. Medial force ratios were   analysed during nine daily activities, including activities with   single-limb support (e.g. walking) and double-limb support (e.g.   knee bend). Hip-knee-ankle angles in the frontal plane were analysed   using full-leg coronal radiographs. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The medial force ratio strongly correlated with the tibiofemoral   alignment in the static condition of one-legged stance (R² = 0.88)   and dynamic single-limb loading (R² = 0.59) with varus malalignment   leading to increased medial force ratios of up to 88%. In contrast,   the correlation between leg alignment and magnitude of medial compartment force   was much less pronounced. A lateral shift of force occurred during   activities with double-limb support and higher knee flexion angles. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The medial force ratio depends on both the tibiofemoral alignment   and the nature of the activity involved. It cannot be generalised   to a single value. Higher medial ratios during single-limb loading   are associated with varus malalignment in TKA. The current trend   towards a ‘constitutional varus’ after joint replacement, in terms   of overall tibiofemoral alignment, should be considered carefully   with respect to the increased medial force ratio.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:779–87.</p></sec>

The evolution of an uncemented acetabular component in alumina-on-alumina total hip arthroplasty has improved clinical outcome
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To determine the effect of a change in design of a cementless   ceramic acetabular component in fixation and clinical outcome after   total hip arthroplasty</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We compared 342 hips (302 patients) operated between 1999 and   2005 with a relatively smooth hydroxyapatite coated acetabular component   (group 1), and 337 hips (310 patients) operated between 2006 and   2011 using a similar acetabular component with a macrotexture on   the entire outer surface of the component (group 2). The mean age of   the patients was 53.5 (14 to 70) in group 1 and 53.0 (15 to 70)   in group 2. The mean follow-up was 12.7 years (10 to 17) for group   1 and 7.2 years (4 to 10) for group 2.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>No hips were revised due to complications related to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>ing   fracture or to stem loosening. A total of 15 acetabular components   were revised for aseptic loosening in group 1 and two in group 2.   The survival rate for acetabular component aseptic loosening at   eight years was 96.8% (95% confidence interval (CI) 94.8 to 98.7)   for group 1 and 99.2% (95% CI 98.0 to 100) for group 2. The risk   for aseptic loosening of the acetabular component was higher in group   1 (p = 0.04, Hazard Ratio (HR) 4.99), dysplastic acetabula (p =   0.01, HR 4.12), components outside Lewinnek's zone (p < 0.001,   HR 6.13) and in those with a hip rotation centre distance greater   than 5 mm (p = 0.005, HR 4.09). </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Alumina ceramic-on-ceramic THA is an excellent option for young   patients.

Radiological and clinical comparison of kinematically <i>versus</i> mechanically aligned total knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to compare the post-operative radiographic   and clinical outcomes between kinematically and mechanically aligned   total knee arthroplasties (TKAs). </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 60 TKAs (30 kinematically and 30 mechanically aligned)   were performed in 60 patients with varus osteoarthritis of the knee   using a navigation system. The angles of orientation of the joint   line in relation to the floor, the conventional and true mechanical   axis (tMA) (the line from the centre of the hip to the lowest point   of the calcaneus) were compared, one year post-operatively, on single-leg   and double-leg standing long leg radiographs between the groups.

Do varus or valgus outliers have higher forces in the medial or lateral compartments than those which are in-range after a kinematically aligned total knee arthroplasty?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aims of this study were to determine the proportion of patients   with outlier varus or valgus alignment in kinematically aligned   total knee arthroplasty (TKA), whether those with outlier varus   or valgus alignment have higher forces in the medial or lateral   compartments of the knee than those with in-range alignment and   whether measurements of the alignment of the limb, knee and components   predict compartment forces.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The intra-operative forces in the medial and lateral compartments   were measured with an instrumented tibial insert in 67 patients   who underwent a kinematically aligned TKA during passive movement.   The mean of the forces at full extension, 45° and 90° of flexion   determined the force in the medial and lateral compartments. Measurements   of the alignment of the limb and the components included the hip-knee-ankle   (HKA) angle, proximal medial tibial angle (PMTA), and distal lateral   femoral angle (DLFA). Measurements of the alignment of the knee   and the components included the tibiofemoral angle (TFA), tibial   component angle (TCA) and femoral component angle (FCA). Alignment was   measured on post-operative, non-weight-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>ing anteroposterior (AP)   scanograms and categorised as varus or valgus outlier or in-range   in relation to mechanically aligned criteria.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The proportion of patients with outlier varus or valgus alignment   was 16%/24% for the HKA angle, 55%/0% for the PMTA, 0%/57% for the   DLFA, 25%/12% for the TFA, 100%/0% for the TCA, and 0%/64% for the   FCA. In general, the forces in the medial and lateral compartments   of those with outlier alignment were not different from those with   in-range alignment except for the TFA, in which patients with outlier   varus alignment had a mean paradoxical force which was 6 lb higher   in the lateral compartment than those with in-range alignment. None   of the measurements of alignment of the limb, knee and components   predicted the force in the medial or lateral compartment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Although kinematically aligned TKA has a high proportion of varus   or valgus outliers using mechanically aligned criteria, the intra-operative   forces in the medial and lateral compartments of patients with outlier   alignment were comparable with those with in-range alignment, with   no evidence of overload of the medial or lateral compartment of   the knee.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1319–28.</p></sec>

<i>In vivo</i> three-dimensional kinematics of normal knees during different high-flexion activities
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>In Asia and the Middle-East, people often flex their knees deeply   in order to perform activities of daily living. The purpose of this   study was to investigate the 3D kinematics of normal knees during   high-flexion activities. Our hypothesis was that the femorotibial   rotation, varus-valgus angle, translations, and kinematic pathway   of normal knees during high-flexion activities, varied according   to activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We investigated the <i>in vivo</i> kinematics of eight   normal knees in four male volunteers (mean age 41.8 years; 37 to   53) using 2D and 3D registration technique, and modelled the knees   with a computer aided design program. Each subject squatted, kneeled,   and sat cross-legged. We evaluated the femoral rotation and varus-valgus   angle relative to the tibia and anteroposterior translation of the   medial and lateral side, using the transepicodylar axis as our femoral   reference relative to the perpendicular projection on to the tibial   plateau. This method evaluates the femur medially from what has   elsewhere been described as the extension facet centre, and differs   from the method classically applied. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>During squatting and kneeling, the knees displayed femoral external   rotation. When sitting cross-legged, femurs displayed internal rotation   from 10° to 100°. From 100°, femoral external rotation was observed.   No significant difference in varus-valgus angle was seen between   squatting and kneeling, whereas a varus position was observed from   140° when sitting cross-legged. The measure kinematic pathway using   our methodology found during squatting a medial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pivot</span></strong>ing pattern   from 0° to 40° and bicondylar rollback from 40° to 150°. During   kneeling, a medial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pivot</span></strong> pattern was evident. When sitting cross-legged,   a lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pivot</span></strong> pattern was seen from 0° to 100°, and a medial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pivot</span></strong>   pattern beyond 100°.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The kinematics of normal knees during high flexion are variable   according to activity. Nevertheless, our study was limited to a   small number of male patients using a different technique to report   the kinematics than previous publications. Accordingly, caution   should be observed in generalizing our findings.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:50–5.</p></sec>

Increase in Endovascular Therapy in Get With The Guidelines-Stroke After the Publication of Pivotal Trials
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Beginning in December 2014, a series of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pivot</span></strong>al trials showed that endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) was highly effective, prompting calls to reorganize stroke systems of care. However, there are few data on how these trials influenced the frequency of EVT in clinical practice. We used data from the Get With The Guidelines-Stroke program to determine how the frequency of EVT changed in US practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We analyzed prospectively collected data from a cohort of 2 437 975 patients with ischemic stroke admitted to 2222 participating hospitals between April 2003 and the third quarter of 2016. Weighted linear regression with 2 linear splines and a knot at January 2015 was used to compare the slope of the change in EVT use before and after the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pivot</span></strong>al trials were published. Potentially eligible patients were defined as last known well to arrival time ≤4.5 hours and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score ≥6.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The frequency of EVT use was slowly increasing before January 2015 but then sharply accelerated thereafter. In the third quarter 2016, EVT was provided to 3.3% of all patients with ischemic stroke at all hospitals, representing 15.1% of all patients who were potentially eligible for EVT based on stroke duration and severity. At EVT-capable hospitals, 7.5% of all patients with ischemic stroke were treated in the third quarter of 2016, including 27.3% of the potentially eligible patients. From 2013 to 2016, case volumes nearly doubled at EVT-capable hospitals. Mean case volume per EVT-capable hospital was 37.6 per year in the last 4 quarters. EVT case volumes increased in nearly all US states from 2014 to the last 4 quarters, but with persistent geographic variation unexplained by differences in potential patient eligibility.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>EVT use is increasing rapidly; however, there are still opportunities to treat more patients. Reorganizing stroke systems to route patients to adequately resourced EVT-capable hospitals might increase treatment of eligible patients, improve outcomes, and reduce disparities.</p></sec>

Stellarex Drug-Coated Balloon for Treatment of Femoropopliteal Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Drug-coated balloons (DCBs) are a predominant revascularization therapy for symptomatic femoropopliteal artery disease. Because of the differences in excipients, paclitaxel dose, and coating morphologies, varying clinical outcomes have been observed with different DCBs. We report the results of 2 studies investigating the pharmacokinetic and clinical outcomes of a new DCB to treat femoropopliteal disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In the ILLUMENATE Pivotal Study (Prospective, Randomized, Single-Blind, U.S. Multi-Center Study to Evaluate Treatment of Obstructive Superficial Femoral Artery or Popliteal Lesions With A Novel Paclitaxel-Coated Percutaneous Angioplasty Balloon), 300 symptomatic patients (Rutherford class 2–4) were randomly assigned to DCB (n=200) or standard angioplasty (percutaneous transluminal angioplasty [PTA]) (n=100). The primary safety end point was freedom from device- and procedure-related death through 30 days, and freedom from target limb major amputation and clinically driven target lesion revascularization through 12 months. The primary effectiveness end point was primary patency through 12 months. In the ILLUMENATE PK study (Pharmacokinetic Study of the Stellarex Drug-Coated Angioplasty Balloon), paclitaxel plasma concentrations were measured after last DCB deployment and at prespecified times (at 1, 4, 24 hours and at 7 and 14 days postprocedure) until no longer detectable.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In the ILLUMENATE Pivotal Study, baseline characteristics were similar between groups: 50% had diabetes mellitus, 41% were women, mean lesion length was 8.3 cm, and 44% were severely calcified. The primary safety end point was met (92.1% for DCB versus 83.2% for PTA, <i>P</i>=0.025 for superiority) and the primary patency rate was significantly higher with DCB (76.3% for DCB versus 57.6% for PTA, <i>P</i>=0.003). Primary patency per Kaplan-Meier estimates at day 365 was 82.3% for DCB versus 70.9% for PTA (<i>P</i>=0.002). The rate of clinically driven target lesion revascularization was significantly lower in the DCB cohort (7.9% versus 16.8%, <i>P</i>=0.023). Improvements in ankle-brachial index, Rutherford class, and quality of life were comparable, but the PTA cohort required twice as many revascularizations. Pharmacokinetic outcomes showed that all patients had detectable paclitaxel levels after DCB deployment that declined within the first hour (54.4±116.9 ng/mL to 1.4±1.0 ng/mL).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The data demonstrate superior safety and effectiveness of the Stellarex DCB in comparison with PTA, and plasma levels of paclitaxel fall to low levels within 1 hour.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Phosphorylation of Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) links energy sensing to anti-inflammatory signaling
<p>Adenosine 5′-monophosphate–activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pivot</span></strong>al regulator of metabolism at cellular and organismal levels. AMPK also suppresses inflammation. We found that pharmacological activation of AMPK rapidly inhibited the Janus kinase (JAK)–signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway in various cells. In vitro kinase assays revealed that AMPK directly phosphorylated two residues (Ser<sup>515</sup> and Ser<sup>518</sup>) within the Src homology 2 domain of JAK1. Activation of AMPK enhanced the interaction between JAK1 and 14-3-3 proteins in cultured vascular endothelial cells and fibroblasts, an effect that required the presence of Ser<sup>515</sup> and Ser<sup>518</sup> and was abolished in cells lacking AMPK catalytic subunits. Mutation of Ser<sup>515</sup> and Ser<sup>518</sup> abolished AMPK-mediated inhibition of JAK-STAT signaling stimulated by either the sIL-6Rα/IL-6 complex or the expression of a constitutively active V658F-mutant JAK1 in human fibrosarcoma cells. Clinically used AMPK activators metformin and salicylate enhanced the inhibitory phosphorylation of endogenous JAK1 and inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation in primary vascular endothelial cells. Therefore, our findings reveal a mechanism by which JAK1 function and inflammatory signaling may be suppressed in response to metabolic stress and provide a mechanistic rationale for the investigation of AMPK activators in a range of diseases associated with enhanced activation of the JAK-STAT pathway.</p>

5-oxoETE triggers nociception in constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome through MAS-related G protein–coupled receptor D
<p>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder that is characterized by chronic abdominal pain concurrent with altered bowel habit. Polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) metabolites are increased in abundance in IBS and are implicated in the alteration of sensation to mechanical stimuli, which is defined as visceral hypersensitivity. We sought to quantify PUFA metabolites in patients with IBS and evaluate their role in pain. Quantification of PUFA metabolites by mass spectrometry in colonic biopsies showed an increased abundance of 5-oxoeicosatetraenoic acid (5-oxoETE) only in biopsies taken from patients with IBS with predominant constipation (IBS-C). Local administration of 5-oxoETE to mice induced somatic and visceral hypersensitivity to mechanical stimuli without causing tissue inflammation. We found that 5-oxoETE directly acted on both human and mouse sensory neurons as shown by lumbar splanchnic nerve recordings and Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. We showed that 5-oxoETE selectively stimulated nonpeptidergic, isolectin B4 (IB4)–positive DRG neurons through a phospholipase C (PLC)– and pertussis toxin–dependent mechanism, suggesting that the effect was mediated by a G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR). The MAS-related GPCR D (Mrgprd) was found in mouse colonic DRG afferents and was identified as being implicated in the noxious effects of 5-oxoETE. Together, these data suggest that 5-oxoETE, a potential biomarker of IBS-C, induces somatic and visceral hyperalgesia without inflammation in an Mrgprd-dependent manner. Thus, 5-oxoETE may play a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pivot</span></strong>al role in the abdominal pain associated with IBS-C.</p>

ER-mitochondria cross-talk is regulated by the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor NCS1 and is impaired in Wolfram syndrome
<p>Communication between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria plays a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pivot</span></strong>al role in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, energy metabolism, and cell survival. Dysfunction in this cross-talk leads to metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases. Wolfram syndrome is a fatal neurodegenerative disease caused by mutations in the ER-resident protein WFS1. Here, we showed that WFS1 formed a complex with neuronal calcium sensor 1 (NCS1) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP<sub>3</sub>R) to promote Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer between the ER and mitochondria. In addition, we found that NCS1 abundance was reduced in WFS1-null patient fibroblasts, which showed reduced ER-mitochondria interactions and Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchange. Moreover, in WFS1-deficient cells, NCS1 overexpression not only restored ER-mitochondria interactions and Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer but also rescued mitochondrial dysfunction. Our results describe a key role of NCS1 in ER-mitochondria cross-talk, uncover a pathogenic mechanism for Wolfram syndrome, and potentially reveal insights into the pathogenesis of other neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

Unique BIR domain sets determine inhibitor of apoptosis protein–driven cell death and NOD2 complex signal specificity
<p>The mammalian IAPs, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 and 2 (cIAP1 and cIAP2), play <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pivot</span></strong>al roles in innate immune signaling and inflammatory homeostasis, often working in parallel or in conjunction at a signaling complex. IAPs direct both nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing 2 (NOD2) signaling complexes and cell death mechanisms to appropriately regulate inflammation. Although it is known that XIAP is critical for NOD2 signaling and that the loss of cIAP1 and cIAP2 blunts NOD2 activity, it is unclear whether these three highly related proteins can compensate for one another in NOD2 signaling or in mechanisms governing apoptosis or necroptosis. This potential redundancy is critically important, given that genetic loss of XIAP causes both very early onset inflammatory bowel disease and X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome 2 (XLP-2) and that the overexpression of cIAP1 and cIAP2 is linked to both carcinogenesis and chemotherapeutic resistance. Given the therapeutic interest in IAP inhibition and the potential toxicities associated with disruption of inflammatory homeostasis, we used synthetic biology techniques to examine the functional redundancies of key domains in the IAPs. From this analysis, we defined the features of the IAPs that enable them to function at overlapping signaling complexes but remain independent and functionally exclusive in their roles as E3 ubiquitin ligases in innate immune and inflammatory signaling.</p>

Regulation of the ubiquitylation and deubiquitylation of CREB-binding protein modulates histone acetylation and lung inflammation
<p>Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element–binding protein (CREB)–binding protein (CBP) is a histone acetyltransferase that plays a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pivot</span></strong>al role in the control of histone modification and the expression of cytokine-encoding genes in inflammatory diseases, including sepsis and lung injury. We found that the E3 ubiquitin ligase subunit FBXL19 targeted CBP for site-specific ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation. The ubiquitylation-dependent degradation of CBP reduced the extent of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)–dependent histone acetylation and cytokine release in mouse lung epithelial cells and in a mouse model of sepsis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the deubiquitylating enzyme USP14 (ubiquitin-specific peptidase 14) stabilized CBP by reducing its ubiquitylation. LPS increased the stability of CBP by reducing the association between CBP and FBXL19 and by activating USP14. Inhibition of USP14 reduced CBP protein abundance and attenuated LPS-stimulated histone acetylation and cytokine release. Together, our findings delineate the molecular mechanisms through which CBP stability is regulated by FBXL19 and USP14, which results in the modulation of chromatin remodeling and the expression of cytokine-encoding genes.</p>

The SCF<sup>β-TRCP</sup> E3 ubiquitin ligase complex targets Lipin1 for ubiquitination and degradation to promote hepatic lipogenesis
<p>The SCF<sup>β-TRCP</sup> E3 ubiquitin ligase complex plays <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pivot</span></strong>al roles in normal cellular physiology and in pathophysiological conditions. Identification of β-transducin repeat–containing protein (β-TRCP) substrates is therefore critical to understand SCF<sup>β-TRCP</sup> biology and function. We used a β-TRCP–phosphodegron motif–specific antibody in a β-TRCP substrate screen coupled with tandem mass spectrometry and identified multiple β-TRCP substrates. One of these substrates was Lipin1, an enzyme and suppressor of the family of sterol regulatory element–binding protein (SREBP) transcription factors, which activate genes encoding lipogenic factors. We showed that SCF<sup>β-TRCP</sup> specifically interacted with and promoted the polyubiquitination of Lipin1 in a manner that required phosphorylation of Lipin1 by mechanistic target of rapamycin 1 (mTORC1) and casein kinase I (CKI). β-<i>TRCP</i> depletion in HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells resulted in increased Lipin1 protein abundance, suppression of SREBP-dependent gene expression, and attenuation of triglyceride synthesis. Moreover, β-<i>TRCP1</i> knockout mice showed increased Lipin1 protein abundance and were protected from hepatic steatosis induced by a high-fat diet. Together, these data reveal a critical physiological function of β-TRCP in regulating hepatic lipid metabolic homeostasis in part through modulating Lipin1 stability.</p>

H3K9me3-heterochromatin loss at protein-coding genes enables developmental lineage specification
<p>Gene silencing by chromatin compaction is integral to establishing and maintaining cell fates. Trimethylated histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9me3)–marked heterochromatin is reduced in embryonic stem cells compared to differentiated cells. However, the establishment and dynamics of closed regions of chromatin at protein-coding genes, in embryologic development, remain elusive. We developed an antibody-independent method to isolate and map compacted heterochromatin from low–cell number samples. We discovered high levels of compacted heterochromatin, H3K9me3-decorated, at protein-coding genes in early, uncommitted cells at the germ-layer stage, undergoing profound rearrangements and reduction upon differentiation, concomitant with cell type–specific gene expression. Perturbation of the three H3K9me3-related methyltransferases revealed a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pivot</span></strong>al role for H3K9me3 heterochromatin during lineage commitment at the onset of organogenesis and for lineage fidelity maintenance.</p>

Super-resolution chromatin tracing reveals domains and cooperative interactions in single cells
<p>The spatial organization of chromatin is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pivot</span></strong>al for regulating genome functions. We report an imaging method for tracing chromatin organization with kilobase- and nanometer-scale resolution, unveiling chromatin conformation across topologically associating domains (TADs) in thousands of individual cells. Our imaging data revealed TAD-like structures with globular conformation and sharp domain boundaries in single cells. The boundaries varied from cell to cell, occurring with nonzero probabilities at all genomic positions but preferentially at CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF)- and cohesin-binding sites. Notably, cohesin depletion, which abolished TADs at the population-average level, did not diminish TAD-like structures in single cells but eliminated preferential domain boundary positions. Moreover, we observed widespread, cooperative, multiway chromatin interactions, which remained after cohesin depletion. These results provide critical insight into the mechanisms underlying chromatin domain and hub formation.</p>

Sex reversal following deletion of a single distal enhancer of <i>Sox9</i>

In vivo high-throughput chromatin accessibility techniques, transgenic assays, and genome editing revealed several novel gonadal regulatory elements in the 2-megabase gene desert upstream of <i>Sox9</i>.

Our data are consistent with the time-sensitive activity of SRY and indicate a strict order of enhancer usage. Enh13 is conserved and embedded within a 32.5-kilobase region whose deletion in humans is associated with XY sex reversal, suggesting that it is also critical in humans.</p>

Convergent evidence for widespread rock nitrogen sources in Earth’s surface environment
<p>Nitrogen availability is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pivot</span></strong>al control on terrestrial carbon sequestration and global climate change. Historical and contemporary views assume that nitrogen enters Earth’s land-surface ecosystems from the atmosphere. Here we demonstrate that bedrock is a nitrogen source that rivals atmospheric nitrogen inputs across major sectors of the global terrestrial environment. Evidence drawn from the planet’s nitrogen balance, geochemical proxies, and our spatial weathering model reveal that ~19 to 31 teragrams of nitrogen are mobilized from near-surface rocks annually. About 11 to 18 teragrams of this nitrogen are chemically weathered in situ, thereby increasing the unmanaged (preindustrial) terrestrial nitrogen balance from 8 to 26%. These findings provide a global perspective to reconcile Earth’s nitrogen budget, with implications for nutrient-driven controls over the terrestrial carbon sink.</p>

Use of cholera vaccines expands, raising hopes

But an emergency vaccine stockpile established in 2013 has grown rapidly and a new, easier-to-use formulation has hit the market, making large-scale campaigns feasible. Soon, 2.4 million doses are to be shipped to Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where another epidemic looms. With interventions like this, experts hope to make a dent in the global burden of cholera, estimated at 3 million cases a year. And Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which is funding the stockpile, is set to decide later this year whether it will start funding routine immunizations in endemic areas as well.</p>

Chiromagnetic nanoparticles and gels
<p>Chiral inorganic nanostructures have high circular dichroism, but real-time control of their optical activity has so far been achieved only by irreversible chemical changes. Field modulation is a far more desirable path to chiroptical devices. We hypothesized that magnetic field modulation can be attained for chiral nanostructures with large contributions of the magnetic transition dipole moments to polarization rotation. We found that dispersions and gels of paramagnetic Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles with chiral distortions of the crystal lattices exhibited chiroptical activity in the visible range that was 10 times as strong as that of nonparamagnetic nanoparticles of comparable size. Transparency of the nanoparticle gels to circularly polarized light beams in the ultraviolet range was reversibly modulated by magnetic fields. These phenomena were also observed for other nanoscale metal oxides with lattice distortions from imprinted amino acids and other chiral ligands.

Structure of the TAPBPR–MHC I complex defines the mechanism of peptide loading and editing
<p>Adaptive immunity is shaped by a selection of peptides presented on major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) molecules.

Despite the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pivot</span></strong>al role of Tsn and TAPBPR in controlling the hierarchical immune response, their catalytic mechanism remains unknown. Here, we present the x-ray structure of the TAPBPR–MHC I complex, which delineates the central step of catalysis. TAPBPR functions as peptide selector by remodeling the MHC I α2-1-helix region, stabilizing the empty binding groove, and inserting a loop into the groove that interferes with peptide binding. The complex explains how mutations in MHC I–specific chaperones cause defects in antigen processing and suggests a unifying mechanism of peptide proofreading.</p>

Pinstatic Acid Promotes Auxin Transport by Inhibiting PIN Internalization
<p>Polar auxin transport plays a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pivot</span></strong>al role in plant growth and development. PIN-FORMED (PIN) auxin efflux carriers regulate directional auxin movement by establishing local auxin maxima, minima, and gradients that drive multiple developmental processes and responses to environmental signals. Auxin has been proposed to modulate its own transport by regulating subcellular PIN trafficking via processes such as clathrin-mediated PIN endocytosis and constitutive recycling. Here, we further investigated the mechanisms by which auxin affects PIN trafficking by screening auxin analogs and identified pinstatic acid (PISA) as a positive modulator of polar auxin transport in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). PISA had an auxin-like effect on hypocotyl elongation and adventitious root formation via positive regulation of auxin transport. PISA did not activate SCF<sup>TIR1/AFB</sup> signaling and yet induced PIN accumulation at the cell surface by inhibiting PIN internalization from the plasma membrane. This work demonstrates PISA to be a promising chemical tool to dissect the regulatory mechanisms behind subcellular PIN trafficking and auxin transport.</p>

Pivotal Roles of Cryptochromes 1a and 2 in Tomato Development and Physiology
<p>Cryptochromes are flavin-containing blue/UVA light photoreceptors that regulate various plant light-induced physiological processes. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), cryptochromes mediate de-etiolation, photoperiodic control of flowering, entrainment of the circadian clock, cotyledon opening and expansion, anthocyanin accumulation, and root growth. In tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>), cryptochromes are encoded by a multigene family, comprising <i>CRY1a</i>, <i>CRY1b</i>, <i>CRY2</i>, and <i>CRY3</i>. We have previously reported the phenotypes of tomato <i>cry1a</i> mutants and <i>CRY2</i> overexpressing plants. Here, we report the isolation by targeting induced local lesions in genomes, of a tomato <i>cry2</i> knock-out mutant, its introgression in the indeterminate Moneymaker background, and the phenotypes of <i>cry1a</i>/<i>cry2</i> single and double mutants. The <i>cry1a</i>/<i>cry2</i> mutant showed phenotypes similar to its Arabidopsis counterpart (long hypocotyls in white and blue light), but also several additional features such as increased seed weight and internode length, enhanced hypocotyl length in red light, inhibited primary root growth under different light conditions, anticipation of flowering under long-day conditions, and alteration of the phase of circadian leaf movements. Both cry1a and cry2 control the levels of photosynthetic pigments in leaves, but cry2 has a predominant role in fruit pigmentation. Metabolites of the sterol, tocopherol, quinone, and sugar classes are differentially accumulated in <i>cry1a</i> and <i>cry2</i> leaves and fruits. These results demonstrate a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pivot</span></strong>al role of cryptochromes in controlling tomato development and physiology. The manipulation of these photoreceptors represents a powerful tool to influence important agronomic traits such as flowering time and fruit quality.</p>

Roles of RbcX in Carboxysome Biosynthesis in the Cyanobacterium <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> PCC7942
<p>Rubisco is the essential enzyme mediating the fixation of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> during photosynthesis. In cyanobacteria, Rubisco enzymes are densely packed and encapsulated in a specialized organelle known as the carboxysome. Well-defined Rubisco assembly and carboxysome formation are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pivot</span></strong>al for efficient CO<sub>2</sub> fixation. Numerous chaperone proteins, including RbcX, are essential for proper protein folding and Rubisco assembly. In this study, we investigated the in vivo function of RbcX in the cyanobacterium <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> PCC 7942 (Syn7942) using molecular, biochemical, and live-cell fluorescence imaging approaches. Our results show that genetic deletion of the <i>rbcX</i> gene affects Rubisco abundance, as well as carboxysome formation and spatial distribution. Moreover, RbcX appears as one component of the carboxysome and shows a dynamic interaction with Rubisco enzymes. These in vivo observations provide insight into the role of RbcX from Syn7942 in mediating carboxysome assembly. Understanding the molecular mechanism underlying Rubisco assembly and carboxysome biogenesis will provide essential information required for engineering functional CO<sub>2</sub>-fixing complexes in heterogeneous organisms, especially plants, with the aim of boosting photosynthesis and agricultural productivity.</p>

Arabidopsis Leaf Flatness Is Regulated by PPD2 and NINJA through Repression of <i>CYCLIN D3</i> Genes
<p>In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), reduced expression of the transcriptional regulator <i>PEAPOD2</i> (<i>PPD2</i>) results in propeller-like rosettes with enlarged and dome-shaped leaves. However, the molecular and cellular processes underlying this peculiar phenotype remain elusive. Here, we studied the interaction between PPD2 and NOVEL INTERACTOR OF JAZ (NINJA) and demonstrated that <i>ninja</i> loss-of-function plants produce rosettes with dome-shaped leaves similar to those of <i>ppd</i> mutants but without the increase in size. We showed that <i>ninja</i> mutants have a convex-shaped primary cell cycle arrest front, putatively leading to excessive cell division in the central leaf blade region. Furthermore, <i>ppd</i> and <i>ninja</i> mutants have a similar increase in the expression of <i>CYCLIN D3;2</i> (<i>CYCD3;2</i>), and ectopic overexpression of <i>CYCD3;2</i> phenocopies the <i>ppd</i> and <i>ninja</i> rosette and leaf shape phenotypes without affecting the size. Our results reveal a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pivot</span></strong>al contribution of NINJA in leaf development, in addition to its well-studied function in jasmonate signaling, and imply a new function for D3-type cyclins in, at least partially, uncoupling the size and shape phenotypes of <i>ppd</i> leaves.</p>

The Microtubule-Associated Protein IQ67 DOMAIN5 Modulates Microtubule Dynamics and Pavement Cell Shape
<p>The dynamic arrangement of cortical microtubules (MTs) plays a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pivot</span></strong>al role in controlling cell growth and shape formation in plants, but the mechanisms by which cortical MTs are organized to regulate these processes are not well characterized. In particular, the dynamic behavior of cortical MTs is critical for their spatial organization, yet the molecular mechanisms controlling MT dynamics remain poorly understood. In this study, we used the puzzle piece-shaped pavement cells of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves as a model system in which to study cortical MT organization. We isolated an ethyl methanesulfonate mutant with reduced interdigitation of pavement cells in cotyledons. This line carried a mutation in <i>IQ67 DOMAIN5</i> (<i>IQD5</i>), which encodes a member of the plant-specific IQ motif protein family. Live-cell imaging and biochemical analyses demonstrated that IQD5 binds to MTs and promotes MT assembly. MT-depolymerizing drug treatment and in vivo MT dynamics assays suggested that IQD5 functions to stabilize MTs. Hence, our findings provide genetic, cell biological, and biochemical evidence that IQD5 regulates MT dynamics that affect MT organization and subsequent cell shape formation.</p>

Betaine Lipid Is Crucial for Adapting to Low Temperature and Phosphate Deficiency in <i>Nannochloropsis</i>
<p>Diacylglyceryl-<i>N,N,N</i>-trimethylhomo-Ser (DGTS) is a nonphosphorous, polar glycerolipid that is regarded as analogous to the phosphatidylcholine in bacteria, fungi, algae, and basal land plants. In some species of algae, including the stramenopile microalga <i>Nannochloropsis oceanica</i>, DGTS contains an abundance of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which is relatively scarce in phosphatidylcholine, implying that DGTS has a unique physiological role. In this study, we addressed the role of DGTS in <i>N. oceanica</i>. We identified two DGTS biosynthetic enzymes that have distinct domain configurations compared to previously identified DGTS synthases. Mutants lacking DGTS showed growth retardation under phosphate starvation, demonstrating a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pivot</span></strong>al role for DGTS in the adaptation to this condition. Under normal conditions, DGTS deficiency led to an increase in the relative amount of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol, a major plastid membrane lipid with high EPA content, whereas excessive production of DGTS induced by gene overexpression led to a decrease in monogalactosyldiacylglycerol. Meanwhile, lipid analysis of partial phospholipid-deficient mutants revealed a role for phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine in EPA biosynthesis. These results suggest that DGTS and monogalactosyldiacylglycerol may constitute the two major pools of EPA in extraplastidic and plastidic membranes, partially competing to acquire EPA or its precursors derived from phospholipids. The mutant lacking DGTS also displayed impaired growth and a lower proportion of EPA in extraplastidic compartments at low temperatures. Our results indicate that DGTS is involved in the adaptation to low temperatures through a mechanism that is distinct from the DGTS-dependent adaptation to phosphate starvation in <i>N. oceanica</i>.</p>

ER-Anchored Transcription Factors bZIP17 and bZIP28 Regulate Root Elongation
<p>The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a eukaryotic transcriptional regulatory network that is activated upon the accumulation of malformed proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), three bZIP transcription factors modulate the UPR: bZIP17, bZIP28, and bZIP60. Although bZIP28 and bZIP60 have been relatively well studied, the physiological and transcriptional roles of bZIP17 remain largely unknown. Here, we generated a double knockout mutant of bZIP17 and bZIP28 to elucidate the function of bZIP17. The mutant plant exhibited multiple developmental defects, including markedly reduced root elongation and constantly overinduced bZIP60 activity, indicating the essential roles of bZIP17 and bZIP28 in plant development and UPR modulation. Extended analysis of the transcriptomes of three double knockout mutants of <i>bZIP17</i>, <i>bZIP28</i>, and <i>bZIP60</i> revealed that bZIP28 and bZIP60 are the major activators of the canonical induced UPR. By contrast, bZIP17 functions with bZIP28 to mediate the noninducible expression of multiple genes involved in cell growth, particularly to sustain their expression under stress conditions. Our study reveals <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pivot</span></strong>al roles of bZIP17 in the plant UPR and vegetative development, with functional redundancy to bZIP28.</p>

Signal Dynamics and Interactions during Flooding Stress
<p>Flooding is detrimental for nearly all higher plants, including crops. The compound stress elicited by slow gas exchange and low light levels under water is responsible for both a carbon and an energy crisis ultimately leading to plant death. The endogenous concentrations of four gaseous compounds, oxygen, carbon dioxide, ethylene, and nitric oxide, change during the submergence of plant organs in water. These gases play a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pivot</span></strong>al role in signal transduction cascades, leading to adaptive processes such as metabolic adjustments and anatomical features. Of these gases, ethylene is seen as the most consistent, pervasive, and reliable signal of early flooding stress, most likely in tight interaction with the other gases. The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in plant cells during flooding and directly after subsidence, during which the plant is confronted with high light and oxygen levels, is characteristic for this abiotic stress. Low, well-controlled levels of ROS are essential for adaptive signaling pathways, in interaction with the other gaseous flooding signals. On the other hand, excessive uncontrolled bursts of ROS can be highly damaging for plants. Therefore, a fine-tuned balance is important, with a major role for ROS production and scavenging. Our understanding of the temporal dynamics of the four gases and ROS is basal, whereas it is likely that they form a signature readout of prevailing flooding conditions and subsequent adaptive responses.</p>

Cytokinin-Auxin Crosstalk in the Gynoecial Primordium Ensures Correct Domain Patterning<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) gynoecium consists of two congenitally fused carpels made up of two lateral valve domains and two medial domains, which retain meristematic properties and later fuse to produce the female reproductive structures vital for fertilization. Polar auxin transport (PAT) is important for setting up distinct apical auxin signaling domains in the early floral meristem remnants allowing for lateral domain identity and outgrowth. Crosstalk between auxin and cytokinin plays an important role in the development of other meristematic tissues, but hormone interaction studies to date have focused on more accessible later-stage gynoecia and the spatiotemporal interactions <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pivot</span></strong>al for patterning of early gynoecium primordia remain unknown. Focusing on the earliest stages, we propose a cytokinin-auxin feedback model during early gynoecium patterning and hormone homeostasis. Our results suggest that cytokinin positively regulates auxin signaling in the incipient gynoecial primordium and strengthen the concept that cytokinin regulates auxin homeostasis during gynoecium development. Specifically, medial cytokinin promotes auxin biosynthesis components [<i>YUCCA1</i>/<i>4</i> (<i>YUC1</i>/<i>4</i>)] in, and PINFORMED7 (PIN7)-mediated auxin efflux from, the medial domain. The resulting laterally focused auxin signaling triggers <i>ARABIDOPSIS HISTIDINE PHOSPHOTRANSFER PROTEIN6</i> (<i>AHP6</i>), which then represses cytokinin signaling in a PAT-dependent feedback. Cytokinin also down-regulates PIN3, promoting auxin accumulation in the apex. The <i>yuc1</i>, <i>yuc4</i>, and <i>ahp6</i> mutants are hypersensitive to exogenous cytokinin and 1-napthylphthalamic acid (NPA), highlighting their role in mediolateral gynoecium patterning. In summary, these mechanisms self-regulate cytokinin and auxin signaling domains, ensuring correct domain specification and gynoecium development.</p>

Root Tip Shape Governs Root Elongation Rate under Increased Soil Strength
<p>Increased soil strength due to soil compaction or soil drying is a major limitation to root growth and crop productivity. Roots need to exert higher penetration force, resulting in increased penetration stress when elongating in soils of greater strength. This study aimed to quantify how the genotypic diversity of root tip geometry and root diameter influences root elongation under different levels of soil strength and to determine the extent to which roots adjust to increased soil strength. Fourteen wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) varieties were grown in soil columns packed to three bulk densities representing low, moderate, and high soil strength. Under moderate and high soil strength, smaller root tip radius-to-length ratio was correlated with higher genotypic root elongation rate, whereas root diameter was not related to genotypic root elongation. Based on cavity expansion theory, it was found that smaller root tip radius-to-length ratio reduced penetration stress, thus enabling higher root elongation rates in soils with greater strength. Furthermore, it was observed that roots could only partially adjust to increased soil strength. Root thickening was bounded by a maximum diameter, and root tips did not become more acute in response to increased soil strength. The obtained results demonstrated that root tip geometry is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pivot</span></strong>al trait governing root penetration stress and root elongation rate in soils of greater strength. Hence, root tip shape needs to be taken into account when selecting for crop varieties that may tolerate high soil strength.</p>

NADPH Thioredoxin Reductase C and Thioredoxins Act Concertedly in Seedling Development
<p>Thiol-dependent redox regulation of enzyme activity plays a central role in the rapid acclimation of chloroplast metabolism to ever-fluctuating light availability. This regulatory mechanism relies on ferredoxin reduced by the photosynthetic electron transport chain, which fuels reducing power to thioredoxins (Trxs) via a ferredoxin-dependent Trx reductase. In addition, chloroplasts harbor an NADPH-dependent Trx reductase, which has a joint Trx domain at the carboxyl terminus, termed NTRC. Thus, a relevant issue concerning chloroplast function is to establish the relationship between these two redox systems and its impact on plant development. To address this issue, we generated Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants combining the deficiency of NTRC with those of Trxs <i>f</i>, which participate in metabolic redox regulation, and that of Trx <i>x</i>, which has antioxidant function. The <i>ntrc-trxf1f2</i> and, to a lower extent, <i>ntrc-trxx</i> mutants showed severe growth-retarded phenotypes, decreased photosynthesis performance, and almost abolished light-dependent reduction of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. Moreover, the combined deficiency of both redox systems provokes aberrant chloroplast ultrastructure. Remarkably, both the <i>ntrc-trxf1f2</i> and <i>ntrc-trxx</i> mutants showed high mortality at the seedling stage, which was overcome by the addition of an exogenous carbon source. Based on these results, we propose that NTRC plays a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pivot</span></strong>al role in chloroplast redox regulation, being necessary for the activity of diverse Trxs with unrelated functions. The interaction between the two thiol redox systems is indispensable to sustain photosynthesis performed by cotyledons chloroplasts, which is essential for early plant development.</p>

Transcriptome Profiling of Wheat Inflorescence Development from Spikelet Initiation to Floral Patterning Identified Stage-Specific Regulatory Genes
<p>Early reproductive development in cereals is crucial for final grain number per spike and hence the yield potential of the crop. To date, however, no systematic analyses of gene expression profiles during this important process have been conducted for common wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>). Here, we studied the transcriptome profiles at four stages of early wheat reproductive development, from spikelet initiation to floral organ differentiation. <i>K</i>-means clustering and stage-specific transcript identification detected dynamically expressed homeologs of important transcription regulators in spikelet and floral meristems that may be involved in spikelet initiation, floret meristem specification, and floral organ patterning, as inferred from their homologs in model plants. Small RNA transcriptome sequencing discovered key microRNAs that were differentially expressed during wheat inflorescence development alongside their target genes, suggesting that miRNA-mediated regulatory mechanisms for floral development may be conserved in cereals and Arabidopsis. Our analysis was further substantiated by the functional characterization of the <i>ARGONAUTE1d</i> (<i>AGO1d</i>) gene, which was initially expressed in stamen primordia and later in the tapetum during anther maturation. In agreement with its stage-specific expression pattern, the loss of function of the predominantly expressed B homeolog of <i>AGO1d</i> in a tetraploid durum wheat mutant resulted in smaller anthers with more infertile pollens than the wild type and a reduced grain number per spike. Together, our work provides a first glimpse of the gene regulatory networks in wheat inflorescence development that may be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pivot</span></strong>al for floral and grain development, highlighting potential targets for genetic manipulation to improve future wheat yields.</p>

Convergence in morphology and masticatory function between the pharyngeal jaws of grass carp, <i>Ctenopharyngodon idella</i>, and oral jaws of amniote herbivores
<p>The cellulose-rich walls that protect plant cells are difficult to digest, and therefore mechanical food processing is a key aspect of herbivory across vertebrates. Cell walls are typically broken down by translation of flattened teeth in the occlusal plane (i.e. grinding) as part of a complex, rhythmic chewing stroke. The grass carp, <i>Ctenopharyngodon idella</i>, is a voracious, invasive herbivorous fish that relies solely on its pharyngeal teeth, located in the back of the throat, for mechanical processing of plant material. Here, we describe the musculoskeletal anatomy of the pharyngeal jaws of grass carp and use XROMM to quantify chewing kinematics and muscle strain. The pharyngeal jaws are suspended in a sling of 11 muscles and maintain no bony articulation with any other skeletal elements in the head. The jaws bear long, serrated teeth that are worn during use into flattened tooth cusps. Our kinematic data show that this wear is the result of the teeth being elevated into occlusion against the basioccipital process and keratinous chewing pad, not tooth-on-tooth occlusion. Pharyngeal jaw elevation results from large strains in the jaw elevator muscle, the levator arcus branchialis V, to drive a pulley-like mechanism that rotates the jaws about a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pivot</span></strong> point at the symphysis between the left and right pharyngeal jaws. These complex, rhythmic jaw rotations translate the teeth laterally across the chewing surface throughout the occlusion phase. The grass carp chewing system is strikingly similar in gross morphology and masticatory function to herbivorous chewing strategies in other vertebrates.</p>

<i>Cryptosporidium parvum</i>-induced ileo-caecal adenocarcinoma and Wnt signaling in a mouse model
<p><i>Cryptosporidium</i> species are apicomplexan protozoans that are found worldwide. These parasites constitute a large risk to human and animal health. They cause self-limited diarrhea in immunocompetent hosts and a life-threatening disease in immunocompromised hosts. Interestingly, <i>Cryptosporidium parvum</i> has been related to digestive carcinogenesis in humans. Consistent with a potential tumorigenic role of this parasite, in an original reproducible animal model of chronic cryptosporidiosis based on dexamethasone-treated or untreated adult SCID mice, we formerly reported that <i>C. parvum</i> (strains of animal and human origin) is able to induce digestive adenocarcinoma even in infections induced with very low inoculum. The aim of this study was to further characterize this animal model and to explore metabolic pathways potentially involved in the development of <i>C. parvum</i>-induced ileo-caecal oncogenesis. We searched for alterations in genes or proteins commonly involved in cell cycle, differentiation or cell migration, such as β-catenin, <i>Apc</i>, E-cadherin, <i>Kras</i> and <i>p53</i>. After infection of animals with <i>C. parvum</i> we demonstrated immunohistochemical abnormal localization of Wnt signaling pathway components and p53. Mutations in the selected loci of studied genes were not found after high-throughput sequencing. Furthermore, alterations in the ultrastructure of adherens junctions of the ileo-caecal neoplastic epithelia of <i>C. parvum</i>-infected mice were recorded using transmission electron microscopy. In conclusion, we found for the first time that the Wnt signaling pathway, and particularly the cytoskeleton network, seems to be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pivot</span></strong>al for the development of the <i>C. parvum</i>-induced neoplastic process and cell migration of transformed cells. Furthermore, this model is a valuable tool in understanding the host-pathogen interactions associated with the intricate infection process of this parasite, which is able to modulate host cytoskeleton activities and several host-cell biological processes and remains a significant cause of infection worldwide.</p>

Long-term infusion of aldosterone in mice resulted in elevation of plasma interleukin-1β levels and vascular abnormalities. Mice lacking the IL-1R or the inflammasome components NLRP3 and caspase-1 were protected from aldosterone-induced vascular damage. In vitro, aldosterone stimulated NLRP3-dependent interleukin-1β secretion by bone marrow–derived macrophages by activating nuclear factor-κB signaling and reactive oxygen species generation. Moreover, chimeric mice reconstituted with NLRP3-deficient hematopoietic cells showed that NLRP3 in immune cells mediates aldosterone-induced vascular damage. In addition, aldosterone increased the expression of NLRP3, active caspase-1, and mature interleukin-1β in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Hypertensive patients with hyperaldosteronism or normal levels of aldosterone exhibited increased activity of NLRP3 inflammasome, suggesting that the effect of hyperaldosteronism on the inflammasome may be mediated through high blood pressure.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Together, these data demonstrate that NLRP3 inflammasome, through activation of IL-1R, is critically involved in the deleterious vascular effects of aldosterone, placing NLRP3 as a potential target for therapeutic interventions in conditions with high aldosterone levels.</p></sec>

Vascular Endothelial Cell Growth–Activated XBP1 Splicing in Endothelial Cells Is Crucial for Angiogenesis
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Vascular endothelial cell growth factor plays a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pivot</span></strong>al role in angiogenesis via regulating endothelial cell proliferation. The X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) is believed to be a signal transducer in the endoplasmic reticulum stress response. It is unknown whether there is crosstalk between vascular endothelial cell growth factor signaling and XBP1 pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We found that vascular endothelial cell growth factor induced the kinase insert domain receptor internalization and interaction through C-terminal domain with the unspliced XBP1 and the inositol requiring enzyme 1 α in the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to inositol requiring enzyme 1 α phosphorylation and XBP1 mRNA splicing, which was abolished by siRNA-mediated knockdown of kinase insert domain receptor. Spliced XBP1 regulated endothelial cell proliferation in a PI3K/Akt/GSK3β/β-catenin/E2F2–dependent manner and modulated the cell size increase in a PI3K/Akt/GSK3β/β-catenin/E2F2–independent manner. Knockdown of XBP1 or inositol requiring enzyme 1 α decreased endothelial cell proliferation via suppression of Akt/GSK3β phosphorylation, β-catenin nuclear translocation, and E2F2 expression. Endothelial cell–specific knockout of XBP1 (<i>XBP1ecko</i>) in mice retarded the retinal vasculogenesis in the first 2 postnatal weeks and impaired the angiogenesis triggered by ischemia. Reconstitution of XBP1 by Ad-XBP1s gene transfer significantly improved angiogenesis in ischemic tissue in <i>XBP1ecko</i> mice. Transplantation of bone marrow from wild-type o <i>XBP1ecko</i> mice could also slightly improve the foot blood reperfusion in ischemic <i>XBP1ecko</i> mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>These results suggest that XBP1 can function via growth factor signaling pathways to regulate endothelial proliferation and angiogenesis.</p></sec>

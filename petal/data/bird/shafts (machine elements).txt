Load-induced changes in bone stiffness and cancellous and cortical bone mass following tibial compression diminish with age in female mice
<p>The vertebrate skeleton is an adaptive structure that responds to mechanical stimuli by increasing bone mass under increased mechanical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>s. Although experimental animal models have shown the anabolic cortical bone response to applied <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong> decreases with age, no consensus exists regarding whether this adaptive mechanism is affected by age in cancellous bone, the tissue most impacted by age-related bone loss. We used an established murine <i>in vivo</i> tibial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing model to characterize the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>-induced cancellous, cortical and whole-bone responses to mechanical stimuli in growing and mature female mice at 6, 10 and 16 weeks of age. The effects of applied <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong> on tibial morphology and stiffness were determined using microcomputed tomography and <i>in vivo</i> bone strains measured at the medial tibial midshaft during applied <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing. At all ages, 2 weeks of applied <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong> produced larger midshaft cortical cross-sectional properties (+13–72%) and greater cancellous bone volume (+21–107%) and thicker trabeculae (+31–68%) in the proximal metaphyses of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ed tibiae. The relative anabolic response decreased from 6 to 16 weeks of age in both the cancellous and cortical envelopes. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>-induced tibial stresses decreased more in 6-week-old mice following <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing, which corresponded to increased <i>in vivo</i> tibial stiffness. Stiffness in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ed tibiae of 16-week-old mice decreased despite moderately increased cortical cross-sectional geometry, suggesting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>-induced changes in bone material properties. This study shows that the cancellous and cortical anabolic responses to mechanical stimuli decline with age into adulthood and that cortical cross-sectional geometry alone does not necessarily predict whole-bone functional stiffness.</p>

The receptor tyrosine kinase AXL mediates nuclear translocation of the epidermal growth factor receptor
<p>The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a therapeutic target in patients with various cancers. Unfortunately, resistance to EGFR-targeted therapeutics is common. Previous studies identified two mechanisms of resistance to the EGFR monoclonal antibody cetuximab. Nuclear translocation of EGFR bypasses the inhibitory effects of cetuximab, and the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL mediates cetuximab resistance by maintaining EGFR activation and downstream signaling. Thus, we hypothesized that AXL mediated the nuclear translocation of EGFR in the setting of cetuximab resistance. Cetuximab-resistant clones of non–small cell lung cancer in culture and patient-derived xenografts in mice had increased abundance of AXL and nuclear EGFR (nEGFR). Cellular fractionation analysis, super-resolution microscopy, and electron microscopy revealed that genetic loss of AXL reduced the accumulation of nEGFR. SRC family kinases (SFKs) and HER family ligands promote the nuclear translocation of EGFR. We found that AXL knockdown reduced the expression of the genes encoding the SFK family members YES and LYN and the ligand neuregulin-1 (NRG1). AXL knockdown also decreased the interaction between EGFR and the related receptor HER3 and accumulation of HER3 in the nucleus. Overexpression of LYN and NRG1 in cells depleted of AXL resulted in accumulation of nEGFR, rescuing the deficit induced by lack of AXL. Collectively, these data uncover a previously unrecognized role for AXL in regulating the nuclear translocation of EGFR and suggest that AXL-mediated SFK and <i>NRG1</i> expression promote this process.</p>

Ceramic-on-ceramic bearing fractures in total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Ceramic-on-ceramic (CoC) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>ings in total hip arthroplasty (THA)   are commonly used, but concerns exist regarding ceramic fracture.   This study aims to report the risk of revision for fracture of modern   CoC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>ings and identify factors that might influence this risk,   using data from the National Joint Registry (NJR) for England, Wales, Northern   Ireland and the Isle of Man.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We analysed data on 223 362 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>ings from 111 681 primary CoC   THAs and 182 linked revisions for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>ing fracture recorded in the   NJR.

Direct Comparison of Leaf Plasmodesma Structure and Function in Relation to Phloem-Loading Type
<p>The export of photosynthetically produced sugars from leaves depends on plasmodesmatal transport of sugar molecules from mesophyll to phloem. Traditionally, the density of plasmodesmata (PD) along this phloem-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing pathway has been used as a defining feature of different phloem-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing types, with species proposed to have either many or few PD between the phloem and surrounding cells of the leaf. However, quantitative determination of PD density has rarely been performed. Moreover, the structure of PD has not been considered, even though it could impact permeability, and functional data are only available for very few species. Here, a comparison of PD density, structure, and function using data from transmission electron microscopy and live-cell microscopy was conducted for all relevant cell–cell interfaces in leaves of nine species. These species represent the three principal phloem-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing types currently discussed in literature. Results show that relative PD density among the different cell-cell interfaces in one species, but not absolute PD density, is indicative of phloem-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing type. PD density data of single interfaces, even combined with PD diameter and length data, did not correlate with the intercellular diffusion capacity measured by the fluorescence loss in photobleaching method. This means that PD substructure not visible on standard transmission electron micrographs may have a strong influence on permeability. Furthermore, the results <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong> a proposed passive symplasmic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing mechanism in the tree species horse chestnut (<i>Aesculus hippocastanum</i>), white birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>), orchard apple (<i>Malus domestica</i>), and gray poplar (<i>Populus x canescens</i>) as functional cell coupling and PD structure differed from active symplasmic and apoplasmic phloem-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing species.</p>

Brown and Polar Bear Y Chromosomes Reveal Extensive Male-Biased Gene Flow within Brother Lineages
<p>Brown and polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>s have become prominent examples in phylogeography, but previous phylogeographic studies relied largely on maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or were geographically restricted. The male-specific Y chromosome, a natural counterpart to mtDNA, has remained underexplored. Although this paternally inherited chromosome is indispensable for comprehensive analyses of phylogeographic patterns, technical difficulties and low variability have hampered its application in most mammals. We developed 13 novel Y-chromosomal sequence and microsatellite markers from the polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong> genome and screened these in a broad geographic sample of 130 brown and polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>s. We also analyzed a 390-kb-long Y-chromosomal scaffold using sequencing data from published male ursine genomes. Y chromosome evidence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong> the emerging understanding that brown and polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>s started to diverge no later than the Middle Pleistocene. Contrary to mtDNA patterns, we found 1) brown and polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>s to be reciprocally monophyletic sister (or rather brother) lineages, without signals of introgression, 2) male-biased gene flow across continents and on phylogeographic time scales, and 3) male dispersal that links the Alaskan ABC islands population to mainland brown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>s. Due to female philopatry, mtDNA provides a highly structured estimate of population differentiation, while male-biased gene flow is a homogenizing force for nuclear genetic variation. Our findings highlight the importance of analyzing both maternally and paternally inherited loci for a comprehensive view of phylogeographic history, and that mtDNA-based phylogeographic studies of many mammals should be reevaluated. Recent advances in sequencing technology render the analysis of Y-chromosomal variation feasible, even in nonmodel organisms.</p>

Bidirectional eukaryotic DNA replication is established by quasi-symmetrical helicase loading
<p>Bidirectional replication from eukaryotic DNA replication origins requires the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing of two ring-shaped minichromosome maintenance (MCM) helicases around DNA in opposite orientations. MCM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing is orchestrated by binding of the origin recognition complex (ORC) to DNA, but how ORC coordinates symmetrical MCM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing is unclear. We used natural budding yeast DNA replication origins and synthetic DNA sequences to show that efficient MCM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing requires binding of two ORC molecules to two ORC binding sites. The relative orientation of these sites, but not the distance between them, was found to be critical for MCM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing in vitro and origin function in vivo. We propose that quasi-symmetrical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing of individual MCM hexamers by ORC and directed MCM translocation into double hexamers acts as a unifying mechanism for the establishment of bidirectional replication in archaea and eukaryotes.</p>

Mediolateral force distribution at the knee joint shifts across activities and is driven by tibiofemoral alignment
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Tibiofemoral alignment is important to determine the rate of   progression of osteoarthritis and implant survival after total knee   arthroplasty (TKA). Normally, surgeons aim for neutral tibiofemoral   alignment following TKA, but this has been questioned in recent   years. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether varus or valgus   alignment indeed leads to increased medial or lateral tibiofemoral   forces during static and dynamic weight-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>ing activities.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Tibiofemoral contact forces and moments were measured in nine   patients with instrumented knee implants.

Phloem Loading through Plasmodesmata: A Biophysical Analysis
<p>In many species, Suc en route out of the leaf migrates from photosynthetically active mesophyll cells into the phloem down its concentration gradient via plasmodesmata, i.e. symplastically. In some of these plants, the process is entirely passive, but in others phloem Suc is actively converted into larger sugars, raffinose and stachyose, and segregated (trapped), thus raising total phloem sugar concentration to a level higher than in the mesophyll. Questions remain regarding the mechanisms and selective advantages conferred by both of these symplastic-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing processes. Here, we present an integrated model—including local and global transport and kinetics of polymerization—for passive and active symplastic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing. We also propose a physical model of transport through the plasmodesmata. With these models, we predict that (1) relative to passive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing, polymerization of Suc in the phloem, even in the absence of segregation, lowers the sugar content in the leaf required to achieve a given export rate and accelerates export for a given concentration of Suc in the mesophyll and (2) segregation of oligomers and the inverted gradient of total sugar content can be achieved for physiologically reasonable parameter values, but even higher export rates can be accessed in scenarios in which polymers are allowed to diffuse back into the mesophyll. We discuss these predictions in relation to further studies aimed at the clarification of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing mechanisms, fitness of active and passive symplastic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing, and potential targets for engineering improved rates of export.</p>

Sucrose Transporter <i>ZmSut1</i> Expression and Localization Uncover New Insights into Sucrose Phloem Loading
<p>Sucrose transporters (SUTs) translocate sucrose (Suc) across cellular membranes, and in eudicots, multiple SUTs are known to function in Suc phloem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing in leaves. In maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), the <i>Sucrose Transporter1</i> (<i>ZmSut1</i>) gene has been implicated in Suc phloem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing based upon RNA expression in leaves, electrophysiological experiments, and phenotypic analysis of <i>zmsut1</i> mutant plants. However, no previous studies have examined the cellular expression of <i>ZmSut1</i> RNA or the subcellular localization of the ZmSUT1 protein to assess the gene’s hypothesized function in Suc phloem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing or to evaluate its potential roles, such as phloem un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing, in nonphotosynthetic tissues. To this end, we performed RNA in situ hybridization experiments, promoter-reporter gene analyses, and ZmSUT1 localization studies to elucidate the cellular expression pattern of the <i>ZmSut1</i> transcript and protein. These data showed that <i>ZmSut1</i> was expressed in multiple cell types throughout the plant and indicated that it functions in phloem companion cells to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong> Suc and also in other cell types to retrieve Suc from the apoplasm to prevent its accumulation and loss to the transpiration stream. Additionally, by comparing a phloem-mobile tracer with <i>ZmSut1</i> expression, we determined that developing maize leaves dynamically switch from symplasmic to apoplasmic phloem un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing, reconciling previously conflicting reports, and suggest that <i>ZmSut1</i> does not have an apparent function in either un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing process. A model for the dual roles for <i>ZmSut1</i> function (phloem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing and apoplasmic recycling), <i>Sut1</i> evolution, and its possible use to enhance Suc export from leaves in engineering C<sub>3</sub> grasses for C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis is discussed.</p>

Ultrafast Approximation for Phylogenetic Bootstrap
<p>Nonparametric bootstrap has been a widely used tool in phylogenetic analysis to assess the clade <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong> of phylogenetic trees. However, with the rapidly growing amount of data, this task remains a computational bottleneck. Recently, approximation methods such as the RAxML rapid bootstrap (RBS) and the Shimodaira–Hasegawa-like approximate likelihood ratio test have been introduced to speed up the bootstrap. Here, we suggest an ultrafast bootstrap approximation approach (UFBoot) to compute the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong> of phylogenetic groups in maximum likelihood (ML) based trees. To achieve this, we combine the resampling estimated log-likelihood method with a simple but effective collection scheme of candidate trees. We also propose a stopping rule that assesses the convergence of branch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong> values to automatically determine when to stop collecting candidate trees. UFBoot achieves a median speed up of 3.1 (range: 0.66–33.3) to 10.2 (range: 1.32–41.4) compared with RAxML RBS for real DNA and amino acid alignments, respectively. Moreover, our extensive simulations show that UFBoot is robust against moderate model violations and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong> values obtained appear to be relatively unbiased compared with the conservative standard bootstrap. This provides a more direct interpretation of the bootstrap <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong>. We offer an efficient and easy-to-use software (available at <ext-link>http://www.cibiv.at/software/iqtree</ext-link>) to perform the UFBoot analysis with ML tree inference.</p>

Gastrointestinal and renal responses to variable water intake in whitebellied sunbirds and New Holland honeyeaters
<p>Nectarivores face a constant challenge in terms of water balance, experiencing water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing or dehydration when switching between food plants or between feeding and fasting. To understand how whitebellied sunbirds and New Holland honeyeaters meet the challenges of varying preformed water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>, we used the elimination of intramuscular-injected [<sup>14</sup>C]-<sc>l</sc>-glucose and <sup>3</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O to quantify intestinal and renal water handling on diets varying in sugar concentration. Both sunbirds and honeyeaters showed significant modulation of intestinal water absorption, allowing excess water to be shunted through the intestine when on dilute diets. Despite reducing their fractional water absorption, both species showed linear increases in water flux and fractional body water turnover as water intake increased (both afternoon and morning), suggesting that the modulation of fractional water absorption was not sufficient to completely offset dietary water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>s. In both species, glomerular filtration rate was independent of water gain (but was higher for the afternoon), as was renal fractional water reabsorption (measured in the afternoon). During the natural overnight fast, both sunbirds and honeyeaters arrested whole kidney function. Evaporative water loss in sunbirds was variable but correlated with water gain. Both sunbirds and honeyeaters appear to modulate intestinal water absorption as an important component of water regulation to help deal with massive preformed water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>s. Shutting down glomerular filtration rate during the overnight fast is another way of saving energy for osmoregulatory function. Birds maintain osmotic balance on diets varying markedly in preformed water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong> by varying both intestinal water absorption and excretion through the intestine and kidneys.</p>

Mitotic phosphorylation regulates Hsp72 spindle localization by uncoupling ATP binding from substrate release
<p>Hsp72 is a member of the 70-kDa heat shock family of molecular chaperones (Hsp70s) that comprise a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and a substrate-binding domain (SBD) connected by a linker that couples the exchange of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) with the release of the protein substrate. Mitotic phosphorylation of Hsp72 by the kinase NEK6 at Thr<sup>66</sup> located in the NBD promotes the localization of Hsp72 to the mitotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spindl</span></strong>e and is required for efficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spindl</span></strong>e assembly and chromosome congression and segregation. We determined the crystal structure of the Hsp72 NBD containing a genetically encoded phosphoserine at position 66. This revealed structural changes that stabilized interactions between subdomains within the NBD. ATP binding to the NBD of unmodified Hsp72 resulted in the release of substrate from the SBD, but phosphorylated Hsp72 retained substrate in the presence of ATP. Mutations that prevented phosphorylation-dependent subdomain interactions restored the connection between ATP binding and substrate release. Thus, phosphorylation of Thr<sup>66</sup> is a reversible mechanism that decouples the allosteric connection between nucleotide binding and substrate release, providing further insight into the regulation of the Hsp70 family. We propose that phosphorylation of Hsp72 on Thr<sup>66</sup> by NEK6 during mitosis promotes its localization to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spindl</span></strong>e by stabilizing its interactions with components of the mitotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spindl</span></strong>e.</p>

Dual-spindle formation in zygotes keeps parental genomes apart in early mammalian embryos
<p>At the beginning of mammalian life, the genetic material from each parent meets when the fertilized egg divides. It was previously thought that a single microtubule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spindl</span></strong>e is responsible for spatially combining the two genomes and then segregating them to create the two-cell embryo. We used light-sheet microscopy to show that two bipolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spindl</span></strong>es form in the zygote and then independently congress the maternal and paternal genomes. These two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spindl</span></strong>es aligned their poles before anaphase but kept the parental genomes apart during the first cleavage. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spindl</span></strong>e assembly mechanism provides a potential rationale for erroneous divisions into more than two blastomeric nuclei observed in mammalian zygotes and reveals the mechanism behind the observation that parental genomes occupy separate nuclear compartments in the two-cell embryo.</p>

Spindle asymmetry drives non-Mendelian chromosome segregation
<p>Genetic elements compete for transmission through meiosis, when haploid gametes are created from a diploid parent. Selfish elements can enhance their transmission through a process known as meiotic drive. In female meiosis, selfish elements drive by preferentially attaching to the egg side of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spindl</span></strong>e. This implies some asymmetry between the two sides of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spindl</span></strong>e, but the molecular mechanisms underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spindl</span></strong>e asymmetry are unknown. Here we found that CDC42 signaling from the cell cortex regulated microtubule tyrosination to induce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spindl</span></strong>e asymmetry and that non-Mendelian segregation depended on this asymmetry. Cortical CDC42 depends on polarization directed by chromosomes, which are positioned near the cortex to allow the asymmetric cell division. Thus, selfish meiotic drivers exploit the asymmetry inherent in female meiosis to bias their transmission.</p>

Seasonal water storage, stress modulation, and California seismicity
<p>Establishing what controls the timing of earthquakes is fundamental to understanding the nature of the earthquake cycle and critical to determining time-dependent earthquake hazard. Seasonal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing provides a natural laboratory to explore the crustal response to a quantifiable transient force. In California, water storage deforms the crust as snow and water accumulates during the wet winter months. We used 9 years of global positioning system (GPS) vertical deformation time series to constrain models of monthly hydrospheric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing and the resulting stress changes on fault planes of small earthquakes. The seasonal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing analysis reveals earthquakes occurring more frequently during stress conditions that favor earthquake rupture. We infer that California seismicity rates are modestly modulated by natural hydrological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing cycles.</p>

‘Modern’ distal femoral locking plates allow safe, early weight-bearing with a high rate of union and low rate of failure
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Fractures of the distal femur can be challenging to manage and   are on the increase in the elderly osteoporotic population. Management   with casting or bracing can unacceptably limit a patient’s ability   to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong> weight, but historically, operative fixation has been associated   with a high rate of re-operation.

Functional outcomes of conservatively managed acute ruptures of the Achilles tendon
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>This prospective cohort study aims to determine if the size of   the tendon gap following acute rupture of the Achilles tendon shows   an association with the functional outcome following non-operative   treatment. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>All patients presenting within two weeks of an acute unilateral   rupture of the Achilles tendon between July 2012 and July 2015 were   considered for the study. In total, 38 patients (nine female, 29   male, mean age 52 years; 29 to 78) completed the study. Dynamic   ultrasound examination was performed to confirm the diagnosis and   measure the gap between ruptured tendon ends.

<i>In vivo</i> three-dimensional kinematics of normal knees during different high-flexion activities
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>In Asia and the Middle-East, people often flex their knees deeply   in order to perform activities of daily living. The purpose of this   study was to investigate the 3D kinematics of normal knees during   high-flexion activities. Our hypothesis was that the femorotibial   rotation, varus-valgus angle, translations, and kinematic pathway   of normal knees during high-flexion activities, varied according   to activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We investigated the <i>in vivo</i> kinematics of eight   normal knees in four male volunteers (mean age 41.8 years; 37 to   53) using 2D and 3D registration technique, and modelled the knees   with a computer aided design program. Each subject squatted, kneeled,   and sat cross-legged. We evaluated the femoral rotation and varus-valgus   angle relative to the tibia and anteroposterior translation of the   medial and lateral side, using the transepicodylar axis as our femoral   reference relative to the perpendicular projection on to the tibial   plateau. This method evaluates the femur medially from what has   elsewhere been described as the extension facet centre, and differs   from the method classically applied. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>During squatting and kneeling, the knees displayed femoral external   rotation. When sitting cross-legged, femurs displayed internal rotation   from 10° to 100°. From 100°, femoral external rotation was observed.   No significant difference in varus-valgus angle was seen between   squatting and kneeling, whereas a varus position was observed from   140° when sitting cross-legged. The measure kinematic pathway using   our methodology found during squatting a medial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pivot</span></strong>ing pattern   from 0° to 40° and bicondylar rollback from 40° to 150°. During   kneeling, a medial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pivot</span></strong> pattern was evident.

Stroma provides an intestinal stem cell niche in the absence of epithelial Wnts
<p>Wnt/β-catenin signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong>s intestinal homeostasis by regulating proliferation in the crypt. Multiple Wnts are expressed in Paneth cells as well as other intestinal epithelial and stromal cells. <i>Ex vivo</i>, Wnts secreted by Paneth cells can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong> intestinal stem cells when Wnt signaling is enhanced with supplemental R-Spondin 1 (RSPO1). However, <i>in vivo</i>, the source of Wnts in the stem cell niche is less clear. Genetic ablation of <i>Porcn</i>, an endoplasmic reticulum resident O-acyltransferase that is essential for the secretion and activity of all vertebrate Wnts, confirmed the role of intestinal epithelial Wnts in <i>ex vivo</i> culture. Unexpectedly, mice lacking epithelial Wnt activity (<i>Porcn<sup>Del</sup>/Villin-Cre</i> mice) had normal intestinal proliferation and differentiation, as well as successful regeneration after radiation injury, indicating that epithelial Wnts are dispensable for these processes. Consistent with a key role for stroma in the crypt niche, intestinal stromal cells endogenously expressing Wnts and <i>Rspo3</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong> the growth of <i>Porcn<sup>Del</sup></i> organoids <i>ex vivo</i> without RSPO1 supplementation. Conversely, increasing pharmacologic PORCN inhibition, affecting both stroma and epithelium, reduced <i>Lgr5</i> intestinal stem cells, inhibited recovery from radiation injury, and at the highest dose fully blocked intestinal proliferation. We conclude that epithelial Wnts are dispensable and that stromal production of Wnts can fully <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong> normal murine intestinal homeostasis.</p>

Protective Effects of Ticagrelor on Myocardial Injury After Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor antagonist ticagrelor has been shown to be clinically superior to clopidogrel. Although the underlying mechanisms remain elusive, ticagrelor may exert off-target effects through adenosine-related mechanisms. We aimed to investigate whether ticagrelor reduces myocardial injury to a greater extent than clopidogrel after myocardial infarction (MI) at a similar level of platelet inhibition and to determine the underlying mechanisms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Pigs received the following before MI induction: (1) placebo-control; (2) a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing dose of clopidogrel (600 mg); (3) a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing dose of ticagrelor (180 mg); or (4) a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ing dose of ticagrelor followed by an adenosine A1/A2-receptor antagonist [8-(<i>p</i>-sulfophenyl)theophylline, 4 mg/kg intravenous] to determine the potential contribution of adenosine in ticagrelor-related cardioprotection. Animals received the corresponding maintenance doses of the antiplatelet agents during the following 24 hours and underwent 3T-cardiac MRI analysis. Platelet inhibition was monitored by ADP-induced platelet aggregation. In the myocardium, we assessed the expression and activation of proteins known to modulate edema formation, including aquaporin-4 and AMP-activated protein kinase and its downstream effectors CD36 and endothelial nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Clopidogrel and ticagrelor exerted a high and consistent antiplatelet effect (68.2% and 62.2% of platelet inhibition, respectively, on challenge with 20 μmol/L ADP) that persisted up to 24 hours post-MI (<i>P</i><0.05). All groups showed comparable myocardial area-at-risk and cardiac worsening after MI induction. 3T-Cardiac MRI analysis revealed that clopidogrel- and ticagrelor-treated animals had a significantly smaller extent of MI than placebo-control animals (15.7 g left ventricle and 12.0 g left ventricle versus 22.8 g left ventricle, respectively). Yet, ticagrelor reduced infarct size to a significantly greater extent than clopidogrel (further 23.5% reduction; <i>P</i>=0.0026), an effect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong>ed by troponin-I assessment and histopathologic analysis (<i>P</i>=0.0021). Furthermore, in comparison with clopidogrel, ticagrelor significantly diminished myocardial edema by 24.5% (<i>P</i>=0.004), which correlated with infarct mass (<i>r</i>=0.73; <i>P</i><0.001). 8-(<i>p</i>-Sulfophenyl)theophylline administration abolished the cardioprotective effects of ticagrelor over clopidogrel. At a molecular level, aquaporin-4 expression decreased and the expression and activation of AMP-activated protein kinase signaling and cyclooxygenase-2 increased in the ischemic myocardium of ticagrelor- versus clopidogrel-treated animals (<i>P</i><0.05). These protein changes were not observed in those animals administered the adenosine receptor blocker 8-(<i>p</i>-sulfophenyl)theophylline.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Ticagrelor, beyond its antiplatelet efficacy, exerts cardioprotective effects by reducing necrotic injury and edema formation via adenosine-dependent mechanisms.</p></sec>

Phylogenetic Signal Variation in the Genomes of <i>Medicago</i> (Fabaceae)
<p>Genome-scale data offer the opportunity to clarify phylogenetic relationships that are difficult to resolve with few loci, but they can also identify genomic regions with evolutionary history distinct from that of the species history. We collected whole-genome sequence data from 29 taxa in the legume genus <i>Medicago</i>, then aligned these sequences to the <i>Medicago truncatula</i> reference genome to confidently identify 87 596 variable homologous sites. We used this data set to estimate phylogenetic relationships among <i>Medicago</i> species, to investigate the number of sites needed to provide robust phylogenetic estimates and to identify specific genomic regions <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong>ing topologies in conflict with the genome-wide phylogeny. Our full genomic data set resolves relationships within the genus that were previously intractable. Subsampling the data reveals considerable variation in phylogenetic signal and power in smaller subsets of the data. Even when sampling 5000 sites, no random sample of the data <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong>s a topology identical to that of the genome-wide phylogeny. Phylogenetic relationships estimated from 500-site sliding windows revealed genome regions <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong>ing several alternative species relationships among recently diverged taxa, consistent with the expected effects of deep coalescence or introgression in the recent history of <i>Medicago</i>.

Mitotic phosphotyrosine network analysis reveals that tyrosine phosphorylation regulates Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1)
<p>Tyrosine phosphorylation is closely associated with cell proliferation. During the cell cycle, serine and threonine phosphorylation plays the leading role, and such phosphorylation events are most dynamic during the mitotic phase of the cell cycle. However, mitotic phosphotyrosine is not well characterized. Although a few functionally-relevant mitotic phosphotyrosine sites have been characterized, evidence suggests that this modification may be more prevalent than previously appreciated. Here, we examined tyrosine phosphorylation in mitotic human cells including those on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spindl</span></strong>e-associated proteins.? Database mining confirmed ~2000 mitotic phosphotyrosine sites, and network analysis revealed a number of subnetworks that were enriched in tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, including components of the kinetochore or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spindl</span></strong>e and SRC family kinases. We identified Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), a major signaling hub in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spindl</span></strong>e subnetwork, as phosphorylated at the conserved Tyr<sup>217</sup> in the kinase domain. Substitution of Tyr<sup>217</sup> with a phosphomimetic residue eliminated PLK1 activity in vitro and in cells. Further analysis showed that Tyr<sup>217</sup> phosphorylation reduced the phosphorylation of Thr<sup>210</sup> in the activation loop, a phosphorylation event necessary for PLK1 activity. Our data indicate that mitotic tyrosine phosphorylation regulated a key serine/threonine kinase hub in mitotic cells and suggested that spatially separating tyrosine phosphorylation events can reveal previously unrecognized regulatory events and complexes associated with specific structures of the cell cycle.</p>

Genetic diversity of tumors with mismatch repair deficiency influences anti–PD-1 immunotherapy response
<p>Tumors with mismatch repair deficiency (MMR-d) are characterized by sequence alterations in microsatellites and can accumulate thousands of mutations. This high mutational burden renders tumors immunogenic and sensitive to programmed cell death–1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitors. Yet, despite their tumor immunogenicity, patients with MMR-deficient tumors experience highly variable responses, and roughly half are refractory to treatment. We present experimental and clinical evidence showing that the degree of microsatellite instability (MSI) and resultant mutational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>, in part, underlies the variable response to PD-1 blockade immunotherapy in MMR-d human and mouse tumors. The extent of response is particularly associated with the accumulation of insertion-deletion (indel) mutational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>. This study provides a rationale for the genome-wide characterization of MSI intensity and mutational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong> to better profile responses to anti–PD-1 immunotherapy across MMR-deficient human cancers.</p>

Legacy nitrogen may prevent achievement of water quality goals in the Gulf of Mexico

However, to date there has been no rigorous assessment of the effect of N legacies on achieving water quality goals.

High-energy, high-fat lifestyle challenges an Arctic apex predator, the polar bear
<p>Regional declines in polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong> (<i>Ursus maritimus</i>) populations have been attributed to changing sea ice conditions, but with limited information on the causative mechanisms. By simultaneously measuring field metabolic rates, daily activity patterns, body condition, and foraging success of polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>s moving on the spring sea ice, we found that high metabolic rates (1.6 times greater than previously assumed) coupled with low intake of fat-rich marine mammal prey resulted in an energy deficit for more than half of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>s examined. Activity and movement on the sea ice strongly influenced metabolic demands. Consequently, increases in mobility resulting from ongoing and forecasted declines in and fragmentation of sea ice are likely to increase energy demands and may be an important factor explaining observed declines in body condition and survival.</p>

An atom-by-atom assembler of defect-free arbitrary two-dimensional atomic arrays

Starting from initially larger, half-filled matrices of randomly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>ed traps, we obtain user-defined target arrays at unit filling. This is achieved with a real-time control system and a moving optical tweezers, which together enable a sequence of rapid atom moves depending on the initial distribution of the atoms in the arrays.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Metabolic Control of Tobacco Pollination by Sugars and Invertases
<p>Pollination in flowering plants is initiated by germination of pollen grains on stigmas followed by fast growth of pollen tubes representing highly energy-consuming processes. The symplastic isolation of pollen grains and tubes requires import of Suc available in the apoplast. We show that the functional coupling of Suc cleavage by invertases and uptake of the released hexoses by monosaccharide transporters are critical for pollination in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>). Transcript profiling, in situ hybridization, and immunolocalization of extracellular invertases and two monosaccharide transporters in vitro and in vivo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong> the functional coupling in supplying carbohydrates for pollen germination and tube growth evidenced by spatiotemporally coordinated expression. Detection of vacuolar invertases in maternal tissues by these approaches revealed metabolic cross talk between male and female tissues and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong>ed the requirement for carbohydrate supply in transmitting tissue during pollination. Tissue-specific expression of an invertase inhibitor and addition of the chemical invertase inhibitor miglitol strongly reduced extracellular invertase activity and impaired pollen germination. Measurements of (competitive) uptake of labeled sugars identified two import pathways for exogenously available Suc into the germinating pollen operating in parallel: direct Suc uptake and via the hexoses after cleavage by extracellular invertase. Reduction of extracellular invertase activity in pollen decreases Suc uptake and severely compromises pollen germination. We further demonstrate that Glc as sole carbon source is sufficient for pollen germination, whereas Suc is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong>ing tube growth, revealing an important regulatory role of both the invertase substrate and products contributing to a potential metabolic and signaling-based multilayer regulation of pollination by carbohydrates.</p>

Temperature mediates the effect of humidity on the viscoelasticity of glycoprotein glue within the droplets of an orb-weaving spider's prey capture threads
<p>Sticky viscous prey capture threads retain insects that strike araneoid orb-webs. The threads' two axial fibers <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong> a series of glue droplets, each featuring a core of adhesive viscoelastic glycoprotein covered by an aqueous solution. After sticking, the glue extends, summing the adhesion of multiple droplets, and dissipates some of the energy of a struggling prey. As a day progresses, threads experience a drop in humidity and an increase in temperature, environmental variables that have the potential to alter thread and web function. We hypothesize that thread droplets respond to these opposing environmental changes in a manner that stabilizes their performance, and test this by examining threads spun by <i>Argiope aurantia</i>, a species that occupies exposed, weedy habitats. We confirmed that decreased humidity increases glycoprotein viscosity and found that increased temperature had the opposite effect. To evaluate the combined effect of temperature and humidity on a droplet's ability to transfer adhesive force and dissipate energy, we extended a droplet and measured both the deflection of the axial line <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong>ing the droplet and the duration of its tensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong>. The cumulative product of these two indices, which reflects the energy required to extend a droplet, was greatest under afternoon (hot and dry) conditions, less under morning (cool and humid) conditions, and least under hot and humid afternoon conditions. Although the opposing effects of temperature and humidity tend to stabilize glycoprotein performance, <i>A. aurantia</i> thread droplets appear to function optimally during the afternoon, equipping this species to capture large orthopterans, which are most active at this time.</p>

The use of femoral stems with exchangeable necks in primary total hip arthroplasty increases the rate of revision
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Femoral stems with exchangeable (modular) necks were introduced   to offer surgeons an increased choice when determining the version,   offset and length of the femoral neck during total hip arthroplasty   (THA). It was hoped that this would improve outcomes and reduce   complications, particularly dislocation. In 2010, the Australian Orthopaedic   Association National Joint Replacement Registry (AOANJRR) first   reported an increased rate of revision after primary THA using femoral   stems with an exchangeable neck. The aim of this study was to provide   a more comprehensive up-to-date analysis of primary THA using femoral   stems with exchangeable and fixed necks.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The data included all primary THA procedures performed for osteoarthritis   (OA), reported to the AOANJRR between 01 September 1999 and 31 December   2014. There were 9289 femoral stems with an exchangeable neck and   253 165 femoral stems with a fixed neck. The characteristics of   the patients and prostheses including the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>ing surface and stem/neck   metal combinations were examined using Cox proportional hazard ratios   (HRs) and Kaplan-Meier estimates of survivorship. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>It was found that prostheses with an exchangeable neck had a   higher rate of revision and this was evident regardless of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>ing   surface or the size of the femoral head. Exchangeable neck prostheses   with a titanium stem and a cobalt-chromium neck had a significantly   higher rate of revision compared with titanium stem/titanium neck   combinations (HR 1.83, 95% confidence interval 1.49 to 2.23, p <   0.001). Revisions were higher for these combinations compared with   femoral stems with a fixed neck.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion </title><p>There appears to be little evidence to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong> the continued   use of prostheses with an exchangeable neck in primary THA undertaken   for OA.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:766–73.</p></sec>

Patients were randomised to be treated with a   cobalt-chrome (CoCr) femoral head with an ultra-high molecular weight   polyethylene (UHMWPE), highly cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) or   ceramic-on-ceramic (CoC) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>ing surface.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 102 hips (91 patients) were randomised into the three   groups. At ten years, 97 hips were available for radiological and   functional follow-up. Two hips (two patients) had been revised (one   with deep infection and one for periprosthetic fracture) and three   were lost to follow-up.

Volumetric wear was also significantly reduced in the   XLPE group (29.29 mm<sup>3</sup>/yr) compared with the UHMWPE group   (100.75mm<sup>3</sup>/yr) (p = 0.0001). There were six patients   with UHMWPE who had non-progressive osteolysis and none in the XLPE   group.

A <i>β</i>-Ketoacyl-CoA Synthase Is Involved in Rice Leaf Cuticular Wax Synthesis and Requires a CER2-LIKE Protein as a Cofactor
<p>Cuticular waxes are complex mixtures of very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) and their derivatives, forming a natural barrier on aerial surfaces of terrestrial plants against biotic and abiotic stresses. In VLCFA biosynthesis, β-ketoacyl-CoA synthase (KCS) is the key enzyme, catalyzing the first reaction in fatty acid elongation and determining substrate specificity. We isolated a rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) <i>wax crystal-sparse leaf 4</i> (<i>WSL4</i>) gene using a map-based cloning strategy. <i>WSL4</i> is predicted to encode a KCS, a homolog of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) CER6. Complementation of the mutant <i>wsl4-1</i> with <i>WSL4</i> genomic DNA rescued the cuticular wax-deficient phenotype, confirming the function of <i>WSL4</i>. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong> of wax components longer than 30 carbons (C30) and C28 were reduced markedly in <i>wsl4-1</i> and <i>wsl4-2</i> mutants, respectively. Overexpression of <i>WSL4</i> increased the cuticular wax <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">load</span></strong> in rice leaves. We further isolated a cofactor of WSL4, OsCER2, a homolog of Arabidopsis CER2, by coimmunoprecipitation and confirmed their physical interaction by split-ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid experiments. Expression of <i>WSL4</i> alone in <i>elo3</i> yeast cells resulted in increased C24 but did not produce VLCFAs of greater length, whereas expressing <i>OsCER2</i> alone showed no effect. Coexpression of <i>WSL4</i> and <i>OsCER2</i> in <i>elo3</i> yeast cells yielded fatty acids up to C30. OsCER2 with a mutated HxxxD motif (H172E, D176A, and D176H) interrupted its interaction with WSL4 and failed to elongate VLCFAs past C24 when expressed with WSL4 in <i>elo3</i> yeast cells. These results demonstrated that WSL4 was involved in VLCFA elongation beyond C22 and that elongation beyond C24 required the participation of OsCER2.</p>

Phosphorylation of MAP65-1 by Arabidopsis Aurora Kinases Is Required for Efficient Cell Cycle Progression
<p>Aurora kinases are key effectors of mitosis. Plant Auroras are functionally divided into two clades. The alpha Auroras (Aurora1 and Aurora2) associate with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spindl</span></strong>e and the cell plate and are implicated in controlling formative divisions throughout plant development. The beta Aurora (Aurora3) localizes to centromeres and likely functions in chromosome separation. In contrast to the wealth of data available on the role of Aurora in other kingdoms, knowledge on their function in plants is merely emerging. This is exemplified by the fact that only histone H3 and the plant homolog of TPX2 have been identified as Aurora substrates in plants. Here we provide biochemical, genetic, and cell biological evidence that the microtubule-bundling protein MAP65-1—a member of the MAP65/Ase1/PRC1 protein family, implicated in central <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spindl</span></strong>e formation and cytokinesis in animals, yeasts, and plants—is a genuine substrate of alpha Aurora kinases. MAP65-1 interacts with Aurora1 in vivo and is phosphorylated on two residues at its unfolded tail domain. Its overexpression and down-regulation antagonistically affect the alpha Aurora double mutant phenotypes. Phospho-mutant analysis shows that Aurora contributes to the microtubule bundling capacity of MAP65-1 in concert with other mitotic kinases.</p>

Plant-Specific Preprotein and Amino Acid Transporter Proteins Are Required for tRNA Import into Mitochondria
<p>A variety of eukaryotes, in particular plants, do not contain the required number of tRNAs to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong> the translation of mitochondria-encoded genes and thus need to import tRNAs from the cytosol. This study identified two Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) proteins, Tric1 and Tric2 (for tRNA import component), which on simultaneous inactivation by T-DNA insertion lines displayed a severely delayed and chlorotic growth phenotype and significantly reduced tRNA import capacity into isolated mitochondria. The predicted tRNA-binding domain of Tric1 and Tric2, a sterile-α-motif at the C-terminal end of the protein, was required to restore tRNA uptake ability in mitochondria of complemented plants. The purified predicted tRNA-binding domain binds the T-arm of the tRNA for alanine with conserved lysine residues required for binding. T-DNA inactivation of both Tric proteins further resulted in an increase in the in vitro rate of in organello protein synthesis, which was mediated by a reorganization of the nuclear transcriptome, in particular of genes encoding a variety of proteins required for mitochondrial gene expression at both the transcriptional and translational levels. The characterization of Tric1/2 provides mechanistic insight into the process of tRNA import into mitochondria and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong>s the theory that the tRNA import pathway resulted from the repurposing of a preexisting protein import apparatus.</p>

Dirigent Protein Mode of Action Revealed by the Crystal Structure of AtDIR6
<p>Dirigent proteins impart stereoselectivity to phenoxy radical coupling reactions in plants and, thus, play an essential role in the biosynthesis of biologically active natural products. This includes the regioselective and enantioselective coupling and subsequent cyclization of two coniferyl alcohol radicals to pinoresinol as the committed step of lignan biosynthesis. The reaction is controlled by dirigent proteins, which, depending on the species and protein, direct the reaction to either (+)- or (−)-pinoresinol. We present the crystal structure of the (−)-pinoresinol forming DIRIGENT PROTEIN6 (AtDIR6) from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) with data to 1.4 Å resolution. The structure shows AtDIR6 as an eight-stranded antiparallel β-barrel that forms a trimer with spatially well-separated cavities for substrate binding. The binding cavities are two lobed, exhibiting two opposing pockets, each lined with a set of hydrophilic and potentially catalytic residues, including essential aspartic acids. These residues are conserved between (+) and (−)-pinoresinol-forming DIRs and required for activity. The structure <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong>s a model in which two substrate radicals bind to each of the DIR monomers. With the aromatic rings fixed in the two pockets, the propionyl side chains face each other for radical-radical coupling, and stereoselectivity is determined by the exact positioning of the side chains. Extensive mutational analysis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong>s a previously unrecognized function for DIRs in catalyzing the cyclization of the bis-quinone methide reaction intermediate to yield (+)- or (−)-pinoresinol.</p>

The Proteasome Acts as a Hub for Plant Immunity and Is Targeted by <i>Pseudomonas</i> Type III Effectors
<p>Recent evidence suggests that the ubiquitin-proteasome system is involved in several aspects of plant immunity and that a range of plant pathogens subvert the ubiquitin-proteasome system to enhance their virulence. Here, we show that proteasome activity is strongly induced during basal defense in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Mutant lines of the proteasome subunits <i>RPT2a</i> and <i>RPN12a</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong> increased bacterial growth of virulent <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>tomato</i> DC3000 (<i>Pst</i>) and <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>maculicola</i> ES4326. Both proteasome subunits are required for pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity responses. Analysis of bacterial growth after a secondary infection of systemic leaves revealed that the establishment of systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is impaired in proteasome mutants, suggesting that the proteasome also plays an important role in defense priming and SAR. In addition, we show that <i>Pst</i> inhibits proteasome activity in a type III secretion-dependent manner. A screen for type III effector proteins from <i>Pst</i> for their ability to interfere with proteasome activity revealed HopM1, HopAO1, HopA1, and HopG1 as putative proteasome inhibitors. Biochemical characterization of HopM1 by mass spectrometry indicates that HopM1 interacts with several E3 ubiquitin ligases and proteasome subunits. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong>s the hypothesis that HopM1 associates with the proteasome, leading to its inhibition. Thus, the proteasome is an essential component of pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity and SAR, which is targeted by multiple bacterial effectors.</p>

Convergence in morphology and masticatory function between the pharyngeal jaws of grass carp, <i>Ctenopharyngodon idella</i>, and oral jaws of amniote herbivores
<p>The cellulose-rich walls that protect plant cells are difficult to digest, and therefore mechanical food processing is a key aspect of herbivory across vertebrates. Cell walls are typically broken down by translation of flattened teeth in the occlusal plane (i.e. grinding) as part of a complex, rhythmic chewing stroke. The grass carp, <i>Ctenopharyngodon idella</i>, is a voracious, invasive herbivorous fish that relies solely on its pharyngeal teeth, located in the back of the throat, for mechanical processing of plant material. Here, we describe the musculoskeletal anatomy of the pharyngeal jaws of grass carp and use XROMM to quantify chewing kinematics and muscle strain. The pharyngeal jaws are suspended in a sling of 11 muscles and maintain no bony articulation with any other skeletal elements in the head. The jaws <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong> long, serrated teeth that are worn during use into flattened tooth cusps. Our kinematic data show that this wear is the result of the teeth being elevated into occlusion against the basioccipital process and keratinous chewing pad, not tooth-on-tooth occlusion. Pharyngeal jaw elevation results from large strains in the jaw elevator muscle, the levator arcus branchialis V, to drive a pulley-like mechanism that rotates the jaws about a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pivot</span></strong> point at the symphysis between the left and right pharyngeal jaws. These complex, rhythmic jaw rotations translate the teeth laterally across the chewing surface throughout the occlusion phase. The grass carp chewing system is strikingly similar in gross morphology and masticatory function to herbivorous chewing strategies in other vertebrates.</p>

Anterior knee pain and evidence of osteoarthritis of the patellofemoral joint should not be considered contraindications to mobile-bearing unicompartmental knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>It is not clear whether anterior knee pain and osteoarthritis   (OA) of the patellofemoral joint (PFJ) are contraindications to   medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA).

In 6% of cases there   was full thickness cartilage loss on the lateral side of the patella.   In these cases, the overall ten-year function and 15-year survival   was similar to those without cartilage loss; however they had slightly   more difficulty with descending stairs.

However,   if a patient does have full thickness cartilage loss on the lateral   side of the PFJ they may have a slight compromise in their ability   to descend stairs.

Periprosthetic femoral fractures and trying to avoid them
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Periprosthetic femoral fractures (PFF) following total hip arthroplasty   (THA) are devastating complications that are associated with functional   limitations and increased overall mortality. Although cementless   implants have been associated with an increased risk of PFF, the   precise contribution of implant geometry and design on the risk   of both intra-operative and post-operative PFF remains poorly investigated.   A systematic review was performed to aggregate all of the PFF literature   with specific attention to the femoral implant used.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A systematic search strategy of several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">journal</span></strong> databases and   recent proceedings from the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons   was performed.

Cementless implants, specifically those of single-wedge   and double-wedge, have the highest PFF rates in the literature,   with most investigations recommending against their use in older   patients with osteoporotic bone. This review illustrates the need   for registries and future PFF studies to record implant name and   information for future analysis. Furthermore, future biomechanical   investigations comparing modern implants are needed to clarify the   precise contribution of implant design to PFF risk.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B(1 Supple   A):50–9.</p></sec>

The quality of randomised controlled trials involving surgery from the hand to the elbow
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Our purpose was to determine the quality of current randomised   controlled trials (RCTs) in hand surgery using standardised metrics.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Based on five-year mean impact factors, we selected the six <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">journal</span></strong>s   that routinely publish studies of upper extremity surgery. Using   a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">journal</span></strong>-specific search query, 62 RCTs met our inclusion criteria.   Then three blinded reviewers used the Jadad and revised Coleman Methodology   Score (RCMS) to assess the quality of the manuscripts.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Based on the Jadad scale, 28 studies were of high quality and   34 were of low quality. Methodological deficiencies in poorly scoring   trials included the absence of rate of enrolment, no power analysis,   no description of withdrawal or dropout, and a failure to use validated   outcomes assessments with an independent investigator.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>A large number of RCTs in hand, wrist, and elbow surgery were   of suboptimal quality when judged against the RCMS and Jadad scales.   Even with a high level of evidence, study design and execution of   RCTs should be critically assessed. Methodological deficiencies   may introduce bias and lead to statistically underpowered studies.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:94–9.</p></sec>

Metaphyseal debonding of the Corail collarless cementless stem
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The Corail stem has good long-term results. After four years   of using this stem, we have detected a small group of patients who   have presented with symptomatic metaphyseal debonding. The aim of   this study was to quantify the incidence of this complication, to   delineate the characteristics of patients presenting with this complication   and to compare these patients with asymptomatic controls to determine   any important predisposing factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Of 855 Corail collarless cementless stems implanted for osteoarthritis,   18 presented with symptomatic metaphyseal debonding. A control group   of 74 randomly selected patients was assembled. Clinical and radiological   parameters were measured and a logistic regression model was created   to evaluate factors associated with metaphyseal debonding.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The prevalence of this complication was 2.1% in our series. In   the multivariable model, the presence of a Dorr B-type proximal   femur was associated with metaphyseal debonding (odds ratio (OR)   10.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.31 to 49.97, p = 0.002), as   was a body mass index > 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (OR 6.85, 95% CI 1.06   to 44.28, p = 0.04). Smaller stems and the use of a polyethylene   acetabular liner appeared to be protective when compared with metal   and ceramic setting hard-on-hard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>ings.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have described an uncommon but important mode of failure of   the Corail stem. Surgeons should be aware of this phenomenon; overweight   patients with Dorr B-type femurs and in whom hard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>ings are used   appear to be particularly at risk.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1435–41.</p></sec>

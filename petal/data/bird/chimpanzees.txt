Great apes anticipate that other individuals will act according to false beliefs
<p>Humans operate with a “theory of mind” with which they are able to understand that others’ actions are driven not by reality but by beliefs about reality, even when those beliefs are false. Although great <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ape</span></strong>s share with humans many social-cognitive skills, they have repeatedly failed experimental tests of such false-belief understanding. We use an anticipatory looking test (originally developed for human infants) to show that three species of great <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ape</span></strong>s reliably look in anticipation of an agent acting on a location where he falsely believes an object to be, even though the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ape</span></strong>s themselves know that the object is no longer there. Our results suggest that great <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ape</span></strong>s also operate, at least on an implicit level, with an understanding of false beliefs.</p>

New genus of extinct Holocene gibbon associated with humans in Imperial China
<p>Although all extant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ape</span></strong>s are threatened with extinction, there is no evidence for human-caused extinctions of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ape</span></strong>s or other primates in postglacial continental ecosystems, despite intensive anthropogenic pressures associated with biodiversity loss for millennia in many regions. Here, we report a new, globally extinct genus and species of gibbon, <i>Junzi imperialis</i>, described from a partial cranium and mandible from a ~2200- to 2300-year-old tomb from Shaanxi, China. <i>Junzi</i> can be differentiated from extant hylobatid genera and the extinct Quaternary gibbon <i>Bunopithecus</i> by using univariate and multivariate analyses of craniodental morphometric data. Primates are poorly represented in the Chinese Quaternary fossil record, but historical accounts suggest that China may have contained an endemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ape</span></strong> radiation that has only recently disappeared.</p>

High-resolution comparative analysis of great ape genomes
<p>Genetic studies of human evolution require high-quality contiguous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ape</span></strong> genome assemblies that are not guided by the human reference. We coupled long-read sequence assembly and full-length complementary DNA sequencing with a multiplatform scaffolding approach to produce ab initio chimpanzee and orangutan genome assemblies. By comparing these with two long-read de novo human genome assemblies and a gorilla genome assembly, we characterized lineage-specific and shared great <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ape</span></strong> genetic variation ranging from single– to mega–base pair–sized variants. We identified ~17,000 fixed human-specific structural variants identifying genic and putative regulatory changes that have emerged in humans since divergence from nonhuman <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ape</span></strong>s. Interestingly, these variants are enriched near genes that are down-regulated in human compared to chimpanzee cerebral organoids, particularly in cells analogous to radial glial neural progenitors.</p>

Ravens parallel great apes in flexible planning for tool-use and bartering
<p>The ability to flexibly plan for events outside of the current sensory scope is at the core of being human and is crucial to our everyday lives and society. Studies on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ape</span></strong>s have sh<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ape</span></strong>d a belief that this ability evolved within the hominid lineage. Corvids, however, have shown evidence of planning their food hoarding, although this has been suggested to reflect a specific caching adaptation rather than domain-general planning. Here, we show that ravens plan for events unrelated to caching—tool-use and bartering—with delays of up to 17 hours, exert self-control, and consider temporal distance to future events. Their performance parallels that seen in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ape</span></strong>s and suggests that planning evolved independently in corvids, which opens new avenues for the study of cognitive evolution.</p>

Mosaic Morphology in the Thorax of <i>Australopithecus sediba</i>
<p>The sh<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ape</span></strong> of the thorax of early hominins has been a point of contention for more than 30 years. Owing to the generally fragmentary nature of fossil hominin ribs, few specimens have been recovered that have rib remains complete enough to allow accurate reassembly of thoracic sh<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ape</span></strong>, thus leaving open the question of when the cylindrical-sh<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ape</span></strong>d chest of humans and their immediate ancestors evolved. The ribs of <i>Australopithecus sediba</i> exhibit a mediolaterally narrow, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ape</span></strong>-like upper thoracic sh<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ape</span></strong>, which is unlike the broad upper thorax of <i>Homo</i> that has been related to the locomotor pattern of endurance walking and running. The lower thorax, however, appears less laterally flared than that of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ape</span></strong>s and more closely approximates the morphology found in humans.</p>

Molecular and cellular reorganization of neural circuits in the human lineage
<p>To better understand the molecular and cellular differences in brain organization between human and nonhuman primates, we performed transcriptome sequencing of 16 regions of adult human, chimpanzee, and macaque brains. Integration with human single-cell transcriptomic data revealed global, regional, and cell-type–specific species expression differences in genes representing distinct functional categories. We validated and further characterized the human specificity of genes enriched in distinct cell types through histological and functional analyses, including rare subpallial-derived interneurons expressing dopamine biosynthesis genes enriched in the human striatum and absent in the nonhuman African <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ape</span></strong> neocortex. Our integrated analysis of the generated data revealed diverse molecular and cellular features of the phylogenetic reorganization of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">human b</span></strong>rain across multiple levels, with relevance for brain function and disease.</p>

The Upper Limb of <i>Australopithecus sediba</i>
<p>The evolution of the human upper limb involved a change in function from its use for both locomotion and prehension (as in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ape</span></strong>s) to a predominantly prehensile and manipulative role. Well-preserved forelimb remains of 1.98-million-year-old <i>Australopithecus sediba</i> from Malapa, South Africa, contribute to our understanding of this evolutionary transition. Whereas other aspects of their postcranial anatomy evince mosaic combinations of primitive (australopith-like) and derived (<i>Homo</i>-like) features, the upper limbs (excluding the hand and wrist) of the Malapa hominins are predominantly primitive and suggest the retention of substantial climbing and suspensory ability. The use of the forelimb primarily for prehension and manipulation appears to arise later, likely with the emergence of <i>Homo erectus</i>.</p>

Natural Selection in the Great Apes
<p>Natural selection is crucial for the adaptation of populations to their environments. Here, we present the first global study of natural selection in the <i>Hominidae</i> (humans and great <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ape</span></strong>s) based on genome-wide information from population samples representing all extant species (including most subspecies). Combining several neutrality tests we create a multi-species map of signatures of natural selection covering all major types of natural selection. We find that the estimated efficiency of both purifying and positive selection varies between species and is significantly correlated with their long-term effective population size. Thus, even the modest differences in population size among the closely related <i>Hominidae</i> lineages have resulted in differences in their ability to remove deleterious alleles and to adapt to changing environments. Most signatures of balancing and positive selection are species-specific, with signatures of balancing selection more often being shared among species. We also identify loci with evidence of positive selection across several lineages. Notably, we detect signatures of positive selection in several genes related to brain function, anatomy, diet and immune processes. Our results contribute to a better understanding of human evolution by putting the evidence of natural selection in humans within its larger evolutionary context.

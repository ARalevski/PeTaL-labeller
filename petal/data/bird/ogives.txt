Unsatisfactory outcomes following unicompartmental knee arthroplasty in patients with partial thickness cartilage loss
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>While medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is indicated   for patients with full-thickness cartilage loss, it is occasionally   used to treat those with partial-thickness loss. The aim of this   study was to investigate the five-year outcomes in a consecutive   series of UKAs used in patients with partial thickness cartilage   loss in the medial compartment of the knee.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between 2002 and 2014, 94 consecutive UKAs were undertaken in   90 patients with partial thickness cartilage loss and followed up   independently for a mean of six years (1 to 13). These patients   had partial thickness cartilage loss either on both femur and tibia   (13 knees), or on either the femur or the tibia, with full thickness   loss on the other surface of the joint (18 and 63 knees respectively).   Using propensity score analysis, these patients were matched 1:2 based   on age, gender and pre-operative Oxford Knee Score (OKS) with knees   with full thickness loss on both the femur and tibia. The functional   outcomes, implant survival and incidence of re-operations were assessed   at one, two and five years post-operatively. A subgroup of 36 knees   in 36 patients with partial thickness cartilage loss, who had pre-operative   MRI scans, was assessed to identify whether there were any factors   identified on MRI that predicted the outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Knees with partial thickness cartilage loss had significantly   worse functional outcomes at one, two and five years post-operatively   compared with those with full thickness loss. A quarter of knees   with partial thickness loss had a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fair</span></strong> or poor result and a fifth   failed to achieve a clinically significant improvement in OKS from   a baseline of four points or more; double that seen in knees with   full thickness loss. Whilst there was no difference in implant survival between   the groups, the rate of re-operation in knees with partial thickness   loss was three times higher. Most of the re-operations (three-quarters),   were arthroscopies for persistent pain.</p><p>Compared with those achieving good or excellent outcomes, patients   with partial thickness cartilage loss who achieved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fair</span></strong> or poor   outcomes were younger and had worse pre-operative functional scores.   However, there were no other differences in the baseline demographics.   MRI findings of full thickness cartilage loss, subchondral oedema,   synovitis or effusion did not provide additional prognostic information.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Medial UKA should be reserved for patients with full thickness   cartilage loss on both the femur and tibia. Whilst some patients   with partial thickness loss achieve a good result we cannot currently   identify which these will be and in this situation MRI is unhelpful   and misleading.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:475–82.</p></sec>

The challenge of Monteggia-like lesions of the elbow
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this retrospective multicentre study was to evaluate   mid-term results of the operative treatment of Monteggia-like lesions   and to determine the prognostic factors that influence the clinical   and radiological outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 46 patients (27 women and 19 men), with a mean age   of 57.7 years (18 to 84) who had sustained a Monteggia-like lesion   were followed up clinically and radiologically after surgical treatment.   The Mayo Modified Wrist Score (MMWS), Mayo Elbow Performance Score   (MEPS), Broberg and Morrey Score, and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder   and Hand (DASH) score were used for evaluation at a mean of 65 months   (27 to 111) postoperatively. All ulnar fractures were stabilized   using a proximally contoured or precontoured locking compression   plate. Mason type I fractures of the radial head were treated conservatively, type   II fractures were treated with reconstruction, and type III fractures   with arthroplasty. All Morrey type II and III fractures of the coronoid   process was stabilized using lag screws.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Good results were found for the MMWS, with a mean of 88.4 (40 to   100). There were 29 excellent results (63%), nine good (20%), seven   satisfactory (15%), and one poor (2%). Excellent results were obtained   for the MEPS, with a mean of 90.7 (70 to 100): 31 excellent results   (68%), 13 good (28%), and two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fair</span></strong> (4%). Good results were also   found for the functional rating index of Broberg and Morrey, with   a mean score of 86.6 (57 to 100). There were 16 excellent results   (35%), 22 good (48%), six <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fair</span></strong> (13%), and two poor (4%). The mean DASH   score was 15.1 (0 to 55.8). Two patients had delayed wound healing;   four patients had nonunion requiring bone grafting. One patient   had asymptomatic loosening of the radial head prosthesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Monteggia-like lesions are rare. With correct identification,   classification, and understanding using CT scans followed by appropriate   surgical treatment that addresses all components of the injury,   good to excellent mid-term results can be achieved.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:212–18.</p></sec>

A designed heme-[4Fe-4S] metalloenzyme catalyzes sulfite reduction like the native enzyme
<p>Multielectron redox reactions often require multicofactor metalloenzymes to facilitate coupled electron and proton movement, but it is challenging to design artificial enzymes to catalyze these important reactions, owing to their structural and functional complexity. We report a designed heteronuclear heme-[4Fe-4S] cofactor in cytochrome <i>c</i> peroxidase as a structural and functional model of the enzyme sulfite reductase. The initial model exhibits spectroscopic and ligand-binding properties of the native enzyme, and sulfite reduction activity was improved—through rational tuning of the secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sphere</span></strong> interactions around the [4Fe-4S] and the substrate-binding sites—to be close to that of the native enzyme. By offering insight into the requirements for a demanding six-electron, seven-proton reaction that has so far eluded synthetic catalysts, this study provides strategies for designing highly functional multicofactor artificial enzymes.</p>

Handedness in shearing auxetics creates rigid and compliant structures
<p>In nature, repeated base units produce handed structures that selectively bond to make rigid or compliant materials. Auxetic tilings are scale-independent frameworks made from repeated unit cells that expand under tension. We discovered how to produce handedness in auxetic unit cells that shear as they expand by changing the symmetries and alignments of auxetic tilings. Using the symmetry and alignment rules that we developed, we made handed shearing auxetics that tile planes, cylinders, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sphere</span></strong>s. By compositing the handed shearing auxetics in a manner inspired by keratin and collagen, we produce both compliant structures that expand while twisting and deployable structures that can rigidly lock. This work opens up new possibilities in designing chemical frameworks, medical devices like stents, robotic systems, and deployable engineering structures.</p>

Nanofluidic rocking Brownian motors
<p>Control and transport of nanoscale objects in fluids is challenging because of the unfavorable scaling of most interaction mechanisms to small length scales. We designed energy landscapes for nanoparticles by accurately shaping the geometry of a nanofluidic slit and exploiting the electrostatic interaction between like-charged particles and walls. Directed transport was performed by combining asymmetric potentials with an oscillating electric field to achieve a rocking Brownian motor. Using gold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sphere</span></strong>s 60 nanometers in diameter, we investigated the physics of the motor with high spatiotemporal resolution, enabling a parameter-free comparison with theory. We fabricated a sorting device that separates 60- and 100-nanometer particles in opposing directions within seconds. Modeling suggests that the device separates particles with a radial difference of 1 nanometer.</p>

A bioinspired iron catalyst for nitrate and perchlorate reduction
<p>Nitrate and perchlorate have considerable use in technology, synthetic materials, and agriculture; as a result, they have become pervasive water pollutants. Industrial strategies to chemically reduce these oxyanions often require the use of harsh conditions, but microorganisms can efficiently reduce them enzymatically. We developed an iron catalyst inspired by the active sites of nitrate reductase and (per)chlorate reductase enzymes. The catalyst features a secondary coordination <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sphere</span></strong> that aids in oxyanion deoxygenation. Upon reduction of the oxyanions, an iron(III)-oxo is formed, which in the presence of protons and electrons regenerates the catalyst and releases water.</p>

Light Sheet Microscopy Imaging of Light Absorption and Photosynthesis Distribution in Plant Tissue
<p>In vivo variable chlorophyll fluorescence measurements of photosystem II (PSII) quantum yields in optically dense systems are complicated by steep tissue light gradients due to scattering and absorption. Consequently, externally measured effective PSII quantum yields may be composed of signals derived from cells differentially exposed to actinic light, where cells located deeper inside tissues receive lower irradiance than cells closer to the surface and can display distinct photophysiological status. We demonstrate how measured distributions of PSII quantum yields in plant tissue change under natural tissue light gradients as compared with conventionally measured quantum yields with even exposure to actinic light. This was achieved by applying actinic irradiance perpendicular to one side of thallus cross sections of the aquatic macrophyte <i>Fucus vesiculosus</i> with laser light sheets of defined spectral composition, while imaging variable chlorophyll fluorescence from cross sections with a microscope-mounted pulse amplitude-modulated imaging system. We show that quantum yields are highly affected by light gradients and that traditional surface-based variable chlorophyll fluorescence measurements result in substantial underestimations and/or overestimations, depending on incident actinic irradiance. We present a method for using chlorophyll fluorescence profiles in combination with integrating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sphere</span></strong> measurements of reflectance and transmittance to calculate depth-resolved photon absorption profiles, which can be used to correct apparent PSII electron transport rates to photons absorbed by PSII. Absorption profiles of the investigated aquatic macrophyte were different in shape from what is typically observed in terrestrial leaves, and based on this finding, we discuss strategies for optimizing photon absorption via modulation of the structural organization of phytoelements according to in situ light environments.</p>

Molecular Adaptation during a Rapid Adaptive Radiation
<p>“Explosive” adaptive radiations on islands remain one of the most puzzling evolutionary phenomena and the evolutionary genetic processes behind such radiations remain unclear. Rapid morphological and ecological evolution during island radiations suggests that many genes may be under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fair</span></strong>ly strong selection, although this remains untested. Here, we report that during a rapid recent diversification in the Hawaiian endemic plant genus <i>Schiedea</i> (<i>Caryophyllaceae</i>), 5 in 36 studied genes evolved under positive selection. Positively selected genes are involved in defence mechanisms, photosynthesis, and reproduction. Comparison with eight mainland plant groups demonstrates both the relaxation of purifying selection and more widespread positive selection in Hawaiian <i>Schiedea</i>. This provides compelling evidence that adaptive evolution of protein-coding genes may play a significant role during island adaptive radiations.</p>

Building Phylogenetic Trees from Molecular Data with MEGA
<p>Phylogenetic analysis is sometimes regarded as being an intimidating, complex process that requires expertise and years of experience. In fact, it is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fair</span></strong>ly straightforward process that can be learned quickly and applied effectively. This Protocol describes the several steps required to produce a phylogenetic tree from molecular data for novices. In the example illustrated here, the program MEGA is used to implement all those steps, thereby eliminating the need to learn several programs, and to deal with multiple file formats from one step to another (Tamura K, Peterson D, Peterson N, Stecher G, Nei M, Kumar S. 2011. MEGA5: molecular evolutionary genetics analysis using maximum likelihood, evolutionary distance, and maximum parsimony methods. <i>Mol Biol Evol</i>. 28:2731–2739). The first step, identification of a set of homologous sequences and downloading those sequences, is implemented by MEGA's own browser built on top of the Google Chrome toolkit. For the second step, alignment of those sequences, MEGA offers two different algorithms: ClustalW and MUSCLE. For the third step, construction of a phylogenetic tree from the aligned sequences, MEGA offers many different methods. Here we illustrate the maximum likelihood method, beginning with MEGA's Models feature, which permits selecting the most suitable substitution model. Finally, MEGA provides a powerful and flexible interface for the final step, actually drawing the tree for publication. Here a step-by-step protocol is presented in sufficient detail to allow a novice to start with a sequence of interest and to build a publication-quality tree illustrating the evolution of an appropriate set of homologs of that sequence. MEGA is available for use on PCs and Macs from <ext-link>www.megasoftware.net</ext-link>.</p>

Moving without a purpose: an experimental study of swarm guidance in the Western honey bee, <i>Apis mellifera</i>
<p>During reproductive swarming, honey bee scouts perform two very important functions. Firstly, they find new nesting locations and return to the swarm cluster to communicate their discoveries. Secondly, once the swarm is ready to depart, informed scout bees act as guides, leading the swarm to its final destination. We have previously hypothesised that the two processes, selecting a new nest site and swarm guidance, are tightly linked in honey bees. When swarms can be <i>laissez <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fair</span></strong>e</i> about where they nest, reaching directional consensus prior to lift off seems unnecessary. If, in contrast, it is essential that the swarm reaches a precise location, either directional consensus must be near unanimous prior to swarm departure or only a select subgroup of the scouts guide the swarm. Here, we tested experimentally whether directional consensus is necessary for the successful guidance of swarms of the Western honey bee <i>Apis mellifera</i> by forcing swarms into the air prior to the completion of the decision-making process. Our results show that swarms were unable to guide themselves prior to the swarm reaching the pre-flight buzzing phase of the decision-making process, even when directional consensus was high. We therefore suggest that not all scouts involved in the decision-making process attempt to guide the swarm.</p>

Experimental analysis of the liquid-feeding mechanism of the butterfly <i>Pieris rapae</i>
<p>The butterfly <i>Pieirs rapae</i> drinks liquid using a long proboscis. A high pressure gradient is induced in the proboscis when cibarial pump muscles contract. However, liquid feeding through the long proboscis poses a disadvantage of high flow resistance. Hence, butterflies may possess special features to compensate for this disadvantage and succeed in foraging. The main objective of this study is to analyze the liquid-feeding mechanism of butterflies. The systaltic motion of the cibarial pump organ was visualized using the synchrotron X-ray imaging technique. In addition, an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ellipsoid</span></strong>al pump model was established based on synchrotron X-ray micro-computed tomography. To determine the relationship between the cyclic variation of the pump volume and the liquid-feeding flow, velocity fields of the intake flow at the tip of the proboscis were measured using micro-particle image velocimetry. Reynolds and Womersley numbers of liquid-feeding flow in the proboscis were ~1.40 and 0.129, respectively. The liquid-feeding flow could be characterized as a quasi-steady state laminar flow. Considering these results, we analyzed the dimensions of the feeding apparatus on the basis of minimum energy consumption during the liquid-feeding process. The relationship between the proboscis and the cibarial pump was determined when minimum energy consumption occurs. As a result, the volume of the cibarial pump is proportional to the cube of the radius of the proboscis. It seems that the liquid-feeding system of butterflies and other long-proboscid insects follow the cube relationship. The present results provide insights into the feeding strategies of liquid-feeding butterflies.</p>

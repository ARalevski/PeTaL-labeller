Thresholds for Ambulatory Blood Pressure Among African Americans in the Jackson Heart Study
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring is the reference standard for out-of-clinic BP measurement. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong>s for identifying ambulatory hypertension (daytime systolic BP [SBP]/diastolic BP [DBP] ≥135/85 mm Hg, 24-hour SBP/DBP ≥130/80 mm Hg, and nighttime SBP/DBP ≥120/70 mm Hg) have been derived from European, Asian, and South American populations. We determined BP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong>s for ambulatory hypertension in a US population-based sample of African American adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We analyzed data from the Jackson Heart Study, a population-based cohort study comprised exclusively of African American adults (n=5306). Analyses were restricted to 1016 participants who completed ambulatory BP monitoring at baseline in 2000 to 2004. Mean SBP and DBP levels were calculated for daytime (10:00 am–8:00 pm), 24-hour (all available readings), and nighttime (midnight–6:00 am) periods, separately. Daytime, 24-hour, and nighttime BP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong>s for ambulatory hypertension were identified using regression- and outcome-derived approaches. The composite of a cardiovascular disease or an all-cause mortality event was used in the outcome-derived approach. For this latter approach, BP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong>s were identified only for SBP because clinic DBP was not associated with the outcome. Analyses were stratified by antihypertensive medication use.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among participants not taking antihypertensive medication, the regression-derived <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong>s for daytime, 24-hour, and nighttime SBP/DBP corresponding to clinic SBP/DBP of 140/90 mm Hg were 134/85 mm Hg, 130/81 mm Hg, and 123/73 mm Hg, respectively. The outcome-derived <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong>s for daytime, 24-hour, and nighttime SBP corresponding to a clinic SBP ≥140 mm Hg were 138 mm Hg, 134 mm Hg, and 129 mm Hg, respectively.

Topological insulator laser: Theory
<p>Topological insulators are phases of matter characterized by topological edge states that propagate in a unidirectional manner that is robust to imperfections and disorder. These attributes make topological insulator systems ideal candidates for enabling applications in quantum computation and spintronics. We propose a concept that exploits topological effects in a unique way: the topological insulator <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong>. These are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong>s whose lasing mode exhibits topologically protected transport without magnetic fields. The underlying topological properties lead to a highly efficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong>, robust to defects and disorder, with single-mode lasing even at very high gain values. The topological insulator <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> alters current understanding of the interplay between disorder and lasing, and at the same time opens exciting possibilities in topological physics, such as topologically protected transport in systems with gain. On the technological side, the topological insulator <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> provides a route to arrays of semiconductor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong>s that operate as one single-mode high-power <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> coupled efficiently into an output port.</p>

Spatiotemporal mode-locking in multimode fiber lasers
<p>A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> is based on the electromagnetic modes of its resonator, which provides the feedback required for oscillation. Enormous progress has been made toward controlling the interactions of longitudinal modes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong>s with a single transverse mode. For example, the field of ultrafast science has been built on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong>s that lock many longitudinal modes together to form ultrashort light pulses. However, coherent superposition of longitudinal and transverse modes in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> has received little attention. We show that modal and chromatic dispersions in fiber <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong>s can be counteracted by strong spatial and spectral filtering. This allows locking of multiple transverse and longitudinal modes to create ultrashort pulses with a variety of spatiotemporal profiles. Multimode fiber <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong>s thus open new directions in studies of nonlinear wave propagation and capabilities for applications.</p>

Keyhole threshold and morphology in laser melting revealed by ultrahigh-speed x-ray imaging
<p>We used ultrahigh-speed synchrotron x-ray imaging to quantify the phenomenon of vapor depressions (also known as keyholes) during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> melting of metals as practiced in additive manufacturing. Although expected from welding and inferred from postmortem cross sections of fusion zones, the direct visualization of the keyhole morphology and dynamics with high-energy x-rays shows that (i) keyholes are present across the range of power and scanning velocity used in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> powder bed fusion; (ii) there is a well-defined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong> from conduction mode to keyhole based on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> power density; and (iii) the transition follows the sequence of vaporization, depression of the liquid surface, instability, and then deep keyhole formation. These and other aspects provide a physical basis for three-dimensional printing in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> powder bed machines.</p>

Vernier spectrometer using counterpropagating soliton microcombs
<p>Determination of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> frequency with high resolution under continuous and abrupt tuning conditions is important for sensing, spectroscopy, and communications. We show that a single microresonator provides rapid and broadband measurement of optical frequencies with a relative frequency precision comparable to that of conventional dual-frequency comb systems. Dual-locked counterpropagating solitons having slightly different repetition rates were used to implement a vernier spectrometer, which enabled characterization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> tuning rates as high as 10 terahertz per second, broadly step-tuned <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong>s, multiline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> spectra, and molecular absorption lines. Besides providing a considerable technical simplification through the dual-locked solitons and enhanced capability for measurement of arbitrarily tuned sources, our results reveal possibilities for chip-scale spectrometers that exceed the performance of tabletop grating and interferometer-based devices.</p>

A silicon Brillouin laser
<p>Brillouin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> oscillators offer powerful and flexible dynamics as the basis for mode-locked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong>s, microwave oscillators, and optical gyroscopes in a variety of optical systems. However, Brillouin interactions are markedly weak in conventional silicon photonic waveguides, stifling progress toward silicon-based Brillouin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong>s. The recent advent of hybrid photonic-phononic waveguides has revealed Brillouin interactions to be one of the strongest and most tailorable nonlinearities in silicon. In this study, we have harnessed these engineered nonlinearities to demonstrate Brillouin lasing in silicon. Moreover, we show that this silicon-based Brillouin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> enters a regime of dynamics in which optical self-oscillation produces phonon linewidth narrowing. Our results provide a platform to develop a range of applications for monolithic integration within silicon photonic circuits.</p>

Soliton microcomb range measurement
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong>-based range measurement systems are important in many application areas, including autonomous vehicles, robotics, manufacturing, formation flying of satellites, and basic science. Coherent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> ranging systems using dual-frequency combs provide an unprecedented combination of long range, high precision, and fast update rate. We report dual-comb distance measurement using chip-based soliton microcombs. A single pump <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> was used to generate dual-frequency combs within a single microresonator as counterpropagating solitons. We demonstrated time-of-flight measurement with 200-nanometer precision at an averaging time of 500 milliseconds within a range ambiguity of 16 millimeters. Measurements at distances up to 25 meters with much lower precision were also performed. Our chip-based source is an important step toward miniature dual-comb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> ranging systems that are suitable for photonic integration.</p>

Bumblebees are not deterred by ecologically relevant concentrations of nectar toxins
<p>Bees visit flowers to collect nectar and pollen that contain nutrients and simultaneously facilitate plant sexual reproduction. Paradoxically, nectar produced to attract pollinators often contains deterrent or toxic plant compounds associated with herbivore defence. The functional significance of these nectar toxins is not fully understood, but they may have a negative impact on pollinator behaviour and health, and, ultimately, plant pollination. This study investigates whether a generalist bumblebee, <i>Bombus terrestris</i>, can detect naturally occurring concentrations of nectar toxins. Using paired-choice experiments, we identified deterrence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong>s for five compounds found in the nectar of bee-pollinated plants: quinine, caffeine, nicotine, amygdalin and grayanotoxin. The deterrence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong> was determined when bumblebees significantly preferred a sucrose solution over a sucrose solution containing the compound. Bumblebees had the lowest deterrence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong> for the alkaloid quinine (0.01 mmol l<sup>−1</sup>); all other compounds had higher deterrence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong>s, above the natural concentration range in floral nectar. Our data, combined with previous work using honeybees, suggest that generalist bee species have poor acuity for the detection of nectar toxins. The fact that bees do not avoid nectar-relevant concentrations of these compounds likely indicates that it is difficult for them to learn to associate floral traits with the presence of toxins, thus maintaining this trait in plant populations.</p>

Supersymmetric laser arrays
<p>Scaling up the radiance of coupled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> arrays has been a long-standing challenge in photonics. In this study, we demonstrate that notions from supersymmetry—a theoretical framework developed in high-energy physics—can be strategically used in optics to address this problem. In this regard, a supersymmetric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> array is realized that is capable of emitting exclusively in its fundamental transverse mode in a stable manner. Our results not only pave the way toward devising new schemes for scaling up radiance in integrated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong>s, but also, on a more fundamental level, could shed light on the intriguing synergy between non-Hermiticity and supersymmetry.</p>

Suppressing spatiotemporal lasing instabilities with wave-chaotic microcavities
<p>Spatiotemporal instabilities are widespread phenomena resulting from complexity and nonlinearity. In broad-area edge-emitting semiconductor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong>s, the nonlinear interactions of multiple spatial modes with the active medium can result in filamentation and spatiotemporal chaos. These instabilities degrade the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> performance and are extremely challenging to control. We demonstrate a powerful approach to suppress spatiotemporal instabilities using wave-chaotic or disordered cavities. The interference of many propagating waves with random phases in such cavities disrupts the formation of self-organized structures such as filaments, resulting in stable lasing dynamics. Our method provides a general and robust scheme to prevent the formation and growth of nonlinear instabilities for a large variety of high-power <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong>s.</p>

Building one molecule from a reservoir of two atoms
<p>Chemical reactions typically proceed via stochastic encounters between reactants. Going beyond this paradigm, we combined exactly two atoms in a single, controlled reaction. The experimental apparatus traps two individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong>-cooled atoms [one sodium (Na) and one cesium (Cs)] in separate optical tweezers and then merges them into one optical dipole trap. Subsequently, photoassociation forms an excited-state NaCs molecule. The discovery of previously unseen resonances near the molecular dissociation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong> and measurement of collision rates are enabled by the tightly trapped ultracold sample of atoms. As <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong>-cooling and trapping capabilities are extended to more elements, the technique will enable the study of more diverse, and eventually more complex, molecules in an isolated environment, as well as synthesis of designer molecules for qubits.</p>

Scaling pain threshold with microRNAs
<p>Pain is not something universally enjoyed, especially chronic pain involving nerve damage, referred to as neuropathic pain (<i>1</i>). Pain perception can be modulated in a variety of ways—for example, by focusing attention on the painful stimulus. On page 1168 of this issue, Peng <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) report that pain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong> in dorsal root ganglion neurons (DRG), which relay peripheral sensory information to the central nervous system, can be modulated by mechanisms involving a specific cluster of microRNAs (miRNAs). Remarkably, the same cluster also regulates the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong> of neuropathic pain in DRG neurons that would not be involved in pain under normal conditions. The study provides important new insights into molecular mechanisms that control pain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong>, both in normal and pathological conditions.</p>

The limits of applicability of the sound exposure level (SEL) metric to temporal threshold shifts (TTS) in beluga whales, <i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>
<p>The influence of fatiguing sound level and duration on post-exposure temporary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong> shift (TTS) was investigated in two beluga whales (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>). The fatiguing sound was half-octave noise with a center frequency of 22.5 kHz. TTS was measured at a test frequency of 32 kHz. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong>s were measured by recording rhythmic evoked potentials (the envelope following response) to a test series of short (eight cycles) tone pips with a pip rate of 1000 s<sup>−1</sup>. TTS increased approximately proportionally to the dB measure of both sound pressure (sound pressure level, SPL) and duration of the fatiguing noise, as a product of these two variables. In particular, when the noise parameters varied in a manner that maintained the product of squared sound pressure and time (sound exposure level, SEL, which is equivalent to the overall noise energy) at a constant level, TTS was not constant. Keeping SEL constant, the highest TTS appeared at an intermediate ratio of SPL to sound duration and decreased at both higher and lower ratios. Multiplication (SPL multiplied by log duration) better described the experimental data than an equal-energy (equal SEL) model. The use of SEL as a sole universal metric may result in an implausible assessment of the impact of a fatiguing sound on hearing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong>s in odontocetes, including under-evaluation of potential risks.</p>

Hearing threshold shifts and recovery after noise exposure in beluga whales, <i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>
<p>Temporary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong> shift (TTS) after loud noise exposure was investigated in a male and a female beluga whale (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong>s were evaluated using the evoked-potential technique, which allowed for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong> tracing with a resolution of ~1 min. The fatiguing noise had a 0.5 octave bandwidth, with center frequencies ranging from 11.2 to 90 kHz, a level of 165 dB re. 1 μPa and exposure durations from 1 to 30 min. The effects of the noise were tested at probe frequencies ranging from −0.5 to +1.5 octaves relative to the noise center frequency. The effect was estimated in terms of both immediate (1.5 min) post-exposure TTS and recovery duration. The highest TTS with the longest recovery duration was produced by noises of lower frequencies (11.2 and 22.5 kHz) and appeared at a test frequency of +0.5 octave. At higher noise frequencies (45 and 90 kHz), the TTS decreased. The TTS effect gradually increased with prolonged exposures ranging from 1 to 30 min. There was a considerable TTS difference between the two subjects.</p>

Redefining near-unity luminescence in quantum dots with photothermal threshold quantum yield
<p>A variety of optical applications rely on the absorption and reemission of light. The quantum yield of this process often plays an essential role. When the quantum yield deviates from unity by significantly less than 1%, applications such as luminescent concentrators and optical refrigerators become possible. To evaluate such high performance, we develop a measurement technique for luminescence efficiency with sufficient accuracy below one part per thousand. Photothermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong> quantum yield is based on the quantization of light to minimize overall measurement uncertainty. This technique is used to guide a procedure capable of making ensembles of near-unity emitting cadmium selenide/cadmium sulfide (CdSe/CdS) core-shell quantum dots. We obtain a photothermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong> quantum yield luminescence efficiency of 99.6 ± 0.2%, indicating nearly complete suppression of nonradiative decay channels.</p>

Laser cooling of ions in a neutral plasma
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> cooling of a neutral plasma is a challenging task because of the high temperatures typically associated with the plasma state. By using an ultracold neutral plasma created by photoionization of an ultracold atomic gas, we avoid this obstacle and demonstrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> cooling of ions in a neutral plasma. After 135 microseconds of cooling, we observed a reduction in ion temperature by up to a factor of four, with the temperature reaching as low as 50(4) millikelvin. This pushes laboratory studies of neutral plasmas deeper into the strongly coupled regime, beyond the limits of validity of current kinetic theories for calculating transport properties. The same optical forces also retard the plasma expansion, opening avenues for neutral-plasma confinement and manipulation.</p>

Light amplification by seeded Kerr instability
<p>Amplification of femtosecond <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> pulses typically requires a lasing medium or a nonlinear crystal.

High-harmonic generation in graphene enhanced by elliptically polarized light excitation
<p>The electronic properties of graphene can give rise to a range of nonlinear optical responses. One of the most desirable nonlinear optical processes is high-harmonic generation (HHG) originating from coherent electron motion induced by an intense light field. Here, we report on the observation of up to ninth-order harmonics in graphene excited by mid-infrared <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> pulses at room temperature. The HHG in graphene is enhanced by an elliptically polarized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> excitation, and the resultant harmonic radiation has a particular polarization. The observed ellipticity dependence is reproduced by a fully quantum mechanical treatment of HHG in solids. The zero-gap nature causes the unique properties of HHG in graphene, and our findings open up the possibility of investigating strong-field and ultrafast dynamics and nonlinear behavior of massless Dirac fermions.</p>

In B cells, analysis of single-cell responses has shown that the stimulation of the B cell receptor causes a “digital” all-or-none response of cells to a stimulus. <bold>Shinohara <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 760) used a combination of mathematical modeling and experiments to show that this property of the system results from the presence of a positive feedback loop among the signaling components activated in response to the receptor. Studies in cells expressing mutated signaling components resolved key phosphorylation events that provide the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong> responses observed and identified potential molecular modifications that might modify the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong> or other aspects of the dynamic response.</p></sec>

Asexual Female Gametogenesis Involves Contact with a Sexually-Fated Megaspore in Apomictic <i>Hieracium</i>
<p>Apomixis results in asexual seed formation where progeny are identical to the maternal plant. In ovules of apomictic species of the <i>Hieracium</i> subgenus <i>Pilosella</i>, meiosis of the megaspore mother cell generates four megaspores. Aposporous initial (AI) cells form during meiosis in most ovules. The sexual pathway terminates during functional megaspore (FM) differentiation, when an enlarged AI undergoes mitosis to form an aposporous female gametophyte. Then, the mitotically programmed FM dies along with the three other megaspores by unknown mechanisms. Transcriptomes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong>-dissected AIs, ovule cells, and ovaries from apomicts and AI-deficient mutants were analyzed to understand the pathways involved. The steps leading to AI mitosis and sexual pathway termination were determined using antibodies against arabinogalactan protein epitopes found to mark both sexual and aposporous female gametophyte lineages at inception. At most, four AIs differentiated near developing megaspores. The first expanding AI cell to contact the FM formed a functional AI that underwent mitosis soon after megaspore degeneration. Transcriptome analyses indicated that the enlarged, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong>-captured AIs were arrested in the S/G2 phase of the cell cycle and were metabolically active. Further comparisons with AI-deficient mutants showed that AIs were enriched in transcripts encoding homologs of genes involved in, and potentially antagonistic to, known FM specification pathways. We propose that AI and FM cell contact provides cues required for AI mitosis and megaspore degeneration. Specific candidates to further interrogate AI-FM interactions were identified here and include <i>Hieracium</i> arabinogalactan protein family genes.</p>

Physiological basis of starvation resistance in <i>Drosophila leontia</i>: analysis of sexual dimorphism
<p>Geographically varying starvation stress has often been considered as a natural selector that constrains between-population differences for starvation resistance (SR) in <i>Drosophila</i> species. On the Indian subcontinent, a dozen <i>Drosophila</i> species have shown clinal variations in SR across latitude, but the evolved physiological basis of such contrasting adaptations is largely unknown. In the present study, I untangled the physiological basis of sex-specific as well as between-population divergence for SR in <i>D. leontia</i>, collected across a latitudinal transect of the Indian subcontinent (11°45′–31°19′N). Secondly, I tested the assumptions that hardening to starvation stress facilitates an increased survival under subsequent lethal levels of starvation, and such plastic effects differ between the sexes. I observed several interesting results. In contrast to a steeper cline of starvation-related traits with latitude in females, a shallower gradient was observed for males. Females stored higher (~1.3-fold) dry-mass-specific levels of body lipids and glycogen contents, and utilized these both of these energy resources under starvation stress, whereas the starved males metabolized only body lipids as a source of energy. Conversely, the rate of body lipid utilization and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong> need were considerably higher in females as compared with males. Between-population differences were significant for storage levels of energy reserves only, but not for other avenues (rate of metabolite utilization and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong> need) of SR for both sexes. These findings indicate that multiple pathways shape the physiological basis of sexual dimorphism for SR in <i>D. leontia</i>. Further, single or multiple bouts of starvation hardening conferred an increased longevity (~4–9 h; <i>P</i><0.001) under subsequent lethal levels of starvation stress for females only, and such plastic responses were consistent with a decrease in rate of metabolite utilization. Nevertheless, between-population effects were non-significant for absolute hardening capacity (AHC=<i>K</i><sub>SR</sub>–C). Altogether, these findings suggest that similar evolutionary constraints have resulted in divergent genetic as well as plastic responses to evolve adaptations under starvation stress, and account for the observed sexual dimorphism for basal SR in <i>D. leontia</i>.</p>

An acquired distaste: sugar discrimination by the larval parasitoid <i>Microplitis croceipes</i> (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) is affected by prior sugar exposure
<p>We examined gustatory responses of the larval parasitoid <i>Microplitis croceipes</i> to determine whether the adults discriminate among common sugars, including fructose, glucose, maltose and sucrose, found in plants. When given single sugar solutions of sucrose, glucose, fructose and maltose at concentrations of 0.008–2.0 mol l<sup>−1</sup>, the estimated concentrations at which 50% of wasps initiated feeding ranged between 0.054 and 0.085 mol l<sup>−1</sup> for sucrose, glucose and fructose, which was significantly lower than for maltose. Wasps showed a strong decrease in feeding time for maltose or fructose following a brief exposure to other sugars, suggesting that wasps can distinguish maltose and fructose from the other sugars tested. The higher acceptance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong> and short feeding time in the case of maltose appears adaptive in light of the relatively poor nutritional quality of the sugar in the longevity trial. The pronounced feeding inhibition seen for fructose following exposure to other sugars is not linked with lower nutritional performance. This feeding inhibition was even seen in wasps that had fed on glucose at the lowest acceptance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong> (0.031 mol l<sup>−1</sup>) and persisted for 24 h. This study is the first to show feeding inhibition of otherwise phagostimulant sugars such as maltose and fructose after gustatory stimulation on other sugars.</p>

Baseline hearing abilities and variability in wild beluga whales (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>)
<p>While hearing is the primary sensory modality for odontocetes, there are few data addressing variation within a natural population. This work describes the hearing ranges (4–150 kHz) and sensitivities of seven apparently healthy, wild beluga whales (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>) during a population health assessment project that captured and released belugas in Bristol Bay, Alaska. The baseline hearing abilities and subsequent variations were addressed. Hearing was measured using auditory evoked potentials (AEPs). All audiograms showed a typical cetacean U-shape; substantial variation (>30 dB) was found between most and least sensitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong>s. All animals heard well, up to at least 128 kHz. Two heard up to 150 kHz. Lowest auditory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong>s (35–45 dB) were identified in the range 45–80 kHz. Greatest differences in hearing abilities occurred at both the high end of the auditory range and at frequencies of maximum sensitivity. In general, wild beluga hearing was quite sensitive. Hearing abilities were similar to those of belugas measured in zoological settings, reinforcing the comparative importance of both settings. The relative degree of variability across the wild belugas suggests that audiograms from multiple individuals are needed to properly describe the maximum sensitivity and population variance for odontocetes. Hearing measures were easily incorporated into field-based settings. This detailed examination of hearing abilities in wild Bristol Bay belugas provides a basis for a better understanding of the potential impact of anthropogenic noise on a noise-sensitive species. Such information may help design noise-limiting mitigation measures that could be applied to areas heavily influenced and inhabited by endangered belugas.</p>

Sepsis otopathy: experimental sepsis leads to significant hearing impairment due to apoptosis and glutamate excitotoxicity in murine cochlea
<p>Hearing loss is frequent in intensive care patients and can be due to several causes. However, sepsis has not been examined as a possible cause. The aim of this study is to assess the influence of experimental sepsis on hearing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong>s and to evaluate pathological changes in the cochlea. The cecal ligation puncture technique was used to induce sepsis in 18 mice. Results were compared with those from 13 sham-operated and 13 untreated control mice. The hearing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong>s of the animals were evaluated with auditory evoked brainstem responses prior to the induction of sepsis and again at the peak of the disease. Immediately after the second measurement, the mice were sacrificed and the inner ears harvested and prepared for further evaluation. The cochleae were examined with light microscopy, electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry for Bax, cleaved caspase-3 and Bcl-2. The mice with sepsis showed a significant hearing loss but not the control groups. Induction of apoptosis could be shown in the supporting cells of the organ of Corti. Furthermore, excitotoxicity could be shown at the basal pole of the inner hair cells. In this murine model, sepsis leads to significant hearing impairment. The physiological alteration could be linked to apoptosis in the supporting cells of the organ of Corti and to a disturbance of the synapses of the inner hair cells.</p>

High-Sensitivity Cardiac Troponin and the Risk Stratification of Patients With Renal Impairment Presenting With Suspected Acute Coronary Syndrome
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>High-sensitivity cardiac troponin testing may improve the risk stratification and diagnosis of myocardial infarction, but concentrations can be challenging to interpret in patients with renal impairment, and the effectiveness of testing in this group is uncertain.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a prospective multicenter study of consecutive patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome, we evaluated the performance of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I in those with and without renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>). The negative predictive value and sensitivity of troponin concentrations below the risk stratification <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong> (5 ng/L) at presentation were reported for a primary outcome of index type 1 myocardial infarction, or type 1 myocardial infarction or cardiac death at 30 days. The positive predictive value and specificity at the 99th centile diagnostic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong> (16 ng/L in women, 34 ng/L in men) was determined for index type 1 myocardial infarction. Subsequent type 1 myocardial infarction and cardiac death were reported at 1 year.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 4726 patients identified, 904 (19%) had renal impairment. Troponin concentrations <5 ng/L at presentation identified 17% of patients with renal impairment as low risk for the primary outcome (negative predictive value, 98.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 96.0%–99.7%; sensitivity 98.9%; 95%CI, 97.5%–99.9%), in comparison with 56% without renal impairment (<i>P</i><0.001) with similar performance (negative predictive value, 99.7%; 95% CI, 99.4%–99.9%; sensitivity 98.4%; 95% CI, 97.2%–99.4%). The positive predictive value and specificity at the 99th centile were lower in patients with renal impairment at 50.0% (95% CI, 45.2%–54.8%) and 70.9% (95% CI, 67.5%–74.2%), respectively, in comparison with 62.4% (95% CI, 58.8%–65.9%) and 92.1% (95% CI, 91.2%–93.0%) in those without. At 1 year, patients with troponin concentrations >99th centile and renal impairment were at greater risk of subsequent myocardial infarction or cardiac death than those with normal renal function (24% versus 10%; adjusted hazard ratio, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.54–3.11).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In suspected acute coronary syndrome, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin identified fewer patients with renal impairment as low risk and more as high risk, but with lower specificity for type 1 myocardial infarction.

Wide Variation in Reported Rates of Stroke Across Cohorts of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Oral anticoagulants decrease ischemic stroke rates in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) but increase the risk of bleeding. For the average patient with AF, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong> of annual ischemic stroke rate where the benefit of anticoagulation outweighs the bleeding risk (net clinical benefit) has been shown to be ≈1% to 2%. Guideline recommendations for oral anticoagulants in AF are based on the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc stroke risk point scores, assuming that those scores translate to fixed stroke rates. However, the relationship between stroke point scores and annual stroke rates may vary substantially across populations. We sought to comprehensively assess the reported rates of stroke in patients with AF and the relationship of stroke rates to stroke risk point scores.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A systematic review of cohort studies and randomized controlled trials enrolled patients with nonvalvular AF not treated with oral anticoagulants.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of the 3552 studies screened, we identified 34 studies eligible for analysis. Overall stroke rates in cohort studies were highly heterogeneous (Q=5706.54, <i>P</i><0.001; I<sup>2</sup> = 99.6%) and ranged from 0.45% to 9.28% per year, despite being of similar objective study quality. The mean North American stroke rate was less than one-third that of the mean European stroke rate (<i>P</i><0.0001). However, a random effects regression indicated that between-study variability was not significantly accounted for by cohort region, prospective versus retrospective design, calendar year of study, or outcome event cluster. At a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score of 1, 76% of cohorts reported ischemic stroke rates <1% per year and only 18% of cohorts reported a stroke rate >2% per year. At a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score of 2, 27% of cohorts reported stroke rates below 1% per year, 40% reported stroke rates between 1 and 2% per year, and 33% reported stroke rates >2% per year.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Substantial variation exists across cohorts in overall stroke rates and rates corresponding to CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc point scores. These variations can affect the point score <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong> for recommending oral anticoagulants in AF. The majority of cohorts did not observe stroke rates that would indicate a clear expected net clinical benefit for anticoagulating AF patients with CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc scores of 1 or 2.</p></sec>

Spatial Mapping and Profiling of Metabolite Distributions during Germination
<p>Germination is a highly complex process by which seeds begin to develop and establish themselves as viable organisms. In this study, we utilize a combination of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, liquid chromatography-fluorescence, and mass spectrometry imaging approaches to profile and visualize the metabolic distributions of germinating seeds from two different inbreds of maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) seeds, B73 and Mo17. Gas chromatography and liquid chromatography analyses demonstrate that the two inbreds are highly differentiated in their metabolite profiles throughout the course of germination, especially with regard to amino acids, sugar alcohols, and small organic acids. Crude dissection of the seed followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of polar metabolites also revealed that many compounds were highly sequestered among the various seed tissue types. To further localize compounds, matrix-assisted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging was utilized to visualize compounds in fine detail in their native environments over the course of germination. Most notably, the fatty acyl chain-dependent differential localization of phospholipids and triacylglycerols was observed within the embryo and radicle, showing correlation with the heterogeneous distribution of fatty acids. Other interesting observations include unusual localization of ceramides on the endosperm/scutellum boundary and subcellular localization of ferulate in the aleurone.</p>

Vesicle Dynamics during Plant Cell Cytokinesis Reveals Distinct Developmental Phases

We combined high spatial and temporal resolution confocal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> scanning microscopy with advanced image-processing tools and fluorescence fluctuation methods and distinguished three distinct phases during cell plate expansion in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) ‘Bright Yellow-2’ cells: massive delivery of preexisting vesicles to a disk-shaped region at the equatorial plane precedes a primary rapid expansion phase followed by a secondary, slow expansion phase during which the extremity of the circular plate seeks contact with the mother wall and brings about the separation of the two portions of cytoplasm. Different effects of pharmacological inhibition emphasize the distinct nature of the assembly and expansion mechanisms characterizing these phases.</p>

Two Acyltransferases Contribute Differently to Linolenic Acid Levels in Seed Oil
<p>Acyltransferases are key contributors to triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis and, thus, are of great importance for seed oil quality. The effects of increased or decreased expression of <i>ACYL-COENZYME A:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1</i> (<i>DGAT1</i>) or <i>PHOSPHOLIPID:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE</i> (<i>PDAT</i>) on seed lipid composition were assessed in several <i>Camelina sativa</i> lines. Furthermore, in vitro assays of acyltransferases in microsomal fractions prepared from developing seeds of some of these lines were performed. Decreased expression of <i>DGAT1</i> led to an increased percentage of 18:3<i>n</i>-3 without any change in total lipid content of the seed. The tri-18:3 TAG increase occurred predominantly in the cotyledon, as determined with matrix-assisted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry, whereas species with two 18:3<i>n</i>-3 acyl groups were elevated in both cotyledon and embryonal axis. <i>PDAT</i> overexpression led to a relative increase of 18:2<i>n</i>-6 at the expense of 18:3<i>n</i>-3, also without affecting the total lipid content. Differential distributions of TAG species also were observed in different parts of the seed. The microsomal assays revealed that <i>C.</i> <i>sativa</i> seeds have very high activity of diacylglycerol-phosphatidylcholine interconversion. The combination of analytical and biochemical data suggests that the higher 18:2<i>n</i>-6 content in the seed oil of the <i>PDAT</i> overexpressors is due to the channeling of fatty acids from phosphatidylcholine into TAG before being desaturated to 18:3<i>n</i>-3, caused by the high activity of PDAT in general and by PDAT specificity for 18:2<i>n</i>-6. The higher levels of 18:3<i>n</i>-3 in <i>DGAT1</i>-silencing lines are likely due to the compensatory activity of a TAG-synthesizing enzyme with specificity for this acyl group and more desaturation of acyl groups occurring on phosphatidylcholine.</p>

Spatial and Temporal Mapping of Key Lipid Species in <i>Brassica napus</i> Seeds
<p>The regulation of lipid synthesis in oil seeds is still not fully understood. Oilseed rape (<i>Brassica napus</i>) is the third most productive vegetable oil crop on the global market; therefore, increasing our understanding of lipid accumulation in oilseed rape seeds is of great economic, as well as intellectual, importance. Matrix-assisted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong>/desorption ionization-mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) is a technique that allows the mapping of metabolites directly onto intact biological tissues, giving a spatial context to metabolism. We have used MALDI-MSI to study the spatial distribution of two major lipid species, triacylglycerols and phosphatidylcholines. A dramatic, heterogenous landscape of molecular species was revealed, demonstrating significantly different lipid compositions between the various tissue types within the seed. The embryonic axis was found to be particularly enriched in palmitic acid, while the seed coat/aleurone layer accumulated vaccenic, linoleic, and α-linoleic acids. Furthermore, the lipid composition of the inner and outer cotyledons differed from each other, a remarkable discovery given the supposed identical functionality of these two tissues. Triacylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine molecular species distribution was analyzed through a developmental time series covering early seed lipid accumulation to seed maturity. The spatial patterning of lipid molecular species did not vary significantly during seed development. Data gathered using MALDI-MSI was verified through gas chromatography analysis of dissected seeds. The distinct lipid distribution profiles observed imply differential regulation of lipid metabolism between the different tissue types of the seed. Further understanding of this differential regulation will enhance efforts to improve oilseed rape productivity and quality.</p>

The HvNramp5 Transporter Mediates Uptake of Cadmium and Manganese, But Not Iron
<p>The Natural Resistance Associated Macrophage Protein (Nramp) represents a transporter family for metal ions in all organisms. Here, we functionally characterized a member of Nramp family in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), HvNramp5. This member showed different expression patterns, transport substrate specificity, and cellular localization from its close homolog in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), OsNramp5, although HvNramp5 was also localized to the plasma membrane. <i>HvNramp5</i> was mainly expressed in the roots and its expression was not affected by Cd and deficiency of Zn, Cu, and Mn, but slightly up-regulated by Fe deficiency. Spatial expression analysis showed that the expression of <i>HvNramp5</i> was higher in the root tips than that in the basal root regions. Furthermore, analysis with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> microdissection revealed higher expression of <i>HvNramp5</i> in the outer root cell layers. HvNramp5 showed transport activity for both Mn<sup>2+</sup> and Cd<sup>2+</sup>, but not for Fe<sup>2+</sup> when expressed in yeast. Immunostaining with a HvNramp5 antibody showed that this protein was localized in the root epidermal cells without polarity. Knockdown of <i>HvNramp5</i> in barley resulted in a significant reduction in the seedling growth at low Mn supply, but this reduction was rescued at high Mn supply. The concentration of Mn and Cd, but not other metals including Cu, Zn, and Fe, was decreased in both the roots and shoots of knockdown lines compared with the wild-type barley. These results indicate that HvNramp5 is a transporter required for uptake of Mn and Cd, but not for Fe, and that barley has a distinct uptake system from rice.</p>

Regulation of succinate-fuelled mitochondrial respiration in liver and skeletal muscle of hibernating thirteen-lined ground squirrels
<p>Hibernating ground squirrels (<i>Ictidomys tridecemlineatus</i>) alternate between two distinct metabolic states throughout winter: torpor, during which metabolic rate (MR) and body temperature (<i>T</i><sub>b</sub>) are considerably suppressed, and interbout euthermia (IBE), during which MR and <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> briefly return to euthermic levels. Previous studies showed suppression of succinate-fuelled respiration during torpor in liver and skeletal muscle mitochondria; however, these studies used only a single, saturating succinate concentration. Therefore, they could not address whether mitochondrial metabolic suppression occurs under physiological substrate concentrations or whether differences in the kinetics of mitochondrial responses to changing substrate concentration might also contribute to mitochondrial metabolic regulation during torpor. The present study confirmed that succinate oxidation is reduced during torpor in liver and skeletal muscle at 37 and 10°C over a 100-fold range of succinate concentrations. At 37°C, this suppression resulted from inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), which had a greater affinity for oxaloacetate (an SDH inhibitor) during torpor. At 10°C, SDH was not inhibited, suggesting that SDH inhibition initiates but does not maintain mitochondrial suppression during torpor. Moreover, in both liver and skeletal muscle, mitochondria from torpid animals maintained relatively higher respiration rates at low succinate concentrations, which reduces the extent of energy savings that can be achieved during torpor, but may also maintain mitochondrial oxidative capacity above some lower critical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong>, thereby preventing cellular and/or mitochondrial injury during torpor and facilitating rapid recruitment of oxidative capacity during arousal.</p>

Oxidised zirconium <i>versus</i> cobalt alloy bearing surfaces in total knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We sought to establish whether an oxidised zirconium (OxZr) femoral   component causes less loss of polyethylene volume than a cobalt   alloy (CoCr) femoral component in total knee arthroplasty.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A total of 20 retrieved tibial inserts that had articulated with   OxZr components were matched with 20 inserts from CoCr articulations   for patient age, body mass index, length of implantation, and revision   diagnosis. Changes in dimensions of the articular surfaces were compared   with those of pristine inserts using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> scanning. The differences   in volume between the retrieved and pristine surfaces of the two   groups were calculated and compared.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The loss of polyethylene volume was 122 mm<sup>3</sup> (standard   deviation (<sc>sd</sc>) 87) in the OxZr group and 170 mm<sup>3</sup> (<sc>sd</sc> 96)   in the CoCr group (p = 0.033). The volume loss in the OxZr group was   also lower in the medial (72 mm<sup>3 </sup>(<sc>sd</sc> 67) <i>versus</i> 92   mm<sup>3 </sup>(<sc>sd</sc> 60); p = 0.096) and lateral (49 mm<sup>3 </sup>(<sc>sd</sc> 36)<i> versus</i> 79   mm<sup>3 </sup>(<sc>sd</sc> 61); p = 0.096) compartments separately,   but these differences were not significant.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results corroborate earlier findings from <i>in vitro</i> testing   and visual retrieval analysis which suggest that polyethylene volume   loss is lower with OxZr femoral components. Since both OxZr and   CoCr are hard surfaces that would be expected to create comparable amounts   of polyethylene creep, the differences in volume loss may reflect   differences in the <i>in vivo</i> wear of these inserts.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:793–8.</p></sec>

Proximal translation of > 1 mm within the first two years of revision total hip arthroplasty correctly predicts whether or not an acetabular component is loose in 80% of cases
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The purpose of this study was to determine the sensitivity, specificity   and predictive values of previously reported <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong>s of proximal   translation and sagittal rotation of cementless acetabular components   used for revision total hip arthroplasty (THA) at various times   during early follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Migration of cementless acetabular components was measured retrospectively   in 84 patients (94 components) using Ein-Bild-Rontgen-Analyse (EBRA-Cup)   in two groups of patients. In Group A, components were recorded   as not being loose intra-operatively at re-revision THA (52 components/48   patients) and Group B components were recorded to be loose at re-revision   (42 components/36 patients).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean proximal translation and sagittal rotation were significantly   higher in Group B than in Group A from three months onwards (p <   0.02). Proximal translation > 1.0 mm within 24 months had a positive   predictive value (PPV) of 90% and a specificity of 94%, but a sensitivity   of 64%. Proximal translation > 1.0 mm within the first 24 months correctly   identified 76 of 94 (81%) of components to be either loose or not   loose. However, ten components in Group B (24%) did not migrate   proximally above 1.0 mm within the first 60 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The high PPV of EBRA-Cup measurements of proximal translation   (90%) shows that this can be used in early follow-up to identify   patients at risk of aseptic loosening. The absence of proximal translation   within the first 60 months indicates a component is not likely to   be loose at re-revision THA although it does not exclude late aseptic loosening   as a cause of failure.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:465–74.</p></sec>

Augmenting the osseointegration of endoprostheses using laser-sintered porous collars
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Massive endoprostheses rely on extra-cortical bone bridging (ECBB)   to enhance fixation. The aim of this study was to investigate the   role of selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> sintered (SLS) porous collars in augmenting   the osseointegration of these prostheses.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The two novel designs of porous SLS collars, one with small pores   (Ø700 μm, SP) and one with large pores (Ø1500 μm, LP), were compared   in an ovine tibial diaphyseal model. Osseointegration of these collars   was compared with that of a clinically used solid, grooved design   (G). At six months post-operatively, the ovine tibias were retrieved and   underwent radiological and histological analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Porous collars provided a significantly greater surface (p <   0.001) for the ingrowth of bone than the standard grooved design.   Significantly greater extracortical pedicle formation was seen radiologically   around the grooved design (length p = 0.002, thickness p < 0.001,   surface area p = 0.002) than around the porous collars. However,   the ingrowth of bone occurred from the transection site into the   porous structure of both types of collar. A fivefold increase in   integration was seen with the SP and a threefold increase in the   LP design when compared with G (p < 0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>SLS porous collars allow the direct ingrowth of more bone and   are better than current designs which rely on surface ongrowth and   ECBB.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:276–82.</p></sec>

‘Hot Joints’ infection protocol reduces unnecessary post-operative re-admissions following total hip and knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To evaluate the effectiveness of an institutionally developed   algorithm for evaluation and diagnosis of prosthetic joint injection   and to determine the impact of this protocol on overall hospital   re-admissions.p</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We retrospectively evaluated 2685 total hip arthroplasty (THA)   and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patients prior to (1263) and following   (1422) the introduction of an infection detection protocol. The   protocol used conservative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong>s for C-reactive protein to   direct the medical attendant to aspirate the joint. The protocol   incorporated a clear set of laboratory and clinical criteria that   allowed a patient to be discharged home if all were met. Patients were   included if they presented to our emergency department within 120   days post-operatively with concerns for swelling, pain or infection   and were excluded if they had an unambiguous infection or if their   chief complaint was non-orthopaedic in nature.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Concern for infection was the single most common (32%) reason   for presentation. A total of 296 patients made an emergency visit   and were included following THA or TKA. In the pre-protocol cohort,   11 of 27 patients were formally re-admitted to the hospital with   concern for infection but only five (45%) patients had actual infections   and received additional treatment. In comparison, in the post-protocol   cohort, 11 patients were admitted for suspected infection, nine   (82%) of whom were truly infected (p = 0.04). Sensitivity increased   from 83% to 100% and specificity increased from 71% to 96%. Implementation   of this protocol did not miss any infections.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>A standardised protocol for evaluation of THA and TKA infections   significantly reduced unnecessary hospital re-admissions.

Ten-year follow-up study of three alternative bearing surfaces used in total hip arthroplasty in young patients
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We present the ten-year data of a cohort of patients, aged between   18 and 65 years (mean age 52.7 years; 19 to 64), who underwent total   hip arthroplasty. Patients were randomised to be treated with a   cobalt-chrome (CoCr) femoral head with an ultra-high molecular weight   polyethylene (UHMWPE), highly cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) or   ceramic-on-ceramic (CoC) bearing surface.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 102 hips (91 patients) were randomised into the three   groups. At ten years, 97 hips were available for radiological and   functional follow-up. Two hips (two patients) had been revised (one   with deep infection and one for periprosthetic fracture) and three   were lost to follow-up. Radiological analysis was performed using   a validated digital assessment programme to give linear, directional   and volumetric wear of the two polyethylene groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was a significantly reduced rate of steady-state linear   wear with XLPE (0.07 mm/yr) compared with UHMWPE (0.37 mm/yr) (p   = 0.001). Volumetric wear was also significantly reduced in the   XLPE group (29.29 mm<sup>3</sup>/yr) compared with the UHMWPE group   (100.75mm<sup>3</sup>/yr) (p = 0.0001). There were six patients   with UHMWPE who had non-progressive osteolysis and none in the XLPE   group. All three bearing groups had significant improvements in   12-item short form health survey scores, Western Ontario and McMaster   Universities Osteoarthritis Index score and Harris Hip Score. However,   the improvement in HSS was significantly less in the UHMWPE group   (p = 0.0188) than in the other two groups.</p><p>At ten years, the rates of volumetric and linear wear in the   XLPE group remain low and predominantly below the estimated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">threshold</span></strong>   for osteolysis (1 mm/yr). The rate of linear wear in the XLPE group   was three times less than in the UHMWPE group at five-year follow-up   and five times less at ten years. The rate of volumetric wear was also   three times less in the XLPE group at ten years.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>While CoC also performs well, XLPE at ten years remains a safe   and excellent bearing option in young patients, with low rates of   wear and no evidence of osteolysis.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1590–5.</p></sec>

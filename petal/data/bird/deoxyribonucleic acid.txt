Multi-Omics Driven Assembly and Annotation of the Sandalwood (<i>Santalum album</i>) Genome
<p>Indian sandalwood (<i>Santalum album</i>) is an important tropical evergreen tree known for its fragrant heartwood-derived essential oil and its valuable carving wood. Here, we applied an integrated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic, transcriptomic, and proteomic approach to assemble and annotate the Indian sandalwood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e. Our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequencing resulted in the establishment of a draft map of the smallest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e for any woody tree species to date (221 Mb). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e annotation predicted 38,119 protein-coding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s and 27.42% repetitive DNA elements. In-depth proteome analysis revealed the identities of 72,325 unique peptides, which confirmed 10,076 of the predicted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. The addition of transcriptomic and proteo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic approaches resulted in the identification of 53 novel proteins and 34 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>-correction events that were missed by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic approaches. Proteo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic analysis also helped in reassigning 1,348 potential noncoding RNAs as bona fide protein-coding messenger RNAs. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> expression patterns at the RNA and protein levels indicated that peptide sequencing was useful in capturing proteins encoded by nuclear and organellar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es alike. Mass spectrometry-based proteomic evidence provided an unbiased approach toward the identification of proteins encoded by organellar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. Such proteins are often missed in transcriptome data sets due to the enrichment of only messenger RNAs that contain poly(A) tails. Overall, the use of integrated omic approaches enhanced the quality of the assembly and annotation of this nonmodel plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e. The availability of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data will enhance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ics-assisted breeding, germplasm characterization, and conservation of sandalwood trees.</p>

Genome-Wide Analysis of the Arabidopsis Replication Timing Program
<p>Eukaryotes use a temporally regulated process, known as the replication timing program, to ensure that their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es are fully and accurately duplicated during S phase. Replication timing programs are predictive of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic features and activity and are considered to be functional readouts of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromatin</span></strong> organization. Although replication timing programs have been described for yeast and animal systems, much less is known about the temporal regulation of plant DNA replication or its relationship to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequence and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromatin</span></strong> structure. We used the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thymidin</span></strong>e analog, 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine, in combination with flow sorting and Repli-Seq to describe, at high-resolution, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e-wide replication timing program for Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) Col-0 suspension cells. We identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic regions that replicate predominantly during early, mid, and late S phase, and correlated these regions with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic features and with data for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromatin</span></strong> state, accessibility, and long-distance interaction. Arabidopsis chromosome arms tend to replicate early while pericentromeric regions replicate late. Early and mid-replicating regions are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>-rich and predominantly euchromatic, while late regions are rich in transposable elements and primarily heterochromatic. However, the distribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromatin</span></strong> states across the different times is complex, with each replication time corresponding to a mixture of states. Early and mid-replicating sequences interact with each other and not with late sequences, but early regions are more accessible than mid regions. The replication timing program in Arabidopsis reflects a bipartite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic organization with early/mid-replicating regions and late regions forming separate, noninteracting compartments. The temporal order of DNA replication within the early/mid compartment may be modulated largely by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromatin</span></strong> accessibility.</p>

CTDGFinder: A Novel Homology-Based Algorithm for Identifying Closely Spaced Clusters of Tandemly Duplicated Genes
<p>Closely spaced clusters of tandemly duplicated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s (CTDGs) contribute to the diversity of many phenotypes, including chemosensation, snake venom, and animal body plans. CTDGs have traditionally been identified subjectively as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic neighborhoods containing several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> duplicates in close proximity; however, CTDGs are often highly variable with respect to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> number, intergenic distance, and synteny. This lack of formal definition hampers the study of CTDG evolutionary dynamics and the discovery of novel CTDGs in the exponentially growing body of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic data. To address this gap, we developed a novel homology-based algorithm, CTDGFinder, which formalizes and automates the identification of CTDGs by examining the physical distribution of individual members of families of duplicated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s across chromosomes. Application of CTDGFinder accurately identified CTDGs for many well-known <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters (e.g., Hox and beta-globin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters) in the human, mouse and 20 other mammalian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. Differences between previously annotated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters and our inferred CTDGs were due to the exclusion of nonhomologs that have historically been considered parts of specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters, the inclusion or absence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s between the CTDGs and their corresponding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters, and the splitting of certain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters into distinct CTDGs. Examination of human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s showing tissue-specific enhancement of their expression by CTDGFinder identified members of several well-known <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters (e.g., cytochrome P450s and olfactory receptors) and revealed that they were unequally distributed across tissues. By formalizing and automating CTDG identification, CTDGFinder will facilitate understanding of CTDG evolutionary dynamics, their functional implications, and how they are associated with phenotypic diversity.</p>

The Roles of Mutation, Selection, and Expression in Determining Relative Rates of Evolution in Mitochondrial versus Nuclear Genomes
<p>Eukaryotes rely on proteins encoded by the nuclear and mitochondrial (mt) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es, which interact within multisubunit complexes such as oxidative-phosphorylation enzymes. Although selection is thought to be less efficient on the asexual mt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e, in bilaterian animals the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions (<i>ω</i>) is lower in mt- compared with nuclear-encoded OXPHOS subunits, suggesting <i>stronger</i> effects of purifying selection in the mt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e. Because high levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion constrain protein sequence evolution, one proposed resolution to this paradox is that mt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s are expressed more highly than nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. To test this hypothesis, we investigated expression and sequence evolution of mt and nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s from 84 diverse eukaryotes that vary in mt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> content and mutation rate. We found that the relationship between mt and nuclear <i>ω</i> values varied dramatically across eukaryotes. In contrast, transcript abundance is consistently higher for mt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s than nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, regardless of which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s happen to be in the mt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e. Consequently, expression levels cannot be responsible for the differences in <i>ω</i>. Rather, 84% of the variance in the ratio of <i>ω</i> values between mt and nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s could be explained by differences in mutation rate between the two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. We relate these findings to the hypothesis that high rates of mt mutation select for compensatory changes in the nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e. We also propose an explanation for why mt transcripts consistently outnumber their nuclear counterparts, with implications for mitonuclear protein imbalance and aging.</p>

Integrated Consensus Map of Cultivated Peanut and Wild Relatives Reveals Structures of the A and B Genomes of <i>Arachis</i> and Divergence of the Legume Genomes
<p>The complex, tetraploid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e structure of peanut (<i>Arachis hypogaea</i>) has obstructed advances in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tics and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ics in the species. The aim of this study is to understand the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e structure of <i>Arachis</i> by developing a high-density integrated consensus map. Three recombinant inbred line populations derived from crosses between the A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e diploid species, <i>Arachis duranensis</i> and <i>Arachis stenosperma</i>; the B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e diploid species, <i>Arachis ipaënsis</i> and <i>Arachis magna</i>; and between the AB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e tetraploids, <i>A. hypogaea</i> and an artificial amphidiploid (<i>A. ipaënsis</i> × <i>A. duranensis</i>)<sup>4×</sup>, were used to construct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic linkage maps: 10 linkage groups (LGs) of 544 cM with 597 loci for the A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e; 10 LGs of 461 cM with 798 loci for the B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e; and 20 LGs of 1442 cM with 1469 loci for the AB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e. The resultant maps plus 13 published maps were integrated into a consensus map covering 2651 cM with 3693 marker loci which was anchored to 20 consensus LGs corresponding to the A and B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. The comparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ics with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequences of <i>Cajanus cajan</i>, <i>Glycine max</i>, <i>Lotus japonicus</i>, and <i>Medicago truncatula</i> revealed that the <i>Arachis</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e has segmented synteny relationship to the other legumes. The comparative maps in legumes, integrated tetraploid consensus maps, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e-specific diploid maps will increase the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic understanding of <i>Arachis</i> and should facilitate molecular breeding.</p>

Histone Modifications Define Expression Bias of Homoeologous Genomes in Allotetraploid Cotton
<p>Histone modifications regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion in eukaryotes, but their roles in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion changes in interspecific hybrids or allotetraploids are poorly understood. Histone modifications can be mapped by immunostaining of metaphase chromosomes at the single cell level and/or by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromatin</span></strong> immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) for analyzing individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. Here, we comparatively analyzed immunostained metaphase chromosomes and ChIP-seq of individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, which revealed a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromatin</span></strong> basis for biased homoeologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion in polyploids. We examined H3K4me3 density and transcriptome maps in root-tip cells of allotetraploid cotton (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>). The overall H3K4me3 levels were relatively equal between A and D chromosomes, which were consistent with equal numbers of expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s between the two sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. However, intensities per chromosomal area were nearly twice as high in the D homeologs as in the A homeologs. Consistent with the cytological observation, ChIP-seq analysis showed that more D homeologs with biased H3K4me3 levels than A homeologs with biased modifications correlated with the greater number of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s with D-biased expression than that with A-biased expression in most homeologous chromosome pairs. Two chromosomes displayed different expression levels compared with other chromosomes, which correlate with known translocations and may affect the local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromatin</span></strong> structure and expression levels for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s involved. This example of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e-wide histone modifications that determine expression bias of homeologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in allopolyploids provides a molecular basis for the evolution and domestication of polyploid species, including many important crops.</p>

The Evolution of Genes within Genes and the Control of DNA Replication in Microviruses
<p>Single-stranded DNA(ssDNA) viral life cycles must balance double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and ssDNA biosynthesis. Previously published in vitro results suggest that microvirus C and host cell SSB proteins play antagonistic roles to achieve this balance. To investigate this in vivo, microvirus DNA replication was characterized in cells expressing cloned C or <i>ssb</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, which would presumably alter the C:SSB protein ratios. Representatives of each microvirus clade (φX174, G4, and α3) were used in these studies. α3 DNA replication was significantly more complex. Results suggested that the recognized α3 C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> (C<sub>S</sub>: small) is one of two C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. A larger 5′ extended <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> could be translated from an upstream GTG start codon (C<sub>B</sub>: big). Wild-type α3 acquired resistance to elevated SSB levels by mutations that exclusively frameshifted the C<sub>B</sub> reading frame, whereas mutations in the origin of replication conferred resistance to elevated C protein levels. Expression of either the cloned C<sub>B</sub> or C<sub>S</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> complemented <i>am(C)</i> mutants, demonstrating functional redundancy. When the C<sub>S</sub> start codon was eliminated, strains were only viable if an additional amber mutation was placed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> C and propagated in an informational suppressing host. Thus, C<sub>B</sub> protein likely reaches toxic levels in the absence of C<sub>S</sub> translation. This phenomenon may have driven the evolution of the C<sub>S</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> within the larger C<sub>B</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> and could constitute a unique mechanism of regulation. Furthermore, cross-complementation data suggested that interactions between the α3 C and other viral proteins have evolved enough specificity to biochemically isolate its DNA replication from G4 and φX174.</p>

STING is an essential mediator of the Ku70-mediated production of IFN-λ1 in response to exogenous DNA
<p>We previously identified Ku70, a subunit of a DNA repair protein complex, as a cytosolic DNA sensor that induces the production of interferon-λ1 (IFN-λ1) by human primary cells and cell lines. IFN-λ1 is a type III IFN and has similar antiviral activity to that of the type I IFNs (IFN-α and IFN-β). We observed that human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells, which are deficient in the innate immune adaptor protein STING (stimulator of IFN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s), did not produce IFN-λ1 in response to DNA unless they were reconstituted with STING. Conversely, parental HEK 293 cells produced IFN-λ1 after they were exposed to exogenous DNA; however, when STING was knocked out in the HEK 293 cells through the CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas9 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e editing system, they lost this response. Through confocal microscopy, we demonstrated that endogenous Ku70 was located in the nucleus and then translocated to the cytoplasm upon DNA exposure to form a complex with STING. Additionally, the DNA binding domain of Ku70 was essential for formation of the Ku70-STING complex. Knocking down STING in primary human macrophages inhibited their ability to produce IFN-λ1 in response to transfection with DNA or infection with the DNA virus HSV-2 (herpes simplex virus–2). Together, these data suggest that STING mediates the Ku70-mediated IFN-λ1 innate immune response to exogenous DNA or DNA virus infection.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
ROS1-Dependent DNA Demethylation Is Required for ABA-Inducible <i>NIC3</i> Expression
<p>DNA methylation plays an important role in diverse developmental processes in many eukaryotes, including the response to environmental stress. Abscisic acid (ABA) is a plant hormone that is up-regulated under stress. The involvement of DNA methylation in the ABA response has been reported but is poorly understood. DNA demethylation is a reverse process of DNA methylation and often induces structural changes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromatin</span></strong> leading to transcriptional activation. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana)</i>, active DNA demethylation depends on the activity of REPRESSOR OF SILENCING 1 (ROS1), which directly excises 5-methylcytosine from DNA. Here we showed that <i>ros1</i> mutants were hypersensitive to ABA during early seedling development and root elongation. Expression levels of some ABA-inducible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s were decreased in <i>ros1</i> mutants, and more than 60% of their proximal regions became hypermethylated, indicating that a subset of ABA-inducible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s are under the regulation of ROS1-dependent DNA demethylation. Notable among them is <i>NICOTINAMIDASE 3</i> (<i>NIC3</i>) that encodes an enzyme that converts nicotinamide to nicotinic acid in the NAD<sup>+</sup> salvage pathway. Many enzymes in this pathway are known to be involved in stress responses. The <i>nic3</i> mutants display hypersensitivity to ABA, whereas overexpression of <i>NIC3</i> restores normal ABA responses. Our data suggest that <i>NIC3</i> is responsive to ABA but requires ROS1-mediated DNA demethylation at the promoter as a prerequisite to transcriptional activation. These findings suggest that ROS1-induced active DNA demethylation maintains the active state of <i>NIC3</i> transcription in response to ABA.</p>

Hierarchically Aligning 10 Legume Genomes Establishes a Family-Level Genomics Platform
<p>Mainly due to their economic importance, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es of 10 legumes, including soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>), wild peanut (<i>Arachis duranensis</i> and <i>Arachis ipaensis</i>), and barrel medic (<i>Medicago truncatula</i>), have been sequenced. However, a family-level comparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ics analysis has been unavailable. With grape (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) and selected legume <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es as outgroups, we managed to perform a hierarchical and event-related alignment of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es and deconvoluted layers of homologous regions produced by ancestral polyploidizations or speciations. Consequently, we illustrated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic fractionation characterized by widespread <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> losses after the polyploidizations. Notably, high similarity in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> retention between recently duplicated chromosomes in soybean supported the likely autopolyploidy nature of its tetraploid ancestor. Moreover, although most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> losses were nearly random, largely but not fully described by geometric distribution, we showed that polyploidization contributed divergently to the copy number variation of important <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families. Besides, we showed significantly divergent evolutionary levels among legumes and, by performing synonymous nucleotide substitutions at synonymous sites correction, redated major evolutionary events during their expansion. This effort laid a solid foundation for further <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ics exploration in the legume research community and beyond. We describe only a tiny fraction of legume comparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ics analysis that we performed; more information was stored in the newly constructed Legume Comparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ics Research Platform (<ext-link>www.legumegrp.org</ext-link>).</p>

Whole-Genome Sequencing of Tibetan Macaque (<i>Macaca thibetana</i>) Provides New Insight into the Macaque Evolutionary History
<p>Macaques are the most widely distributed nonhuman primates and used as animal models in biomedical research. The availability of full-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequences from them would be essential to both biomedical and primate evolutionary studies. Previous studies have reported whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequences from rhesus macaque (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>) and cynomolgus macaque (<i>M. fascicularis</i>, CE), both of which belong to the <i>fascicularis</i> group. Here, we present a 37-fold coverage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequence of the Tibetan macaque (<i>M. thibetana</i>; TM). TM is an endemic species to China belonging to the <i>sinica</i> group<i>.</i> On the basis of mapping to the rhesus macaque <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e, we identified approximately 11.9 million single-nucleotide variants), of which 3.9 million were TM specific, as assessed by comparison two Chinese rhesus macaques (CR) and two CE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. Some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s carried TM-specific homozygous nonsynonymous variants (TSHNVs), which were scored as deleterious in human by both PolyPhen-2 and SIFT (Sorting Tolerant From Intolerant) and were enriched in the eye disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. In total, 273 immune response and disease-related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s carried at least one TSHNV. The heterozygosity rates of two CRs (0.002617 and 0.002612) and two CEs (0.003004 and 0.003179) were approximately three times higher than that of TM (0.000898). Polymerase chain reaction resequencing of 18 TM individuals showed that 29 TSHNVs exhibited high allele frequencies, thus confirming their low heterozygosity. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e-wide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic divergence analysis demonstrated that TM was more closely related to CR than to CE. We further detected unusual low divergence regions between TM and CR. In addition, after applying statistical criteria to detect putative introgression regions (PIRs) in the TM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e, up to 239,620 kb PIRs (8.84% of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e) were identified. Given that TM and CR have overlapping geographical distributions, had the same refuge during the Middle Pleistocene, and show similar mating behaviors, it is highly likely that there was an ancient introgression event between them. Moreover, demographic inferences revealed that TM exhibited a similar demographic history as other macaques until 0.5 Ma, but then it maintained a lower effective population size until present time. Our study has provided new insight into the macaque evolutionary history, confirming hybridization events between macaque species groups based on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e-wide data.</p>

Tree Physiology
Revisiting the sequencing of the first tree genome: <i>Populus trichocarpa</i>
<p>Ten years ago, it was announced that the Joint <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e Institute with funds provided by the Department of Energy, Office of Science, Biological and Environmental Research would sequence the black cottonwood (<i>Populus trichocarpa</i> Torr. & Gray) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e. This landmark decision was the culmination of work by the forest science community to develop <i>Populus</i> as a model system. Since its public release in late 2006, the availability of the <i>Populus</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e has spawned research in plant biology, morphology, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tics and ecology. Here we address how the tree physiologist has used this resource. More specifically, we revisit our earlier contention that the rewards of sequencing the <i>Populus</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e would depend on how quickly scientists working with woody perennials could adopt molecular approaches to investigate the mechanistic underpinnings of basic physiological processes. Several examples illustrate the integration of functional and comparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ics into the forest sciences, especially in areas that target improved understanding of the developmental differences between woody perennials and herbaceous annuals (e.g., phase transitions). Sequencing the <i>Populus</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e and the availability of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic resources has also been instrumental in identifying candidate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s that underlie physiological and morphological traits of interest. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e-enabled research has advanced our understanding of how phenotype and genotype are related and provided insights into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic mechanisms whereby woody perennials adapt to environmental stress. In the future, we anticipate that low-cost, high-throughput sequencing will continue to facilitate research in tree physiology and enhance our understanding at scales of individual organisms and populations. A challenge remains, however, as to how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic resources, including the <i>Populus</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e, can be used to understand ecosystem function. Although examples are limited, progress in this area is encouraging and will undoubtedly improve as future research targets the many unique aspects of <i>Populus</i> as a keystone species in terrestrial ecosystems.</p>

K63-linked polyubiquitin chains bind to DNA to facilitate DNA damage repair
<p>Polyubiquitylation is canonically viewed as a posttranslational modification that governs protein stability or protein-protein interactions, in which distinct polyubiquitin linkages ultimately determine the fate of modified protein(s). We explored whether polyubiquitin chains have any nonprotein-related function. Using in vitro pull-down assays with synthetic materials, we found that polyubiquitin chains with the Lys<sup>63</sup> (K63) linkage bound to DNA through a motif we called the “DNA-interacting patch” (DIP), which is composed of the adjacent residues Thr<sup>9</sup>, Lys<sup>11</sup>, and Glu<sup>34</sup>. Upon DNA damage, the binding of K63-linked polyubiquitin chains to DNA enhanced the recruitment of repair factors through their interaction with an Ile<sup>44</sup> patch in ubiquitin to facilitate DNA repair. Furthermore, experimental or cancer patient–derived mutations within the DIP impaired the DNA binding capacity of ubiquitin and subsequently attenuated K63-linked polyubiquitin chain accumulation at sites of DNA damage, thereby resulting in defective DNA repair and increased cellular sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents. Our results therefore highlight a critical physiological role for K63-linked polyubiquitin chains in binding to DNA to facilitate DNA damage repair.</p>

Gcorn Plant: A Database for Retrieving Functional and Evolutionary Traits of Plant Genes
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> homology helps us understand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> function and speciation. The number of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s and species registered in public databanks is continuously increasing. It is useful to associate homologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s of various plants to better understand plant speciation. We designed the Gcorn plant database for the retrieval of information on homology and evolution of a plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> of interest. Amino acid sequences of 73 species (62 land plants and 11 green algae), containing 2,682,261 sequences, were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Reference Sequence database. Based on NCBI BLAST searches between these sequences, homologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s were grouped at various thresholds of homology indices devised by the authors. To show functional and evolutionary traits of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> of interest, a phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic tree, connecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s with high homology indices, and line charts of the numbers of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s with various homology indices, are depicted. In addition, such indices are projected on a network graph in which species studied are connected based on the ratios of homologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, and on a phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic tree for species based on NCBI Taxonomy. Gcorn plant provides information on homologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s at various virtual time points along with speciation in plants.</p>

Recursive Paleohexaploidization Shaped the Durian Genome
<p>The durian (<i>Durio zibethinus</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e has recently become available, and analysis of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e reveals two paleopolyploidization events previously inferred as shared with cotton (<i>Gossypium</i> spp.). Here, we reanalyzed the durian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e in comparison with other well-characterized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. We found that durian and cotton were actually affected by different polyploidization events: hexaploidization in durian ∼19–21 million years ago (mya) and decaploidization in cotton ∼13–14 mya. Previous interpretations of shared polyploidization events may have resulted from the elevated evolutionary rates in cotton <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s due to the decaploidization and insufficient consideration of the complexity of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. The decaploidization elevated evolutionary rates of cotton <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s by ∼64% compared to durian and explained a previous ∼4-fold over dating of the event. In contrast, the hexaploidization in durian did not prominently elevate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> evolutionary rates, likely due to its long <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>ration time. Moreover, divergent evolutionary rates probably explain 98.4% of reconstructed phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic trees of homologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s being incongruent with expected topology. The findings provide further insight into the roles played by polypoidization in the evolution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, and they suggest revisiting existing reconstructed phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic trees.</p>

MAPINS, a Highly Efficient Detection Method That Identifies Insertional Mutations and Complex DNA Rearrangements
<p>Insertional muta<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>sis, in which a piece of exogenous DNA is integrated randomly into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic DNA of the recipient cell, is a useful method to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>rate new mutants with phenotypes of interest. The unicellular green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> is an outstanding model for studying many biological processes. We developed a new computational algorithm, MAPINS (mapping insertions), to efficiently identify insertion sites created by the integration of an <i>APHVIII</i> (<i>aminoglycoside 3′-phosphotransferase VIII</i>) cassette that confers paromomycin resistance. Using whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequencing data, this method eliminates the need for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic DNA manipulation and retains all the sequencing information provided by paired-end sequencing. We experimentally verified 38 insertion sites out of 41 sites (93%) identified by MAPINS from 20 paromomycin-resistant strains. Using meiotic analysis of 18 of these strains, we identified insertion sites that completely cosegregate with paromomycin resistance. In six of the seven strains with a mutant phenotype, we demonstrated complete cosegregation of the mutant phenotype and the verified insertion site. In addition, we provide direct evidence of complex rearrangements of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic DNA in five strains, three of which involve the <i>APHVIII</i> insertion site. We suggest that strains obtained by insertional muta<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>sis are more complicated than expected from previous analyses in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>. To map the locations of some complex insertions, we designed 49 molecular markers based on differences identified via whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequencing between wild-type strains CC-124 and CC-125. Overall, MAPINS provides a low-cost, efficient method to characterize insertional mutants in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>.</p>

Engineering Artificial MicroRNAs for Multiplex Gene Silencing and Simplified Transgenic Screen
<p>Artificial microRNA (amiRNA) technology offers reversible and flexible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> inactivation and complements <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e-editing technologies. However, obtaining transgenic plants with maximal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> silencing remains a major technical challenge in current amiRNA applications. Here, we incorporated an empirically determined feature of effective amiRNAs to the amiRNA design and in silico <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>rated a database containing 533,429 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>-specific amiRNAs for silencing 27,136 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e coverage of 98.87%. In both single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> and multiple-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> silencing, we observed an overall improvement in performance by amiRNAs designed using our strategy in Arabidopsis protoplasts and transgenic plants. In addition, the endogenous tRNA-processing system was used to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>rate multiple amiRNAs from tRNA-pre-amiRNA tandem repeats for multiplex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> silencing. An intronic amiRNA-producing fluorescent reporter was explored as a visual screening strategy for transgenic Arabidopsis and rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) plants with maximal whole-plant or cell type-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> silencing. These improvements enable the amiRNA technology to be a functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> knockout tool for basic and applied plant research.</p>

Roles of miR319 and TCP Transcription Factors in Leaf Development
<p>Sophisticated regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and their target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, is required for leaf differentiation, growth, and senescence. The impact of miR319 and its target <i>TEOSINTE BRANCHED1</i>, <i>CYCLOIDEA</i>, and <i>PROLIFERATING CELL NUCLEAR ANTIGEN BINDING FACTOR</i> (<i>TCP</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s on leaf development has been extensively investigated, but the redundancies of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families often interfere with the evaluation of their function and regulation in the developmental context. Here, we present the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic evidence of the involvement of the <i>MIR319</i> and <i>TCP</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaf development. Single mutations in <i>MIR319A</i> and <i>MIR319B</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s moderately inhibited the formation of leaf serrations, whereas double mutations increased the extent of this inhibition and resulted in the formation of smooth leaves. Mutations in <i>MIR319</i> and gain-of-function mutations in the <i>TCP4</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> conferred resistance against miR319 and impaired the cotyledon boundary and leaf serration formation. These mutations functionally associated with <i>CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, which regulate the cotyledon boundary and leaf serration formation. In contrast, loss-of-function mutations in miR319-targeted and nontargeted <i>TCP</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s cooperatively induced the formation of serrated leaves in addition to changes in the levels of their downstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> transcript. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the <i>MIR319</i> and <i>TCP</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families underlie robust and multilayer control of leaf development. This study also provides a framework toward future researches on redundant miRNAs and transcription factors in Arabidopsis and crop plants.</p>

Genome-Wide Prediction of Metabolic Enzymes, Pathways, and Gene Clusters in Plants
<p>Plant metabolism underpins many traits of ecological and agronomic importance. Plants produce numerous compounds to cope with their environments but the biosynthetic pathways for most of these compounds have not yet been elucidated. To engineer and improve metabolic traits, we need comprehensive and accurate knowledge of the organization and regulation of plant metabolism at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e scale. Here, we present a computational pipeline to identify metabolic enzymes, pathways, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters from a sequenced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e. Using this pipeline, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>rated metabolic pathway databases for 22 species and identified metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters from 18 species. This unified resource can be used to conduct a wide array of comparative studies of plant metabolism. Using the resource, we discovered a widespread occurrence of metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters in plants: 11,969 clusters from 18 species. The prevalence of metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters offers an intriguing possibility of an untapped source for uncovering new metabolite biosynthesis pathways. For example, more than 1,700 clusters contain enzymes that could <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>rate a specialized metabolite scaffold (signature enzymes) and enzymes that modify the scaffold (tailoring enzymes). In four species with sufficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion data, we identified 43 highly coexpressed clusters that contain signature and tailoring enzymes, of which eight were characterized previously to be functional pathways. Finally, we identified patterns of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e organization that implicate local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> duplication and, to a lesser extent, single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> transposition as having played roles in the evolution of plant metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters.</p>

The Plastid Genome of <i>Polytoma uvella</i> Is the Largest Known among Colorless Algae and Plants and Reflects Contrasting Evolutionary Paths to Nonphotosynthetic Lifestyles
<p>The loss of photosynthesis is frequently associated with parasitic or pathogenic lifestyles, but it also can occur in free-living, plastid-bearing lineages. A common consequence of becoming nonphotosynthetic is the reduction in size and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> content of the plastid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e. In exceptional circumstances, it can even result in the complete loss of the plastid DNA (ptDNA) and its associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion system, as reported recently in several lineages, including the nonphotosynthetic green algal genus <i>Polytomella</i>. Closely related to <i>Polytomella</i> is the polyphyletic genus <i>Polytoma</i>, the members of which lost photosynthesis independently of <i>Polytomella</i>. Species from both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>ra are free-living organisms that contain nonphotosynthetic plastids, but unlike <i>Polytomella</i>, <i>Polytoma</i> members have retained a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e in their colorless plastid. Here, we present the plastid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e of <i>Polytoma uvella</i>: to our knowledge, the first report of ptDNA from a nonphotosynthetic chlamydomonadalean alga. The <i>P. uvella</i> ptDNA contains 25 protein-coding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, most of which are related to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion and none are connected to photosynthesis. However, despite its reduced coding capacity, the <i>P. uvella</i> ptDNA is inflated with short repeats and is tens of kilobases larger than the ptDNAs of its closest known photosynthetic relatives, <i>Chlamydomonas leiostraca</i> and <i>Chlamydomonas applanata</i>. In fact, at approximately 230 kb, the ptDNA of <i>P. uvella</i> represents the largest plastid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e currently reported from a nonphotosynthetic alga or plant. Overall, the <i>P. uvella</i> and <i>Polytomella</i> plastid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es reveal two very different evolutionary paths following the loss of photosynthesis: expansion and complete deletion, respectively. We hypothesize that recombination-based DNA-repair mechanisms are at least partially responsible for the different evolutionary outcomes observed in such closely related nonphotosynthetic algae.</p>

Validating Genome-Wide Association Candidates Controlling Quantitative Variation in Nodulation
<p>Genome-wide association (GWA) studies offer the opportunity to identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s that contribute to naturally occurring variation in quantitative traits. However, GWA relies exclusively on statistical association, so functional validation is necessary to make strong claims about <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> function. We used a combination of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>-disruption platforms (Tnt1 retrotransposons, hairpin RNA-interference constructs, and CRISPR/Cas9 nucleases) together with randomized, well-replicated experiments to evaluate the function of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s that an earlier GWA study in <i>Medicago truncatula</i> had identified as candidates contributing to variation in the symbiosis between legumes and rhizobia. We evaluated ten candidate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s found in six clusters of strongly associated single nucleotide polymorphisms, selected on the basis of their strength of statistical association, proximity to annotated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> models, and root or nodule expression. We found statistically significant effects on nodule production for three candidate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, each validated in two independent mutants. Annotated functions of these three <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s suggest their contributions to quantitative variation in nodule production occur through processes not previously connected to nodulation, including phosphorous supply and salicylic acid-related defense response. These results demonstrate the utility of GWA combined with reverse muta<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>sis technologies to discover and validate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s contributing to naturally occurring variation in quantitative traits. The results highlight the potential for GWA to complement forward <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tics in identifying the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic basis of ecologically and economically important traits.</p>

Stability of Single-Parent Gene Expression Complementation in Maize Hybrids upon Water Deficit Stress
<p>Heterosis is the superior performance of F1 hybrids compared with their homozygous, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tically distinct parents. In this study, we monitored the transcriptomic divergence of the maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) inbred lines B73 and Mo17 and their reciprocal F1 hybrid progeny in primary roots under control and water deficit conditions simulated by polyethylene glycol treatment. Single-parent expression (SPE) of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s is an extreme instance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion complementation, in which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s are active in only one of two parents but are expressed in both reciprocal hybrids. In this study, 1,997 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s only expressed in B73 and 2,024 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s only expressed in Mo17 displayed SPE complementation under control and water deficit conditions. As a consequence, the number of active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in hybrids exceeded the number of active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in the parental inbred lines significantly independent of treatment. SPE patterns were substantially more stable to expression changes by water deficit treatment than other genotype-specific expression profiles. While, on average, 75% of all SPE patterns were not altered in response to polyethylene glycol treatment, only 17% of the remaining genotype-specific expression patterns were not changed by water deficit. Nonsyntenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s that lack syntenic orthologs in other grass species, and thus evolved late in the grass lineage, were significantly overrepresented among SPE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. Hence, the significant overrepresentation of nonsyntenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s among SPE patterns and their stability under water limitation might suggest a function of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s during the early developmental manifestation of heterosis under fluctuating environmental conditions in hybrid progeny of the inbred lines B73 and Mo17.</p>

Atypical Protein Phosphatase 2A Gene Families Do Not Expand via Paleopolyploidization
<p>Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) presents unique opportunities for analyzing molecular mechanisms of functional divergence between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> family members. The canonical PP2A holoenzyme regulates multiple eukaryotic signaling pathways by dephosphorylating target proteins and contains a catalytic (C) subunit, a structural/scaffolding (A) subunit, and a regulatory (B) subunit. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s encoding PP2A subunits have expanded into multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families in both flowering plants and mammals, and the extent to which different isoform functions may overlap is not clearly understood. To gain insight into the diversification of PP2A subunits, we used phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic analyses to reconstruct the evolutionary histories of PP2A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s encoding PP2A subunits in mammals represent ancient lineages that expanded early in vertebrate evolution, while flowering plant PP2A subunit lineages evolved much more recently. Despite this temporal difference, our data indicate that the expansion of PP2A subunit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families in both flowering plants and animals was driven by whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e duplications followed by nonrandom <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> loss. Selection analysis suggests that the expansion of one B subunit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> family (B56/PPP2R5) was driven by functional diversification rather than by the maintenance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> dosage. We also observed reduced expansion rates in three distinct B subunit subclades. One of these subclades plays a highly conserved role in cell division, while the distribution of a second subclade suggests a specialized function in supporting beneficial microbial associations. Thus, while whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e duplications have driven the expansion and diversification of most PP2A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families, members of functionally specialized subclades quickly revert to singleton status after duplication events.</p>

Evolutionary Dynamics of Abundant Stop Codon Readthrough
<p>Translational stop codon readthrough emerged as a major regulatory mechanism affecting hundreds of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in animal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es, based on recent comparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ics and ribosomal profiling evidence, but its evolutionary properties remain unknown. Here, we leverage comparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic evidence across 21 <i>Anopheles</i> mosquitoes to systematically annotate readthrough <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in the malaria vector <i>Anopheles gambiae</i>, and to provide the first study of abundant readthrough evolution, by comparison with 20 <i>Drosophila</i> species. Using improved comparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ics methods for detecting readthrough, we identify evolutionary signatures of conserved, functional readthrough of 353 stop codons in the malaria vector, <i>Anopheles gambiae</i>, and of 51 additional <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> stop codons, including several cases of double and triple readthrough and of readthrough of two adjacent stop codons. We find that most differences between the readthrough repertoires of the two species arose from readthrough gain or loss in existing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, rather than birth of new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> death; that readthrough-associated RNA structures are sometimes gained or lost while readthrough persists; that readthrough is more likely to be lost at TAA and TAG stop codons; and that readthrough is under continued purifying evolutionary selection in mosquito, based on population <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic evidence. We also determine readthrough-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> properties that predate readthrough, and identify differences in the characteristic properties of readthrough <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s between clades. We estimate more than 600 functional readthrough stop codons in mosquito and 900 in fruit fly, provide evidence of readthrough control of peroxisomal targeting, and refine the phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic extent of abundant readthrough as following divergence from centipede.</p>

The Evolution of Innate Immune Genes: Purifying and Balancing Selection on β-Defensins in Waterfowl
<p>In disease dynamics, high immune <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> diversity can confer a selective advantage to hosts in the face of a rapidly evolving and diverse pathogen fauna. This is supported empirically for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s involved in pathogen recognition and signalling. In contrast, effector <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s involved in pathogen clearance may be more constrained. β-Defensins are innate immune effector <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s; their main mode of action is via disruption of microbial membranes. Here, five β-defensin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s were characterized in mallards (<i>Anas platyrhynchos</i>) and other waterfowl; key reservoir species for many zoonotic diseases. All five <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s showed remarkably low diversity at the individual-, population-, and species-level. Furthermore, there was widespread sharing of identical alleles across species divides. Thus, specific β-defensin alleles were maintained not only spatially but also over long temporal scales, with many amino acid residues being fixed across all species investigated. Purifying selection to maintain individual, highly efficacious alleles was the primary evolutionary driver of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in waterfowl. However, we also found evidence for balancing selection acting on the most recently duplicated β-defensin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> (<i>AvBD3b</i>). For this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>, we found that amino acid replacements were more likely to be radical changes, suggesting that duplication of β-defensin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s allows exploration of wider functional space. Structural conservation to maintain function appears to be crucial for avian β-defensin effector molecules, resulting in low tolerance for new allelic variants. This contrasts with other types of innate immune <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, such as receptor and signalling molecules, where balancing selection to maintain allelic diversity has been shown to be a strong evolutionary force.</p>

Old but Not (So) Degenerated—Slow Evolution of Largely Homomorphic Sex Chromosomes in Ratites
<p>De<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>ration of the nonrecombining chromosome is a common feature of sex chromosome evolution, readily evident by the presence of a pair of largely heteromorphic chromosomes, like in eutherian mammals and birds. However, in ratites (order Palaeognathae, including, e.g., ostrich), the Z and W chromosomes are similar in size and largely undifferentiated, despite avian sex chromosome evolution was initiated > 130 Ma. To better understand what may limit sex chromosome evolution, we performed ostrich transcriptome sequencing and studied <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s from the nonrecombining region of the W chromosome. Fourteen gametologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> pairs present on the W chromosome and Z chromosome were identified, with synonymous sequence divergence of 0.027–0.177. The location of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s on the Z chromosome was consistent with a sequential increase in divergence, starting 110–157 and ending 24–30 Ma. On the basis of the occurrence of Z-linked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s hemizygous in females, we estimate that about one-third of the Z chromosome does not recombine with the W chromosome in female meiosis. Pairwise <i>d</i><sub>N</sub><i>/d</i><sub>S</sub> between gametologs decreased with age, suggesting strong evolutionary constraint in old gametologs. Lineage-specific <i>d</i><sub>N</sub><i>/d</i><sub>S</sub> was consistently higher in W-linked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, in accordance with the lower efficacy of selection expected in nonrecombining chromosomes. A higher ratio of GC > AT:AT > GC substitutions in W-linked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s supports a role for GC-biased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> conversion in differentially driving base composition on the two sex chromosomes. A male-to-female (M:F) expression ratio of close to one for recombining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s and close to two for Z-linked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s lacking a W copy show that dosage compensation is essentially absent. Some gametologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s have retained active expression of the W copy in females (giving a M:F ratio of 1 for the gametologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> pair), whereas for others W expression has become severely reduced resulting in a M:F ratio of close to 2. These observations resemble the patterns of sex chromosome evolution seen in other avian and mammalian lineages, suggesting similar underlying evolutionary processes, although the rate of sex chromosome differentiation has been atypically low. Lack of dosage compensation may be a factor hindering sex chromosome evolution in this lineage.</p>

Efficient Inference of Recombination Hot Regions in Bacterial Genomes
<p>In eukaryotes, detailed surveys of recombination rates have shown variation at multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic scales and the presence of “hotspots” of highly elevated recombination. In bacteria, studies of recombination rate variation are less developed, in part because there are few analysis methods that take into account the clonal context within which bacterial evolution occurs. Here, we focus in particular on identifying “hot regions” of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e where DNA is transferred frequently between isolates. We present a computationally efficient algorithm based on the recently developed “chromosome painting” algorithm, which characterizes patterns of haplotype sharing across a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e. We compare the average <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e wide painting, which principally reflects clonal descent, with the painting for each site which additionally reflects the specific deviations at the site due to recombination. Using simulated data, we show that hot regions have consistently higher deviations from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e wide average than normal regions. We applied our approach to previously analyzed <i>Escherichia coli</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es and revealed that the new method is highly correlated with the number of recombination events affecting each site inferred by ClonalOrigin, a method that is only applicable to small numbers of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. Furthermore, we analyzed recombination hot regions in <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i> by using 200 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. We identified three recombination hot regions, which are enriched for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s related to membrane proteins. Our approach and its implementation, which is downloadable from <ext-link>https://github.com/bioprojects/orderedPainting</ext-link>, will help to develop a new phase of population <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic studies of recombination in prokaryotes.</p>

Expansion of Secretin-Like G Protein-Coupled Receptors and Their Peptide Ligands via Local Duplications Before and After Two Rounds of Whole-Genome Duplication
<p>In humans, the secretin-like G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family comprises 15 members with 18 corresponding peptide ligand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. Although members have been identified in a large variety of vertebrate and nonvertebrate species, the origin and relationship of these proteins remain unresolved. To address this issue, we employed large-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e comparisons to identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e fragments with conserved synteny and matched these fragments to linkage groups in reconstructed early gnathostome ancestral chromosomes (<i>GAC</i>). This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e comparison revealed that most receptor and peptide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s were clustered in three <i>GAC</i> linkage groups and suggested that the ancestral forms of five peptide subfamilies (corticotropin-releasing hormone-like, calcitonin-like, parathyroid hormone-like, glucagon-like, and growth hormone-releasing hormone-like) and their cognate receptor families emerged through tandem local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> duplications before two rounds (2R) of whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e duplication. These subfamily <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s have, then, been amplified by 2R whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e duplication, followed by additional local duplications and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> loss prior to the divergence of land vertebrates and teleosts. This study delineates a possible evolutionary scenario for whole secretin-like peptide and receptor family members and may shed light on evolutionary mechanisms for expansion of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> family with a large number of paralogs.</p>

Comparison of the complete genome sequences of four γ-hexachlorocyclohexane-degrading bacterial strains: insights into the evolution of bacteria able to degrade a recalcitrant man-made pesticide
<p>γ-Hexachlorocyclohexane (γ-HCH) is a recalcitrant man-made chlorinated pesticide. Here, the complete <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequences of four γ-HCH-degrading sphingomonad strains, which are most unlikely to have been derived from one ancestral γ-HCH degrader, were compared. Together with several experimental data, we showed that (i) all the four strains carry almost identical <i>linA</i> to <i>linE</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s for the conversion of γ-HCH to maleylacetate (designated “specific” <i>lin</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s), (ii) considerably different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s are used for the metabolism of maleylacetate in one of the four strains, and (iii) the <i>linKLMN</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s for the putative ABC transporter necessary for γ-HCH utilization exhibit structural divergence, which reflects the phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic relationship of their hosts. Replicon organization and location of the <i>lin</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in the four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es are significantly different with one another, and that most of the specific <i>lin</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s are located on multiple sphingomonad-unique <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plasmid</span></strong>s. Copies of IS<i>6100</i>, the most abundant insertion sequence in the four strains, are often located in close proximity to the specific <i>lin</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. Analysis of the footprints of target duplication upon IS<i>6100</i> transposition and the experimental detection of IS<i>6100</i> transposition strongly suggested that the IS<i>6100</i> transposition has caused dynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e rearrangements and the diversification of <i>lin</i>-flanking regions in the four strains.</p>

The chromatin accessibility landscape of primary human cancers

Integration of ATAC-seq (the assay for transposase-accessible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromatin</span></strong> using sequencing) with TCGA multi-omic data identifies a large number of putative distal enhancers that distinguish molecular subtypes of cancers, uncovers specific driving transcription factors via protein-DNA footprints, and nominates long-range <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>-regulatory interactions in cancer.

Propagation of Polycomb-repressed chromatin requires sequence-specific recruitment to DNA
<p>Epi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic inheritance models posit that during Polycomb repression, Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) propagates histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) independently of DNA sequence. We show that insertion of Polycomb response element (PRE) DNA into the <i>Drosophila</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e creates extended domains of H3K27me3-modified nucleosomes in the flanking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromatin</span></strong> and causes repression of a linked reporter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>. After excision of PRE DNA, H3K27me3 nucleosomes become diluted with each round of DNA replication, and reporter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> repression is lost. After excision in replication-stalled cells, H3K27me3 levels stay high and repression persists. H3K27me3-marked nucleosomes therefore provide a memory of repression that is transmitted in a sequence-independent manner to daughter strand DNA during replication. In contrast, propagation of H3K27 trimethylation to newly incorporated nucleosomes requires sequence-specific targeting of PRC2 to PRE DNA.</p>

Genetics of Variable Disease Expression Conferred by Inverse Gene-For-Gene Interactions in the Wheat-<i>Parastagonospora nodorum</i> Pathosystem
<p>The wheat-<i>Parastagonospora nodorum</i> pathosystem involves the recognition of pathogen-secreted necrotrophic effectors (NEs) by corresponding wheat NE sensitivity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. This inverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>-for-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> recognition leads to necrotrophic effector-triggered susceptibility and ultimately septoria nodorum blotch disease. Here, we used multiple pathogen isolates to individually evaluate the effects of the host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>-NE interactions <i>Tan spot necrosis1</i>-Stagonospora nodorum ToxinA (<i>Tsn1</i>-SnToxA), <i>Stagonospora nodorum necrosis1</i>-Stagonospora nodorum Toxin1 (<i>Snn1</i>-SnTox1), and <i>Stagonospora nodorum necrosis3-B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e homeolog1</i>-Stagonospora nodorum Toxin3 (<i>Snn3-B1</i>-SnTox3), alone and in various combinations, to determine the relative importance of these interactions in causing disease. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic analysis of a recombinant inbred wheat population inoculated separately with three <i>P. nodorum</i> isolates, all of which produce all three NEs, indicated that the <i>Tsn1</i>-SnToxA and <i>Snn3-B1</i>-SnTox3 interactions contributed to disease caused by all four isolates, but their effects varied and ranged from epistatic to additive. The <i>Snn1</i>-SnTox1 interaction was associated with increased disease for one isolate, but for other isolates, there was evidence that this interaction inhibited the expression of other host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>-NE interactions. RNA sequencing analysis in planta showed that <i>SnTox1</i> was differentially expressed between these three isolates after infection. Further analysis of NE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>-knockout isolates showed that the effect of some interactions could be masked or inhibited by other compatible interactions, and the regulation of this occurs at the level of NE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> transcription. Collectively, these results show that the inverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>-for-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> interactions leading to necrotrophic effector-triggered susceptibility in the wheat-<i>P. nodorum</i> pathosystem vary in their effects depending on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic backgrounds of the pathogen and host, and interplay among the interactions is complex and intricately regulated.</p>

Healthy Roots and Leaves: Comparative Genome Structure of Horseradish and Watercress
<p>Horseradish (<i>Armoracia rusticana</i>) and watercress (<i>Nasturtium officinale</i>) are economically important cruciferous vegetable species with limited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic resources. We used comparative chromosome painting to identify the extent of chromosomal collinearity between horseradish and watercress, and to reconstruct the origin and evolution of the two tetraploid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es (2<i>n</i> = 4<i>x</i> = 32). Our results show that horseradish and watercress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es originated from a common ancestral (<i>n</i> = 8) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e, structurally resembling the Ancestral Crucifer Karyotype (<i>n</i> = 8), which, however, contained two unique translocation chromosomes (AK6/8 and AK8/6). Except for a 2.4-Mb unequal chromosome translocation in watercress, both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es are structurally identical. The structural similarity of the two parental sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es might suggest an autotetraploid origin of horseradish and watercress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. The sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e stasis, apart from the single-chromosome translocation, indicates that homeologous recombination played a limited role in postpolyploid evolution in both tetraploid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. The octoploid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e of one-rowed watercress (<i>N. microphyllum</i>, 2<i>n</i> = 8<i>x</i> = 64), structurally mirroring the tetraploid horseradish and watercress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es, originated via autopolyploidization from the immediate tetraploid predecessor of watercress or hybridization between this and another now-extinct tetraploid <i>Nasturtium</i> species. These comparative cyto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic maps in horseradish and watercress represent a first stepping stone for future whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequencing efforts and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic improvement of both crop species.</p>

Characterization of Imprinted Genes in Rice Reveals Conservation of Regulation and Imprinting with Other Plant Species
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic imprinting is an epi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic phenomenon by which certain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s display differential expression in a parent-of-origin-dependent manner. Hundreds of imprinted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s have been identified from several plant species. Here, we identified, with a high level of confidence, 208 imprinted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> candidates from rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). Imprinted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s of rice showed limited association with the transposable elements, which contrasts with findings from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>rally, imprinting in rice is conserved within a species, but intraspecific variation also was detected. The imprinted rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s do not show signatures of selection, which suggests that domestication has had a limited evolutionary consequence on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic imprinting. Although conservation of imprinting in plants is limited, we show that some loci are imprinted in several different species. Moreover, our results suggest that different types of epi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic regulation can be established either before or after fertilization. Imprinted 24-nucleotide small RNAs and their neighboring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s tend to express alleles from different parents. This association was not observed between 21-nucleotide small RNAs and their neighboring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. Together, our findings suggest that the regulation of imprinting can be diverse, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic imprinting has evolutionary and biological significance.</p>

Unique Physiological and Transcriptional Shifts under Combinations of Salinity, Drought, and Heat
<p>Climate-change-driven stresses such as extreme temperatures, water deficit, and ion imbalance are projected to exacerbate and jeopardize global food security. Under field conditions, these stresses usually occur simultaneously and cause damages that exceed single stresses. Here, we investigated the transcriptional patterns and morpho-physiological acclimations of <i>Brachypodium dystachion</i> to single salinity, drought, and heat stresses, as well as their double and triple stress combinations. Hierarchical clustering analysis of morpho-physiological acclimations showed that several traits exhibited a gradually aggravating effect as plants were exposed to combined stresses. On the other hand, other morphological traits were dominated by salinity, while some physiological traits were shaped by heat stress. Response patterns of differentially expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, under single and combined stresses (i.e. common stress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s), were maintained only among 37% of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, indicating a limited expression consistency among partially overlapping stresses. A comparison between common stress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s that were uniquely expressed only under combined stresses (i.e. combination unique <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s) revealed a significant shift from increased intensity to antagonistic responses, respectively. The different transcriptional signatures imply an alteration in the mode of action under combined stresses and limited ability to predict plant responses as different stresses are combined. Coexpression analysis coupled with enrichment analysis revealed that each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> subset was enriched with different biological processes. Common stress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s were enriched with known stress response pathways, while combination unique-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s were enriched with unique processes and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s with unknown functions that hold the potential to improve stress tolerance and enhance cereal productivity under suboptimal field conditions.</p>

Genetic Bases of Fungal White Rot Wood Decay Predicted by Phylogenomic Analysis of Correlated Gene-Phenotype Evolution
<p>Fungal decomposition of plant cell walls (PCW) is a complex process that has diverse industrial applications and huge impacts on the carbon cycle. White rot (WR) is a powerful mode of PCW decay in which lignin and carbohydrates are both degraded. Mechanistic studies of decay coupled with comparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic analyses have provided clues to the enzymatic components of WR systems and their evolutionary origins, but the complete suite of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s necessary for WR remains undetermined. Here, we use phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic comparative methods, which we validate through simulations, to identify shifts in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> family diversification rates that are correlated with evolution of WR, using data from 62 fungal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. We detected 409 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families that appear to be evolutionarily correlated with WR. The identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families encode well-characterized decay enzymes, e.g., fungal class II peroxidases and cellobiohydrolases, and enzymes involved in import and detoxification pathways, as well as 73 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families that have no functional annotation. About 310 of the 409 identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families are present in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e of the model WR fungus <i>Phanerochaete chrysosporium</i> and 192 of these (62%) have been shown to be upregulated under ligninolytic culture conditions, which corroborates the phylogeny-based functional inferences. These results illuminate the complexity of WR and suggest that its evolution has involved a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>ral elaboration of the decay apparatus, including numerous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families with as-yet unknown exact functions.</p>

The Genotype–Phenotype Map of Yeast Complex Traits: Basic Parameters and the Role of Natural Selection
<p>Most phenotypic traits are controlled by many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, but a global picture of the genotype–phenotype map (GPM) is lacking. For example, in no species do we know <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>rally how many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s affect a trait and how large these effects are. It is also unclear to what extent GPMs are shaped by natural selection. Here we address these fundamental questions using the reverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic data of 220 morphological traits in 4,718 budding yeast strains, each of which lacks a nonessential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>. We show that 1) the proportion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s affecting a trait varies from <1% to >30%, averaging 6%, 2) most traits are impacted by many more small-effect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s than large-effect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, and 3) the mean effect of all nonessential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s on a trait decreases precipitously as the estimated importance of the trait to fitness increases. An analysis of 3,116 yeast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion traits in 754 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>-deletion strains reveals a similar pattern. These findings illustrate the power of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e-wide reverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tics in genotype–phenotype mapping, uncover an enormous range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic complexity of phenotypic traits, and suggest that the GPM of cellular organisms has been shaped by natural selection for mutational robustness.</p>

Molecular Characterization and Evolution of a Gene Family Encoding Both Female- and Male-Specific Reproductive Proteins in <i>Drosophila</i>
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> duplication is an important mechanism for the evolution of new reproductive proteins. However, in most cases, each resulting paralog continues to function within the same sex. To investigate the possibility that seminal fluid proteins arise through duplicates of female reproductive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s that become “co-opted” by males, we screened female reproductive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> for cases of duplication in which one of the resulting paralogs produces a protein in males that is transferred to females during mating. We identified a set of three tandemly duplicated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s that encode secreted serine-type endopeptidase homologs, two of which are expressed primarily in the female reproductive tract (RT), whereas the third is expressed specifically in the male RT and encodes a seminal fluid protein. Evolutionary and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion analyses across <i>Drosophila</i> species suggest that this family arose from a single-copy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> that was female-specific; after duplication, one paralog evolved male-specific expression. Functional tests of knockdowns of each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> in <i>D. melanogaster</i> show that one female-expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> is essential for full fecundity, and both female-expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s contribute singly or in combination to a female’s propensity to remate. In contrast, knockdown of the male-expressed paralog had no significant effect on female fecundity or remating. These data are consistent with a model in which members of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> family exert effects on females by acting on a common, female-expressed target. After duplication and male co-option of one paralog, the evolution of the interacting proteins could have resulted in differential strengths or effects of each paralog.</p>

Large Numbers of Novel miRNAs Originate from DNA Transposons and Are Coincident with a Large Species Radiation in Bats
<p>Vesper bats (family Vespertilionidae) experienced a rapid adaptive radiation beginning around 36 Ma that resulted in the second most species-rich mammalian family (>400 species). Coincident with that radiation was an initial burst of DNA transposon activity that has continued into the present in some species. Such extensive and recent DNA transposon activity has not been seen in any other extant mammal. Indeed, retrotransposon activity is much more common in all other sequenced mammal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. Deep sequencing of the small RNA fraction from a vespertilionid bat, <i>Eptesicus fuscus</i>, as well as a dog and horse revealed large numbers of 17–24 bp putative miRNAs (p/miRNAs). Although the origination rate of p/miRNAs is similar in all three taxa, 61.1% of postdivergence p/miRNAs in <i>Eptesicus</i> are derived from transposable elements (TEs) compared with only 23.9% and 16.5% in the dog and horse, respectively. Not surprisingly, given the retrotransposon bias of dog and horse, the majority of TE-derived p/miRNAs are associated with retrotransposons. In <i>Eptesicus</i>, however, 58.7% of the TE-derived and 35.9% of the total p/miRNAs arose not from retrotransposons but from bat-specific DNA transposons. Notably, we observe that the timing of the DNA transposon expansion and the resulting introduction of novel p/miRNAs coincide with the rapid diversification of the family Vespertilionidae. Furthermore, potential targets of the DNA transposon-derived p/miRNAs are identifiable and enriched for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s that are important for regulation of transcription. We propose that lineage-specific DNA transposon activity lead to the rapid and repeated introduction of novel p/miRNAs. Some of these p/miRNAs are likely functional miRNAs and potentially influenced the diversification of Vespertilionidae. Our observations suggest a mechanism for introducing functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic variation rapidly through the expansion of DNA transposons that fits within the TE-thrust hypothesis.</p>

Evidence for Selection on Gene Expression in Cultivated Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>)
<p>Artificial selection has been used throughout plant domestication and breeding to develop crops that are adapted to diverse environments. Here, we investigate whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> regulatory changes have been widespread targets of lineage-specific selection in cultivated lines Minghui 63 and Zhenshan 97 of rice, <i>Oryza sativa</i>. A line experiencing positive selection for either an increase or a decrease in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s' transcript abundances is expected to have an overabundance of expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) alleles that increase or decrease those <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s' expression, respectively. Results indicate that several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s that share <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> Ontology terms or are members of the same coexpression module have eQTL alleles from one parent that consistently increase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion relative to the second parent. A second line of evidence for lineage-specific selection is an overabundance of <i>cis–trans</i> pairs of eQTL alleles that affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion in the same direction (are reinforcing). Across all <i>cis–trans</i> pairs of eQTL, including pairs that both weakly and strongly affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion, there is no evidence for selection. However, the frequency of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s with reinforcing eQTL increases with eQTL strength. Therefore, there is evidence that eQTL with strong effects were positively selected during rice cultivation. Among 41 <i>cis–trans</i> pairs with strong <i>trans</i> eQTL, 31 have reinforcing eQTL. Several of the candidate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s under positive selection accurately predict phenotypic differences between Minghui 63 and Zhenshan 97. Overall, our results suggest that positive selection for regulatory alleles may be a key factor in plant improvement.</p>

Correlation between genome reduction and bacterial growth
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e reduction by removing dispensable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic sequences in bacteria is commonly used in both fundamental and applied studies to determine the minimal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic requirements for a living system or to develop highly efficient bioreactors. Nevertheless, whether and how the accumulative loss of dispensable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic sequences disturbs bacterial growth remains unclear. To investigate the relationship between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e reduction and growth, a series of <i>Escherichia coli</i> strains carrying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es reduced in a stepwise manner were used. Intensive growth analyses revealed that the accumulation of multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic deletions caused decreases in the exponential growth rate and the saturated cell density in a deletion-length-dependent manner as well as gradual changes in the patterns of growth dynamics, regardless of the growth media. Accordingly, a perspective growth model linking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e evolution to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e engineering was proposed. This study provides the first demonstration of a quantitative connection between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic sequence and bacterial growth, indicating that growth rate is potentially associated with dispensable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic sequences.</p>

Ssrp1a controls organogenesis by promoting cell cycle progression and RNA synthesis
<p>Tightly controlled DNA replication and RNA transcription are essential for differentiation and tissue growth in multicellular organisms. Histone chaperones, including the FACT (facilitates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromatin</span></strong> transcription) complex, are central for these processes and act by mediating DNA access through nucleosome reorganisation. However, their roles in vertebrate organo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>sis are poorly understood. Here, we report the identification of zebrafish mutants for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> encoding Structure specific recognition protein 1a (Ssrp1a), which, together with Spt16, forms the FACT heterodimer. Focussing on the liver and eye, we show that zygotic Ssrp1a is essential for proliferation and differentiation during organo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>sis. Specifically, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion indicative of progressive organ differentiation is disrupted and RNA transcription is globally reduced. Ssrp1a-deficient embryos exhibit DNA synthesis defects and prolonged S phase, uncovering a role distinct from that of Spt16, which promotes G<sub>1</sub> phase progression. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> deletion/replacement experiments in <i>Drosophila</i> show that Ssrp1b, Ssrp1a and N-terminal Ssrp1a, equivalent to the yeast homologue Pob3, can substitute <i>Drosophila</i> Ssrp function. These data suggest that (1) Ssrp1b does not compensate for Ssrp1a loss in the zebrafish embryo, probably owing to insufficient expression levels, and (2) despite fundamental structural differences, the mechanisms mediating DNA accessibility by FACT are conserved between yeast and metazoans. We propose that the essential functions of Ssrp1a in DNA replication and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> transcription, together with its dynamic spatiotemporal expression, ensure organ-specific differentiation and proportional growth, which are crucial for the forming embryo.</p>

Quantitative assay for TALEN activity at endogenous genomic loci
<p>Artificially designed nucleases such as zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) can induce a targeted DNA double-strand break at the specific target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic locus, leading to the frameshift-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> disruption. However, the assays for their activity on the endogenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic loci remain limited. Herein, we describe a versatile modified <i>lacZ</i> assay to detect frameshifts in the nuclease target site. Short fragments of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e DNA at the target or putative off-target loci were amplified from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic DNA of TALEN-treated or control embryos, and were inserted into the <i>lacZα</i> sequence for the conventional blue–white selection. The frequency of the frameshifts in the fragment can be estimated from the numbers of blue and white colonies. Insertions and/or deletions were easily determined by sequencing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plasmid</span></strong> DNAs recovered from the positive colonies. Our technique should offer broad application to the artificial nucleases for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e editing in various types of model organisms.</p>

Out of Water: The Origin and Early Diversification of Plant <i>R</i>-Genes
<p>During plant-pathogen interactions, plants use intracellular proteins with nucleotide-binding site and Leu-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) domains to detect pathogens. NBS-LRR proteins represent a major class of plant disease resistance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s (<i>R</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s). Whereas <i>R</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s have been well characterized in angiosperms, little is known about their origin and early diversification. Here, we perform comprehensive evolutionary analyses of <i>R</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in plants and report the identification of <i>R</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in basal-branching streptophytes, including charophytes, liverworts, and mosses. Phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic analyses suggest that plant <i>R</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s originated in charophytes and R-proteins diversified into TIR-NBS-LRR proteins and non-TIR-NBS-LRR proteins in charophytes. Moreover, we show that plant R-proteins evolved in a modular fashion through frequent gain or loss of protein domains. Most of the <i>R</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in basal-branching streptophytes underwent adaptive evolution, indicating an ancient involvement of <i>R</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in plant-pathogen interactions. Our findings provide novel insights into the origin and evolution of <i>R</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s and the mechanisms underlying colonization of terrestrial environments by plants.</p>

FERTILIZATION-INDEPENDENT SEED-Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 Plays a Dual Role in Regulating Type I MADS-Box Genes in Early Endosperm Development
<p>Early endosperm development presents a unique system in which to uncover epi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic regulatory mechanisms because the contributing maternal and paternal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es possess differential epi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic modifications. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the initiation of endosperm coenocytic growth upon fertilization and the transition to endosperm cellularization are regulated by the FERTILIZATION-INDEPENDENT SEED (FIS)-Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), a putative H3K27 methyltransferase. Here, we address the possible role of the FIS-PRC2 complex in regulating the type I MADS-box <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> family, which has been shown previously to regulate early endosperm development. We show that a subclass of type I MADS-box <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s (C2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s) was expressed in distinct domains of the coenocytic endosperm in wild-type seeds. Furthermore, the C2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s were mostly up-regulated biallelically during the extended coenocytic phase of endosperm development in the FIS-PRC2 mutant background. Using allele-specific expression analysis, we also identified a small subset of C2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s subjected to FIS-PRC2-dependent maternal or FIS-PRC2-independent paternal imprinting. Our data support a dual role for the FIS-PRC2 complex in the regulation of C2 type I MADS-box <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, as evidenced by a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>ralized role in the repression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion at both alleles associated with endosperm cellularization and a specialized role in silencing the maternal allele of imprinted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s.</p>

LTR_retriever: A Highly Accurate and Sensitive Program for Identification of Long Terminal Repeat Retrotransposons
<p>Long terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTR-RTs) are prevalent in plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. The identification of LTR-RTs is critical for achieving high-quality <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> annotation. Based on the well-conserved structure, multiple programs were developed for the de novo identification of LTR-RTs; however, these programs are associated with low specificity and high false discovery rates. Here, we report LTR_retriever, a multithreading-empowered Perl program that identifies LTR-RTs and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>rates high-quality LTR libraries from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic sequences. LTR_retriever demonstrated significant improvements by achieving high levels of sensitivity (91%), specificity (97%), accuracy (96%), and precision (90%) in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). LTR_retriever is also compatible with long sequencing reads. With 40k self-corrected PacBio reads equivalent to 4.5× <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e coverage in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the constructed LTR library showed excellent sensitivity and specificity. In addition to canonical LTR-RTs with 5′-TG…CA-3′ termini, LTR_retriever also identifies noncanonical LTR-RTs (non-TGCA), which have been largely ignored in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e-wide studies. We identified seven types of noncanonical LTRs from 42 out of 50 plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. The majority of noncanonical LTRs are <i>Copia</i> elements, with which the LTR is four times shorter than that of other <i>Copia</i> elements, which may be a result of their target specificity. Strikingly, non-TGCA <i>Copia</i> elements are often located in genic regions and preferentially insert nearby or within <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, indicating their impact on the evolution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s and their potential as muta<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>sis tools.</p>

Arabidopsis Novel Glycine-Rich Plasma Membrane PSS1 Protein Enhances Disease Resistance in Transgenic Soybean Plants
<p>Nonhost resistance is defined as the immunity of a plant species to all nonadapted pathogen species. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) ecotype Columbia-0 is nonhost to the oomycete plant pathogen <i>Phytophthora sojae</i> and the fungal plant pathogen <i>Fusarium virguliforme</i> that are pathogenic to soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>). Previously, we reported <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>rating the <i>pss1</i> mutation in the <i>pen1-1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic background as well as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic mapping and characterization of the Arabidopsis nonhost resistance <i>Phytophthora sojae</i>-susceptible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> locus, <i>PSS1</i>. In this study, we identified six candidate <i>PSS1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s by comparing single-nucleotide polymorphisms of (1) the bulked DNA sample of seven F<sub>2:3</sub> families homozygous for the <i>pss1</i> allele and (2) the <i>pen1-1</i> mutant with Columbia-0. Analyses of T-DNA insertion mutants for each of these candidate <i>PSS1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s identified the <i>At3g59640</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> encoding a glycine-rich protein as the putative <i>PSS1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>. Later, complementation analysis confirmed the identity of <i>At3g59640</i> as the <i>PSS1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>. <i>PSS1</i> is induced following <i>P. sojae</i> infection as well as expressed in an organ-specific manner. Coexpression analysis of the available transcriptomic data followed by reverse transcriptase-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymerase chain react</span></strong>ion suggested that <i>PSS1</i> is coregulated with <i>ATG8a</i> (<i>At4g21980</i>), a core <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> in autophagy. PSS1 contains a predicted single membrane-spanning domain. Subcellular localization study indicated that it is an integral plasma membrane protein. Sequence analysis suggested that soybean is unlikely to contain a PSS1-like defense function. Following the introduction of <i>PSS1</i> into the soybean cultivar Williams 82, the transgenic plants exhibited enhanced resistance to <i>F. virguliforme</i>, the pathogen that causes sudden death syndrome.</p>

Deubiquitinating Enzyme OTU5 Contributes to DNA Methylation Patterns and Is Critical for Phosphate Nutrition Signals
<p>Phosphate (Pi) starvation induces a suite of adaptive responses aimed at recalibrating cellular Pi homeostasis. Plants harboring a mutation in <i>OVARIAN TUMOR DOMAIN-CONTAINING DEUBIQUITINATING ENZYME5</i> (<i>OTU5</i>) showed altered DNA methylation of root hair-related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s and altered Pi-responsive root traits. Unlike the wild type, homozygous <i>otu5</i> mutants did not respond to Pi starvation by increased lateral root formation and increased root hair length but formed very short root hairs when grown on low-Pi media. Under Pi-replete conditions, <i>otu5</i> plants developed more root hairs than the wild type due to attenuated primary root growth, a phenotype that resembled that of Pi-deficient plants. Growth of plants on low-Pi media altered both H3K4 and H3K27 trimethylation levels at the transcriptional start site of a subset of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s encoding key players in Pi homeostasis, which was correlated with mRNA abundance changes of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. Pi starvation had a minor impact on DNA methylation. Differentially methylated regions were enriched in transposable elements, suggesting that DNA methylation associated with low Pi supply is required for maintaining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e integrity. It is concluded that DNA methylation and histone methylation constitute critical, interdependent regulatory components that orchestrate the activity of a subset of Pi-responsive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s.</p>

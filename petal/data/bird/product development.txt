<i>ELIGULUM-A</i> Regulates Lateral Branch and Leaf Development in Barley
<p>The shoot apical and axillary meristems control shoot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, effectively influencing lateral branch and leaf formation. The barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) <i>uniculm2</i> (<i>cul2</i>) mutation blocks axillary meristem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, and mutant plants lack lateral branches (tillers) that normally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong> from the crown. A genetic screen for <i>cul2</i> suppressors recovered two recessive alleles of <i>ELIGULUM-A</i> (<i>ELI-A</i>) that partially rescued the <i>cul2</i> tillering phenotype. Mutations in <i>ELI-A</i> produce shorter plants with fewer tillers and disrupt the leaf blade-sheath boundary, producing liguleless leaves and reduced secondary cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in stems and leaves. <i>ELI-A</i> is predicted to encode an unannotated protein containing an RNaseH-like domain that is conserved in land plants. <i>ELI-A</i> transcripts accumulate at the preligule boundary, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing ligule, leaf margins, cells destined to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong> secondary cell walls, and cells surrounding leaf vascular bundles. Recent studies have identified regulatory similarities between boundary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in leaves and lateral organs. Interestingly, we observed <i>ELI-A</i> transcripts at the preligule boundary, suggesting that <i>ELI-A</i> contributes to boundary formation between the blade and sheath. However, we did not observe <i>ELI-A</i> transcripts at the axillary meristem boundary in leaf axils, suggesting that <i>ELI-A</i> is not involved in boundary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment for axillary meristem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Our results show that <i>ELI-A</i> contributes to leaf and lateral branch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment by acting as a boundary gene during ligule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment but not during lateral branch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment.</p>

<i>PINOID</i> Is Required for Formation of the Stigma and Style in Rice
<p>The stigma is the entry point for sexual re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion in plants, but the mechanisms underlying stigma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment are largely unknown. Here, we disrupted putative auxin biosynthetic and signaling genes to evaluate their roles in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Disruption of the rice <i>PINOID</i> (<i>OsPID</i>) gene completely eliminated the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of stigmas, and overexpression of <i>OsPID</i> led to overproliferation of stigmas, suggesting that <i>OsPID</i> is a key determinant for stigma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Interestingly, <i>ospid</i> mutants did not display defects in flower initiation, nor did they <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong> any pin-like inflorescences, a characteristic phenotype observed in <i>pid</i> mutants in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). We constructed double mutants of <i>OsPID</i> and its closest homolog, <i>OsPIDb</i>, yet the double mutants still did not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong> any pin-like inflorescences, indicating that either <i>ospid</i> is compensated by additional homologous genes or <i>OsPID</i> has different functions in rice compared with <i>PID</i> in other organisms. We then knocked out one of the <i>NAKED PINS IN YUC MUTANTS</i> (<i>NPY</i>) genes, which cause the formation of pin-like inflorescences in Arabidopsis when compromised, in the <i>ospid</i> background. The <i>ospid osnpy2</i> double mutants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ed pin-like inflorescences, which were phenotypically similar to <i>pid</i> mutants in Arabidopsis and maize, demonstrating that the roles of <i>OsPID</i> in inflorescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment are likely masked by redundant partners. This work identified a key determinant for stigma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in rice and revealed a complex picture of the <i>PID</i> gene in rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Furthermore, the stigma-less <i>ospid</i> mutants are potentially useful in producing hybrid rice.</p>

Transcription Factor OsTGA10 Is a Target of the MADS Protein OsMADS8 and Is Required for Tapetum Development
<p>This study aimed at elucidating regulatory components behind floral organ identity determination and tissue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. It remains unclear how organ identity proteins facilitate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of organ primordia into tissues with a determined identity, even though it has long been accepted that floral organ identity is genetically determined by interaction of identity genes according to the ABC model. Using the chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing technique, we identified <i>OsTGA10</i>, encoding a bZIP transcription factor, as a target of the MADS box protein OsMADS8, which is annotated as an E-class organ identity protein. We characterized the function of OsTGA10 using genetic and molecular analyses. <i>OsTGA10</i> was preferentially expressed during stamen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, and mutation of <i>OsTGA10</i> resulted in male sterility. OsTGA10 was required for tapetum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and functioned by interacting with known tapetum genes. In addition, in <i>ostga10</i> stamens, the hallmark cell wall thickening of the endothecium was defective. Our findings suggest that OsTGA10 plays a mediator role between organ identity determination and tapetum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in rice stamen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, between tapetum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and microspore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, and between various regulatory components required for tapetum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Furthermore, the defective endothecium in <i>ostga10</i> implies that cell wall thickening of endothecium is dependent on tapetum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment.</p>

Non-invasive long-term fluorescence live imaging of <i>Tribolium castaneum</i> embryos
<p>Insect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment has contributed significantly to our understanding of metazoan <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. However, most information has been obtained by analyzing a single species, the fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Embryonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of the red flour beetle <i>Tribolium castaneum</i> differs fundamentally from that of <i>Drosophila</i> in aspects such as short-germ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, embryonic leg <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, extensive extra-embryonic membrane formation and non-involuted head <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Although <i>Tribolium</i> has become the second most important insect model organism, previous live imaging attempts have addressed only specific questions and no long-term live imaging data of <i>Tribolium</i> embryogenesis have been available. By combining light sheet-based fluorescence microscopy with a novel mounting method, we achieved complete, continuous and non-invasive fluorescence live imaging of <i>Tribolium</i> embryogenesis at high spatiotemporal resolution. The embryos survived the 2-day or longer imaging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">process</span></strong>, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ed into adults and produced fertile progeny. Our data document all morphogenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">process</span></strong>es from the rearrangement of the uniform blastoderm to the onset of regular muscular movement in the same embryo and in four orientations, contributing significantly to the understanding of <i>Tribolium</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Furthermore, we created a comprehensive chronological table of <i>Tribolium</i> embryogenesis, integrating most previous work and providing a reference for future studies. Based on our observations, we provide evidence that serosa window closure and serosa opening, although deferred by more than 1 day, are linked. All our long-term imaging datasets are available as a resource for the community. <i>Tribolium</i> is only the second insect species, after <i>Drosophila</i>, for which non-invasive long-term fluorescence live imaging has been achieved.</p>

Renewable acrylonitrile production
<p>Acrylonitrile (ACN) is a petroleum-derived compound used in resins, polymers, acrylics, and carbon fiber. We present a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">process</span></strong> for renewable ACN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion using 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP), which can be produced microbially from sugars. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">process</span></strong> achieves ACN molar yields exceeding 90% from ethyl 3-hydroxypropanoate (ethyl 3-HP) via dehydration and nitrilation with ammonia over an inexpensive titanium dioxide solid acid catalyst. We further describe an integrated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">process</span></strong> modeled at scale that is based on this chemistry and achieves near-quantitative ACN yields (98 ± 2%) from ethyl acrylate. This endothermic approach eliminates runaway reaction hazards and achieves higher yields than the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> propylene ammoxidation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">process</span></strong>. Avoidance of hydrogen cyanide as a by-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong> also improves <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">process</span></strong> safety and mitigates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong> handling requirements.</p>

ABC Transporter-Mediated Transport of Glutathione Conjugates Enhances Seed Yield and Quality in Chickpea
<p>The identification of functionally relevant molecular tags is vital for genomics-assisted crop improvement and enhancement of seed yield, quality, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ivity in chickpea (<i>Cicer arietinum</i>). The simultaneous improvement of yield/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ivity as well as quality traits often requires pyramiding of multiple genes, which remains a major hurdle given various associated epistatic and pleotropic effects. Unfortunately, no single gene that can improve yield/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ivity along with quality and other desirable agromorphological traits is known, hampering the genetic enhancement of chickpea. Using a combinatorial genomics-assisted breeding and functional genomics strategy, this study identified natural alleles and haplotypes of an <i>ABCC3</i>-type transporter gene that regulates seed weight, an important domestication trait, by transcriptional regulation and modulation of the transport of glutathione conjugates in seeds of <i>desi</i> and <i>kabuli</i> chickpea. The superior allele/haplotype of this gene introgressed in <i>desi</i> and <i>kabuli</i> near-isogenic lines enhances the seed weight, yield, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ivity, and multiple desirable plant architecture and seed-quality traits without compromising agronomic performance. These salient findings can expedite crop improvement endeavors and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of nutritionally enriched high-yielding cultivars in chickpea.</p>

Importin β4 Mediates Nuclear Import of GRF-Interacting Factors to Control Ovule Development in Arabidopsis
<p>Ovule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment is critical for seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and plant re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion. Multiple transcription factors (TFs) have been reported to mediate ovule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. However, it is not clear which intracellular components regulate these TFs during ovule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. After their synthesis, TFs are transported into the nucleus a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">process</span></strong> regulated by karyopherins commonly known as importin alpha and β. Around half of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) importin β-coding genes have been functionally characterized but only two with specific cargos have been identified. We report here that Arabidopsis IMPORTIN β4 (IMB4) regulates ovule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment through nucleocytoplasmic transport of transcriptional coactivator growth regulating factors–interacting factors (GIFs). Mutations in <i>IMB4</i> impaired ovule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment by affecting integument growth. <i>imb4</i> mutants were also defective in embryo sac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, leading to partial female sterility. IMB4 directly interacts with GIFs and is critical for the nucleocytoplasmic transport of GIF1. Finally, functional loss of <i>GIF</i>s resulted in ovule defects similar to those in <i>imb4</i> mutants, whereas enhanced expression of <i>GIF1</i> partially restored the fertility of <i>imb4</i>. The results presented here uncover a novel genetic pathway regulating ovule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and reveal the upstream regulator of GIFs.</p>

Ribosomal RNA Biogenesis and Its Response to Chilling Stress in <i>Oryza sativa</i>
<p>Ribosome biogenesis is crucial for plant growth and environmental acclimation. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">process</span></strong>ing of ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) is an essential step in ribosome biogenesis and begins with transcription of the rDNA. The resulting precursor-rRNA (pre-rRNA) transcript undergoes systematic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">process</span></strong>ing, where multiple endonucleolytic and exonucleolytic cleavages remove the external and internal transcribed spacers (ETS and ITS). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">process</span></strong>ing sites and pathways for pre-rRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">process</span></strong>ing have been deciphered in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> and, to some extent, in <i>Xenopus laevis</i>, mammalian cells, and Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). However, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">process</span></strong>ing sites and pathways remain largely unknown in crops, particularly in monocots such as rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), one of the most important food resources in the world. Here, we identified the rRNA precursors produced during rRNA biogenesis and the critical endonucleolytic cleavage sites in the transcribed spacer regions of pre-rRNAs in rice. We further found that two pre-rRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">process</span></strong>ing pathways, distinguished by the order of 5′ ETS removal and ITS1 cleavage, coexist in vivo. Moreover, exposing rice to chilling stress resulted in the inhibition of rRNA biogenesis mainly at the pre-rRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">process</span></strong>ing level, suggesting that these energy-intensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">process</span></strong>es may be reduced to increase acclimation and survival at lower temperatures. Overall, our study identified the pre-rRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">process</span></strong>ing pathway in rice and showed that ribosome biogenesis is quickly inhibited by low temperatures, which may shed light on the link between ribosome biogenesis and environmental acclimation in crop plants.</p>

Jasmonate Negatively Regulates Stomatal Development in Arabidopsis Cotyledons
<p>Stomata are ports that facilitate gas and water vapor exchange between plants and their environment. Stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment is strictly regulated by endogenous signals and environmental cues. Jasmonate is an important signal that modulates multiple physiological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">process</span></strong>es in plants, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying its interactions with other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>mental signaling pathways remain poorly understood. Here, we show that jasmonate negatively regulates stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) cotyledons. Cotyledons of the wild type and stomata-overproliferating mutants (such as <i>too many mouths-1</i> and <i>stomatal density and distribution1-1</i>) treated with methyl jasmonate exhibit a clear reduction in stomata number. By contrast, blocking endogenous jasmonate biosynthesis or perception enhanced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Moreover, three MYC transcription factors involved in jasmonate signaling, MYC2, MYC3, and MYC4, were found to redundantly modulate jasmonate-inhibited stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. A genetic analysis showed that these MYC proteins act upstream of the SPEECHLESS and FAMA transcription factors to mediate stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Furthermore, jasmonate repression of stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment is dependent on these three MYC transcription factors, as stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of the <i>myc2 myc3 myc4</i> triple mutant was insensitive to methyl jasmonate treatment. Collectively, our study demonstrates that jasmonate and MYC transcription factors negatively regulate stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in Arabidopsis cotyledons.</p>

WT1 regulates the development of the posterior taste field
<p>Despite the importance of taste in determining nutrient intake, our understanding of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">process</span></strong>es that control the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of the peripheral taste system is lacking. Several early regulators of taste <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment have been identified, including sonic hedgehog, bone morphogenetic protein 4 and multiple members of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. However, the regulation of these factors, including their induction, remains poorly understood. Here, we identify a crucial role for the Wilms' tumor 1 protein (WT1) in circumvallate (CV) papillae <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. WT1 is a transcription factor that is important in the normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of multiple tissues, including both the olfactory and visual systems. In mice, WT1 expression is detectable by E12.5, when the CV taste placode begins to form. In mice lacking WT1, the CV fails to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong> normally and markers of early taste <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment are dysregulated compared with wild type. We demonstrate that expression of the WT1 target genes <i>Lef1</i>, <i>Ptch1</i> and <i>Bmp4</i> is significantly reduced in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing tongue tissue derived from <i>Wt1</i> knockout mice and that, in normal tongue, WT1 is bound to the promoter regions of these genes. Moreover, siRNA knockdown of WT1 in cultured taste cells leads to a reduction in the expression of <i>Lef1</i> and <i>Ptch1</i>. Our data identify WT1 as a crucial transcription factor in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of the CV through the regulation of multiple signaling pathways that have established roles in the formation and patterning of taste placodes.</p>

Association Between Hospital Volume, Processes of Care, and Outcomes in Patients Admitted With Heart Failure

Accordingly, we sought to determine the relationship between admission volume, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">process</span></strong>-of-care metrics, and short- and long-term outcomes in patients admitted with acute HF.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients enrolled in the Get With The Guidelines-HF registry with linked Medicare inpatient data at 342 hospitals were assessed. Volume was assessed both as a continuous variable, and quartiles based on the admitting hospital annual HF case volume, as well: 5 to 38 (quartile 1), 39 to 77 (quartile 2), 78 to 122 (quartile 3), 123 to 457 (quartile 4). The main outcome measures were (1) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">process</span></strong> measures at discharge (achievement of HF achievement, quality, reporting, and composite metrics); (2) 30-day mortality and hospital readmission; and (3) 6-month mortality and hospital readmission.

Toward a chemical vaccine for malaria
<p>Despite considerable progress in combating malaria, it remains one of the world's most important infectious diseases, with 50% of the world population at risk of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing the disease and a mortality rate of ∼0.5 million annually (<i>1</i>). The lack of an effective vaccine and the relentless ability of the <i>Plasmodium</i> parasite responsible for malaria to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong> drug resistance has contributed to the continuing disease burden (<i>2</i>–<i>4</i>). Artemisinin-combination therapies (ACTs) are the mainstay of current treatment regimens, but decreased effectiveness, particularly in Southeast Asia, threatens our ability to control this disease. A global effort to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong> new drugs for the treatment and prevention of malaria is under way but not guaranteed to succeed (<i>3</i>, <i>5</i>, <i>6</i>). These efforts include a systematic attempt to target all life-cycle stages of the parasite to allow combination therapies to be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ed, which are also likely to reduce the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of resistance. High-throughput screens (HTSs) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed to identify small drug-like molecules that prevent growth of blood-stage parasites (<i>7</i>, <i>8</i>) and target-based approaches have identified new compounds that are currently in preclinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and/or various stages of human clinical trials for treatment of malaria (<i>3</i>). Missing from these efforts has been a high-throughput technology to find liver stage–specific chemotypes. On page 1129 of this issue, Antonova-Koch <i>et al.</i> (<i>9</i>) report an HTS effort that has filled this gap. They identify a substantial number of new chemical starting points with potent liver-stage antimalarial activity, promising a new capacity to feed compounds through the drug <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment pipeline for chemoprotection.</p>

Global analysis of protein folding using massively parallel design, synthesis, and testing
<p>Proteins fold into unique native structures stabilized by thousands of weak interactions that collectively overcome the entropic cost of folding. Although these forces are “encoded” in the thousands of known protein structures, “decoding” them is challenging because of the complexity of natural proteins that have evolved for function, not stability. We combined computational protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>, next-generation gene synthesis, and a high-throughput protease susceptibility assay to measure folding and stability for more than 15,000 de novo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed miniproteins, 1000 natural proteins, 10,000 point mutants, and 30,000 negative control sequences. This analysis identified more than 2500 stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed proteins in four basic folds—a number sufficient to enable us to systematically examine how sequence determines folding and stability in uncharted protein space. Iteration between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> and experiment increased the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> success rate from 6% to 47%, produced stable proteins unlike those found in nature for topologies where <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> was initially unsuccessful, and revealed subtle contributions to stability as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>s became increasingly optimized. Our approach achieves the long-standing goal of a tight feedback cycle between computation and experiment and has the potential to transform computational protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> into a data-driven science.</p>

Development Defects of Hydroxy-Fatty Acid-Accumulating Seeds Are Reduced by Castor Acyltransferases
<p>Researchers have long endeavored to produce modified fatty acids in easily <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ed crop plants where they are not natively found. An important step toward this goal has been the biosynthesis of these valuable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>s in model oilseeds. The successful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of such fatty acids has revealed barriers to the broad application of this technology, including low seed oil and low proportion of the introduced fatty acid and reduced seed vigor. Here, we analyze the impact of producing hydroxy-fatty acids on seedling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. We show that germinating seeds of a hydroxy-fatty acid-accumulating Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) line produce chlorotic cotyledons and suffer reduced photosynthetic capacity. These seedlings retain hydroxy-fatty acids in polar lipids, including chloroplast lipids, and exhibit decreased fatty acid synthesis. Triacylglycerol mobilization in seedling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment also is reduced, especially for lipids that include hydroxy-fatty acid moieties. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>mental defects are ameliorated by increased flux of hydroxy-fatty acids into seed triacylglycerol created through the expression of either castor (<i>Ricinus communis</i>) acyltransferase enzyme ACYL-COA:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE2 or PHOSPHOLIPID:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1A. Such expression increases both the level of total stored triacylglycerol and the rate at which it is mobilized, fueling fatty acid synthesis and restoring photosynthetic capacity. Our results suggest that further improvements in seedling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment may require the specific mobilization of triacylglycerol-containing hydroxy-fatty acids. Understanding the defects in early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment caused by the accumulation of modified fatty acids and providing mechanisms to circumvent these defects are vital steps in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of tailored oil crops.</p>

Does osteofibrous dysplasia progress to adamantinoma and how should they be treated?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to identify any progression between   benign osteofibrous dysplasia (OFD), OFD-like adamantinoma and malignant   adamantinoma, and to investigate the rates of local recurrence,   metastases and survival, in order to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong> treatment algorithms   for each.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A single institution retrospective review of all patients presenting   with OFD, OFD-like adamantinoma and adamantinoma between 1973 and   2012 was undertaken. Complete data were available for 73 patients   (42 with OFD; ten with an OFD-like adamantinoma and 21 with an adamantinoma).   The mean follow-up was 10.3 years (3 to 25) for OFD, 9.2 years (3.0   to 26.3) for OFD-like and 11.6 years (0.25 to 33) for adamantinoma.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean age at diagnosis for OFD was 13.5 years (1 to 49), 10.5   years (6 to 28) for OFD-like and 34 years (14 to 86) for adamantinoma.   A total of 24 of the 42 patients with OFD (57%) have not required   any treatment and have been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ed with observation. A total of   18 of the 42 patients with OFD underwent surgery, 13 with curettage   and five with resection. In all, three patients <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ed recurrence   following curettage (23%) but none following resection. All these   patients were cured with further limited surgery. A total of six   patients initially diagnosed with OFD were subsequently found to   have OFD-like adamantinoma. Of the ten patients initially diagnosed   with OFD-like adamantinoma, three (30%) were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ed with observation   alone and seven underwent surgery, two with curettage and five with   resection. Local recurrence arose in two patients, one each after   curettage and resection. No patients with either OFD or an OFD-like   adamantinoma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ed metastases or had progression to adamantinoma.   All patients with an adamantinoma were treated by surgery, three   with curettage, six with amputation and 12 with excision.

State-to-state chemistry for three-body recombination in an ultracold rubidium gas

Timing and Order of the Molecular Events Marking the Onset of Berry Ripening in Grapevine
<p>Grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) is a model for the investigation of physiological and biochemical changes during the formation and ripening of nonclimacteric fleshy fruits. However, the order and complexity of the molecular events during fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment remain poorly understood. To identify the key molecular events controlling berry formation and ripening, we created a highly detailed transcriptomic and metabolomic map of berry <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, based on samples collected every week from fruit set to maturity in two grapevine genotypes for three consecutive years, resulting in 219 samples. Major transcriptomic changes were represented by coordinated waves of gene expression associated with early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, veraison (onset of ripening)/midripening, and late-ripening and were consistent across vintages. The two genotypes were clearly distinguished by metabolite profiles and transcriptional changes occurring primarily at the veraison/midripening phase. Coexpression analysis identified a core network of transcripts as well as variations in the within-module connections representing varietal differences. By focusing on transcriptome rearrangements close to veraison, we identified two rapid and successive shared transitions involving genes whose expression profiles precisely locate the timing of the molecular reprogramming of berry <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Functional analyses of two transcription factors, markers of the first transition, suggested that they participate in a hierarchical cascade of gene activation at the onset of ripening. This study defined the initial transcriptional events that mark and trigger the onset of ripening and the molecular network that characterizes the whole <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">process</span></strong> of berry <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, providing a framework to model fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and maturation in grapevine.</p>

The Long Intergenic Noncoding RNA (LincRNA) Landscape of the Soybean Genome
<p>Long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) are emerging as important regulators of diverse biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">process</span></strong>es. However, our understanding of lincRNA abundance and function remains very limited especially for agriculturally important plants. Soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) is a major legume crop plant providing over a half of global oilseed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion. Moreover, soybean can form symbiotic relationships with <i>Rhizobium</i> bacteria to fix atmospheric nitrogen. Soybean has a complex paleopolyploid genome and exhibits many vegetative and floral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment complexities. Soybean cultivars have photoperiod requirements restricting its use and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ivity. Molecular regulators of these legume-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>mental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">process</span></strong>es remain enigmatic. Long noncoding RNAs may play important regulatory roles in soybean growth and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. In this study, over one billion RNA-seq read pairs from 37 samples representing nine tissues were used to discover 6,018 lincRNA loci. The lincRNAs were shorter than protein-coding transcripts and had lower expression levels and more sample specific expression. Few of the loci were found to be conserved in two other legume species (chickpea [<i>Cicer arietinum</i>] and <i>Medicago truncatula</i>), but almost 200 homeologous lincRNAs in the soybean genome were detected. Protein-coding gene-lincRNA coexpression analysis suggested an involvement of lincRNAs in stress response, signal transduction, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>mental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">process</span></strong>es. Positional analysis of lincRNA loci implicated involvement in transcriptional regulation. lincRNA expression from centromeric regions was observed especially in actively dividing tissues, suggesting possible roles in cell division. Integration of publicly available genome-wide association data with the lincRNA map of the soybean genome uncovered 23 lincRNAs potentially associated with agronomic traits.</p>

Two SUMO Proteases SUMO PROTEASE RELATED TO FERTILITY1 and 2 Are Required for Fertility in Arabidopsis

Here, we report two proteases, SUMO PROTEASE RELATED TO FERTILITY1 (SPF1) and SPF2, that regulate male and female gamete and embryo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and remove SUMO from proteins in vitro and in vivo. <i>spf1</i> mutants exhibit abnormal floral structures and embryo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, while <i>spf2</i> mutants exhibit largely a wild-type phenotype. However, <i>spf1 spf2</i> double mutants exhibit severe abnormalities in microgametogenesis, megagametogenesis, and embryo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, suggesting that the two genes are functionally redundant. Mutation of <i>SPF1</i> and <i>SPF2</i> genes also results in misexpression of generative- and embryo-specific genes. In vitro, SPF1 and SPF2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">process</span></strong> SUMO1 precursors into a mature form, and as expected in vivo, <i>spf1</i> and <i>spf2</i> mutants accumulate SUMO conjugates. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified EMBRYO SAC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>MENT ARREST9 (EDA9) as an SPF1-interacting protein. In vivo, we demonstrate that EDA9 is sumolyated and that, in <i>spf1</i> mutants, EDA9-SUMO conjugates increase in abundance, demonstrating that EDA9 is a substrate of SPF1. Together, our results demonstrate that SPF1 and SPF2 are two SUMO proteases important for plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>).</p>

SCYL2 Genes Are Involved in Clathrin-Mediated Vesicle Trafficking and Essential for Plant Growth
<p>Protein transport between organelles is an essential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">process</span></strong> in all eukaryotic cells and is mediated by the regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">process</span></strong>es such as vesicle formation, transport, docking, and fusion. In animals, SCY1-LIKE2 (SCYL2) binds to clathrin and has been shown to play roles in trans-Golgi network-mediated clathrin-coated vesicle trafficking. Here, we demonstrate that SCYL2A and SCYL2B, which are Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) homologs of animal SCYL2, are vital for plant cell growth and root hair <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Studies of the SCYL2 isoforms using multiple single or double loss-of-function alleles show that SCYL2B is involved in root hair <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and that SCYL2A and SCYL2B are essential for plant growth and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and act redundantly in those <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">process</span></strong>es. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and a β-glucuronidase-aided promoter assay show that <i>SCYL2A</i> and <i>SCYL2B</i> are differentially expressed in various tissues. We also show that SCYL2 proteins localize to the Golgi, trans-Golgi network, and prevacuolar compartment and colocalize with Clathrin Heavy Chain1 (CHC1). Furthermore, bimolecular fluorescence complementation and coimmunoprecipitation data show that SCYL2B interacts with CHC1 and two Soluble NSF Attachment Protein Receptors (SNAREs): Vesicle Transport through t-SNARE Interaction11 (VTI11) and VTI12. Finally, we present evidence that the root hair tip localization of Cellulose Synthase-Like D3 is dependent on SCYL2B. These findings suggest the role of SCYL2 genes in plant cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>mental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">process</span></strong>es via clathrin-mediated vesicle membrane trafficking.</p>

Transcriptome Profiling of Wheat Inflorescence Development from Spikelet Initiation to Floral Patterning Identified Stage-Specific Regulatory Genes
<p>Early re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in cereals is crucial for final grain number per spike and hence the yield potential of the crop. To date, however, no systematic analyses of gene expression profiles during this important <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">process</span></strong> have been conducted for common wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>). Here, we studied the transcriptome profiles at four stages of early wheat re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, from spikelet initiation to floral organ differentiation. <i>K</i>-means clustering and stage-specific transcript identification detected dynamically expressed homeologs of important transcription regulators in spikelet and floral meristems that may be involved in spikelet initiation, floret meristem specification, and floral organ patterning, as inferred from their homologs in model plants. Small RNA transcriptome sequencing discovered key microRNAs that were differentially expressed during wheat inflorescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment alongside their target genes, suggesting that miRNA-mediated regulatory mechanisms for floral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment may be conserved in cereals and Arabidopsis. Our analysis was further substantiated by the functional characterization of the <i>ARGONAUTE1d</i> (<i>AGO1d</i>) gene, which was initially expressed in stamen primordia and later in the tapetum during anther maturation. In agreement with its stage-specific expression pattern, the loss of function of the predominantly expressed B homeolog of <i>AGO1d</i> in a tetraploid durum wheat mutant resulted in smaller anthers with more infertile pollens than the wild type and a reduced grain number per spike. Together, our work provides a first glimpse of the gene regulatory networks in wheat inflorescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment that may be pivotal for floral and grain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, highlighting potential targets for genetic manipulation to improve future wheat yields.</p>

Shoot Removal Induces Chloroplast Development in Roots via Cytokinin Signaling
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of plant chloroplasts is regulated by various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>mental, environmental, and hormonal cues. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment is repressed in roots via auxin signaling. However, roots <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong> chloroplasts when they are detached from the shoot. In contrast to auxin, cytokinin positively affects chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in roots, but the role and signaling pathway of cytokinin in the root greening response remain unclear. To understand the regulatory pathways of chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in the plant stress response, we examined the mechanisms underlying the conditional greening of detached roots. In wild-type Arabidopsis roots, shoot removal activates type B ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR (ARR)-mediated cytokinin signaling and induces chlorophyll accumulation and photosynthetic remodeling. ARR1 and ARR12 are essential for up-regulating nucleus- and plastid-encoded genes associated with chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in detached roots. In this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">process</span></strong>, WOUND INDUCED DEDIFFERENTIATION1 and class B GATA transcription factors (B-GATAs) act upstream and downstream of ARRs, respectively. Overexpression of B-GATAs promotes root greening, as does shoot removal, dependent on a light signaling transcription factor, LONG HYPOCOTYL5. Auxin represses the root greening response independent of ARR signaling. <i>GNC-LIKE</i> (<i>GNL</i>), a B-GATA, is strongly up-regulated in detached roots via ARR1 and ARR12 but is repressed by auxin, so <i>GNL</i> may function at the point of convergence of cytokinin and auxin signaling in the root greening response.</p>

<i>De novo</i> formation of nucleoli in developing mouse embryos originating from enucleolated zygotes
<p>The large, compact oocyte nucleoli, sometimes referred to as nucleolus precursor bodies (NPBs), are essential for embryonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in mammals; in their absence, the oocytes complete maturation and can be fertilized, but no nucleoli are formed in the zygote or embryo, leading to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>mental failure. It has been convincingly documented that zygotes inherit the oocyte nucleolar material and form NPBs again in pronuclei. It is commonly accepted that during early embryonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, the original compact zygote NPBs gradually transform into reticulated nucleoli of somatic cells. Here, we show that zygote NPBs are not required for embryonic and full-term <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in the mouse. When NPBs were removed from late-stage zygotes by micromanipulation, the enucleolated zygotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ed to the blastocyst stage and, after transfer to recipients, live pups were obtained. We also describe <i>de novo</i> formation of nucleoli in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing embryos. After removal of NPBs from zygotes, they formed new nucleoli after several divisions. These results indicate that the zygote NPBs are not used in embryonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and that the nucleoli in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing embryos originate from <i>de novo</i> synthesized materials.</p>

<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Current consensus statements maintain that endoscopic vein harvesting (EVH) should be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> care in coronary artery bypass graft surgery, but vein quality and clinical outcomes have been questioned. The VICO trial (Vein Integrity and Clinical Outcomes) was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed to assess the impact of different vein harvesting methods on vessel damage and whether this contributes to clinical outcomes after coronary artery bypass grafting.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In this single-center, randomized clinical trial, patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with an internal mammary artery and with 1 to 4 vein grafts were recruited. All veins were harvested by a single experienced practitioner. We randomly allocated 300 patients into closed tunnel CO<sub>2</sub> EVH (n=100), open tunnel CO<sub>2</sub> EVH (n=100), and traditional open vein harvesting (n=100) groups. The primary end point was endothelial integrity and muscular damage of the harvested vein. Secondary end points included clinical outcomes (major adverse cardiac events), use of healthcare resources, and impact on health status (quality-adjusted life-years).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The open vein harvesting group demonstrated marginally better endothelial integrity in random samples (85% versus 88% versus 93% for closed tunnel EVH, open tunnel EVH, and open vein harvesting; <i>P</i><0.001). Closed tunnel EVH displayed the lowest longitudinal hypertrophy (1% versus 13.5% versus 3%; <i>P</i>=0.001). However, no differences in endothelial stretching were observed between groups (37% versus 37% versus 31%; <i>P</i>=0.62). Secondary clinical outcomes demonstrated no significant differences in composite major adverse cardiac event scores at each time point up to 48 months. The quality-adjusted life-year gain per patient was 0.11 (<i>P</i><0.001) for closed tunnel EVH and 0.07 (<i>P</i>=0.003) for open tunnel EVH compared with open vein harvesting. The likelihood of being cost-effective, at a predefined threshold of £20 000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, was 75% for closed tunnel EVH, 19% for open tunnel EVH, and 6% for open vein harvesting.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our study demonstrates that harvesting techniques affect the integrity of different vein layers, albeit only slightly. Secondary outcomes suggest that histological findings do not directly contribute to major adverse cardiac event outcomes. Gains in health status were observed, and cost-effectiveness was better with closed tunnel EVH. High-level experience with endoscopic harvesting performed by a dedicated specialist practitioner gives optimal results comparable to those of open vein harvesting.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.isrctn.com</ext-link>.

Potential Cardiovascular and Total Mortality Benefits of Air Pollution Control in Urban China
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Outdoor air pollution ranks fourth among preventable causes of China’s burden of disease.

Ductal sex determination
<p>How the physical differences between the sexes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong> is an intriguing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">process</span></strong>. In mammals, the first important stage in sex determination occurs during fetal life, when the male-determining Y chromosome expresses a gene called <i>sex determining region Y</i> (<i>SRY</i>), which acts on the bipotential gonad to initiate testis (instead of ovary) formation (<i>1</i>). Landmark experiments by Jost in the 1950s showed that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of male-specific structures is established by factors produced from the emerging testis, namely androgens and anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) (<i>2</i>). This suggested that the formation of male characteristics is an active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">process</span></strong>, whereas female-specific differentiation is passive. On page 717 of this issue, Zhao <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) show that female <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment is also an active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">process</span></strong>.</p>

Super-dry reforming of methane intensifies CO<sub>2</sub> utilization via Le Chatelier’s principle
<p>Efficient CO<sub>2</sub> transformation from a waste <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong> to a carbon source for chemicals and fuels will require reaction conditions that effect its reduction. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ed a “super-dry” CH<sub>4</sub> reforming reaction for enhanced CO <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion from CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>. We used Ni/MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> as a CH<sub>4</sub>-reforming catalyst, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> as a solid oxygen carrier, and CaO/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> as a CO<sub>2</sub> sorbent. The isothermal coupling of these three different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">process</span></strong>es resulted in higher CO <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion as compared with that of conventional dry reforming, by avoiding back reactions with water. The reduction of iron oxide was intensified through CH<sub>4</sub> conversion to syngas over Ni and CO<sub>2</sub> extraction and storage as CaCO<sub>3</sub>. CO<sub>2</sub> is then used for iron reoxidation and CO <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion, exploiting equilibrium shifts effected with inert gas sweeping (Le Chatelier’s principle). Super-dry reforming uses up to three CO<sub>2</sub> molecules per CH<sub>4</sub> and offers a high CO space-time yield of 7.5 millimole CO per second per kilogram of iron at 1023 kelvin.</p>

CyanoGate: A Modular Cloning Suite for Engineering Cyanobacteria Based on the Plant MoClo Syntax
<p>Recent advances in synthetic biology research have been underpinned by an exponential increase in available genomic information and a proliferation of advanced DNA assembly tools. The adoption of plasmid vector assembly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>s and parts libraries has greatly enhanced the reproducibility of research and the exchange of parts between different labs and biological systems. However, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>ized modular cloning (MoClo) system is not yet available for cyanobacteria, which lag behind other prokaryotes in synthetic biology despite their huge potential regarding biotechnological applications. By building on the assembly library and syntax of the Plant Golden Gate MoClo kit, we have <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ed a versatile system called CyanoGate that unites cyanobacteria with plant and algal systems. Here, we describe the generation of a suite of parts and acceptor vectors for making (1) marked/unmarked knock-outs or integrations using an integrative acceptor vector, and (2) transient multigene expression and repression systems using known and previously undescribed replicative vectors. We tested and compared the CyanoGate system in the established model cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 and the more recently described fast-growing strain <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973. The UTEX 2973 fast-growth phenotype was only evident under specific growth conditions; however, UTEX 2973 accumulated high levels of proteins with strong native or synthetic promoters. The system is publicly available and can be readily expanded to accommodate other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>ized MoClo parts to accelerate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reliabl</span></strong>e synthetic biology tools for the cyanobacterial community.</p>

Biosynthesis of 2-Phenylethanol in Rose Petals Is Linked to the Expression of One Allele of <i>RhPAAS</i>
<p>Floral scent is one of the most important characters in horticultural plants. Roses (<i>Rosa</i> spp.) have been cultivated for their scent since antiquity. However, probably by selecting for cultivars with long vase life, breeders have lost the fragrant character in many modern roses, especially the ones bred for the cut flower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">market</span></strong>. The genetic inheritance of scent characters has remained elusive so far. In-depth knowledge of this quantitative trait is thus very much needed to breed more fragrant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">commerc</span></strong>ial cultivars. Furthermore, rose hybrids harbor a composite genomic structure, which complexifies quantitative trait studies. To understand rose scent inheritance, we characterized a segregating population from two diploid cultivars, <i>Rosa</i> × <i>hybrida</i> cv H190 and <i>Rosa wichurana</i>, which have contrasting scent profiles. Several quantitative trait loci for the major volatile compounds in this progeny were identified. One among these loci contributing to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of 2-phenylethanol, responsible for the characteristic odor of rose, was found to be colocalized with a candidate gene belonging to the 2-phenylethanol biosynthesis pathway: the <i>PHENYLACETALDEHYDE SYNTHASE</i> gene <i>RhPAAS</i>. An in-depth allele-specific expression analysis in the progeny demonstrated that only one allele was highly expressed and was responsible for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of 2-phenylethanol. Unexpectedly, its expression was found to start early during flower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, before the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of the volatile 2-phenylethanol, leading to the accumulation of glycosylated compounds in petals.</p>

Arabidopsis <i>VAC14</i> Is Critical for Pollen Development through Mediating Vacuolar Organization
<p>Pollen viability depends on dynamic vacuolar changes during pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment involving increases and decreases of vacuolar volume through water and osmolite accumulation and vacuolar fission. Mutations in <i>FAB1A</i> to <i>FAB1D</i>, the genes encoding phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate [PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>]-converting kinases, are male gametophyte lethal in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) due to defective vacuolar fission after pollen mitosis I, suggesting a key role of the phospholipid in dynamic vacuolar organization. However, other genetic components that regulate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> and its involvement in pollen germination and tube growth are unknown. Here, we identified and characterized Arabidopsis VAC14, a homolog of the yeast and metazoan VAC14s that are crucial for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>. <i>VAC14</i> is constitutively expressed and highly present in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing pollen. Loss of function of <i>VAC14</i> was male gametophyte lethal due to defective pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Ultrastructural studies showed that vacuolar fission after pollen mitosis I was compromised in <i>vac14</i> mutant microspores, which led to pollen abortion. We further showed that inhibiting the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> or exogenous application of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> mimicked or rescued the pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>mental defect of the <i>vac14</i> mutant, respectively. Genetic interference and pharmacological approaches suggested a role of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> in pollen germination and tube growth. Our results provide insights into the function of VAC14 and, by inference, that of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> in plant cells.</p>

FLOURY SHRUNKEN ENDOSPERM1 Connects Phospholipid Metabolism and Amyloplast Development in Rice
<p>Starch synthesized and stored in amyloplasts serves as the major energy storage molecule in cereal endosperm. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying amyloplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and starch synthesis, we isolated a series of floury endosperm mutants in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). We identified the rice mutant <i>floury shrunken endosperm1</i> (<i>fse1</i>), which exhibited obvious defects in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of compound starch grains, decreased starch content, and altered starch physicochemical features. Map-based cloning showed that <i>FSE1</i> encodes a phospholipase-like protein homologous to phosphatidic acid-preferring phospholipase A<sub>1</sub>. <i>FSE1</i> was expressed ubiquitously with abundant levels observed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing seeds and roots. FSE1 was localized to both the cytosol and intracellular membranes. Lipid profiling indicated that total extra-plastidic lipids and phosphatidic acid were increased in <i>fse1</i> plants, suggesting that FSE1 may exhibit in vivo phospholipase A<sub>1</sub> activity on phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidyl-Ser, phosphatidylethanolamine, and, in particular, phosphatidic acid. Additionally, the total galactolipid content in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing <i>fse1</i> endosperm was significantly reduced, which may cause abnormal amyloplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Our results identify FSE1 as a phospholipase-like protein that controls the synthesis of galactolipids in rice endosperm and provide a novel connection between lipid metabolism and starch synthesis in rice grains during endosperm <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment.</p>

Transcriptomic Insights into Phenological Development and Cold Tolerance of Wheat Grown in the Field
<p>Cold acclimation and winter survival in cereal species is determined by complicated environmentally regulated gene expression. However, studies investigating these complex cold responses are mostly conducted in controlled environments that only consider the responses to single environmental variables. In this study, we have comprehensively profiled global transcriptional responses in crowns of field-grown spring and winter wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) genotypes and their near-isogenic lines with the <i>VRN-A1</i> alleles swapped. This in-depth analysis revealed multiple signaling, interactive pathways that influence cold tolerance and phenological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment to optimize plant growth and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in preparation for a wide range of over-winter stresses. Investigation of genetic differences at the <i>VRN-A1</i> locus revealed that a vernalization requirement maintained a higher level of cold response pathways while <i>VRN-A1</i> genetically promoted floral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Our results also demonstrated the influence of genetic background on the expression of cold and flowering pathways. The link between delayed shoot apex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and the induction of cold tolerance was reflected by the gradual up-regulation of abscisic acid-dependent and C-REPEAT-BINDING FACTOR pathways. This was accompanied by the down-regulation of key genes involved in meristem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment as the autumn progressed. The chromosome location of differentially expressed genes between the winter and spring wheat genetic backgrounds showed a striking pattern of biased gene expression on chromosomes 6A and 6D, indicating a transcriptional regulation at the genome level. This finding adds to the complexity of the genetic cascades and gene interactions that determine the evolutionary patterns of both phenological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and cold tolerance traits in wheat.</p>

Establishment of Photosynthesis through Chloroplast Development Is Controlled by Two Distinct Regulatory Phases
<p>Chloroplasts <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong> from undifferentiated proplastids present in meristematic tissue. Thus, chloroplast biogenesis is closely connected to leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, which restricts our ability to study the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">process</span></strong> of chloroplast biogenesis per se. As a consequence, we know relatively little about the regulatory mechanisms behind the establishment of the photosynthetic reactions and how the activities of the two genomes involved are coordinated during chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ed a single cell-based experimental system from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) with high temporal resolution allowing for investigations of the transition from proplastids to functional chloroplasts. Using this unique cell line, we could show that the establishment of photosynthesis is dependent on a regulatory mechanism involving two distinct phases. The first phase is triggered by rapid light-induced changes in gene expression and the metabolome. The second phase is dependent on the activation of the chloroplast and generates massive changes in the nuclear gene expression required for the transition to photosynthetically functional chloroplasts. The second phase also is associated with a spatial transition of the chloroplasts from clusters around the nucleus to the final position at the cell cortex. Thus, the establishment of photosynthesis is a two-phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">process</span></strong> with a clear checkpoint associated with the second regulatory phase allowing coordination of the activities of the nuclear and plastid genomes.</p>

A Model of Leaf Coordination to Scale-Up Leaf Expansion from the Organ to the Canopy

The ability to predict leaf area <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment is critical to predict crop growth, particularly under conditions of limited resources. Here, we aimed at deciphering growth coordination rules between wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) plant organs (i.e. between leaves within a stem, between laminae and sheaths, and between the mainstem and axillary tillers) to model the dynamics of canopy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. We found a unique relationship between laminae area and leaf rank for the mainstem and its tillers, which was robust across a range of sowing dates and plant densities. Robust relationships between laminae and sheath areas also were found, highlighting the tight control of organ growth within and between phytomers. These relationships identified at the phytomer scale were used to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong> a simulation model of leaf area dynamics at the canopy level that was integrated in the wheat model SiriusQuality. The model was then evaluated using several independent experiments. The model accurately predicts leaf area dynamics under different scenarios of nitrogen and water limitations.

The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">process</span></strong>-based model of the dynamics of leaf area described here is a key element to quantify the value of candidate traits for use in plant breeding and to project the impact of climate change on wheat growth.</p>

<i>Small kernel2</i> Encodes a Glutaminase in Vitamin B<sub>6</sub> Biosynthesis Essential for Maize Seed Development
<p>Vitamin B<sub>6</sub>, an essential cofactor for a range of biochemical reactions and a potent antioxidant, plays important roles in plant growth, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, and stress tolerance. Vitamin B<sub>6</sub> deficiency causes embryo lethality in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), but the specific role of vitamin B<sub>6</sub> biosynthesis in endosperm <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment has not been fully addressed, especially in monocot crops, where endosperm constitutes the major portion of the grain. Through molecular characterization of a <i>small kernel2</i> (<i>smk2</i>) mutant in maize, we reveal that vitamin B<sub>6</sub> has differential effects on embryogenesis and endosperm <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in maize. The B<sub>6</sub> vitamer pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) is drastically reduced in both the <i>smk2</i> embryo and the endosperm. However, whereas embryogenesis of the <i>smk2</i> mutant is arrested at the transition stage, endosperm formation is nearly normal. Cloning reveals that <i>Smk2</i> encodes the glutaminase subunit of the PLP synthase complex involved in vitamin B<sub>6</sub> biosynthesis de novo. <i>Smk2</i> partially complements the Arabidopsis vitamin B<sub>6</sub>-deficient mutant <i>pdx2.1</i> and <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> pyridoxine auxotrophic mutant MML21. <i>Smk2</i> is constitutively expressed in the maize plant, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing embryos. Analysis of B<sub>6</sub> vitamers indicates that the endosperm accumulates a large amount of pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate (PMP). These results indicate that vitamin B<sub>6</sub> is essential to embryogenesis but has a reduced role in endosperm <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in maize. The vitamin B<sub>6</sub> required for seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment is synthesized in the seed, and the endosperm accumulates PMP probably as a storage form of vitamin B<sub>6</sub>.</p>

Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Phosphatases Affect UV-B-Induced Stomatal Closure via Controlling NO in Guard Cells
<p>Ultraviolet B (UV-B) radiation induces the activation of MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE PHOSPHATASE1 (MKP1) and its targets MPK3 and MPK6, but whether they participate in UV-B guard cell signaling is not clear. Here, evidence shows that UV-B-induced stomatal closure in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) is antagonistically regulated by MKP1 and MPK6 via modulating hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)-induced nitric oxide (NO) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion in guard cells. The <i>mkp1</i> mutant was hypersensitive to UV-B-induced stomatal closure and NO <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion in guard cells but not to UV-B-induced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion, suggesting that MKP1 negatively regulates UV-B-induced stomatal closure via inhibiting NO generation in guard cells. Moreover, MPK3 and MPK6 were activated by UV-B in leaves of the wild type and hyperactivated in the <i>mkp1</i> mutant, but the UV-B-induced activation of MPK3 and MPK6 was largely inhibited in mutants for <i>ATRBOHD</i> and <i>ATRBOHF</i> but not in mutants for <i>NIA1</i> and <i>NIA2</i>. <i>mpk6</i> mutants showed defects of UV-B-induced NO <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion and stomatal closure but were normal in UV-B-induced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion, while stomata of <i>mpk3</i> mutants responded to UV-B just like those of the wild type. The defect of UV-B-induced stomatal closure in <i>mpk6</i> mutants was rescued by exogenous NO but not by exogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Furthermore, double mutant <i>mkp1</i>/<i>mpk6</i> and the single mutant <i>mpk6</i> showed the same responses to UV-B in terms of either stomatal movement or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and NO <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion. These data indicate that MPK6, but not MPK3, positively regulates UV-B-induced stomatal closure via acting downstream of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and upstream of NO, while MKP1 functions negatively in UV-B guard cell signaling via down-regulation of MPK6.</p>

A Palmitic Acid Elongase Affects Eicosapentaenoic Acid and Plastidial Monogalactosyldiacylglycerol Levels in Nannochloropsis
<p><i>Nannochloropsis</i> species are oleaginous eukaryotes containing a plastid limited by four membranes, deriving from a secondary endosymbiosis. In <i>Nannochloropsis</i>, thylakoid lipids, including monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG), are enriched in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). The need for EPA in MGDG is not understood. Fatty acids are de novo synthesized in the stroma, then converted into very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (FAs) at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of MGDG relies therefore on an EPA supply from the ER to the plastid, following an unknown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">process</span></strong>. We identified seven elongases and five desaturases possibly involved in EPA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion in <i>Nannochloropsis gaditana</i>. Among the six heterokont-specific saturated FA elongases possibly acting upstream in this pathway, we characterized the highly expressed isoform <i>Δ0-ELO1</i>. Heterologous expression in yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) showed that NgΔ0-ELO1 could elongate palmitic acid. <i>Nannochloropsis</i> Δ0-elo1 mutants exhibited a reduced EPA level and a specific decrease in MGDG. In NgΔ0-elo1 lines, the impairment of photosynthesis is consistent with a role of EPA-rich MGDG in nonphotochemical quenching control, possibly providing an appropriate MGDG platform for the xanthophyll cycle. Concomitantly with MGDG decrease, the level of triacylglycerol (TAG) containing medium chain FAs increased. In <i>Nannochloropsis</i>, part of EPA used for MGDG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion is therefore biosynthesized by a channeled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">process</span></strong> initiated at the elongation step of palmitic acid by Δ0-ELO1, thus acting as a committing enzyme for galactolipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion. Based on the MGDG/TAG balance controlled by Δ0-ELO1, this study also provides novel prospects for the engineering of oleaginous microalgae for biotechnological applications.</p>

The Genetic Control of Reproductive Development under High Ambient Temperature<xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>Ambient temperature has a large impact on re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and grain yield in temperate cereals. However, little is known about the genetic control of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment under different ambient temperatures. Here, we demonstrate that in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), high ambient temperatures accelerate or delay re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment depending on the photoperiod response gene <i>PHOTOPERIOD1</i> (<i>Ppd-H1</i>) and its upstream regulator <i>EARLY FLOWERING3</i> (<i>HvELF3</i>). A natural mutation in <i>Ppd-H1</i> prevalent in spring barley delayed floral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and reduced the number of florets and seeds per spike, while the wild-type <i>Ppd-H1</i> or a mutant <i>Hvelf3</i> allele accelerated floral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and maintained the seed number under high ambient temperatures. High ambient temperature delayed the expression phase and reduced the amplitude of clock genes and repressed the floral integrator gene <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T1</i> independently of the genotype. <i>Ppd-H1</i>-dependent variation in flowering time under different ambient temperatures correlated with relative expression levels of the <i>BARLEY MADS</i>-box genes <i>VERNALIZATION1</i> (<i>HvVRN1</i>), <i>HvBM3</i>, and <i>HvBM8</i> in the leaf. Finally, we show that <i>Ppd-H1</i> interacts with regulatory variation at <i>HvVRN1. Ppd-H1</i> only accelerated floral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in the background of a spring <i>HvVRN1</i> allele with a deletion in the regulatory intron. The full-length winter <i>Hvvrn1</i> allele was strongly down-regulated, and flowering was delayed by high temperatures irrespective of <i>Ppd-H1</i>. Our findings demonstrate that the photoperiodic and vernalization pathways interact to control flowering time and floret fertility in response to ambient temperature in barley.</p>

Gibberellins Regulate Ovule Integument Development by Interfering with the Transcription Factor ATS
<p>Gibberellins (GAs) are plant hormones that regulate most plant life cycle aspects, including flowering and fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Here, we demonstrate the implication of GAs in ovule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. DELLA proteins, negative GA response regulators, act as positive factors for ovule integument <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in a mechanism that involves transcription factor ABERRANT TESTA SHAPE (ATS). The seeds of the <i>della global</i> mutant, a complete loss-of-function of DELLA, and the <i>ats-1</i> mutant are remarkably similar, with a round shape, a disorganized testa, and viviparism. These defects are the result of an alteration in integuments that fail to fully <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong> and are shorter than in wild-type plants. <i>ats-1</i> also shows some GA-related phenotypes, for example, higher germination rates and early flowering. In fact, <i>ats-1</i> has elevated GA levels due to the activation of GA biosynthesis genes, which indicates that ATS inhibits GA biosynthesis. Moreover, DELLAs and ATS proteins interact, which suggests the formation of a transcriptional complex that regulates the expression of genes involved in integument growth. Therefore, the repression of GA biosynthesis by ATS would result in the stabilization of DELLAs to ensure correct ATS-DELLA complex formation. The requirement of both activities to coordinate proper ovule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment strongly argues that the ATS-DELLA complex acts as a key molecular factor. This work provides the first evidence for a role of GAs in ovule and seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment.</p>

A Rice Ca<sup>2+</sup> Binding Protein Is Required for Tapetum Function and Pollen Formation
<p>In flowering plants, successful male re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion requires the sophisticated interaction between somatic anther wall layers and re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ive cells. Timely degradation of the innermost tissue of the anther wall layer, the tapetal layer, is critical for pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a well-known stimulus for plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, but whether it plays a role in affecting male re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion remains elusive. Here we report a role of Defective in Exine Formation 1 (OsDEX1) in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), a Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding protein, in regulating rice tapetal cell degradation and pollen formation. In <i>osdex1</i> anthers, tapetal cell degeneration is delayed and degradation of the callose wall surrounding the microspores is compromised, leading to aborted pollen formation and complete male sterility. <i>OsDEX1</i> is expressed in tapetal cells and microspores during early anther <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Recombinant OsDEX1 is able to bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> and regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in vitro, and <i>osdex1</i> exhibited disturbed Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in tapetal cells. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that OsDEX1 may have a conserved function in binding Ca<sup>2+</sup> in flowering plants, and genetic complementation of pollen wall defects of an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>dex1</i> mutant confirmed its evolutionary conservation in pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Collectively, these findings suggest that OsDEX1 plays a fundamental role in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of tapetal cells and pollen formation, possibly via modulating the Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis during pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment.</p>

The outcome of the surgical treatment of pelvic chondrosarcomas
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Few studies dealing with chondrosarcoma of the pelvis are currently   available. Different data about the overall survival and prognostic   factors have been published but without a detailed analysis of surgery-related complications.   We aimed to analyse the outcome of a series of pelvic chondrosarcomas   treated at a single institution, with particular attention to the   prognostic factors. Based on a competing risk model, our objective   was to identify risk factors for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>In a retrospective single-centre study, 58 chondrosarcomas (26   patients alive, 32 patients dead) of the pelvis were reviewed. The   mean follow-up was 13 years (one week to 23.1 years).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 26 patients (45%) were alive and 32 patients (55%)   had died.

In a competing risk model   the cumulative risk of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of a surgery-related complication   was 64% at six months and 69% at one year, post-operatively, respectively.   Endoprosthetic reconstruction was a significant risk factor for   the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of complications (p = 0.006).

The management of open tibial fractures in children
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Following the introduction of national <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>s in 2009, most   major paediatric trauma is now triaged to specialist units offering   combined orthopaedic and plastic surgical expertise. We investigated   the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement of open tibia fractures at a paediatric trauma centre,   primarily reporting the risk of infection and rate of union.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A retrospective review was performed on 61 children who between   2007 and 2015 presented with an open tibia fracture. Their mean   age was nine years (2 to 16) and the median follow-up was ten months   (interquartile range 5 to 18). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement involved IV antibiotics,   early debridement and combined treatment of the skeletal and soft-tissue injuries   in line with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>s proposed by the British Orthopaedic Association.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were 36 diaphyseal fractures and 25 distal tibial fractures.   Of the distal fractures, eight involved the physis. Motor vehicle   collisions accounted for two thirds of the injuries and 38 patients   (62%) arrived outside of normal working hours. The initial method   of stabilisation comprised: casting in nine cases (15%); elastic   nailing in 19 (31%); Kirschner (K)-wiring in 13 (21%); intramedullary   nailing in one (2%); open reduction and plate fixation in four (7%); and   external fixation in 15 (25%). Wound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement comprised: primary   wound closure in 24 (39%), delayed primary closure in 11 (18%),   split skin graft (SSG) in eight (13%), local flap with SSG in 17   (28%) and a free flap in one. A total of 43 fractures (70%) were   Gustilo-Anderson grade III. There were four superficial (6.6%) and   three (4.9%) deep infections. Two deep infections occurred following   open reduction and plate fixation and the third after    K-wire fixation of a distal fracture. No patient who underwent primary   wound closure <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ed an infection. All the fractures united,   although nine patients required revision of a mono-lateral to circular   frame for delayed union (two) or for altered alignment or length   (seven). The mean time to union was two weeks longer in diaphyseal fractures   than in distal fractures (13 weeks <i>versus</i> 10.8   weeks, p<i> = </i>0.016). Children aged > 12 years had   a significantly longer time to union than those aged < 12 years   (16.3 weeks <i>versus</i> 11.4 weeks, p<i> = </i>0.045).   The length of stay in hospital for patients with a Gustilo-Anderson   grade IIIB fracture was twice as long as for less severe injuries. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Fractures in children heal better than those in adults. Based   on our experience of deep infection we discourage the use of internal   fixation with a plate for open tibial fractures in children. We   advocate aggressive initial wound debridement in theatre with early   definitive combined orthopaedic and plastic surgery in order to   obtain skeletal stabilisation and soft-tissue cover.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:544–53.</p></sec>

Role of insulin signaling impairment, adiponectin and dyslipidemia in peripheral and central neuropathy in mice
<p>One of the tissues or organs affected by diabetes is the nervous system, predominantly the peripheral system (peripheral polyneuropathy and/or painful peripheral neuropathy) but also the central system with impaired learning, memory and mental flexibility. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the pre-diabetic or diabetic condition caused by a high-fat diet (HFD) can damage both the peripheral and central nervous systems. Groups of C57BL6 and Swiss Webster mice were fed a diet containing 60% fat for 8 months and compared to control and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic groups that were fed a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> diet containing 10% fat. Aspects of peripheral nerve function (conduction velocity, thermal sensitivity) and central nervous system function (learning ability, memory) were measured at assorted times during the study. Both strains of mice on HFD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ed impaired glucose tolerance, indicative of insulin resistance, but only the C57BL6 mice showed statistically significant hyperglycemia. STZ-diabetic C57BL6 mice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ed learning deficits in the Barnes maze after 8 weeks of diabetes, whereas neither C57BL6 nor Swiss Webster mice fed a HFD showed signs of defects at that time point. By 6 months on HFD, Swiss Webster mice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ed learning and memory deficits in the Barnes maze test, whereas their peripheral nervous system remained normal. In contrast, C57BL6 mice fed the HFD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ed peripheral nerve dysfunction, as indicated by nerve conduction slowing and thermal hyperalgesia, but showed normal learning and memory functions. Our data indicate that STZ-induced diabetes or a HFD can damage both peripheral and central nervous systems, but learning deficits <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong> more rapidly in insulin-deficient than in insulin-resistant conditions and only in Swiss Webster mice. In addition to insulin impairment, dyslipidemia or adiponectinemia might determine the neuropathy phenotype.</p>

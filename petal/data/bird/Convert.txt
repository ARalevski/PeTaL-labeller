<i>ELIGULUM-A</i> Regulates Lateral Branch and Leaf Development in Barley

The barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) <i>uniculm2</i> (<i>cul2</i>) mutation blocks axillary meristem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, and mutant plants lack lateral branches (tillers) that normally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong> from the crown. A genetic screen for <i>cul2</i> suppressors recovered two recessive alleles of <i>ELIGULUM-A</i> (<i>ELI-A</i>) that partially rescued the <i>cul2</i> tillering phenotype. Mutations in <i>ELI-A</i> produce shorter plants with fewer tillers and disrupt the leaf blade-sheath boundary, producing liguleless leaves and reduced secondary cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in stems and leaves. <i>ELI-A</i> is predicted to encode an unannotated protein containing an RNaseH-like domain that is conserved in land plants. <i>ELI-A</i> transcripts accumulate at the preligule boundary, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing ligule, leaf margins, cells destined to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong> secondary cell walls, and cells surrounding leaf vascular bundles. Recent studies have identified regulatory similarities between boundary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in leaves and lateral organs. Interestingly, we observed <i>ELI-A</i> transcripts at the preligule boundary, suggesting that <i>ELI-A</i> contributes to boundary formation between the blade and sheath. However, we did not observe <i>ELI-A</i> transcripts at the axillary meristem boundary in leaf axils, suggesting that <i>ELI-A</i> is not involved in boundary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment for axillary meristem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment.

Glycolysis plays an important role in energy transfer from the base to the distal end of the flagellum in mouse sperm
<p>Many studies have been conducted to elucidate the relationship between energy metabolic pathways (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glycolysis</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respiration</span></strong>) and flagellar motility in mammalian sperm, but the contribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glycolysis</span></strong> to sperm motility has not yet been fully elucidated. In the present study, we performed detailed analysis of mouse sperm flagellar motility for further understanding of the contribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glycolysis</span></strong> to mammalian sperm motility. Mouse sperm maintained vigorous motility in the presence of substrates either for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glycolysis</span></strong> or for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respiration</span></strong>. By contrast, inhibition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glycolysis</span></strong> by alpha-chlorohydrine caused a significant decrease in the bend angle of the flagellar bending wave, sliding velocity of outer doublet microtubules and ATP content even in the presence of respiratory substrates (pyruvate or β-hydroxybutyrate). The decrease of flagellar bend angle and sliding velocity are prominent in the distal part of the flagellum, indicating that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glycolysis</span></strong> inhibition caused the decrease in ATP concentration threrein. These results suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glycolysis</span></strong> potentially acts as a spatial ATP buffering system, transferring energy (ATP) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesize</span></strong>d by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respiration</span></strong> at the mitochondria located in the basal part of the flagellum to the distal part. In order to validate that glycolytic enzymes can transfer high energy phosphoryls, we calculated intraflagellar concentration profiles of adenine nucleotides along the flagellum by computer simulation analysis. The result demonstrated the involvement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glycolysis</span></strong> for maintaining the ATP concentration at the tip of the flagellum. It is likely that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glycolysis</span></strong> plays a key role in energy homeostasis in mouse sperm not only through ATP production but also through energy transfer.</p>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
Altered lipid homeostasis in <i>Drosophila</i> InsP<sub>3</sub> receptor mutants leads to obesity and hyperphagia
<p>Obesity is a complex metabolic disorder that often manifests with a strong genetic component in humans. However, the genetic basis for obesity and the accompanying metabolic syndrome is poorly defined. At a metabolic level, obesity arises from an imbalance between the nutritional intake and energy utilization of an organism. Mechanisms that sense the metabolic state of the individual and convey this information to satiety centers help achieve this balance. Mutations in genes that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alter</span></strong> or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modify</span></strong> such signaling mechanisms are likely to lead to either obese individuals, who in mammals are at high risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease, or excessively thin individuals with accompanying health problems. Here we show that <i>Drosophila</i> mutants for an intracellular calcium signaling channel, the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP<sub>3</sub>R) store excess triglycerides in their fat bodies and become unnaturally obese on a normal diet. Although excess insulin signaling can rescue obesity in InsP<sub>3</sub>R mutants to some extent, we show that it is not the only cause of the defect. Through mass spectrometric analysis of lipids we find that homeostasis of storage and membrane lipids are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alter</span></strong>ed in InsP<sub>3</sub>R mutants. Possibly as a compensatory mechanism, InsP<sub>3</sub>R mutant adults also feed excessively. Thus, reduced InsP<sub>3</sub>R function <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alter</span></strong>s lipid metabolism and causes hyperphagia in adults. Together, the metabolic and behavioral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">change</span></strong>s lead to obesity. Our results implicate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alter</span></strong>ed InsP<sub>3</sub> signaling as a previously unknown causative factor for metabolic syndrome in humans. Importantly, our studies also suggest preventive dietary interventions.</p>

Truncation- and motif-based pan-cancer analysis reveals tumor-suppressing kinases
<p>A major challenge in cancer genomics is identifying “driver” mutations from the many neutral “passenger” mutations within a given tumor. To identify driver mutations that would otherwise be lost within mutational noise, we filtered genomic data by motifs that are critical for kinase activity. In the first step of our screen, we used data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia and The Cancer Genome Atlas to identify kinases with truncation mutations occurring within or before the kinase domain. The top 30 tumor-suppressing kinases were aligned, and hotspots for loss-of-function (LOF) mutations were identified on the basis of amino acid conservation and mutational frequency. The functional consequences of new LOF mutations were biochemically validated, and the top 15 hotspot LOF residues were used in a pan-cancer analysis to define the tumor-suppressing kinome. A ranked list revealed MAP2K7, an essential mediator of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, as a candidate tumor suppressor in gastric cancer, despite its mutational frequency falling within the mutational noise for this cancer type. The majority of mutations in MAP2K7 abolished its catalytic activity, and reactivation of the JNK pathway in gastric cancer cells harboring LOF mutations in MAP2K7 or the downstream kinase JNK suppressed clonogenicity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grow</span></strong>th in soft agar, demonstrating the functional relevance of inactivating the JNK pathway in gastric cancer. Together, our data highlight a broadly applicable strategy to identify functional cancer driver mutations and define the JNK pathway as tumor-suppressive in gastric cancer.</p>

The paradox of mutations and cancer
<p>The past decade has witnessed the cataloging of genetic mutations in cancer genomes, providing new insights into how and in what ways cancer can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong> and spread (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). The focus has been on defining specific “driver” mutations, genetic errors in cancer cells that reveal basic biological processes gone awry that are required for cancer initiation and progression. These drivers are the target of new therapies—this concept is central to precision oncology efforts to treat patients according to the genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">change</span></strong>s that are present in their tumors (<i>3</i>). Along the way, it has also become apparent that cancer genomes harbor many additional “passenger” mutations (<i>4</i>). Patterns of driver and passenger DNA mutations derived from cancer genomes have provided clues about the different ways that cancer can manifest as a disease of genetic mutations (<i>5</i>, <i>6</i>). In some circumstances, they can be linked to strong environmental carcinogens (for example, mutation patterns caused by tobacco smoke, ultraviolet radiation, or the fungal toxin aflatoxin) (<i>7</i>). Moreover, these forensic mutational patterns can be used to estimate how long it has taken for a tumor to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong> (<i>5</i>). On page 911 of this issue, Martincorena <i>et al.</i> (<i>8</i>) turned their attention toward the detection of mutations in normal tissue, addressing a long-standing paradox that mutations arise in normal tissues but do not necessarily lead to cancer.</p>

Glucose-Induced Trophic Shift in an Endosymbiont Dinoflagellate with Physiological and Molecular Consequences<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>Interactions between the dinoflagellate endosymbiont <i>Symbiodinium</i> and its cnidarian hosts (e.g. corals, sea anemones) are the foundation of coral-reef ecosystems. Carbon flow between the partners is a hallmark of this mutualism, but the mechanisms governing this flow and its impact on symbiosis remain poorly understood. We showed previously that although <i>Symbiodinium</i> strain SSB01 can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grow</span></strong> photoautotrophically, it can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grow</span></strong> mixotrophically or heterotrophically when supplied with Glc, a metabolite normally transferred from the alga to its host. Here we show that Glc supplementation of SSB01 cultures causes a loss of pigmentation and photosynthetic activity, disorganization of thylakoid membranes, accumulation of lipid bodies, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alter</span></strong>ations of cell-surface morphology. We used global transcriptome analyses to determine if these physiological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">change</span></strong>s were correlated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">change</span></strong>s in gene expression. Glc-supplemented cells exhibited a marked reduction in levels of plastid transcripts encoding photosynthetic proteins, although most nuclear-encoded transcripts (including those for proteins involved in lipid synthesis and formation of the extracellular matrix) exhibited little <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">change</span></strong> in their abundances. However, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alter</span></strong>ed carbon metabolism in Glc-supplemented cells was correlated with modest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alter</span></strong>ations (approximately 2x) in the levels of some nuclear-encoded transcripts for sugar transporters. Finally, Glc-bleached SSB01 cells appeared unable to efficiently populate anemone larvae. Together, these results suggest links between energy metabolism and cellular physiology, morphology, and symbiotic interactions. However, the results also show that in contrast to many other organisms, <i>Symbiodinium</i> can undergo dramatic physiological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">change</span></strong>s that are not reflected by major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">change</span></strong>s in the abundances of nuclear-encoded transcripts and thus presumably reflect posttranscriptional regulatory processes.</p>

Autophagy Deficiency Compromises Alternative Pathways of Respiration following Energy Deprivation in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>Under heterotrophic conditions, carbohydrate oxidation inside the mitochondrion is the primary energy source for cellular metabolism. However, during energy-limited conditions, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alter</span></strong>native substrates are required to support <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respiration</span></strong>. Amino acid oxidation in plant cells plays a key role in this by generating electrons that can be transferred to the mitochondrial electron transport chain via the electron transfer flavoprotein/ubiquinone oxidoreductase system. Autophagy, a catabolic mechanism for macromolecule and protein recycling, allows the maintenance of amino acid pools and nutrient remobilization. Although the association between autophagy and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alter</span></strong>native respiratory substrates has been suggested, the extent to which autophagy and primary metabolism interact to support plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respiration</span></strong> remains unclear. To investigate the metabolic importance of autophagy during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and under extended darkness, Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants with disruption of autophagy (<i>atg</i> mutants) were used. Under normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grow</span></strong>th conditions, <i>atg</i> mutants showed lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grow</span></strong>th and seed production with no impact on photosynthesis. Following extended darkness, <i>atg</i> mutants were characterized by signatures of early senescence, including decreased chlorophyll content and maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II coupled with increases in dark <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respiration</span></strong>. Transcript levels of genes involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alter</span></strong>native pathways of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respiration</span></strong> and amino acid catabolism were up-regulated in <i>atg</i> mutants. The metabolite profiles of dark-treated leaves revealed an extensive metabolic reprogramming in which increases in amino acid levels were partially compromised in <i>atg</i> mutants. Although an enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respiration</span></strong> in <i>atg</i> mutants was observed during extended darkness, autophagy deficiency compromises protein degradation and the generation of amino acids used as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alter</span></strong>native substrates to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respiration</span></strong>.</p>

Histone Lysine-to-Methionine Mutations Reduce Histone Methylation and Cause Developmental Pleiotropy
<p>Epigenetic modifications play critical roles in diverse biological processes. Histone Lys-to-Met (K-to-M) mutations act as gain-of-function mutations to inhibit a wide range of histone methyltransferases and are thought to promote tumorigenesis. However, it is largely unknown whether K-to-M mutations impact organismal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Using Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) as a model system, we discovered that a transgene exogenously expressing histone 3 Lys-36 to Met mutation (K36M) acts in a dominant-negative manner to cause global reduction of H3K36 methylation. Remarkably, this dominant repressive activity is dosage-dependent and causes strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>mental perturbations including extreme branching and early flowering by affecting the expression of genes involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>mental and metabolic processes. Besides the established pathological roles of K-to-M mutations in tumor cells, we demonstrate a physiological outcome for K-to-M induced H3K36 hypomethylation. This study provides evidence for a conserved dominant-negative inhibitory role of histone K-to-M mutation across the plant and animal kingdoms. We also highlight the unique ability of K36M mutations to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alter</span></strong> plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>mental processes leading to severe pleiotropic phenotypes. Finally, our data suggests K-to-M mutations may provide a useful strategy for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alter</span></strong>ing epigenetic landscapes in organisms where histone methyltransferases are uncharacterized.</p>

Transcription Factor OsTGA10 Is a Target of the MADS Protein OsMADS8 and Is Required for Tapetum Development

It remains unclear how organ identity proteins facilitate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of organ primordia into tissues with a determined identity, even though it has long been accepted that floral organ identity is genetically determined by interaction of identity genes according to the ABC model. Using the chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing technique, we identified <i>OsTGA10</i>, encoding a bZIP transcription factor, as a target of the MADS box protein OsMADS8, which is annotated as an E-class organ identity protein. We characterized the function of OsTGA10 using genetic and molecular analyses. <i>OsTGA10</i> was preferentially expressed during stamen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, and mutation of <i>OsTGA10</i> resulted in male sterility. OsTGA10 was required for tapetum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and functioned by interacting with known tapetum genes.

Genome-Wide Prediction of Metabolic Enzymes, Pathways, and Gene Clusters in Plants
<p>Plant metabolism underpins many traits of ecological and agronomic importance. Plants produce numerous compounds to cope with their environments but the biosynthetic pathways for most of these compounds have not yet been elucidated. To engineer and improve metabolic traits, we need comprehensive and accurate knowledge of the organization and regulation of plant metabolism at the genome scale. Here, we present a computational pipeline to identify metabolic enzymes, pathways, and gene clusters from a sequenced genome. Using this pipeline, we generated metabolic pathway databases for 22 species and identified metabolic gene clusters from 18 species. This unified resource can be used to conduct a wide array of comparative studies of plant metabolism. Using the resource, we discovered a widespread occurrence of metabolic gene clusters in plants: 11,969 clusters from 18 species. The prevalence of metabolic gene clusters offers an intriguing possibility of an untapped source for uncovering new metabolite biosynthesis pathways. For example, more than 1,700 clusters contain enzymes that could generate a specialized metabolite scaffold (signature enzymes) and enzymes that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modify</span></strong> the scaffold (tailoring enzymes). In four species with sufficient gene expression data, we identified 43 highly coexpressed clusters that contain signature and tailoring enzymes, of which eight were characterized previously to be functional pathways. Finally, we identified patterns of genome organization that implicate local gene duplication and, to a lesser extent, single gene transposition as having played roles in the evolution of plant metabolic gene clusters.</p>

Time-course data for 128 metabolites showed dynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">change</span></strong>s in metabolites related to amino acid biosynthesis. The concentration of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, an important intermediate of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glycolysis</span></strong> pathway, immediately decreased in the initial stages of cell differentiation. As cell differentiation progressed, specific amino acids accumulated, including the shikimate-related amino acids and the translocatable nitrogen-rich amino acid arginine. Transcriptome data indicated that cell differentiation involved the active up-regulation of genes encoding the enzymes catalyzing fructose 6-phosphate biosynthesis from glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate biosynthesis from oxaloacetate, and phenylalanine biosynthesis, which includes shikimate pathway enzymes. Concomitantly, active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">change</span></strong>s in the amount of fructose 6-phosphate and phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate were detected during cell differentiation. Taken together, our results show that protoxylem vessel element differentiation is associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">change</span></strong>s in primary metabolism, which could facilitate the production of polysaccharides and lignin monomers and, thus, promote the formation of the secondary cell wall. Also, these metabolic shifts correlate with the active transcriptional regulation of specific enzyme genes. Therefore, our observations indicate that primary metabolism is actively regulated during protoxylem vessel element differentiation to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alter</span></strong> the cell’s metabolic activity for the biosynthesis of secondary wall polymers.</p>

Metabolic and Proliferative State of Vascular Adventitial Fibroblasts in Pulmonary Hypertension Is Regulated Through a MicroRNA-124/PTBP1 (Polypyrimidine Tract Binding Protein 1)/Pyruvate Kinase Muscle Axis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>An emerging metabolic theory of pulmonary hypertension (PH) suggests that cellular and mitochondrial metabolic dysfunction underlies the pathology of this disease. We and others have previously demonstrated the existence of hyperproliferative, apoptosis-resistant, proinflammatory adventitial fibroblasts from human and bovine hypertensive pulmonary arterial walls (PH-Fibs) that exhibit constitutive reprogramming of glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolism, accompanied by an increased ratio of glucose catabolism through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glycolysis</span></strong> versus the tricarboxylic acid cycle. However, the mechanisms responsible for these metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alter</span></strong>ations in PH-Fibs remain unknown. We hypothesized that in PH-Fibs microRNA-124 (miR-124) regulates PTBP1 (polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1) expression to control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alter</span></strong>native splicing of pyruvate kinase muscle (PKM) isoforms 1 and 2, resulting in an increased PKM2/PKM1 ratio, which promotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glycolysis</span></strong> and proliferation even in aerobic environments.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Pulmonary adventitial fibroblasts were isolated from calves and humans with severe PH (PH-Fibs) and from normal subjects. PTBP1 gene knockdown was achieved via PTBP1-siRNA; restoration of miR-124 was performed with miR-124 mimic. TEPP-46 and shikonin were used to manipulate PKM2 glycolytic function. Histone deacetylase inhibitors were used to treat cells. Metabolic products were determined by mass spectrometry–based metabolomics analyses, and mitochondrial function was analyzed by confocal microscopy and spectrofluorometry.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We detected an increased PKM2/PKM1 ratio in PH-Fibs compared with normal subjects. PKM2 inhibition reversed the glycolytic status of PH-Fibs, decreased their cell proliferation, and attenuated macrophage interleukin-1β expression. Furthermore, normalizing the PKM2/PKM1 ratio in PH-Fibs by miR-124 overexpression or PTBP1 knockdown reversed the glycolytic phenotype (decreased the production of glycolytic intermediates and byproducts, ie, lactate), rescued mitochondrial reprogramming, and decreased cell proliferation. Pharmacological manipulation of PKM2 activity with TEPP-46 and shikonin or treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors produced similar results.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In PH, miR-124, through the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alter</span></strong>native splicing factor PTBP1, regulates the PKM2/PKM1 ratio, the overall metabolic, proliferative, and inflammatory state of cells. This PH phenotype can be rescued with interventions at various levels of the metabolic cascade. These findings suggest a more integrated view of vascular cell metabolism, which may open unique therapeutic prospects in targeting the dynamic glycolytic and mitochondrial interactions and between mesenchymal inflammatory cells in PH.</p></sec>

<i>PINOID</i> Is Required for Formation of the Stigma and Style in Rice
<p>The stigma is the entry point for sexual reproduction in plants, but the mechanisms underlying stigma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment are largely unknown. Here, we disrupted putative auxin biosynthetic and signaling genes to evaluate their roles in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Disruption of the rice <i>PINOID</i> (<i>OsPID</i>) gene completely eliminated the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of stigmas, and overexpression of <i>OsPID</i> led to overproliferation of stigmas, suggesting that <i>OsPID</i> is a key determinant for stigma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Interestingly, <i>ospid</i> mutants did not display defects in flower initiation, nor did they <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong> any pin-like inflorescences, a characteristic phenotype observed in <i>pid</i> mutants in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). We constructed double mutants of <i>OsPID</i> and its closest homolog, <i>OsPIDb</i>, yet the double mutants still did not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong> any pin-like inflorescences, indicating that either <i>ospid</i> is compensated by additional homologous genes or <i>OsPID</i> has different functions in rice compared with <i>PID</i> in other organisms. We then knocked out one of the <i>NAKED PINS IN YUC MUTANTS</i> (<i>NPY</i>) genes, which cause the formation of pin-like inflorescences in Arabidopsis when compromised, in the <i>ospid</i> background. The <i>ospid osnpy2</i> double mutants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ed pin-like inflorescences, which were phenotypically similar to <i>pid</i> mutants in Arabidopsis and maize, demonstrating that the roles of <i>OsPID</i> in inflorescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment are likely masked by redundant partners. This work identified a key determinant for stigma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in rice and revealed a complex picture of the <i>PID</i> gene in rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Furthermore, the stigma-less <i>ospid</i> mutants are potentially useful in producing hybrid rice.</p>

Roles of miR319 and TCP Transcription Factors in Leaf Development
<p>Sophisticated regulation of gene expression, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and their target genes, is required for leaf differentiation, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grow</span></strong>th, and senescence. The impact of miR319 and its target <i>TEOSINTE BRANCHED1</i>, <i>CYCLOIDEA</i>, and <i>PROLIFERATING CELL NUCLEAR ANTIGEN BINDING FACTOR</i> (<i>TCP</i>) genes on leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment has been extensively investigated, but the redundancies of these gene families often interfere with the evaluation of their function and regulation in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>mental context. Here, we present the genetic evidence of the involvement of the <i>MIR319</i> and <i>TCP</i> gene families in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Single mutations in <i>MIR319A</i> and <i>MIR319B</i> genes moderately inhibited the formation of leaf serrations, whereas double mutations increased the extent of this inhibition and resulted in the formation of smooth leaves. Mutations in <i>MIR319</i> and gain-of-function mutations in the <i>TCP4</i> gene conferred resistance against miR319 and impaired the cotyledon boundary and leaf serration formation. These mutations functionally associated with <i>CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON</i> genes, which regulate the cotyledon boundary and leaf serration formation. In contrast, loss-of-function mutations in miR319-targeted and nontargeted <i>TCP</i> genes cooperatively induced the formation of serrated leaves in addition to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">change</span></strong>s in the levels of their downstream gene transcript. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the <i>MIR319</i> and <i>TCP</i> gene families underlie robust and multilayer control of leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. This study also provides a framework toward future researches on redundant miRNAs and transcription factors in Arabidopsis and crop plants.</p>

An increase in minimum metabolic rate and not activity explains field metabolic rate changes in a breeding seabird
<p>The field metabolic rate (FMR) of a free-ranging animal can be considered as the sum of its maintenance costs (minimum metabolic rate, MMR) and additional costs associated with thermoregulation, digestion, production and activity. However, the relationships between FMR and BMR and how they relate to behaviour and extrinsic influences is not clear. In seabirds, FMR has been shown to increase during the breeding season. This is presumed to be the result of an increase in foraging activity, stimulated by increased food demands from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grow</span></strong>ing chicks, but few studies have investigated in detail the factors that underlie these increases. We studied free-ranging Australasian gannets (<i>Morus serrator</i>) throughout their 5 month breeding season, and evaluated FMR, MMR and activity-related metabolic costs on a daily basis using the heart rate method. In addition, we simultaneously recorded behaviour (flying and diving) in the same individuals. FMR increased steadily throughout the breeding season, increasing by 11% from the incubation period to the long chick-brooding period. However, this was not accompanied by either an increase in flying or diving behaviour, or an increase in the energetic costs of activity. Instead, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">change</span></strong>s in FMR could be explained exclusively by a progressive increase in MMR. Seasonal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">change</span></strong>s in MMR could be due to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">change</span></strong> in body composition or a decrease in body condition associated with changing the allocation of resources between provisioning adults and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grow</span></strong>ing chicks. Our study highlights the importance of measuring physiological parameters continuously in free-ranging animals in order to understand fully the mechanisms underpinning seasonal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">change</span></strong>s in physiology and behaviour.</p>

The metabolic cost of communicative sound production in bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>)
<p>Bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>) produce various communicative sounds that are important for social behavior, maintaining group cohesion and coordinating foraging. For example, whistle production increases during disturbances, such as separations of mother–calf pairs and vessel approaches. It is clear that acoustic communication is important to the survival of these marine mammals, yet the metabolic cost of producing whistles and other socials sounds and the energetic consequences of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modify</span></strong>ing these sounds in response to both natural and anthropogenic disturbance are unknown. We used flow-through respirometry to determine whether the metabolic cost of sound production could be quantified in two captive dolphins producing social sounds (whistles and squawks). On average, we found that metabolic rates measured during 2 min periods of sound production were 1.2 times resting values. Up to 7 min were required for metabolism to return to resting values following vocal periods. The total metabolic cost (over resting values) of the 2 min vocal period plus the required recovery period (163.3 to 2995.9 ml O<sub>2</sub> or 3279.6 to 60,166.7 J) varied by individual as well as by mean duration of sounds produced within the vocal period. Observed variation in received cumulative sound energy levels of vocalizations was not related to total metabolic costs. Furthermore, our empirical findings did not agree with previous theoretical estimates of the metabolic cost of whistles. This study provides the first empirical data on the metabolic cost of sound production in dolphins, which can be used to estimate metabolic costs of vocal responses to environmental perturbations in wild dolphins.</p>

Ontogenetic expression of metabolic genes and microRNAs in rainbow trout alevins during the transition from the endogenous to the exogenous feeding period
<p>As oviparous fish, rainbow trout <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">change</span></strong> their nutritional strategy during ontogenesis. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">change</span></strong> is divided into the exclusive utilization of yolk-sac reserves (endogenous feeding), the concurrent utilization of yolk reserves and exogenous feeds (mixed feeding) and the complete dependence on external feeds (exogenous feeding). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">change</span></strong> in food source is accompanied by well-characterized morphological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">change</span></strong>s, including the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of adipose tissue as an energy storage site, and continuous muscle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment to improve foraging. The aim of this study was to investigate underlying molecular mechanisms that contribute to these ontogenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">change</span></strong>s between the nutritional phenotypes in rainbow trout alevins. We therefore analyzed the expression of marker genes of metabolic pathways and microRNAs (miRNAs) important in the differentiation and/or maintenance of metabolic tissues. In exogenously feeding alevins, the last enzyme involved in glucose production (<i>g6pca</i> and <i>g6pcb</i>) and lipolytic gene expression (<i>cpt1a</i> and <i>cpt1b</i>) decreased, while that of <i>gk</i>, involved in hepatic glucose use, was induced. This pattern is consistent with a progressive switch from the utilization of stored (gluconeogenic) amino acids and lipids in endogenously feeding alevins to a utilization of exogenous feeds <i>via</i> the glycolytic pathway. A shift towards the utilization of external feeds is further evidenced by the increased expression of <i>omy-miRNA-143</i>, a homologue of the mammalian marker of adipogenesis. The expression of its predicted target gene <i>abhd5</i>, a factor in triglyceride <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrolysis</span></strong>, decreased concurrently, suggesting a potential mechanism in the onset of lipid deposition. Muscle-specific <i>omy-miRNA-1/133</i> and <i>myod1</i> expression decreased in exogenously feeding alevins, a molecular signature consistent with muscle hypertrophy, which may be linked to nutritional cues or increased foraging.</p>

<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by abnormal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grow</span></strong>th and enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glycolysis</span></strong> of pulmonary artery endothelial cells.

We hypothesized that in BOECs from patients with PAH, the downregulation of microRNA-124 (miR-124), determined with a tiered systems biology approach, is responsible for increased expression of the splicing factor <i>PTBP1</i> (polypyrimidine tract binding protein), resulting in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alter</span></strong>native splicing of pyruvate kinase muscle isoforms 1 and 2 (PKM1 and 2) and consequently increased PKM2 expression.

Phenotypic Characterization of <i>EIF2AK4</i> Mutation Carriers in a Large Cohort of Patients Diagnosed Clinically With Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare disease with an emerging genetic basis. Heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding the bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 (<i>BMPR2</i>) are the commonest genetic cause of PAH, whereas biallelic mutations in the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 4 gene (<i>EIF2AK4</i>) are described in pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis. Here, we determine the frequency of these mutations and define the genotype-phenotype characteristics in a large cohort of patients diagnosed clinically with PAH.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Whole-genome sequencing was performed on DNA from patients with idiopathic and heritable PAH and with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis recruited to the National Institute of Health Research BioResource–Rare Diseases study.

Gain-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 induce hydrocephalus in a catalytically dependent manner
<p>Catalytically activating mutations in <i>Ptpn11</i>, which encodes the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2, cause 50% of Noonan syndrome (NS) cases, whereas inactivating mutations in <i>Ptpn11</i> are responsible for nearly all cases of the similar, but distinct, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>mental disorder Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (NSML; formerly called LEOPARD syndrome). However, both types of disease mutations are gain-of-function mutations because they cause SHP2 to constitutively adopt an open conformation. We found that the catalytic activity of SHP2 was required for the pathogenic effects of gain-of-function, disease-associated mutations on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of hydrocephalus in the mouse. Targeted pan-neuronal knockin of a <i>Ptpn11</i> allele encoding the active SHP2 E76K mutant resulted in hydrocephalus due to aberrant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of ependymal cells and their cilia. These pathogenic effects of the E76K mutation were suppressed by the additional mutation C459S, which abolished the catalytic activity of SHP2. Moreover, ependymal cells in NSML mice bearing the inactive SHP2 mutant Y279C were also unaffected. Mechanistically, the SHP2 E76K mutant induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>mental defects in ependymal cells by enhancing dephosphorylation and inhibition of the transcription activator STAT3. Whereas STAT3 activity was reduced in <i>Ptpn11</i><sup><i>E76K/+</i></sup> cells, the activities of the kinases ERK and AKT were enhanced, and neural cell–specific <i>Stat3</i> knockout mice also manifested <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>mental defects in ependymal cells and cilia.

Mutation dynamics and fitness effects followed in single cells
<p>Mutations have been investigated for more than a century but remain difficult to observe directly in single cells, which limits the characterization of their dynamics and fitness effects. By combining microfluidics, time-lapse imaging, and a fluorescent tag of the mismatch repair system in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, we visualized the emergence of mutations in single cells, revealing Poissonian dynamics. Concomitantly, we tracked the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grow</span></strong>th and life span of single cells, accumulating ~20,000 mutations genome-wide over hundreds of generations. This analysis revealed that 1% of mutations were lethal; nonlethal mutations displayed a heavy-tailed distribution of fitness effects and were dominated by quasi-neutral mutations with an average cost of 0.3%. Our approach has enabled the investigation of single-cell individuality in mutation rate, mutation fitness costs, and mutation interactions.</p>

However, it is not clear which intracellular components regulate these TFs during ovule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. After their synthesis, TFs are transported into the nucleus a process regulated by karyopherins commonly known as importin alpha and β. Around half of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) importin β-coding genes have been functionally characterized but only two with specific cargos have been identified. We report here that Arabidopsis IMPORTIN β4 (IMB4) regulates ovule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment through nucleocytoplasmic transport of transcriptional coactivator <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grow</span></strong>th regulating factors–interacting factors (GIFs).

IMB4 directly interacts with GIFs and is critical for the nucleocytoplasmic transport of GIF1. Finally, functional loss of <i>GIF</i>s resulted in ovule defects similar to those in <i>imb4</i> mutants, whereas enhanced expression of <i>GIF1</i> partially restored the fertility of <i>imb4</i>.

Hydraulics Regulate Stomatal Responses to Changes in Leaf Water Status in the Fern <i>Athyrium filix</i>-<i>femina</i>
<p>Stomatal responses to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">change</span></strong>s in leaf water status are important for the diurnal regulation of gas ex<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">change</span></strong> and the survival of plants during drought. These stomatal responses in angiosperm species are well characterized, yet in species of nonseed plants, an ongoing debate surrounds the role of metabolism, particularly the role of the hormone abscisic acid (ABA), in functionally regulating stomatal responses to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">change</span></strong>s in leaf water status. Here, we measured the stomatal response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">change</span></strong>s in vapor pressure difference (VPD) in two natural forms of the fern species <i>Athyrium filix</i>-<i>femina</i>, recently suggested to have stomata that are regulated by ABA. The two forms measured had considerable differences in key hydraulic traits, including leaf hydraulic conductance and capacitance, as well as the kinetics of stomatal response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">change</span></strong>s in VPD. In both forms, the stomatal responses to VPD could be accurately predicted by a dynamic, mechanistic model that assumes guard cell turgor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">change</span></strong>s in concert with leaf turgor in the light, and not via metabolic processes including the level of ABA. During drought, endogenous ABA did not play a role in stomatal closure, and exogenous ABA applied to live, intact leaves did not induce stomatal closure. Our results indicate that functional stomatal responses to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">change</span></strong>s in leaf water status in ferns are regulated by leaf hydraulics and not metabolism. With ferns being sister to seed plants, this result has implications for the evolutionary reconstruction of functional stomatal responses across vascular land plant lineages.</p>

Timing and Order of the Molecular Events Marking the Onset of Berry Ripening in Grapevine
<p>Grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) is a model for the investigation of physiological and biochemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">change</span></strong>s during the formation and ripening of nonclimacteric fleshy fruits. However, the order and complexity of the molecular events during fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment remain poorly understood. To identify the key molecular events controlling berry formation and ripening, we created a highly detailed transcriptomic and metabolomic map of berry <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, based on samples collected every week from fruit set to maturity in two grapevine genotypes for three consecutive years, resulting in 219 samples. Major transcriptomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">change</span></strong>s were represented by coordinated waves of gene expression associated with early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, veraison (onset of ripening)/midripening, and late-ripening and were consistent across vintages. The two genotypes were clearly distinguished by metabolite profiles and transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">change</span></strong>s occurring primarily at the veraison/midripening phase. Coexpression analysis identified a core network of transcripts as well as variations in the within-module connections representing varietal differences. By focusing on transcriptome rearrangements close to veraison, we identified two rapid and successive shared transitions involving genes whose expression profiles precisely locate the timing of the molecular reprogramming of berry <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Functional analyses of two transcription factors, markers of the first transition, suggested that they participate in a hierarchical cascade of gene activation at the onset of ripening. This study defined the initial transcriptional events that mark and trigger the onset of ripening and the molecular network that characterizes the whole process of berry <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, providing a framework to model fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and maturation in grapevine.</p>

Transcriptome Analysis Identifies a Zinc Finger Protein Regulating Starch Degradation in Kiwifruit
<p>Ripening, including softening, is a critical factor in determining the postharvest shelf-life of fruit and is controlled by enzymes involved in cell wall metabolism, starch degradation, and hormone metabolism. Here, we used a transcriptomics-based approach to identify transcriptional regulatory components associated with texture, ethylene, and starch degradation in ripening kiwifruit (<i>Actinidia deliciosa</i>). Twelve differentially expressed structural genes, including seven involved in cell wall metabolism, four in ethylene biosynthesis, and one in starch degradation, and 14 transcription factors (TFs) induced by exogenous ethylene treatment and inhibited by the ethylene signaling inhibitor 1-methylcyclopropene were identified as changing in transcript levels during ripening. Moreover, analysis of the regulatory effects of differentially expressed genes identified a zinc finger TF, DNA BINDING WITH ONE FINGER (AdDof3), which showed significant transactivation on the <i>AdBAM3L</i> (β-amylase) promoter. AdDof3 interacted physically with the <i>AdBAM3L</i> promoter, and stable overexpression of <i>AdBAM3L</i> resulted in lower starch content in transgenic kiwifruit leaves, suggesting that <i>AdBAM3L</i> is a key gene for starch degradation. Moreover, transient overexpression analysis showed that AdDof3 up-regulated <i>AdBAM3L</i> expression in kiwifruit. Thus, transcriptomics analysis not only allowed the prediction of some ripening-regulating genes but also facilitated the characterization of a TF, AdDof3, and a key structural gene, <i>AdBAM3L</i>, in starch degradation.</p>

FLOURY SHRUNKEN ENDOSPERM1 Connects Phospholipid Metabolism and Amyloplast Development in Rice
<p>Starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesize</span></strong>d and stored in amyloplasts serves as the major energy storage molecule in cereal endosperm. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying amyloplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and starch synthesis, we isolated a series of floury endosperm mutants in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). We identified the rice mutant <i>floury shrunken endosperm1</i> (<i>fse1</i>), which exhibited obvious defects in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of compound starch grains, decreased starch content, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alter</span></strong>ed starch physicochemical features. Map-based cloning showed that <i>FSE1</i> encodes a phospholipase-like protein homologous to phosphatidic acid-preferring phospholipase A<sub>1</sub>. <i>FSE1</i> was expressed ubiquitously with abundant levels observed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing seeds and roots. FSE1 was localized to both the cytosol and intracellular membranes. Lipid profiling indicated that total extra-plastidic lipids and phosphatidic acid were increased in <i>fse1</i> plants, suggesting that FSE1 may exhibit in vivo phospholipase A<sub>1</sub> activity on phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidyl-Ser, phosphatidylethanolamine, and, in particular, phosphatidic acid. Additionally, the total galactolipid content in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing <i>fse1</i> endosperm was significantly reduced, which may cause abnormal amyloplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Our results identify FSE1 as a phospholipase-like protein that controls the synthesis of galactolipids in rice endosperm and provide a novel connection between lipid metabolism and starch synthesis in rice grains during endosperm <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment.</p>

<i>Medicago</i> Plants Control Nodulation by Regulating Proteolysis of the Receptor-Like Kinase DMI2
<p>Plants use receptor-like kinases to monitor environmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">change</span></strong>s and transduce signals into plant cells. The <i>Medicago truncatula</i> (hereafter <i>M</i>. <i>truncatula</i>) DOES NOT MAKE INFECTIONS2 (DMI2) protein functions as a coreceptor of rhizobial signals to initiate nodule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and rhizobial infection during nitrogen-fixing symbiosis, but the mechanisms regulating DMI2 protein level and folding are still unknown. Here, we report that DMI2 protein abundance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">change</span></strong>s during nitrogen-fixing symbiosis. DMI2 accumulates in the nodules and is induced by rhizobia treatment through a posttranscriptional process. However, DMI2 induction is independent of the perception of Nod factor, a group of lipochitooligosaccharides secreted by rhizobia. The stability of the DMI2 protein is controlled by the proteasome pathway: in rhizobia-free environments, DMI2 is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrade</span></strong>d by the proteasome, but during rhizobial infection, DMI2 is protected from the proteasome, resulting in protein accumulation. Furthermore, proteasome inhibitor-promoted accumulation of DMI2 protein in <i>Medicago</i> roots induces the expression of two early nodulation marker genes, supporting the hypothesis that DMI2 accumulation activates downstream symbiosis signaling. The extracellular region of DMI2 contains two malectin-like domains (MLDs) and a leucine-rich repeat. When conserved amino acids in the MLDs are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutate</span></strong>d, DMI2 fails to restore nodule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in <i>dmi2</i> mutants, and point-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutate</span></strong>d MLD proteins are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrade</span></strong>d constitutively, suggesting that the MLD may be vital for the accumulation of DMI2. Our findings suggest that legumes control nodule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment through modulating the protein level of DMI2, revealing a layer of regulation in the interaction between plants and rhizobia in nitrogen-fixing symbiosis.</p>

Scanning for New BRI1 Mutations via TILLING Analysis
<p>The identification and characterization of a mutational spectrum for a specific protein can help to elucidate its detailed cellular functions. BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE1 (BRI1), a multidomain transmembrane receptor-like kinase, is a major receptor of brassinosteroids in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Within the last two decades, over 20 different <i>bri1</i> mutant alleles have been identified, which helped to determine the significance of each domain within BRI1. To further understand the molecular mechanisms of BRI1, we tried to identify additional alleles via targeted induced local lesions in genomes. Here, we report our identification of 83 new point mutations in <i>BRI1</i>, including nine mutations that exhibit an allelic series of typical <i>bri1</i> phenotypes, from subtle to severe morphological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alter</span></strong>ations. We carried out biochemical analyses to investigate possible mechanisms of these mutations in affecting brassinosteroid signaling. A number of interesting mutations have been isolated via this study. For example, <i>bri1-702</i>, the only weak allele identified so far with a mutation in the activation loop, showed reduced autophosphorylation activity. <i>bri1-705</i>, a subtle allele with a mutation in the extracellular portion, disrupts the interaction of BRI1 with its ligand brassinolide and coreceptor BRI1-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR KINASE1. <i>bri1-706</i>, with a mutation in the extracellular portion, is a subtle defective mutant. Surprisingly, root inhibition analysis indicated that it is largely insensitive to exogenous brassinolide treatment. In this study, we found that <i>bri1-301</i> possesses kinase activity in vivo, clarifying a previous report arguing that kinase activity may not be necessary for the function of BRI1. These data provide additional insights into our understanding of the early events in the brassinosteroid signaling pathway.</p>

Stearoyl-Acyl Carrier Protein Desaturase Mutations Uncover an Impact of Stearic Acid in Leaf and Nodule Structure
<p>Stearoyl-acyl carrier protein desaturase (SACPD-C) has been reported to control the accumulation of seed stearic acid; however, no study has previously reported its involvement in leaf stearic acid content and impact on leaf structure and morphology. A subset of an ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenized population of soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) ‘Forrest’ was screened to identify mutants within the <i>GmSACPD-C</i> gene. Using a forward genetics approach, one nonsense and four missense <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutants were identified to have high levels of seed, nodule, and leaf stearic acid content. Homology modeling and in silico analysis of the GmSACPD-C enzyme revealed that most of these mutations were localized near or at conserved residues essential for diiron ion coordination. Soybeans carrying <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutations at conserved residues showed the highest stearic acid content, and these mutations were found to have deleterious effects on nodule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and function. Interestingly, mutations at nonconserved residues show an increase in stearic acid content yet retain healthy nodules. Thus, random mutagenesis and mutational analysis allows for the achievement of high seed stearic acid content with no associated negative agronomic characteristics. Additionally, expression analysis demonstrates that nodule leghemoglobin transcripts were significantly more abundant in soybeans with deleterious mutations at conserved residues of GmSACPD-C. Finally, we report that <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutations cause an increase in leaf stearic acid content and an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alter</span></strong>ation of leaf structure and morphology in addition to differences in nitrogen-fixing nodule structure.</p>

A Rice Ca<sup>2+</sup> Binding Protein Is Required for Tapetum Function and Pollen Formation
<p>In flowering plants, successful male reproduction requires the sophisticated interaction between somatic anther wall layers and reproductive cells. Timely degradation of the innermost tissue of the anther wall layer, the tapetal layer, is critical for pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a well-known stimulus for plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, but whether it plays a role in affecting male reproduction remains elusive. Here we report a role of Defective in Exine Formation 1 (OsDEX1) in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), a Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding protein, in regulating rice tapetal cell degradation and pollen formation. In <i>osdex1</i> anthers, tapetal cell degeneration is delayed and degradation of the callose wall surrounding the microspores is compromised, leading to aborted pollen formation and complete male sterility. <i>OsDEX1</i> is expressed in tapetal cells and microspores during early anther <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Recombinant OsDEX1 is able to bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> and regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in vitro, and <i>osdex1</i> exhibited disturbed Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in tapetal cells. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that OsDEX1 may have a conserved function in binding Ca<sup>2+</sup> in flowering plants, and genetic complementation of pollen wall defects of an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>dex1</i> mutant confirmed its evolutionary conservation in pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Collectively, these findings suggest that OsDEX1 plays a fundamental role in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of tapetal cells and pollen formation, possibly via modulating the Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis during pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment.</p>

Spontaneous Mutation Accumulation in <i>Daphnia pulex</i> in Selection-Free vs. Competitive Environments
<p>Understanding the rates, spectra, and fitness effects of spontaneous mutations is fundamental to answering key questions in evolution, molecular biology, disease genetics, and conservation biology. To estimate mutation rates and evaluate the effect of selection on new mutations, we propagated mutation accumulation (MA) lines of <i>Daphnia pulex</i> for more than 82 generations and maintained a non-MA population under conditions where selection could act. Both experiments were started with the same obligate asexual progenitor clone. By sequencing 30 genomes and implementing a series of validation steps that informed the bioinformatic analyses, we identified a total of 477 single nucleotide mutations (SNMs) in the MA lines, corresponding to a mutation rate of 2.30 × 10<sup>−9</sup> (95% CI 1.90–2.70 × 10<sup>−9</sup>) per nucleotide per generation. The high overall rate of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of 4.82 × 10<sup>−5</sup> per site per generation was due to a large ameiotic recombination event spanning an entire arm of a chromosome (∼6 Mb) and several hemizygous deletion events spanning ∼2 kb each. In the non-MA population, we found significantly fewer mutations than expected based on the rate derived from the MA experiment, indicating purifying selection was likely acting to remove new deleterious mutations. We observed a surprisingly high level of genetic variability in the non-MA population, which we propose to be driven by balancing selection. Our findings suggest that both positive and negative selection on new mutations is powerful and effective in a strictly clonal population.</p>

Tight junction protein gene expression patterns and changes in transcript abundance during development of model fish gill epithelia
<p>In vertebrates, tight junction (TJ) proteins play an important role in epithelium formation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, the maintenance of tissue integrity and regulation of TJ permeability. In this study, primary cultured model gill epithelia composed of pavement cells (PVCs) were used to examine TJ protein transcript abundance during the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of epithelium confluence and epithelium resistive properties. Differences in TJ protein expression patterns and transcript abundance between gill models composed of PVCs and models composed of PVCs and mitochondrion-rich cells (MRCs) were also examined. Marked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alter</span></strong>ations in TJ protein transcript abundance were observed as cells <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ed to confluence in flask-cultured model gill epithelia. In contrast, during the formation of tissue resistance in insert-cultured epithelia (i.e. epithelia cultured on a permeable substrate), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">change</span></strong>s in TJ protein mRNA abundance were conservative, despite paracellular marker flux decreasing by orders of magnitude. In both cases significant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">change</span></strong>s in <i>claudin-8b, -8d, -27b, -28b</i> and -<i>32a</i> transcript abundance were observed, suggesting that temporal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alter</span></strong>ations in the abundance of these genes are important end points of model gill epithelium integrity. When MRCs were present in cultured gill models, the mRNA abundance of several TJ proteins significantly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alter</span></strong>ed and <i>claudin-10c, -10d</i> and -<i>33b</i> were only detected in preparations that included MRCs.

In addition, observations reveal a heterogeneous distribution of claudin TJ proteins in the gill epithelial cells of rainbow trout.</p>

Genetic studies in <i>Drosophila</i> and humans support a model for the concerted function of <i>CISD2</i>, <i>PPT1</i> and <i>CLN3</i> in disease
<p>Wolfram syndrome (WFS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, and deafness. WFS1 and WFS2 are caused by recessive mutations in the genes <i>Wolfram Syndrome 1</i> (<i>WFS1</i>) and <i>CDGSH iron sulfur domain 2</i> (<i>CISD2</i>), respectively. To explore the function of <i>CISD2</i>, we performed genetic studies in flies with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alter</span></strong>ed expression of its <i>Drosophila</i> orthologue, <i>cisd2</i>. Surprisingly, flies with strong ubiquitous RNAi-mediated knockdown of <i>cisd2</i> had no obvious signs of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alter</span></strong>ed life span, stress resistance, locomotor behavior or several other phenotypes. We subsequently found in a targeted genetic screen, however, that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alter</span></strong>ed function of <i>cisd2</i> modified the effects of overexpressing the fly orthologues of two lysosomal storage disease genes, <i>palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1</i> (<i>PPT1</i> in humans, <i>Ppt1</i> in flies) and <i>ceroid-lipofuscinosis</i>, <i>neuronal 3</i> (<i>CLN3</i> in humans, <i>cln3</i> in flies), on eye morphology in flies. We also found that <i>cln3</i> modified the effects of overexpressing <i>Ppt1</i> in the eye and that overexpression of <i>cln3</i> interacted with a loss of function mutation in <i>cisd2</i> to disrupt locomotor ability in flies. Follow-up multi-species bioinformatic analyses suggested that a gene network centered on <i>CISD2</i>, <i>PPT1</i> and <i>CLN3</i> might impact disease through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alter</span></strong>ed carbohydrate metabolism, protein folding and endopeptidase activity. Human genetic studies indicated that copy number variants (duplications and deletions) including <i>CLN3</i>, and possibly another gene in the <i>CISD2/PPT1/CLN3</i> network, are over-represented in individuals with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>mental delay. Our studies indicate that <i>cisd2</i>, <i>Ppt1</i> and <i>cln3</i> function in concert in flies, suggesting that <i>CISD2</i>, <i>PPT1</i> and <i>CLN3</i> might also function coordinately in humans. Further, our studies raise the possibility that WFS2 and some lysosomal storage disorders might be influenced by common mechanisms and that the underlying genes might have previously unappreciated effects on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>mental delay.</p>

The Ancient Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase Signaling System Is a Master Regulator of Energy and Carbon Metabolism in Algae
<p>Algae undergo a complete metabolic transformation under stress by arresting cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grow</span></strong>th, inducing autophagy and hyper-accumulating biofuel precursors such as triacylglycerols and starch. However, the regulatory mechanisms behind this stress-induced transformation are still unclear. Here, we use biochemical, mutational, and “omics” approaches to demonstrate that PI3K signaling mediates the homeostasis of energy molecules and influences carbon metabolism in algae. In <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, the inhibition and knockdown (KD) of algal class III PI3K led to significantly decreased cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grow</span></strong>th, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alter</span></strong>ed cell morphology, and higher lipid and starch contents. Lipid profiling of wild-type and PI3K KD lines showed significantly reduced membrane lipid breakdown under nitrogen starvation (−N) in the KD. RNA-seq and network analyses showed that under −N conditions, the KD line carried out lipogenesis rather than lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrolysis</span></strong> by initiating de novo fatty acid biosynthesis, which was supported by tricarboxylic acid cycle down-regulation and via acetyl-CoA synthesis from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glycolysis</span></strong>. Remarkably, autophagic responses did not have primacy over inositide signaling in algae, unlike in mammals and vascular plants. The mutant displayed a fundamental shift in intracellular energy flux, analogous to that in tumor cells. The high free fatty acid levels and reduced mitochondrial ATP generation led to decreased cell viability. These results indicate that the PI3K signal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transduction</span></strong> pathway is the metabolic gatekeeper restraining biofuel yields, thus maintaining fitness and viability under stress in algae. This study demonstrates the existence of homeostasis between starch and lipid synthesis controlled by lipid signaling in algae and expands our understanding of such processes, with biotechnological and evolutionary implications.</p>

Jasmonate Negatively Regulates Stomatal Development in Arabidopsis Cotyledons
<p>Stomata are ports that facilitate gas and water vapor ex<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">change</span></strong> between plants and their environment. Stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment is strictly regulated by endogenous signals and environmental cues. Jasmonate is an important signal that modulates multiple physiological processes in plants, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying its interactions with other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>mental signaling pathways remain poorly understood. Here, we show that jasmonate negatively regulates stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) cotyledons. Cotyledons of the wild type and stomata-overproliferating mutants (such as <i>too many mouths-1</i> and <i>stomatal density and distribution1-1</i>) treated with methyl jasmonate exhibit a clear reduction in stomata number. By contrast, blocking endogenous jasmonate biosynthesis or perception enhanced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Moreover, three MYC transcription factors involved in jasmonate signaling, MYC2, MYC3, and MYC4, were found to redundantly modulate jasmonate-inhibited stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. A genetic analysis showed that these MYC proteins act upstream of the SPEECHLESS and FAMA transcription factors to mediate stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Furthermore, jasmonate repression of stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment is dependent on these three MYC transcription factors, as stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of the <i>myc2 myc3 myc4</i> triple mutant was insensitive to methyl jasmonate treatment.

Control of Retrograde Signaling by Rapid Turnover of GENOMES UNCOUPLED1
<p>The ex<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">change</span></strong> of signals between cellular compartments coordinates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and differentiation, modulates metabolic pathways, and triggers responses to environmental conditions. The proposed central regulator of plastid-to-nucleus retrograde signaling, GENOMES UNCOUPLED1 (GUN1), is present at very low levels, which has hampered the discovery of its precise molecular function. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) GUN1 protein accumulates to detectable levels only at very early stages of leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, where it functions in the regulation of chloroplast biogenesis. <i>GUN1</i> mRNA is present at high levels in all tissues, but GUN1 protein undergoes rapid degradation (with an estimated half-life of ∼4 h) in all tissues where chloroplast biogenesis has been completed. The rapid turnover of GUN1 is controlled mainly by the chaperone ClpC1, suggesting degradation of GUN1 by the Clp protease. Degradation of GUN1 slows under stress conditions that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alter</span></strong> retrograde signaling, thus ensuring that the plant has sufficient GUN1 protein. We also find that the pentatricopeptide repeat motifs of GUN1 are important determinants of GUN1 stability. Moreover, overexpression of <i>GUN1</i> causes an early flowering phenotype, suggesting a function of GUN1 in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>mental phase transitions beyond chloroplast biogenesis. Taken together, our results provide new insight into the regulation of GUN1 by proteolytic degradation, uncover its function in early chloroplast biogenesis, and suggest a role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>mental phase transitions.</p>

The <i>TRAF Mediated Gametogenesis Progression</i> (<i>TRAMGaP</i>) Gene Is Required for Megaspore Mother Cell Specification and Gametophyte Development
<p>In plants, the role of TRAF-like proteins with meprin and the TRAF homology (MATH) domain is far from clear. In animals, these proteins serve as adapter molecules to mediate signal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transduction</span></strong> from Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor to downstream effector molecules. A seed-sterile mutant with a disrupted TRAF-like gene (<i>At5g26290</i>) exhibiting aberrant gametogenesis led us to investigate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>mental role of this gene in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The mutation was semidominant and resulted in pleiotropic phenotypes with such features as short siliques with fewer ovules, pollen and seed sterility, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alter</span></strong>ed Megaspore Mother Cell (MMC) specification, and delayed programmed cell death in megaspores and the tapetum, features that overlapped those in other well-characterized mutants. Seed sterility and reduced transmission frequency of the mutant alleles pointed to a dual role, sporophytic and gametophytic, for the gene on the male side. The mutant also showed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alter</span></strong>ed expression of various genes involved in such cellular and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>mental pathways as regulation of transcription, biosynthesis and transport of lipids, hormone-mediated signaling, and gametophyte <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment.

Acyl-CoA-Binding Protein ACBP1 Modulates Sterol Synthesis during Embryogenesis
<p>Fatty acids (FAs) and sterols are primary metabolites that exert interrelated functions as structural and signaling lipids. Despite their common syntheses from acetyl-coenzyme A, homeostatic cross talk remains enigmatic. Six Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) acyl-coenzyme A-binding proteins (ACBPs) are involved in FA metabolism. ACBP1 interacts with PHOSPHOLIPASE Dα1 and regulates phospholipid composition. Here, its specific role in the negative modulation of sterol synthesis during embryogenesis is reported. ACBP1, likely in a liganded state, interacts with STEROL C4-METHYL OXIDASE1-1 (SMO1-1), a rate-limiting enzyme in the sterol pathway. Proembryo abortion in the double mutant indicated that the ACBP1-SMO1-1 interaction is synthetic lethal, corroborating with their strong promoter activities in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing ovules. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed quantitative and compositional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">change</span></strong>s in FAs and sterols upon overexpression or mutation of <i>ACBP1</i> and/or <i>SMO1-1</i>. Aberrant levels of these metabolites may account for the downstream defect in lipid signaling. <i>GLABRA2</i> (<i>GL2</i>), encoding a phospholipid/sterol-binding homeodomain transcription factor, was up-regulated in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing seeds of <i>acbp1</i>, <i>smo1-1</i>, and <i>ACBP1</i>+/−<i>smo1-1</i> in comparison with the wild type. Consistent with the corresponding transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alter</span></strong>ation of GL2 targets, high-oil, low-mucilage phenotypes of <i>gl2</i> were phenocopied in <i>ACBP1</i>+/−<i>smo1-1</i>. Thus, ACBP1 appears to modulate the metabolism of two important lipid classes (FAs and sterols) influencing cellular signaling.</p>

Gametophyte Development Needs Mitochondrial Coproporphyrinogen III Oxidase Function
<p>Tetrapyrrole biosynthesis is one of the most essential metabolic pathways in almost all organisms. Coproporphyrinogen III oxidase (CPO) catalyzes the conversion of coproporphyrinogen III into protoporphyrinogen IX in this pathway. Here, we report that mutation in the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) CPO-coding gene <i>At5g63290</i> (<i>AtHEMN1</i>) adversely affects silique length, ovule number, and seed set. <i>Athemn1</i> mutant alleles were transmitted via both male and female gametes, but homozygous mutants were never recovered. Plants carrying <i>Athemn1</i> mutant alleles showed defects in gametophyte <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, including nonviable pollen and embryo sacs with unfused polar nuclei. Improper differentiation of the central cell led to defects in endosperm <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Consequently, embryo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment was arrested at the globular stage. The mutant phenotype was completely rescued by transgenic expression of <i>AtHEMN1</i>. Promoter and transcript analyses indicated that <i>AtHEMN1</i> is expressed mainly in floral tissues and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing seeds. AtHEMN1-green fluorescent protein fusion protein was found targeted to mitochondria. Loss of <i>AtHEMN1</i> function increased coproporphyrinogen III level and reduced protoporphyrinogen IX level, suggesting the impairment of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis. Blockage of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis in the <i>AtHEMN1</i> mutant led to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation in anthers and embryo sacs, as evidenced by nitroblue tetrazolium staining. Our results suggest that the accumulated ROS disrupts mitochondrial function by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alter</span></strong>ing their membrane polarity in floral tissues. This study highlights the role of mitochondrial ROS homeostasis in gametophyte and seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and sheds new light on tetrapyrrole/heme biosynthesis in plant mitochondria.</p>

MONENSIN SENSITIVITY1 (MON1)/CALCIUM CAFFEINE ZINC SENSITIVITY1 (CCZ1)-Mediated Rab7 Activation Regulates Tapetal Programmed Cell Death and Pollen Development
<p>Programmed cell death (PCD)-triggered degradation of plant tapetum is essential for microspore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and pollen coat formation; however, little is known about the cellular mechanism regulating tapetal PCD. Here, we demonstrate that Rab7-mediated vacuolar transport of tapetum degradation-related cysteine proteases is crucial for tapetal PCD and pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), with the following evidence: (1) The <i>monensin sensitivity1</i> (<i>mon1</i>) mutants, which are defective in Rab7 activation, showed impaired male fertility due to a combined defect in both tapetum and male gametophyte <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. (2) In anthers, <i>MON1</i> showed preferential high level expression in tapetal cell layers and pollen. (3) The <i>mon1</i> mutants exhibited delayed tapetum degeneration and tapetal PCD, resulting in abnormal pollen coat formation and decreased male fertility. (4) MON1/CALCIUM CAFFEINE ZINC SENSITIVITY1 (CCZ1)-mediated Rab7 activation was indispensable for vacuolar trafficking of tapetum degradation-related cysteine proteases, supporting that PCD-triggered tapetum degeneration requires Rab7-mediated vacuolar trafficking of these cysteine proteases. (5) <i>MON1</i> mutations also resulted in defective pollen germination and tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grow</span></strong>th. Taken together, tapetal PCD and pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment require successful MON1/CCZ1-mediated vacuolar transport in Arabidopsis.</p>

Regulation of Vegetative Phase Change by SWI2/SNF2 Chromatin Remodeling ATPase BRAHMA
<p>Plants progress from a juvenile vegetative phase of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment to an adult vegetative phase of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment before they enter the reproductive phase. miR156 has been shown to be the master regulator of the juvenile-to-adult transition in plants. However, the mechanism of how miR156 is transcriptionally regulated still remains elusive. In a forward genetic screen, we identified that a mutation in the SWI2/SNF2 chromatin remodeling ATPase BRAHMA (BRM) exhibited an accelerated vegetative phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">change</span></strong> phenotype by reducing the expression of miR156, which in turn caused a corresponding increase in the levels of <i>SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN LIKE</i> genes. BRM regulates miR156 expression by directly binding to the <i>MIR156A</i> promoter. Mutations in <i>BRM</i> not only increased occupancy of the −2 and +1 nucleosomes proximal to the transcription start site at the <i>MIR156A</i> locus but also the levels of trimethylated histone H3 at Lys 27. The precocious phenotype of <i>brm</i> mutant was partially suppressed by a second mutation in <i>SWINGER</i> (<i>SWN</i>), but not by a mutation in <i>CURLEY LEAF</i>, both of which are key components of the Polycomb Group Repressive Complex 2 in plants. Our results indicate that BRM and SWN act antagonistically at the nucleosome level to fine-tune the temporal expression of miR156 to regulate vegetative phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">change</span></strong> in Arabidopsis.</p>

Disclosing the Molecular Basis of the Postharvest Life of Berry in Different Grapevine Genotypes
<p>The molecular events that characterize postripening grapevine berries have rarely been investigated and are poorly defined. In particular, a detailed definition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">change</span></strong>s occurring during the postharvest dehydration, a process undertaken to make some particularly special wine styles, would be of great interest for both winemakers and plant biologists. We report an exhaustive survey of transcriptomic and metabolomic responses in berries representing six grapevine genotypes subjected to postharvest dehydration under identical controlled conditions. The modulation of phenylpropanoid metabolism clearly distinguished the behavior of genotypes, with stilbene accumulation as the major metabolic event, although the transient accumulation/depletion of anthocyanins and flavonols was the prevalent variation in genotypes that do not accumulate stilbenes. The modulation of genes related to phenylpropanoid/stilbene metabolism highlighted the distinct metabolomic plasticity of genotypes, allowing for the identification of candidate structural and regulatory genes. In addition to genotype-specific responses, a core set of genes was consistently modulated in all genotypes, representing the common features of berries undergoing dehydration and/or commencing senescence. This included genes controlling ethylene and auxin metabolism as well as genes involved in oxidative and osmotic stress, defense responses, anaerobic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respiration</span></strong>, and cell wall and carbohydrate metabolism. Several transcription factors were identified that may control these shared processes in the postharvest berry. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">change</span></strong>s representing both common and genotype-specific responses to postharvest conditions shed light on the cellular processes taking place in harvested berries stored under dehydrating conditions for several months.</p>

Direct Determination of the Mutation Rate in the Bumblebee Reveals Evidence for Weak Recombination-Associated Mutation and an Approximate Rate Constancy in Insects
<p>Accurate knowledge of the mutation rate provides a base line for inferring expected rates of evolution, for testing evolutionary hypotheses and for estimation of key parameters. Advances in sequencing technology now permit direct estimates of the mutation rate from sequencing of close relatives. Within insects there have been three prior such estimates, two in nonsocial insects (<i>Drosophila</i>: 2.8 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> per bp per haploid genome per generation; <i>Heliconius</i>: 2.9 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>) and one in a social species, the honeybee (3.4 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>). Might the honeybee’s rate be ∼20% higher because it has an exceptionally high recombination rate and recombination may be directly or indirectly mutagenic? To address this possibility, we provide a direct estimate of the mutation rate in the bumblebee (<i>Bombus terrestris</i>), this being a close relative of the honeybee but with a much lower recombination rate. We confirm that the crossover rate of the bumblebee is indeed much lower than honeybees (8.7 cM/Mb vs. 37 cM/Mb). Importantly, we find no significant difference in the mutation rates: we estimate for bumblebees a rate of 3.6 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> per haploid genome per generation (95% confidence intervals 2.38 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> and 5.37 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>) which is just 5% higher than the estimate that of honeybees. Both genomes have approximately one new mutation per haploid genome per generation. While we find evidence for a direct coupling between recombination and mutation (also seen in honeybees), the effect is so weak as to leave almost no footprint on any between-species differences. The similarity in mutation rates suggests an approximate constancy of the mutation rate in insects.</p>

Genome-Wide Biases in the Rate and Molecular Spectrum of Spontaneous Mutations in <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> and <i>Vibrio fischeri</i>
<p>The vast diversity in nucleotide composition and architecture among bacterial genomes may be partly explained by inherent biases in the rates and spectra of spontaneous mutations. Bacterial genomes with multiple chromosomes are relatively unusual but some are relevant to human health, none more so than the causative agent of cholera, <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>. Here, we present the genome-wide mutation spectra in wild-type and mismatch repair (MMR) defective backgrounds of two <i>Vibrio</i> species, the low-%GC squid symbiont <i>V. fischeri</i> and the pathogen <i>V. cholerae</i>, collected under conditions that greatly minimize the efficiency of natural selection. In apparent contrast to their high diversity in nature, both wild-type <i>V. fischeri</i> and <i>V. cholerae</i> have among the lowest rates for base-substitution mutations (bpsms) and insertion–deletion mutations (indels) that have been measured, below 10<sup>−</sup><sup>3</sup>/genome/generation. <i>Vibrio fischeri</i> and <i>V. cholerae</i> have distinct mutation spectra, but both are AT-biased and produce a surprising number of multi-nucleotide indels. Furthermore, the loss of a functional MMR system caused the mutation spectra of these species to converge, implying that the MMR system itself contributes to species-specific mutation patterns. Bpsm and indel rates varied among genome regions, but do not explain the more rapid evolutionary rates of genes on chromosome 2, which likely result from weaker purifying selection. More generally, the very low mutation rates of <i>Vibrio</i> species correlate inversely with their immense population sizes and suggest that selection may not only have maximized replication fidelity but also optimized other polygenic traits relative to the constraints of genetic drift.</p>

A Comprehensive, High-Resolution Map of a Gene’s Fitness Landscape
<p>Mutations are central to evolution, providing the genetic variation upon which selection acts. A mutation’s effect on the suitability of a gene to perform a particular function (gene fitness) can be positive, negative, or neutral. Knowledge of the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of mutations is fundamental for understanding evolutionary dynamics, molecular-level genetic variation, complex genetic disease, the accumulation of deleterious mutations, and the molecular clock. We present comprehensive DFEs for point and codon mutants of the <i>Escherichia coli TEM-1</i> β-lactamase gene and missense mutations in the TEM-1 protein. These DFEs provide insight into the inherent benefits of the genetic code’s architecture, support for the hypothesis that mRNA stability dictates codon usage at the beginning of genes, an extensive framework for understanding protein mutational tolerance, and evidence that mutational effects on protein thermodynamic stability shape the DFE. Contrary to prevailing expectations, we find that deleterious effects of mutation primarily arise from a decrease in specific protein activity and not cellular protein levels.</p>

Absence of strong strain effects in behavioral analyses of <i>Shank3</i>-deficient mice
<p>Haploinsufficiency of <i>SHANK3</i>, caused by chromosomal abnormalities or mutations that disrupt one copy of the gene, leads to a neuro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>mental syndrome called Phelan-McDermid syndrome, symptoms of which can include absent or delayed speech, intellectual disability, neurological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">change</span></strong>s and autism spectrum disorders. The SHANK3 protein forms a key structural part of the post-synaptic density. We previously generated and characterized mice with a targeted disruption of <i>Shank3</i> in which exons coding for the ankyrin-repeat domain were deleted and expression of full-length Shank3 was disrupted. We documented specific deficits in synaptic function and plasticity, along with reduced reciprocal social interactions, in <i>Shank3</i> heterozygous mice. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">change</span></strong>s in phenotype owing to a mutation at a single locus are quite frequently modulated by other loci, most dramatically when the entire genetic background is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">change</span></strong>d. In mice, each strain of laboratory mouse represents a distinct genetic background and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alter</span></strong>ations in phenotype owing to gene knockout or transgenesis are frequently different across strains, which can lead to the identification of important modifier loci. We have investigated the effect of genetic background on phenotypes of <i>Shank3</i> heterozygous, knockout and wild-type mice, using C57BL/6, 129SVE and FVB/Ntac strain backgrounds. We focused on observable behaviors with the goal of carrying out subsequent analyses to identify modifier loci. Surprisingly, there were very modest strain effects over a large battery of analyses. These results indicate that behavioral phenotypes associated with <i>Shank3</i> haploinsufficiency are largely strain-independent.</p>

Reconciling solar and stellar magnetic cycles with nonlinear dynamo simulations
<p>The magnetic fields of solar-type stars are observed to cycle over decadal periods—11 years in the case of the Sun. The fields originate in the turbulent convective layers of stars and have a complex dependency upon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stellar</span></strong> rotation rate. We have performed a set of turbulent global simulations that exhibit magnetic cycles varying systematically with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stellar</span></strong> rotation and luminosity. We find that the magnetic cycle period is inversely proportional to the Rossby number, which quantifies the influence of rotation on turbulent convection. The trend relies on a fundamentally nonlinear dynamo process and is compatible with the Sun’s cycle and those of other solar-type stars.</p>

A loud quasi-periodic oscillation after a star is disrupted by a massive black hole
<p>The tidal forces close to massive black holes can rip apart stars that come too close to them. As the resulting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stellar</span></strong> debris spirals toward the black hole, the debris heats up and emits x-rays. We report observations of a stable 131-second x-ray quasi-periodic oscillation from the tidal disruption event ASASSN-14li. Assuming the black hole mass indicated by host galaxy scaling relations, these observations imply that the periodicity originates from close to the event horizon and that the black hole is rapidly spinning. Our findings demonstrate that tidal disruption events can generate quasi-periodic oscillations that encode information about the physical properties of their black holes.</p>

Spectrally resolved helium absorption from the extended atmosphere of a warm Neptune-mass exoplanet
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stellar</span></strong> heating causes atmospheres of close-in exoplanets to expand and escape. These extended atmospheres are difficult to observe because their main spectral signature—neutral hydrogen at ultraviolet wavelengths—is strongly absorbed by inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stellar</span></strong> medium. We report the detection of the near-infrared triplet of neutral helium in the transiting warm Neptune-mass exoplanet HAT-P-11b by using ground-based, high-resolution observations. The helium feature is repeatable over two independent transits, with an average absorption depth of 1.08 ± 0.05%. Interpreting absorption spectra with three-dimensional simulations of the planet’s upper atmosphere suggests that it extends beyond 5 planetary radii, with a large-scale height and a helium mass loss rate of ≲3 × 10<sup>5</sup> grams per second. A net blue-shift of the absorption might be explained by high-altitude winds flowing at 3 kilometers per second from day to night-side.</p>

Juno observations of spot structures and a split tail in Io-induced aurorae on Jupiter
<p>Jupiter’s aurorae are produced in its upper atmosphere when incoming high-energy electrons precipitate along the planet’s magnetic field lines. A northern and a southern main auroral oval are visible, surrounded by small emission features associated with the Galilean moons. We present infrared observations, obtained with the Juno spacecraft, showing that in the case of Io, this emission exhibits a swirling pattern that is similar in appearance to a von Kéèèárméèèáán vortex street. Well downstream of the main auroral spots, the extended tail is split in two. Both of Ganymede’s footprints also appear as a pair of emission features, which may provide a remote measure of Ganymede’s magnetosphere. These features suggest that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnetohydrodynam</span></strong>ic interaction between Jupiter and its moon is more complex than previously anticipated.</p>

A precise extragalactic test of General Relativity
<p>Einstein’s theory of gravity, General Relativity, has been precisely tested on Solar System scales, but the long-range nature of gravity is still poorly constrained. The nearby strong gravitational lens ESO 325-G004 provides a laboratory to probe the weak-field regime of gravity and measure the spatial curvature generated per unit mass, γ. By reconstructing the observed light profile of the lensed arcs and the observed spatially resolved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stellar</span></strong> kinematics with a single self-consistent model, we conclude that γ = 0.97 ± 0.09 at 68% confidence. Our result is consistent with the prediction of 1 from General Relativity and provides a strong extragalactic constraint on the weak-field metric of gravity.</p>

Magnetic seismology of interstellar gas clouds: Unveiling a hidden dimension
<p>Stars and planets are formed inside dense inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stellar</span></strong> molecular clouds by processes imprinted on the three-dimensional (3D) morphology of the clouds. Determining the 3D structure of inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stellar</span></strong> clouds remains challenging because of projection effects and difficulties measuring the extent of the clouds along the line of sight. We report the detection of normal vibrational modes in the isolated inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stellar</span></strong> cloud Musca, allowing determination of the 3D physical dimensions of the cloud. We found that Musca is vibrating globally, with the characteristic modes of a sheet viewed edge on, not the characteristics of a filament as previously supposed. We reconstructed the physical properties of Musca through 3D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnetohydrodynam</span></strong>ic simulations, reproducing the observed normal modes and confirming a sheetlike morphology.</p>

On the generation of solar spicules and Alfvénic waves
<p>In the lower solar atmosphere, the chromosphere is permeated by jets known as spicules, in which plasma is propelled at speeds of 50 to 150 kilometers per second into the corona. The origin of the spicules is poorly understood, although they are expected to play a role in heating the million-degree corona and are associated with Alfvéííénic waves that help drive the solar wind. We compare <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnetohydrodynam</span></strong>ic simulations of spicules with observations from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph and the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope. Spicules are shown to occur when magnetic tension is amplified and transported upward through interactions between ions and neutrals or ambipolar diffusion. The tension is impulsively released to drive flows, heat plasma (through ambipolar diffusion), and generate Alfvéííéénic waves.</p>

iPTF16geu: A multiply imaged, gravitationally lensed type Ia supernova
<p>We report the discovery of a multiply imaged, gravitationally lensed type Ia supernova, iPTF16geu (SN 2016geu), at redshift <i>z</i> = 0.409. This phenomenon was identified because the light from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stellar</span></strong> explosion was magnified more than 50 times by the curvature of space around matter in an intervening galaxy. We used high-spatial-resolution observations to resolve four images of the lensed supernova, approximately 0.3 arc seconds from the center of the foreground galaxy. The observations probe a physical scale of ~1 kiloparsec, smaller than is typical in other studies of extragalactic gravitational lensing. The large magnification and symmetric image configuration imply close alignment between the lines of sight to the supernova and to the lens. The relative magnifications of the four images provide evidence for substructures in the lensing galaxy.</p>

An accreting pulsar with extreme properties drives an ultraluminous x-ray source in NGC 5907
<p>Ultraluminous x-ray sources (ULXs) in nearby galaxies shine brighter than any x-ray source in our Galaxy. ULXs are usually modeled as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stellar</span></strong>-mass black holes (BHs) accreting at very high rates or intermediate-mass BHs. We present observations showing that NGC 5907 ULX is instead an x-ray accreting neutron star (NS) with a spin period evolving from 1.43 seconds in 2003 to 1.13 seconds in 2014. It has an isotropic peak luminosity of [Formula]1000 times the Eddington limit for a NS at 17.1 megaparsec. Standard accretion models fail to explain its luminosity, even assuming beamed emission, but a strong multipolar magnetic field can describe its properties. These findings suggest that other extreme ULXs (x-ray luminosity [Formula] 10<sup>41 </sup>erg second[Formula]) might harbor NSs.</p>

A Massive Pulsar in a Compact Relativistic Binary
<sec><title>Pulsar Tests Gravity</title><p>Because of their extremely high densities, massive neutron stars can be used to test gravity. Based on spectroscopy of its white dwarf companion, <bold>Antoniadis <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. <ext-link>448</ext-link>) identified a millisecond pulsar as a neutron star twice as heavy as the Sun. The observed binary's orbital decay is consistent with that predicted by general relativity, ruling out previously untested strong-field phenomena predicted by alternative theories. The binary system has a peculiar combination of properties and poses a challenge to our understanding of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stellar</span></strong> evolution.</p></sec>

Evidence for Two Distinct Populations of Type Ia Supernovae
<sec><title>Fast and Young</title><p>Type Ia supernovae are thought to result from the thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf star accreting material from a companion star in a binary system. Their adoption as cosmic yardsticks has led to the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the universe. <bold>Wang <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 170, published online 7 March) show that supernovae with higher expansion velocities are located in the central, brighter regions of their host galaxies and are found in larger, more luminous galaxies, suggesting that they are associated with younger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stellar</span></strong> populations.</p></sec>

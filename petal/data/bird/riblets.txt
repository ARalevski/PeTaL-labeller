The quality of Achilles tendon repair five to eight years after percutaneous tenotomy in the treatment of clubfoot
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Our aim was to describe the mid-term appearances of the repair   process of the Achilles tendon after tenotomy in children with a   clubfoot treated using the Ponseti method.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 15 children (ten boys, five girls) with idiopathic   clubfoot were evaluated at a mean of 6.8 years (5.4 to 8.1) after   complete percutaneous division of the Achilles tendon. The contour   and subjective thickness of the tendon were recorded, and superficial   defects and its strength were assessed clinically. The echogenicity,   texture, thickness, peritendinous irregularities and potential for   deformation of the tendon were evaluated by ultrasonography.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The appearance of the Achilles tendon was slightly abnormal,   with more thickening and less conspicuous contours than a normal   tendon. Its strength was grossly normal, with no insufficiency of   the triceps surae. Ultrasonographic findings revealed a mild fusiform   thickening in 12 children (80%). The tissue at the site of the repair   had a slightly hypoechoic, fibrillar quality with hyperechoic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">striation</span></strong>   and the anterior contour was irregular and blurred. There was a   focal narrowing within the healing tissue in two children.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This mid-term evaluation of the ability of the Achilles tendon   to repair after division suggests a combination of intrinsic and   extrinsic mechanisms. There were minor abnormalities which did not   appear to affect function.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:139â€“44.</p></sec>

Tight junction protein gene expression patterns and changes in transcript abundance during development of model fish gill epithelia
<p>In vertebrates, tight junction (TJ) proteins play an important role in epithelium formation and development, the maintenance of tissue integrity and regulation of TJ permeability. In this study, primary cultured model gill epithelia composed of pavement cells (PVCs) were used to examine TJ protein transcript <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance during the development of epithelium confluence and epithelium resistive properties. Differences in TJ protein expression patterns and transcript <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance between gill models composed of PVCs and models composed of PVCs and mitochondrion-rich cells (MRCs) were also examined. Marked alterations in TJ protein transcript <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance were observed as cells developed to confluence in flask-cultured model gill epithelia. In contrast, during the formation of tissue resistance in insert-cultured epithelia (i.e. epithelia cultured on a permeable substrate), changes in TJ protein mRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance were conservative, despite paracellular marker flux decreasing by orders of magnitude. In both cases significant changes in <i>claudin-8b, -8d, -27b, -28b</i> and -<i>32a</i> transcript <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance were observed, suggesting that temporal alterations in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of these genes are important end points of model gill epithelium integrity. When MRCs were present in cultured gill models, the mRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of several TJ proteins significantly altered and <i>claudin-10c, -10d</i> and -<i>33b</i> were only detected in preparations that included MRCs. These data provide insight into the role of select TJ proteins in the formation and development of gill epithelia and the maintenance of gill barrier properties. In addition, observations reveal a heterogeneous distribution of claudin TJ proteins in the gill epithelial cells of rainbow trout.</p>

Cells alter their tRNA abundance to selectively regulate protein synthesis during stress conditions
<p>Decoding the information in mRNA during protein synthesis relies on tRNA adaptors, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of which can affect the decoding rate and translation efficiency. To determine whether cells alter tRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance to selectively regulate protein expression, we quantified changes in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of individual tRNAs at different time points in response to diverse stress conditions in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. We found that the tRNA pool was dynamic and rearranged in a manner that facilitated selective translation of stress-related transcripts. Through genomic analysis of multiple data sets, stochastic simulations, and experiments with designed sequences of proteins with identical amino acids but altered codon usage, we showed that changes in tRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance affected protein expression independently of factors such as mRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance. We suggest that cells alter their tRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance to selectively affect the translation rates of specific transcripts to increase the amounts of required proteins under diverse stress conditions.</p>

RORγt limits the amount of the cytokine receptor γc through the prosurvival factor Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> in developing thymocytes
<p>The cytokine receptor subunit γc provides critical signals for T cell survival and differentiation. We investigated the molecular mechanism that controls the cell surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of γc during T cell development in the thymus. We found that the amount of γc was low on CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> double-positive (DP) thymocytes before their positive selection to become mature T cells. The transcription factor RORγt was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ant in immature DP thymocytes, and its loss resulted in an increase in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of surface γc, specifically on preselection DP cells. Rather than directly repressing expression of the gene encoding γc, RORγt acted through the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> to reduce the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of surface γc, which resulted in decreased cytokine signaling and was associated with inhibition of cell metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis. Accordingly, overexpression of Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> in RORγt-deficient thymocytes restored the amount of surface γc to that present on normal preselection DP cells. Together, these data highlight a previously unappreciated role for RORγt and Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> in limiting γc <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance at the cell surface and reveal a signaling circuit in which survival factors control cytokine signaling by limiting the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance and surface distribution of a receptor subunit shared by several cytokines.</p>

The β<sub>4</sub> subunit of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 channels is required for an optimal interferon response in cardiac muscle cells
<p>The auxiliary β<sub>4</sub> subunit of the cardiac Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 channel plays a poorly understood role in gene transcription. Here, we characterized the regulatory effects of the β<sub>4</sub> subunit in H9c2 rat cardiac cells on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ances of <i>Ifnb</i> mRNA [which encodes interferon-β (IFN-β)] and of the IFN-β–related genes <i>Ddx58</i>, <i>Ifitm3</i>, <i>Irf7</i>, <i>Stat2</i>, <i>Ifih1</i>, and <i>Mx1</i>, as well as on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ances of the antiviral proteins DDX58, IRF7, STAT2, and IFITM3. Knocking down the β<sub>4</sub> subunit in H9c2 cells reduced the expression of IFN-β–stimulated genes. In response to inhibition of the kinase JAK1, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ances of β<sub>4</sub> subunit mRNA and protein were decreased. β<sub>4</sub> subunit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance was increased, and it translocated to the nucleus, in cells treated with IFN-β, infected with dengue virus (DENV), or transfected with poly(I:C), a synthetic analog of double-stranded RNA. Cells that surrounded the virus-infected cells showed translocation of β<sub>4</sub> subunit proteins to nuclei in response to spreading infection. We showed that the β<sub>4</sub> subunit interacted with the transcriptional regulator IRF7 and that the activity of an <i>Irf7</i> promoter–driven reporter was increased in cells overexpressing the β<sub>4</sub> subunit. Last, overexpressing β<sub>4</sub> in undifferentiated and differentiated H9c2 cells reduced DENV infection and decreased the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of the viral proteins NS1, NS3, and E-protein. DENV infection and poly(I:C) also increased the concentration of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in these cells. These findings suggest that the β<sub>4</sub> subunit plays a role in promoting the expression of IFN-related genes, thereby reducing viral infection.</p>

PSMA redirects cell survival signaling from the MAPK to the PI3K-AKT pathways to promote the progression of prostate cancer
<p>Increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) on prostate epithelium is a hallmark of advanced metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) and correlates negatively with prognosis. However, direct evidence that PSMA functionally contributes to PCa progression remains elusive. We generated mice bearing PSMA-positive or PSMA-negative PCa by crossing PSMA-deficient mice with transgenic PCa (TRAMP) models, enabling direct assessment of PCa incidence and progression in the presence or absence of PSMA. Compared with PSMA-positive tumors, PSMA-negative tumors were smaller, lower-grade, and more apoptotic with fewer blood vessels, consistent with the recognized proangiogenic function of PSMA. Relative to PSMA-positive tumors, tumors lacking PSMA had less than half the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R), less activity in the survival pathway mediated by PI3K-AKT signaling, and more activity in the proliferative pathway mediated by MAPK-ERK1/2 signaling. Biochemically, PSMA interacted with the scaffolding protein RACK1, disrupting signaling between the β<sub>1</sub> integrin and IGF-1R complex to the MAPK pathway, enabling activation of the AKT pathway instead. Manipulation of PSMA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance in PCa cell lines recapitulated this signaling pathway switch. Analysis of published databases indicated that IGF-1R <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance, cell proliferation, and expression of transcripts for antiapoptotic markers positively correlated with PSMA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance in patients, suggesting that this switch may be relevant to human PCa. Our findings suggest that increase in PSMA in prostate tumors contributes to progression by altering normal signal transduction pathways to drive PCa progression and that enhanced signaling through the IGF-1R/β<sub>1</sub> integrin axis may occur in other tumors.</p>

Claudin-6, -10d and -10e contribute to seawater acclimation in the euryhaline puffer fish <i>Tetraodon nigroviridis</i>
<p>Expression profiles of <i>claudin-6, -10d</i> and -<i>10e</i> in the euryhaline teleost fish <i>Tetraodon nigroviridis</i> revealed <i>claudin-6</i> in brain, eye, gill and skin tissue, while <i>claudin-10d</i> and -<i>10e</i> were found in brain, gill and skin only. In fishes, the gill and skin are important tissue barriers that interface directly with surrounding water, but these organs generally function differently in osmoregulation. Therefore, roles for gill and skin claudin-6, -10d and -10e in the osmoregulatory strategies of <i>T. nigroviridis</i> were investigated. In the gill epithelium, claudin-6, -10d and -10e co-localized with Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase immunoreactive (NKA-ir) ionocytes, and differences in sub-cellular localization could be observed in hypoosmotic (freshwater, FW) versus hyperosmotic (seawater, SW) environments. Claudin-10d and -10e <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance increased in the gills of fish acclimated to SW versus FW, while claudin-6 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance decreased in the gills of fish acclimated to SW. Taken together with our knowledge of claudin-6 and -10 function in other vertebrates, data support the idea that in SW-acclimated <i>T. nigroviridis</i>, these claudins are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ant in gill ionocytes, where they contribute to the formation of a Na<sup>+</sup> shunt and ‘leaky’ epithelium, both of which are characteristic of salt-secreting SW fish gills. Skin claudin-10d and -10e <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance also increased in fish acclimated to SW versus those in FW, but so did claudin-6. In skin, claudin-6 was found to co-localize with NKA-ir cells, but claudin-10d and -10e did not. This study provides direct evidence that the gill epithelium contains salinity-responsive tight junction proteins that are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ant primarily in ionocytes. These same proteins also appear to play a role in the osmoregulatory physiology of the epidermis.</p>

Decreased abundance of TRESK two-pore domain potassium channels in sensory neurons underlies the pain associated with bone metastasis
<p>Cancer-associated pain is debilitating. Understanding the mechanisms that cause it can inform drug development that may improve quality of life in patients. Here, we found that the reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of potassium channels called TRESK in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons sensitized nociceptive sensory neurons and cancer-associated pain. Overexpressing TRESK in DRG neurons suppressed tumor-induced neuronal hyperexcitability and pain hypersensitivity in bone metastasis model rats, whereas knocking down TRESK increased neuronal hyperexcitability and pain hypersensitivity in normal rats. Mechanistically, tumor-associated production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) activated the receptor VEGFR2 on DRGs, which increased the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of the calcineurin inhibitor DSCR1, which, in turn, decreased calcineurin-mediated activation of the transcription factor NFAT, thereby reducing the transcription of the gene encoding TRESK. Intrathecal application of exogenous calcineurin to tumor-bearing rats rescued TRESK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance and abrogated both DRG hyperexcitability and pain hypersensitivity, whereas either inhibition or knockdown of calcineurin in normal rats reduced TRESK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance and increased DRG excitability and pain sensitivity. These findings identify a potentially targetable mechanism that may cause bone metastasis–associated pain in cancer patients.</p>

MEG3-4 is a miRNA decoy that regulates IL-1β abundance to initiate and then limit inflammation to prevent sepsis during lung infection
<p>Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate gene expression. We investigated the role of lncRNAs in the inflammatory response to bacterial infection in the lungs. We identified the lncRNA MEG3 as a tissue-specific modulator of inflammatory responses during bacterial infection. Among the 10 transcript isoforms of MEG3, transcript 4 (referred to as MEG3-4) encodes the isoform with the lowest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance in mouse lungs. Nonetheless, we found that MEG3-4 bound to the microRNA miR-138 in a competitive manner with mRNA encoding the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β), thereby increasing IL-1β <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance and intensifying inflammatory responses to bacterial infection in alveolar macrophages and lung epithelial cells in culture and in lung tissue in mice. MEG3-4–mediated sponging of miR-138 in the cytoplasm increased the autocrine activity of IL-1β that subsequently induced a negative feedback mechanism mediated by nuclear factor κB that decreased MEG3-4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance and inflammatory cytokine production. This timely reduction in MEG3-4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance tempered proinflammatory responses in mice with pulmonary bacterial infection, preventing the progression to sepsis. Together, these findings reveal that MEG3-4 dynamically modulates pulmonary inflammatory responses through transcriptional regulation of immune response genes, extending the decoy and sponge mechanism associated with lncRNAs to antibacterial immunity, which affects both response and disease progression.</p>

Microtubules tune mechanotransduction through NOX2 and TRPV4 to decrease sclerostin abundance in osteocytes
<p>The adaptation of the skeleton to its mechanical environment is orchestrated by mechanosensitive osteocytes, largely by regulating the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of sclerostin, a secreted inhibitor of bone formation. We defined a microtubule-dependent mechanotransduction pathway that linked fluid shear stress to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) signals that led to a reduction in sclerostin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance in cultured osteocytes. We demonstrated that microtubules stabilized by detyrosination, a reversible posttranslational modification of polymerized α-tubulin, determined the stiffness of the cytoskeleton, which set the mechanoresponsive range of cultured osteocytes to fluid shear stress. We showed that fluid shear stress through the microtubule network activated NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2)–generated ROS that target the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel TRPV4 to elicit Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Furthermore, tuning the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of detyrosinated tubulin affected cytoskeletal stiffness to define the mechanoresponsive range of cultured osteocytes to fluid shear stress. Finally, we demonstrated that NOX2-ROS elicited Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals that activated the kinase CaMKII to decrease the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of sclerostin protein. Together, these discoveries may identify potentially druggable targets for regulating osteocyte mechanotransduction to affect bone quality.</p>

Regulation of autophagy, NF-κB signaling, and cell viability by miR-124 in <i>KRAS</i> mutant mesenchymal-like NSCLC cells
<p><i>KRAS</i> mutant non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) may be classified into epithelial or mesenchymal subtypes. Despite having the same “driver” mutation, mesenchymal NSCLCs are less responsive than are epithelial NSCLCs to inhibition of the RAS pathway. Identifying alternative networks that promote survival specifically in mesenchymal NSCLC may lead to more effective treatments for this subtype. Through their numerous targets in cellular signaling pathways, noncoding microRNAs (miRNAs) often function as tumor suppressors or oncogenes. In particular, some miRNAs regulate the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We derived an EMT-related miRNA signature by profiling the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of miRNAs in a panel of epithelial (KE) or mesenchymal (KM) <i>KRAS</i> mutant NSCLC cell lines. This signature revealed a number of suppressed miRNAs in KM cell lines, including members of the miR-200 family, which can suppress tumor progression by inhibiting EMT. Reconstituting KM cells with one of these miRNAs, miR-124, disrupted autophagy and decreased cell survival by reducing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of p62, which is both an adaptor for selective autophagy and a regulator of the transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NF-κB). Suppression of p62 by miR-124 correlated with reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of the autophagy activator beclin 1 (BECN1), the ubiquitin ligase TRAF6, and the NF-κB subunit RELA/p65. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of miR-124 inversely correlated with the expression of <i>BECN1</i> and <i>TRAF6</i> in patient NSCLC samples. These findings reveal how the loss of miR-124 promotes cell survival networks in the aggressive mesenchymal subtype of <i>KRAS</i> mutant NSCLC, which might lead to improved subtype-selective therapeutic strategies for patients.</p>

In silico modeling identifies CD45 as a regulator of IL-2 synergy in the NKG2D-mediated activation of immature human NK cells
<p>Natural killer (NK) cells perform immunosurveillance of virally infected and transformed cells, and their activation depends on the balance between signaling by inhibitory and activating receptors. Cytokine receptor signaling can synergize with activating receptor signaling to induce NK cell activation. We investigated the interplay between the signaling pathways stimulated by the cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2) and the activating receptor NKG2D in immature (CD56<sup>bright</sup>) and mature (CD56<sup>dim</sup>) subsets of human primary NK cells using mass cytometry experiments and in silico modeling. Our analysis revealed that IL-2 changed the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ances of several key proteins, including NKG2D and the phosphatase CD45. Furthermore, we found differences in correlations between protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ances, which were associated with the maturation state of the NK cells. The mass cytometry measurements also revealed that the signaling kinetics of key protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ances induced by NKG2D stimulation depended on the maturation state and the pretreatment condition of the NK cells. Our in silico model, which described the multidimensional data with coupled first-order reactions, predicted that the increase in CD45 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance was a major enhancer of NKG2D-mediated activation in IL-2–treated CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells but not in IL-2–treated CD56<sup>dim</sup> NK cells. This dependence on CD45 was verified by measurement of CD107a mobilization to the NK cell surface (a marker of activation). Our mathematical framework can be used to glean mechanisms underlying synergistic signaling pathways in other activated immune cells.</p>

Tree Physiology
Revisiting the sequencing of the first tree genome: <i>Populus trichocarpa</i>
<p>Ten years ago, it was announced that the Joint Genome Institute with funds provided by the Department of Energy, Office of Science, Biological and Environmental Research would sequence the black cottonwood (<i>Populus trichocarpa</i> Torr. & Gray) genome. This landmark decision was the culmination of work by the forest science community to develop <i>Populus</i> as a model system. Since its public release in late 2006, the availability of the <i>Populus</i> genome has spawned research in plant biology, morphology, genetics and ecology. Here we address how the tree physiologist has used this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resourc</span></strong>e. More specifically, we revisit our earlier contention that the rewards of sequencing the <i>Populus</i> genome would depend on how quickly scientists working with woody perennials could adopt molecular approaches to investigate the mechanistic underpinnings of basic physiological processes. Several examples illustrate the integration of functional and comparative genomics into the forest sciences, especially in areas that target improved understanding of the developmental differences between woody perennials and herbaceous annuals (e.g., phase transitions). Sequencing the <i>Populus</i> genome and the availability of genetic and genomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resourc</span></strong>es has also been instrumental in identifying candidate genes that underlie physiological and morphological traits of interest. Genome-enabled research has advanced our understanding of how phenotype and genotype are related and provided insights into the genetic mechanisms whereby woody perennials adapt to environmental stress. In the future, we anticipate that low-cost, high-throughput sequencing will continue to facilitate research in tree physiology and enhance our understanding at scales of individual organisms and populations. A challenge remains, however, as to how genomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resourc</span></strong>es, including the <i>Populus</i> genome, can be used to understand ecosystem function. Although examples are limited, progress in this area is encouraging and will undoubtedly improve as future research targets the many unique aspects of <i>Populus</i> as a keystone species in terrestrial ecosystems.</p>

Tomosyn functions as a PKCδ-regulated fusion clamp in mast cell degranulation
<p>Soluble <i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide–sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) family proteins mediate membrane fusion critical for vesicular transport and cellular secretion. Mast cells rely on SNARE-mediated membrane fusion for degranulation stimulated by crosslinking of immunoglobulin E (IgE) bound to the Fcε receptor (FcεRI). We investigated the mechanisms downstream of receptor activation that control degranulation. We found that the SNARE binding protein tomosyn-1 (also known as STXBP5) inhibited FcεRI-stimulated degranulation of mast cells. After mast cell activation, tomosyn-1 was phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues, dissociated from the SNARE protein syntaxin 4 (STX4), and associated with STX3. We identified PKCδ as the major kinase required for tomosyn-1 threonine phosphorylation and for regulation of the interaction with STXs. Incubation with high IgE concentrations increased tomosyn-1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance in cultured mast cells. Similarly, in basophils from allergic patients with high amounts of serum IgE, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of tomosyn-1 was increased as compared to that in patients with normal IgE concentrations. Our findings identified tomosyn-1 as an inhibitor of mast cell degranulation that required PKCδ to switch its interaction with STX partners during fusion. We suggest that the IgE-mediated increase in tomosyn-1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance in allergic patients may represent a counterregulatory mechanism to limit disease development.</p>

A DGKζ-FoxO-ubiquitin proteolytic axis controls fiber size during skeletal muscle remodeling
<p>Skeletal muscle rapidly remodels in response to various stresses, and the resulting changes in muscle mass profoundly influence our health and quality of life. We identified a diacylglycerol kinase ζ (DGKζ)–mediated pathway that regulated muscle mass during remodeling. During mechanical overload, DGKζ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance was increased and required for effective hypertrophy. DGKζ not only augmented anabolic responses but also suppressed ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS)–dependent proteolysis. We found that DGKζ inhibited the transcription factor FoxO that promotes the induction of the UPS. This function was mediated through a mechanism that was independent of kinase activity but dependent on the nuclear localization of DGKζ. During denervation, DGKζ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance was also increased and was required for mitigating the activation of FoxO-UPS and the induction of atrophy. Conversely, overexpression of DGKζ prevented fasting-induced atrophy. Therefore, DGKζ is an inhibitor of the FoxO-UPS pathway, and interventions that increase its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance could prevent muscle wasting.</p>

IRE1α prevents hepatic steatosis by processing and promoting the degradation of select microRNAs
<p>Obesity or a high-fat diet represses the endoribonuclease activity of inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α), a transducer of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in cells under endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. An impaired UPR is associated with hepatic steatosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is caused by lipid accumulation in the liver. We found that IRE1α was critical to maintaining lipid homeostasis in the liver by repressing the biogenesis of microRNAs (miRNAs) that regulate lipid mobilization. In mice fed normal chow, the endoribonuclease function of IRE1α processed a subset of precursor miRNAs in the liver, including those of the miR-200 and miR-34 families, such that IRE1α promoted their degradation through the process of regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD). A high-fat diet in mice or hepatic steatosis in patients was associated with the S-nitrosylation of IRE1α and inactivation of its endoribonuclease activity. This resulted in an increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of these miRNA families in the liver and, consequently, a decreased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of their targets, which included peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor α (PPARα) and the deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), regulators of fatty acid oxidation and triglyceride lipolysis. IRE1α deficiency exacerbated hepatic steatosis in mice. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of the miR-200 and miR-34 families was also increased in cultured, lipid-overloaded hepatocytes and in the livers of patients with hepatic steatosis. Our findings reveal a mechanism by which IRE1α maintains lipid homeostasis through its regulation of miRNAs, a regulatory pathway distinct from the canonical IRE1α-UPR pathway under acute ER stress.</p>

Nitrosylation of GAPDH augments pathological tau acetylation upon exposure to amyloid-β
<p>Acetylation of the microtubule-associated protein tau promotes its polymerization into neurofibrillary tangles that are implicated in the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The gaseous neurotransmitter nitric oxide (NO) regulates cell signaling through the nitrosylation of proteins. We found that NO production and tau acetylation at Lys<sup>280</sup> occurred in the brain tissue in mice and in cultured mouse cortical neurons in response to exposure to amyloid-β<sub>1–42</sub> (Aβ<sub>1–42</sub>), a peptide that is also implicated in AD. An increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of NO facilitated the <i>S</i>-nitrosylation (SNO) of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). <i>S</i>-nitrosylated GAPDH (GAPDH-SNO) promoted the acetylation and activation of the acetyltransferase p300 and facilitated the nitrosylation and inactivation of the deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1).

IL-2Rβ abundance differentially tunes IL-2 signaling dynamics in CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells
<p>Interleukin-2 (IL-2) stimulates both activated CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to proliferate. IL-2 signals through an identical receptor complex and promotes the same dose-dependent phosphorylation of the canonical transcription factor STAT5 in both cell types. Despite this, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells enter the S phase earlier and proliferate to a greater extent than do CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in response to IL-2. We identified distinct IL-2 signaling dynamics in CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. In IL-2–stimulated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, STAT5 phosphorylation increased rapidly and was sustained for 6 hours. In contrast, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells had a biphasic response, with maxima at 15 min and 2 to 4 hours after stimulation. Both cell types required vesicular trafficking, but only CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells required new protein synthesis to maintain high phosphorylation of STAT5. Two subunits of the IL-2 receptor, IL-2Rβ and IL-2Rγ, were twice as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ant in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells than in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Reduction of IL-2Rβ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance by 50% was sufficient to convert CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to a CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell–like signaling pattern and delay S phase entry. These results suggest that the larger pool of IL-2Rβ chains in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells is required to sustain IL-2 signaling and contributes to the quantitatively greater proliferative response to IL-2 relative to that of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. This cell type–specific difference in IL-2Rβ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance appears to tune responses, potentially preventing extensive, autoimmune proliferation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, while still enabling sufficient proliferation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to control viral infections.</p>

Neuronal activity drives FMRP- and HSPG-dependent matrix metalloproteinase function required for rapid synaptogenesis
<p>Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) functions modulate synapse formation and activity-dependent plasticity. Aberrant MMP activity is implicated in fragile X syndrome (FXS), a disease caused by the loss of the RNA-binding protein FMRP and characterized by neurological dysfunction and intellectual disability. Gene expression studies in <i>Drosophila</i> suggest that Mmps cooperate with the heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) glypican co-receptor Dally-like protein (Dlp) to restrict trans-synaptic Wnt signaling and that synaptogenic defects in the fly model of FXS are alleviated by either inhibition of Mmp or genetic reduction of Dlp. We used the <i>Drosophila</i> neuromuscular junction (NMJ) glutamatergic synapse to test activity-dependent Dlp and Mmp intersections in the context of FXS. We found that rapid, activity-dependent synaptic bouton formation depended on secreted Mmp1. Acute neuronal stimulation reduced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of Mmp2 but increased that of both Mmp1 and Dlp, as well as enhanced the colocalization of Dlp and Mmp1 at the synapse. Dlp function promoted Mmp1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance, localization, and proteolytic activity around synapses. Dlp glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains mediated this functional interaction with Mmp1. In the FXS fly model, activity-dependent increases in Mmp1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance and activity were lost but were restored by reducing the amount of synaptic Dlp. The data suggest that neuronal activity-induced, HSPG-dependent Mmp regulation drives activity-dependent synaptogenesis and that this is impaired in FXS. Thus, exploring this mechanism further may reveal therapeutic targets that have the potential to restore synaptogenesis in FXS patients.</p>

The matricellular protein TSP1 promotes human and mouse endothelial cell senescence through CD47 and Nox1
<p>Senescent cells withdraw from the cell cycle and do not proliferate. The prevalence of senescent compared to normally functioning parenchymal cells increases with age, impairing tissue and organ homeostasis. A contentious principle governing this process has been the redox theory of aging. We linked matricellular protein thrombospondin 1 (TSP1) and its receptor CD47 to the activation of NADPH oxidase 1 (Nox1), but not of the other closely related Nox isoforms, and associated oxidative stress, and to senescence in human cells and aged tissue. In human endothelial cells, TSP1 promoted senescence and attenuated cell cycle progression and proliferation. At the molecular level, TSP1 increased Nox1-dependent generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to the increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of the transcription factor p53. p53 mediated a DNA damage response that led to senescence through Rb and p21<sup>cip</sup>, both of which inhibit cell cycle progression. Nox1 inhibition blocked the ability of TSP1 to increase p53 nuclear localization and p21<sup>cip</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance and its ability to promote senescence. Mice lacking TSP1 showed decreases in ROS production, p21<sup>cip</sup> expression, p53 activity, and aging-induced senescence. Conversely, lung tissue from aging humans displayed increases in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of vascular TSP1, Nox1, p53, and p21<sup>cip</sup>. Finally, genetic ablation or pharmacological blockade of Nox1 in human endothelial cells attenuated TSP1-mediated ROS generation, restored cell cycle progression, and protected against senescence. Together, our results provide insights into the functional interplay between TSP1 and Nox1 in the regulation of endothelial senescence and suggest potential targets for controlling the aging process at the molecular level.</p>

Tim-3 signaling in peripheral NK cells promotes maternal-fetal immune tolerance and alleviates pregnancy loss
<p>Pregnancy loss occurs in about 15% of clinically recognized pregnancies, and defective maternal-fetal immune tolerance contributes to more than 50% of these events. We found that signaling by the type I membrane protein T cell immunoglobulin and mucin-containing protein 3 (Tim-3) in natural killer (NK) cells had an essential protective role during early pregnancy. Tim-3 on peripheral NK (pNK) cells was transiently increased in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance during the first trimester of pregnancy, which depended on interleukin-4 (IL-4)–signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) and progesterone signaling. Tim-3<sup>+</sup> pNK cells displayed immunosuppressive activities, including the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines and the induction of regulatory T cells (T<sub>regs</sub>) in a transforming growth factor–β1 (TGF-β1)–dependent manner. Tim-3 on pNK cells was stimulated by its ligand galectin-9 (Gal-9), leading to signaling by the kinases c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and AKT. In recurrent miscarriage (RM) patients, Tim-3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance on pNK cells was reduced and the immunosuppressive activity of Tim-3<sup>+</sup> pNK cells was impaired. Compared to Tim-3<sup>+</sup> pNK cells from donors with normal pregnancies, RM patient Tim-3<sup>+</sup> pNK cells exhibited changes in DNA accessibility in certain genetic loci, which were reversed by inhibiting accessible chromatin reader proteins. Furthermore, Tim-3<sup>+</sup> pNK cells, but not Tim-3<sup>−</sup> pNK cells, reduced fetal loss in abortion-prone and NK cell–deficient mice. Together, our findings reveal a critical role for Tim-3–Gal-9 signaling–mediated immunoregulation by pNK cells in maternal-fetal immune tolerance and suggest that Tim-3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance on pNK cells is a potential biomarker for RM diagnosis.</p>

The RNA-editing enzyme ADAR promotes lung adenocarcinoma migration and invasion by stabilizing <i>FAK</i>
<p>Large-scale, genome-wide studies report that RNA binding proteins are altered in cancers, but it is unclear how these proteins control tumor progression. We found that the RNA-editing protein ADAR (adenosine deaminase acting on double-stranded RNA) acted as a facilitator of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) progression through its ability to stabilize transcripts encoding focal adhesion kinase (FAK). In samples from 802 stage I LUAD patients, increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of ADAR at both the mRNA and protein level correlated with tumor recurrence. Knocking down ADAR in LUAD cells suppressed their mesenchymal properties, migration, and invasion in culture. Analysis of gene expression patterns in LUAD cells identified ADAR-associated enrichment of a subset of genes involved in cell migration pathways; among these, <i>FAK</i> is the most notable gene whose expression was increased in the presence of ADAR. Molecular analyses revealed that ADAR posttranscriptionally increased FAK protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance by binding to the <i>FAK</i> transcript and editing a specific intronic site that resulted in the increased stabilization of <i>FAK</i> mRNA. Pharmacological inhibition of FAK blocked ADAR-induced invasiveness of LUAD cells, suggesting a potential therapeutic application for LUAD that has a high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of ADAR.</p>

A systems approach for discovering linoleic acid derivatives that potentially mediate pain and itch
<p>Chronic pain and itch are common hypersensitivity syndromes that are affected by endogenous mediators. We applied a systems-based, translational approach to predict, discover, and characterize mediators of pain and itch that are regulated by diet and inflammation. Profiling of tissue-specific precursor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance and biosynthetic gene expression predicted that inflamed skin would be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ant in four previously unknown 11-hydroxy-epoxy- or 11-keto-epoxy-octadecenoate linoleic acid derivatives and four previously identified 9- or 13-hydroxy-epoxy- or 9- or 13-keto-epoxy-octadecenoate linoleic acid derivatives. All of these mediators were confirmed to be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ant in rat and human skin by mass spectrometry. However, only the two 11-hydroxy-epoxy-octadecenoates sensitized rat dorsal root ganglion neurons to release more calcitonin gene–related peptide (CGRP), which is involved in pain transmission, in response to low pH (which mimics an inflammatory state) or capsaicin (which activates ion channels involved in nociception). The two 11-hydroxy-epoxy-octadecenoates share a 3-hydroxy-<i>Z</i>-pentenyl-<i>E</i>-epoxide moiety, thus suggesting that this substructure could mediate nociceptor sensitization. In rats, intradermal hind paw injection of 11-hydroxy-12,13-<i>trans</i>-epoxy-(9<i>Z</i>)-octadecenoate elicited C-fiber–mediated sensitivity to thermal pain. In a randomized trial testing adjunctive strategies to manage refractory chronic headaches, reducing the dietary intake of linoleic acid was associated with decreases in plasma 11-hydroxy-12,13-<i>trans</i>-epoxy-(9<i>Z</i>)-octadecenoate, which correlated with clinical pain reduction. Human psoriatic skin had 30-fold higher 9-keto-12,13-<i>trans</i>-epoxy-(10<i>E</i>)-octadecenoate compared to control skin, and intradermal injection of this compound induced itch-related scratching behavior in mice. Collectively, these findings define a family of endogenous mediators with potential roles in pain and itch.</p>

Differential abundance of CK1α provides selectivity for pharmacological CK1α activators to target WNT-dependent tumors
<p>Constitutive WNT activity drives the growth of various human tumors, including nearly all colorectal cancers (CRCs). Despite this prominence in cancer, no WNT inhibitor is currently approved for use in the clinic largely due to the small number of druggable signaling components in the WNT pathway and the substantial toxicity to normal gastrointestinal tissue. We have shown that pyrvinium, which activates casein kinase 1α (CK1α), is a potent inhibitor of WNT signaling. However, its poor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bioavail</span></strong>ability limited the ability to test this first-in-class WNT inhibitor in vivo. We characterized a novel small-molecule CK1α activator called SSTC3, which has better pharmacokinetic properties than pyrvinium, and found that it inhibited the growth of CRC xenografts in mice. SSTC3 also attenuated the growth of a patient-derived metastatic CRC xenograft, for which few therapies exist. SSTC3 exhibited minimal gastrointestinal toxicity compared to other classes of WNT inhibitors. Consistent with this observation, we showed that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of the SSTC3 target, CK1α, was decreased in WNT-driven tumors relative to normal gastrointestinal tissue, and knocking down CK1α increased cellular sensitivity to SSTC3. Thus, we propose that distinct CK1α <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance provides an enhanced therapeutic index for pharmacological CK1α activators to target WNT-driven tumors.</p>

Dosage-dependent regulation of <i>VAV2</i> expression by steroidogenic factor-1 drives adrenocortical carcinoma cell invasion
<p>Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare endocrine malignancy with a dismal prognosis. Genomic studies have enabled progress in our understanding of the molecular bases of ACC, but factors that influence its prognosis are lacking. Amplification of the gene encoding the transcription factor steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1; also known as NR5A1) is one of the genetic alterations common in ACC. We identified a transcriptional regulatory mechanism involving increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of VAV2, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for small GTPases that control the cytoskeleton, driven by increased expression of the gene encoding SF-1 in ACC. Manipulating SF-1 and VAV2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance in cultured ACC cells revealed that VAV2 was a critical factor for SF-1–induced cytoskeletal remodeling and invasion in culture (Matrigel) and in vivo (chicken chorioallantoic membrane) models.

Because VAV2 is a druggable target, our findings suggest that blocking VAV2 may be a new therapeutic approach to inhibit metastatic progression in ACC patients.</p>

Long-Day Photoperiod Enhances Jasmonic Acid-Related Plant Defense
<p>Agricultural crops are exposed to a range of daylengths, which act as important environmental cues for the control of developmental processes such as flowering. To explore the additional effects of daylength on plant function, we investigated the transcriptome of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants grown under short days (SD) and transferred to long days (LD). Compared with that under SD, the LD transcriptome was enriched in genes involved in jasmonic acid-dependent systemic resistance. Many of these genes exhibited impaired expression induction under LD in the <i>phytochrome A</i> (<i>phyA</i>), <i>cryptochrome 1</i> (<i>cry1</i>), and <i>cry2</i> triple photoreceptor mutant. Compared with that under SD, LD enhanced plant resistance to the necrotrophic fungus <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>. This response was reduced in the <i>phyA cry1 cry2</i> triple mutant, in the <i>constitutive photomorphogenic1</i> (<i>cop1</i>) mutant, in the <i>myc2</i> mutant, and in mutants impaired in DELLA function. Plants grown under SD had an increased nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of COP1 and decreased DELLA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance, the latter of which was dependent on COP1.

More striking disparities were found between active force-calcium relations. Compared with controls, maximal calcium-activated force (F<sub>max</sub>) was 28% higher in IPAH but 37% lower in SSc-PAH.

The neuropilin 2 isoform NRP2b uniquely supports TGFβ-mediated progression in lung cancer
<p>Neuropilins (NRP1 and NRP2) are co-receptors for heparin-binding growth factors and class 3 semaphorins. Different isoforms of NRP1 and NRP2 are produced by alternative splicing. We found that in non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines, transforming growth factor–β (TGFβ) signaling preferentially increased the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of NRP2b. NRP2b and NRP2a differ only in their carboxyl-terminal regions. Although the presence of NRP2b inhibited cultured cell proliferation and primary tumor growth, NRP2b enhanced cellular migration, invasion into Matrigel, and tumorsphere formation in cultured cells in response to TGFβ signaling and promoted metastasis in xenograft mouse models. These effects of overexpressed NRP2b contrast with the effects of overexpressed NRP2a. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)–induced phosphorylation of the kinase AKT was specifically promoted by NRP2b, whereas inhibiting the HGF receptor MET attenuated NRP2b-dependent cell migration. Unlike NRP2a, NRP2b did not bind the PDZ domain scaffolding protein GAIP carboxyl terminus–interacting protein (GIPC1) and only weakly recruited phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), potentially explaining the difference between NRP2b-mediated and NRP2a-mediated effects. Analysis of NSCLC patient tumors showed that NRP2b <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance correlated with that of the immune cell checkpoint receptor ligand PD-L1 as well as with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotypes in the tumors, acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors, disease progression, and poor survival in patients. NRP2b knockdown attenuated the acquisition of resistance to the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib in cultured NSCLC cells. Thus, in NSCLC, NRP2b contributed to the oncogenic response to TGFβ and correlated with tumor progression in patients.</p>

Targeting TNFR2 with antagonistic antibodies inhibits proliferation of ovarian cancer cells and tumor-associated T<sub>regs</sub>
<p>Major barriers to cancer therapy include the lack of selective inhibitors of regulatory T cells (T<sub>regs</sub>) and the lack of broadly applicable ways to directly target tumors through frequently expressed surface oncogenes. Tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2) is an attractive target protein because of its restricted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance to highly immunosuppressive T<sub>regs</sub> and oncogenic presence on human tumors. We characterized the effect of TNFR2 inhibition using antagonistic antibodies. In culture-based assays, we found that two TNFR2 antagonists inhibited T<sub>reg</sub> proliferation, reduced soluble TNFR2 secretion from normal cells, and enabled T effector cell expansion. The antagonistic activity occurred in the presence of added TNF, a natural TNFR2 agonist. These TNFR2 antibodies killed T<sub>regs</sub> isolated from ovarian cancer ascites more potently than it killed T<sub>regs</sub> from healthy donor samples, suggesting that these antibodies may have specificity for the tumor microenvironment. The TNFR2 antagonists also killed OVCAR3 ovarian cancer cells, which have <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ant surface TNFR2. The antibodies stabilized antiparallel dimers in cell surface TNFR2 that rendered the receptor unable to activate the nuclear factor κB pathway and trigger cell proliferation. Our data suggest that, by targeting tumor cells and immunosuppressive tumor-associated T<sub>regs</sub>, antagonistic TNFR2 antibodies may be an effective treatment for cancers positive for TNFR2.</p>

The SCF<sup>β-TRCP</sup> E3 ubiquitin ligase complex targets Lipin1 for ubiquitination and degradation to promote hepatic lipogenesis
<p>The SCF<sup>β-TRCP</sup> E3 ubiquitin ligase complex plays pivotal roles in normal cellular physiology and in pathophysiological conditions. Identification of β-transducin repeat–containing protein (β-TRCP) substrates is therefore critical to understand SCF<sup>β-TRCP</sup> biology and function. We used a β-TRCP–phosphodegron motif–specific antibody in a β-TRCP substrate screen coupled with tandem mass spectrometry and identified multiple β-TRCP substrates. One of these substrates was Lipin1, an enzyme and suppressor of the family of sterol regulatory element–binding protein (SREBP) transcription factors, which activate genes encoding lipogenic factors. We showed that SCF<sup>β-TRCP</sup> specifically interacted with and promoted the polyubiquitination of Lipin1 in a manner that required phosphorylation of Lipin1 by mechanistic target of rapamycin 1 (mTORC1) and casein kinase I (CKI). β-<i>TRCP</i> depletion in HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells resulted in increased Lipin1 protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance, suppression of SREBP-dependent gene expression, and attenuation of triglyceride synthesis. Moreover, β-<i>TRCP1</i> knockout mice showed increased Lipin1 protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance and were protected from hepatic steatosis induced by a high-fat diet. Together, these data reveal a critical physiological function of β-TRCP in regulating hepatic lipid metabolic homeostasis in part through modulating Lipin1 stability.</p>

Herbivores as drivers of negative density dependence in tropical forest saplings
<p>Ecological theory predicts that the high local diversity observed in tropical forests is maintained by negative density–dependent interactions within and between closely related plant species. By using long-term data on tree growth and survival for coexisting <i>Inga</i> (Fabaceae, Mimosoideae) congeners, we tested two mechanisms thought to underlie negative density dependence (NDD): competition for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resourc</span></strong>es and attack by herbivores. We quantified the similarity of neighbors in terms of key ecological traits that mediate these interactions, as well as the similarity of herbivore communities. We show that phytochemical similarity and shared herbivore communities are associated with decreased growth and survival at the sapling stage, a key bottleneck in the life cycle of tropical trees. None of the traits associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resourc</span></strong>e acquisition affect plant performance, indicating that competition between neighbors may not shape local tree diversity. These results suggest that herbivore pressure is the primary mechanism driving NDD at the sapling stage.</p>

Microbiota-activated PPAR-γ signaling inhibits dysbiotic Enterobacteriaceae expansion
<p>Perturbation of the gut-associated microbial community may underlie many human illnesses, but the mechanisms that maintain homeostasis are poorly understood. We found that the depletion of butyrate-producing microbes by antibiotic treatment reduced epithelial signaling through the intracellular butyrate sensor peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ). Nitrate levels increased in the colonic lumen because epithelial expression of <i>Nos2</i>, the gene encoding inducible nitric oxide synthase, was elevated in the absence of PPAR-γ signaling. Microbiota-induced PPAR-γ signaling also limits the luminal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bioavail</span></strong>ability of oxygen by driving the energy metabolism of colonic epithelial cells (colonocytes) toward β-oxidation. Therefore, microbiota-activated PPAR-γ signaling is a homeostatic pathway that prevents a dysbiotic expansion of potentially pathogenic <i>Escherichia</i> and <i>Salmonella</i> by reducing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bioavail</span></strong>ability of respiratory electron acceptors to Enterobacteriaceae in the lumen of the colon.</p>

Mitochondrial Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Contributes to Auxin-Regulated Organ Development
<p>Pyruvate dehydrogenase is the first enzyme (E1) of the PDH complex (PDC). This multienzyme complex contains E1, E2, and E3 components and controls the entry of carbon into the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle to enable cellular energy production. The E1 component of the PDC is composed of an E1α catalytic subunit and an E1β regulatory subunit. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), there are two mitochondrial E1α homologs encoded by <i>IAA-CONJUGATE-RESISTANT 4</i> (<i>IAR4</i>) and <i>IAR4-LIKE</i> (<i>IAR4L</i>), and one mitochondrial E1β homolog. Although IAR4 was reported to be involved in auxin conjugate sensitivity and auxin homeostasis in root development, its precise role remains unknown. Here, we provide experimental evidence that mitochondrial PDC E1 contributes to polar auxin transport during organ development. We performed genetic screens for factors involved in cotyledon development and identified an uncharacterized mutant, <i>macchi-bou 1</i> (<i>mab1</i>). <i>MAB1</i> encodes a mitochondrial PDC E1β subunit that can form both a homodimer and a heterodimer with IAR4. The <i>mab1</i> mutation impaired MAB1 homodimerization, reduced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of IAR4 and IAR4L, weakened PDC enzymatic activity, and diminished mitochondrial respiration. A metabolomics analysis showed significant changes in metabolites including amino acids in <i>mab1</i> and, in particular, identified an accumulation of Ala. These results suggest that MAB1 is a component of the Arabidopsis mitochondrial PDC E1. Furthermore, in <i>mab1</i> mutants and seedlings where the TCA cycle was pharmacologically blocked, we found reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of the PIN-FORMED (PIN) auxin efflux carriers, possibly due to impaired PIN recycling and enhanced PIN degradation in vacuoles. Therefore, we suggest that <i>mab1</i> induces defective polar auxin transport via metabolic abnormalities.</p>

Senescence and Defense Pathways Contribute to Heterosis
<p>Hybrids are used extensively in agriculture due to their superior performance in seed yield and plant growth, yet the molecular mechanisms underpinning hybrid performance are not well understood. Recent evidence has suggested that a decrease in basal defense response gene expression regulated by reduced levels of salicylic acid (SA) may be important for vigor in certain hybrid combinations. Decreasing levels of SA in the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) accession C24 through the introduction of the SA catabolic enzyme salicylate1 hydroxylase (NahG) increases plant size, phenocopying the large-sized C24/Landsberg <i>erecta</i> (L<i>er</i>) F1 hybrids. C24♀ × L<i>er</i>♂ F1 hybrids and C24 NahG lines shared differentially expressed genes and pathways associated with plant defense and leaf senescence including decreased expression of SA biosynthetic genes and SA response genes. The expression of <i>TL1 BINDING TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR1</i>, a key regulator in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resourc</span></strong>e allocation between growth and defense, was decreased in both the F1 hybrid and the C24 NahG lines, which may promote growth.

Tri-Hydroxy-Triacylglycerol Is Efficiently Produced by Position-Specific Castor Acyltransferases
<p>Understanding the biochemistry of triacylglycerol (TAG) assembly is critical in tailoring seed oils to produce high-value products. Hydroxy-fatty acid (HFA) is one such valuable modified fatty acid, which can be produced at low levels in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed through transgenic expression of the castor (<i>Ricinus communis</i>) hydroxylase. The resulting plants have low seed oil content and poor seedling establishment, indicating that Arabidopsis lacks efficient metabolic networks for biosynthesis and catabolism of hydroxy-containing TAG. To improve utilization of such substrates, we expressed three castor acyltransferase enzymes that incorporate HFA at each stereochemical position during TAG synthesis. This produced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ant tri-HFA TAG and concentrated 44% of seed HFA moieties into this one TAG species. Ricinoleic acid was more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ant than any other fatty acid in these seeds, which had 3-fold more HFA by weight than that in seeds following simple hydroxylase expression, the highest yet measured in a nonnative plant. Efficient utilization of hydroxy-containing lipid substrates increased the rate of TAG synthesis 2-fold, leading to complete relief of the low-oil phenotype. Partition of HFA into specific TAG molecules increased the storage lipid available for mobilization during seedling development, resulting in a 1.9-fold increase in seedling establishment. Expression of a complete acyltransferase pathway to efficiently process HFA establishes a benchmark in the quest to successfully produce modified oils in plants.</p>

HCN Regulates Cellular Processes through Posttranslational Modification of Proteins by <i>S-</i>cyanylation
<p>Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) is coproduced with ethylene in plant cells and is primarily enzymatically detoxified by the mitochondrial β-CYANOALANINE SYNTHASE (CAS-C1). Permanent or transient depletion of CAS-C1 activity in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) results in physiological alterations in the plant that suggest that HCN acts as a gasotransmitter molecule. Label-free quantitative proteomic analysis of mitochondrially enriched samples isolated from the wild type and <i>cas-c1</i> mutant revealed significant changes in protein content, identifying 451 proteins that are absent or less <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ant in <i>cas-c1</i> and 353 proteins that are only present or more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ant in <i>cas-c1</i>. Gene ontology classification of these proteins identified proteomic changes that explain the root hairless phenotype and the altered immune response observed in the <i>cas-c1</i> mutant. The mechanism of action of cyanide as a signaling molecule was addressed using two proteomic approaches aimed at identifying the <i>S-</i>cyanylation of Cys as a posttranslational modification of proteins. Both the 2-imino-thiazolidine chemical method and the direct untargeted analysis of proteins using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry identified a set of 163 proteins susceptible to <i>S-</i>cyanylation that included SEDOHEPTULOSE 1,7-BISPHOSPHATASE (SBPase), the PEPTIDYL-PROLYL CIS-TRANS ISOMERASE 20-3 (CYP20-3), and ENOLASE2 (ENO2). In vitro analysis of these enzymes showed that <i>S-</i>cyanylation of SBPase Cys<sup>74</sup>, CYP20-3 Cys<sup>259</sup>, and ENO2 Cys<sup>346</sup> residues affected their enzymatic activity. Gene Ontology classification and protein-protein interaction cluster analysis showed that <i>S-</i>cyanylation is involved in the regulation of primary metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis, and the Calvin and <i>S</i>-adenosyl-Met cycles.</p>

RNA Polymerase II Read-Through Promotes Expression of Neighboring Genes in SAL1-PAP-XRN Retrograde Signaling
<p>In plants, the molecular function(s) of the nucleus-localized 5′-3′ EXORIBONUCLEASES (XRNs) are unclear; however, their activity is reported to have a significant effect on gene expression and SAL1-mediated retrograde signaling. Using parallel analysis of RNA ends, we documented a dramatic increase in uncapped RNA substrates of the XRNs in both <i>sal1</i> and <i>xrn2xrn3</i> mutants. We found that a major consequence of reducing SAL1 or XRN activity was RNA Polymerase II 3′ read-through. This occurred at 72% of expressed genes, demonstrating a major genome-wide role for the XRN-torpedo model of transcription termination in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Read-through is speculated to have a negative effect on transcript <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance; however, we did not observe this. Rather, we identified a strong association between read-through and increased transcript <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of tandemly orientated downstream genes, strongly correlated with the proximity (less than 1,000 bp) and expression of the upstream gene. We observed read-through in the proximity of 903 genes up-regulated in the <i>sal1-8</i> retrograde signaling mutant; thus, this phenomenon may account directly for up to 23% of genes up-regulated in <i>sal1-8</i>. Using <i>APX2</i> and <i>AT5G43770</i> as exemplars, we genetically uncoupled read-through loci from downstream genes to validate the principle of read-through-mediated mRNA regulation, providing one mechanism by which an ostensibly posttranscriptional exoribonuclease that targets uncapped RNAs could modulate gene expression.</p>

Differential Roles of the Thylakoid Lumenal Deg Protease Homologs in Chloroplast Proteostasis<xref><sup>,2</sup></xref>
<p>Deg proteases are involved in protein quality control in prokaryotes. Of the three Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) homologs, Deg1, Deg5, and Deg8, located in the thylakoid lumen, Deg1 forms a homohexamer, whereas Deg5 and Deg8 form a heterocomplex. Both Deg1 and Deg5-Deg8 were shown separately to degrade photosynthetic proteins during photoinhibition. To investigate whether Deg1 and Deg5-Deg8 are redundant, a full set of Arabidopsis <i>Deg</i> knockout mutants were generated and their phenotypes were compared. Under all conditions tested, <i>deg1</i> mutants were affected more than the wild type and <i>deg5</i> and <i>deg8</i> mutants. Moreover, overexpression of Deg5-Deg8 could only partially compensate for the loss of Deg1. Comparative proteomics of <i>deg1</i> mutants revealed moderate up-regulation of thylakoid proteins involved in photoprotection, assembly, repair, and housekeeping and down-regulation of those that form photosynthetic complexes. Quantification of protein levels in the wild type revealed that Deg1 was 2-fold more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ant than Deg5-Deg8. Moreover, recombinant Deg1 displayed higher in vitro proteolytic activity. Affinity enrichment assays revealed that Deg1 was precipitated with very few interacting proteins, whereas Deg5-Deg8 was associated with a number of thylakoid proteins, including D1, OECs, LHCBs, Cyt <i>b</i><sub>6</sub><i>f</i>, and NDH subunits, thus implying that Deg5-Deg8 is capable of binding substrates but is unable to degrade them efficiently. This work suggests that differences in protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance and proteolytic activity underlie the differential importance of Deg1 and Deg5-Deg8 protease complexes observed in vivo.</p>

The <i>PILNCR1</i>-miR399 Regulatory Module Is Important for Low Phosphate Tolerance in Maize

Here, we show that miR399 transcripts are strongly induced in maize by phosphate (Pi) deficiency. Transgenic maize plants that overexpressed <i>MIR399b</i> accumulated excessive amounts of P in their shoots and displayed typical Pi-toxicity phenotypes. We reannotated <i>ZmPHO2</i> with an additional 1,165 bp of the 5′ untranslated region. miR399-guided posttranscriptional repression of <i>ZmPHO2</i> was mainly observed in the P-efficient lines. We identified Pi-deficiency-induced long-noncoding RNA1 (<i>PILNCR1</i>) from our strand-specific RNA libraries. Transient expression assays in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> and maize leaf protoplasts demonstrated that <i>PILNCR1</i> inhibits ZmmiR399-guided cleavage of <i>ZmPHO2</i>.

Temperature mediates the effect of humidity on the viscoelasticity of glycoprotein glue within the droplets of an orb-weaving spider's prey capture threads
<p>Sticky viscous prey capture threads retain insects that strike araneoid orb-webs. The threads' two axial fibers support a series of glue droplets, each featuring a core of adhesive viscoelastic glycoprotein covered by an aqueous solution. After sticking, the glue extends, summing the adhesion of multiple droplets, and dissipates some of the energy of a struggling prey. As a day progresses, threads experience a drop in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">humid</span></strong>ity and an increase in temperature, environmental variables that have the potential to alter thread and web function. We hypothesize that thread droplets respond to these opposing environmental changes in a manner that stabilizes their performance, and test this by examining threads spun by <i>Argiope aurantia</i>, a species that occupies exposed, weedy habitats. We confirmed that decreased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">humid</span></strong>ity increases glycoprotein viscosity and found that increased temperature had the opposite effect. To evaluate the combined effect of temperature and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">humid</span></strong>ity on a droplet's ability to transfer adhesive force and dissipate energy, we extended a droplet and measured both the deflection of the axial line supporting the droplet and the duration of its tensive load. The cumulative product of these two indices, which reflects the energy required to extend a droplet, was greatest under afternoon (hot and dry) conditions, less under morning (cool and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">humid</span></strong>) conditions, and least under hot and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">humid</span></strong> afternoon conditions. Although the opposing effects of temperature and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">humid</span></strong>ity tend to stabilize glycoprotein performance, <i>A. aurantia</i> thread droplets appear to function optimally during the afternoon, equipping this species to capture large orthopterans, which are most active at this time.</p>

Tree Physiology
Temperate tree species show identical response in tree water deficit but different sensitivities in sap flow to summer soil drying
<p>Temperate forests are expected to be particularly vulnerable to drought and soil drying because they are not adapted to such conditions and perform best in mesic environments. Here we ask (i) how sensitively four common temperate tree species (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i>, <i>Picea abies</i>, <i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i> and <i>Fraxinus excelsior</i>) respond in their water relations to summer soil drying and seek to determine (ii) if species-specific responses to summer soil drying are related to the onset of declining water status across the four species. Throughout 2012 and 2013 we determined tree water deficit (TWD) as a proxy for tree water status from recorded stem radius changes and monitored sap flow rates with sensors on 16 mature trees studied in the field at Lageren, Switzerland. All tree species responded equally in their relative maximum TWD to the onset of declining soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">moistur</span></strong>e. This implies that the water supply of all tree species was affected by declining soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">moistur</span></strong>e and that none of the four species was able to fully maintain its water status, e.g., by access to alternative water sources in the soil. In contrast we found strong and highly species-specific responses of sap flow to declining soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">moistur</span></strong>e with the strongest decline in <i>P. abies</i> (92%), followed by <i>F. sylvatica</i> (53%) and <i>A. pseudoplatanus</i> (48%). <i>F. excelsior</i> did not significantly reduce sap flow. We hypothesize the species-specific responses in sap flow to declining soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">moistur</span></strong>e that occur despite a simultaneous increase in relative TWD in all species reflect how fast these species approach critical levels of their water status, which is most likely influenced by species-specific traits determining the hydraulic properties of the species tree.</p>

Comparative Analysis of Arabidopsis Ecotypes Reveals a Role for Brassinosteroids in Root Hydrotropism
<p>Plant roots respond to soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">moistur</span></strong>e gradients and remodel their growth orientation toward water through hydrotropism, a process vital for acclimation to a changing soil environment. Mechanisms underlying the root hydrotropic response, however, remain poorly understood. Here, we examined hydrotropism in 31 Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) ecotypes collected from different parts of the world and grown along <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">moistur</span></strong>e gradients in a specially designed soil-simulation system. Comparative transcriptome profiling and physiological analyses were carried out on three selected ecotypes, Wassilewskija (Ws), Columbia (Col-0) (strongly hydrotropic), Col-0 (moderately hydrotropic), and C24 (weakly hydrotropic), and in mutant lines with altered root hydrotropic responses. We show that H<sup>+</sup> efflux, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, redox homeostasis, epigenetic regulation, and phytohormone signaling may contribute to root hydrotropism. Among phytohormones, the role of brassinosteroids (BRs) was examined further. In the presence of an inhibitor of BR biosynthesis, the strong hydrotropic response observed in Ws was reduced. The root H<sup>+</sup> efflux and primary root elongation also were inhibited when compared with C24, an ecotype that showed a weak hydrotropic response. The BR-insensitive mutant <i>bri1-5</i> displayed higher rates of root growth inhibition and root curvature on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">moistur</span></strong>e gradients in vertical or oblique orientation when compared with wild-type Ws. We also demonstrate that BRI1 (a BR receptor) interacts with AHA2 (a plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase) and that their expression patterns are highly coordinated. This synergistic action may contribute to the strong hydrotropism observed in Ws. Our results suggest that BR-associated H<sup>+</sup> efflux is critical in the hydrotropic response of Arabidopsis roots.</p>

Fern Stomatal Responses to ABA and CO<sub>2</sub> Depend on Species and Growth Conditions
<p>Changing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels, climate, and air <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">humid</span></strong>ity affect plant gas exchange that is controlled by stomata, small pores on plant leaves and stems formed by guard cells. Evolution has shaped the morphology and regulatory mechanisms governing stomatal movements to correspond to the needs of various land plant groups over the past 400 million years. Stomata close in response to the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA), elevated CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, and reduced air <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">humid</span></strong>ity. Whether the active regulatory mechanisms that control stomatal closure in response to these stimuli are present already in mosses, the oldest plant group with stomata, or were acquired more recently in angiosperms remains controversial. It has been suggested that the stomata of the basal vascular plants, such as ferns and lycophytes, close solely hydropassively. On the other hand, active stomatal closure in response to ABA and CO<sub>2</sub> was found in several moss, lycophyte, and fern species. Here, we show that the stomata of two temperate fern species respond to ABA and CO<sub>2</sub> and that an active mechanism of stomatal regulation in response to reduced air <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">humid</span></strong>ity is present in some ferns. Importantly, fern stomatal responses depend on growth conditions. The data indicate that the stomatal behavior of ferns is more complex than anticipated before, and active stomatal regulation is present in some ferns and has possibly been lost in others. Further analysis that takes into account fern species, life history, evolutionary age, and growth conditions is required to gain insight into the evolution of land plant stomatal responses.</p>

Regulation of Stomatal Defense by Air Relative Humidity
<p>It has long been observed that environmental conditions play crucial roles in modulating immunity and disease in plants and animals. For instance, many bacterial plant disease outbreaks occur after periods of high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">humid</span></strong>ity and rain. A critical step in bacterial infection is entry into the plant interior through wounds and natural openings, such as stomata, which are adjustable microscopic pores in the epidermal tissue. Several studies have shown that stomatal closure is an integral part of the plant immune response to reduce pathogen invasion. In this study, we found that high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">humid</span></strong>ity can effectively compromise <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i>-triggered stomatal closure in both <i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i> and Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), which is accompanied by early up-regulation of the jasmonic acid (JA) pathway and simultaneous down-regulation of salicylic acid (SA) pathway in guard cells. Furthermore, SA-dependent response, but not JA-dependent response, is faster in guard cells than in whole leaves, suggesting that the SA signaling in guard cells may be independent from other cell types. Thus, we conclude that high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">humid</span></strong>ity, a well-known disease-promoting environmental condition, acts in part by suppressing stomatal defense and is linked to hormone signaling in guard cells.</p>

Carbon dynamics of <i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i> seedlings under drought and complete darkness
<p>Carbon (C) storage is considered a key component to plant survival under drought and shade, although the combined effects of these factors on survival remain poorly understood. We investigated how drought and shade alter the C dynamics and survival of tree seedlings, and whether drought limits the access to or usage of stored C. We experimentally applied two levels of soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">humid</span></strong>ity (well-watered versus drought, the latter induced by dry-down) and light availability (light versus complete darkness) on 1-year-old seedlings of <i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i> L. for 3 months. We quantified the survival, biomass, growth rate and non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) of seedlings at their time of death or at the end of the experiment for those that survived. We found that the soil dried out faster when drought was combined with light than when it was combined with complete darkness. Seedlings subjected to both drought and light showed reduced growth and reached 100% mortality earlier than any other treatment, with the highest NSC concentrations at the time of death. Seedlings exposed to both drought and complete darkness died significantly earlier than seedlings exposed to complete darkness only, but had similar NSC concentrations at time of their death, suggesting that drought accelerated the use of stored C under complete darkness. Complete darkness significantly reduced seedling growth and whole-plant NSC concentrations regardless of soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">humid</span></strong>ity, while root NSC concentrations were significantly more reduced when complete darkness was combined with drought conditions. Thus, the C dynamics in <i>A. pseudoplatanus</i> seedlings under complete darkness was not hindered by drought, i.e., the access and use of stored C was not limited by drought. The contrasting growth and C storage responses driven by drought under light versus complete darkness are consistent with a key role of the drought progression in the C dynamics of trees.</p>

Metropolitan versus small-town influenza
<p>Every year, influenza epidemics occur during winter in regions with temperate climates. The duration, size, and precise timing of influenza epidemics vary from season to season—the numbers of hospitalizations and deaths can be substantial. The influenza epidemic in the winter of 2017–2018 in the United States was extraordinarily severe and long, straining the health care system capacity. Various external factors have been proposed to explain the duration, size, and precise timing of seasonal influenza epidemics, including weakened immune systems during winter, increased social crowding indoors, school leave during the Christmas holiday, and the lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">humid</span></strong>ity in winter. Inferring the relative importance of each of those factors is difficult because they act on a dynamic process that responds sensitively to changes and that is only observable with a measure of error (<i>1</i>–<i>4</i>). How can we determine what is driving influenza epidemics? On page 75 of this issue, Dalziel <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) demonstrate how influenza epidemics in a city are driven by fluctuations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">humid</span></strong>ity, modulated by the population size. This implies that influenza control measures could work differently in large metropolitan areas compared to small towns.</p>

Water harvesting from air with metal-organic frameworks powered by natural sunlight
<p>Atmospheric water is a resource equivalent to ~10% of all fresh water in lakes on Earth. However, an efficient process for capturing and delivering water from air, especially at low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">humid</span></strong>ity levels (down to 20%), has not been developed. We report the design and demonstration of a device based on a porous metal-organic framework {MOF-801, [Zr<sub>6</sub>O<sub>4</sub>(OH)<sub>4</sub>(fumarate)<sub>6</sub>]} that captures water from the atmosphere at ambient conditions by using low-grade heat from natural sunlight at a flux of less than 1 sun (1 kilowatt per square meter). This device is capable of harvesting 2.8 liters of water per kilogram of MOF daily at relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">humid</span></strong>ity levels as low as 20% and requires no additional input of energy.</p>

The Sites of Evaporation within Leaves
<p>The sites of evaporation within leaves are unknown, but they have drawn attention for decades due to their perceived implications for many factors, including patterns of leaf isotopic enrichment, the maintenance of mesophyll water status, stomatal regulation, and the interpretation of measured stomatal and leaf hydraulic conductances. We used a spatially explicit model of coupled water and heat transport outside the xylem, MOFLO 2.0, to map the distribution of net evaporation across leaf tissues in relation to anatomy and environmental parameters. Our results corroborate earlier predictions that most evaporation occurs from the epidermis at low light and moderate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">humid</span></strong>ity but that the mesophyll contributes substantially when the leaf center is warmed by light absorption, and more so under high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">humid</span></strong>ity. We also found that the bundle sheath provides a significant minority of evaporation (15% in darkness and 18% in high light), that the vertical center of amphistomatous leaves supports net condensation, and that vertical temperature gradients caused by light absorption vary over 10-fold across species, reaching 0.3°C. We show that several hypotheses that depend on the evaporating sites require revision in light of our findings, including that experimental measurements of stomatal and hydraulic conductances should be affected directly by changes in the location of the evaporating sites. We propose a new conceptual model that accounts for mixed-phase water transport outside the xylem. These conclusions have far-reaching implications for inferences in leaf hydraulics, gas exchange, water use, and isotope physiology.</p>

Limited acclimation in leaf anatomy to experimental drought in tropical rainforest trees
<p>Dry periods are predicted to become more frequent and severe in the future in some parts of the tropics, including Amazonia, potentially causing reduced productivity, higher tree mortality and increased emissions of stored carbon. Using a long-term (12 year) through-fall exclusion (TFE) experiment in the tropics, we test the hypothesis that trees produce leaves adapted to cope with higher levels of water stress, by examining the following leaf characteristics: area, thickness, leaf mass per area, vein density, stomatal density, the thickness of palisade mesophyll, spongy mesophyll and both of the epidermal layers, internal cavity volume and the average cell sizes of the palisade and spongy mesophyll. We also test whether differences in leaf anatomy are consistent with observed differential drought-induced mortality responses among taxa, and look for relationships between leaf anatomy, and leaf water relations and gas exchange parameters. Our data show that trees do not produce leaves that are more xeromorphic in response to 12 years of soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">moistur</span></strong>e deficit. However, the drought treatment did result in increases in the thickness of the adaxial epidermis (TFE: 20.5 ± 1.5 µm, control: 16.7 ± 1.0 µm) and the internal cavity volume (TFE: 2.43 ± 0.50 mm<sup>3</sup> cm<sup>−2</sup>, control: 1.77 ± 0.30 mm<sup>3 </sup>cm<sup>−2</sup>). No consistent differences were detected between drought-resistant and drought-sensitive taxa, although interactions occurred between drought-sensitivity status and drought treatment for the palisade mesophyll thickness (<i>P</i> = 0.034) and the cavity volume of the leaves (<i>P</i> = 0.025). The limited response to water deficit probably reflects a tight co-ordination between leaf morphology, water relations and photosynthetic properties. This suggests that there is little plasticity in these aspects of plant anatomy in these taxa, and that phenotypic plasticity in leaf traits may not facilitate the acclimation of Amazonian trees to the predicted future reductions in dry season water availability.</p>

Differential radial growth patterns between beech (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i> L.) and oak (<i>Quercus robur</i> L.) on periodically waterlogged soils
<p>Climate scenarios for northern Central Europe project rising temperatures and increasing frequency and intensity of droughts but also a shift in precipitation pattern with more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">humid</span></strong> winters. This in turn may result in soil waterlogging during the following spring, leading to increasing stress for trees growing on hydric sites. The influence of waterlogging on growth of common beech and pedunculate oak has been studied intensively on seedlings under experimental conditions. However, the question remains whether results of these studies can be transferred to mature trees growing under natural conditions. To test this, we investigated general growth patterns and climate–growth relationships in four mature stands of beech and oak growing on hydromorphic soils (Stagnosols) in northeast Germany using dendrochronological methods. Our results confirmed the expected tolerance of oak to strong water-level fluctuations. Neither extremely wet conditions during spring nor summer droughts significantly affected its radial growth. Oak growth responded positively to warmer temperatures during previous year October and March of the current year of ring formation. Contrary to our expectations, also beech showed relatively low sensitivity to periods of high soil water saturation. Instead, summer drought turned out to be the main climatic factor influencing ring width of beech even under the specific periodically wet soil conditions of our study. This became evident from general climate–growth correlations over the last century as well as from discontinuous (pointer year) analysis with summer drought being significantly correlated to the occurrence of growth depressions. As ring width of the two species is affected by differing climate parameters, species-specific chronologies show no coherence in high-frequency variations even for trees growing in close proximity. We assume differences in rooting depth as the main reason for the differing growth patterns and climate correlations of the two species under study. Our results indicate that under the projected future climate scenarios, beech may suffer from increasing drought stress even on hydromorphic soils. Oak might be able to maintain a sufficient hydraulic status during summer droughts by reaching water in deeper soil strata with its root system. Wet phases with waterlogged soil conditions during spring or summer appear to have only a little direct influence on radial growth of both species.</p>

Is Permanent Parasitism Reversible?—Critical Evidence from Early Evolution of House Dust Mites
<p>Long-term specialization may limit the ability of a species to respond to new environmental conditions and lead to a higher likelihood of extinction. For permanent parasites and other symbionts, the most intriguing question is whether these organisms can return to a free-living lifestyle and, thus, escape an evolutionary “dead end.” This question is directly related to Dollo's law, which stipulates that a complex trait (such as being free living vs. parasitic) cannot re-evolve again in the same form. Here, we present conclusive evidence that house dust mites, a group of medically important free-living organisms, evolved from permanent parasites of warm-blooded vertebrates. A robust, multigene topology (315 taxa, 8942 nt), ancestral character state reconstruction, and a test for irreversible evolution (Dollo's law) demonstrate that house dust mites have abandoned a parasitic lifestyle, secondarily becoming free living, and then speciated in several habitats. Hence, as exemplified by this model system, highly specialized permanent parasites may drastically de-specialize to the extent of becoming free living and, thus escape from dead-end evolution. Our phylogenetic and historical ecological framework explains the limited cross-reactivity between allergens from the house dust mites and “storage” mites and the ability of the dust mites to inhibit host immune responses. It also provides insights into how ancestral features related to parasitism (frequent ancestral shifts to unrelated hosts, tolerance to lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">humid</span></strong>ity, and pre-existing enzymes targeting skin and keratinous materials) played a major role in reversal to the free-living state. We propose that parasitic ancestors of pyroglyphids shifted to nests of vertebrates. Later the nest-inhabiting pyroglyphids expanded into human dwellings to become a major source of allergens.

Coordinating the overall stomatal response of plants: Rapid leaf-to-leaf communication during light stress
<p>The plant canopy functions as an aerial array of light-harvesting antennas. To achieve maximal yield, each leaf within this array and the array as a whole need to rapidly adjust to naturally occurring fluctuations in light intensity and quality. Excessive light stress triggers the closing of pores in leaves called stomata to minimize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">moistur</span></strong>e loss. We found that different leaves within the canopy of an <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> plant, including leaves not directly exposed to light, coordinated stomatal closure in response to light stress by sending and receiving rapid systemic signals. This response required the plant hormones abscisic acid and jasmonic acid and was mediated by a rapid autopropagating wave of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Furthermore, this response depended on the function of genes encoding the ROS-generating NADPH oxidase RBOHD and various stomatal regulators, such as the anion channel SLAC1, GHR1 (guard cell hydrogen peroxide resistant 1), and lipoxygenase 1 (LOX1). Our findings reveal that plants function as highly dynamic and coordinated organisms, optimizing the overall response of their canopies to fluctuating light intensities.</p>

Dynamic gating of infrared radiation in a textile
<p>The human body absorbs and loses heat largely through infrared radiation centering around a wavelength of 10 micrometers. However, neither our skin nor the textiles that make up clothing are capable of dynamically controlling this optical channel for thermal management. By coating triacetate-cellulose bimorph fibers with a thin layer of carbon nanotubes, we effectively modulated the infrared radiation by more than 35% as the relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">humid</span></strong>ity of the underlying skin changed. Both experiments and modeling suggest that this dynamic infrared gating effect mainly arises from distance-dependent electromagnetic coupling between neighboring coated fibers in the textile yarns. This effect opens a pathway for developing wearable localized thermal management systems that are autonomous and self-powered, as well as expanding our ability to adapt to demanding environments.</p>

Termites mitigate the effects of drought in tropical rainforest
<p>Termites perform key ecological functions in tropical ecosystems, are strongly affected by variation in rainfall, and respond negatively to habitat disturbance. However, it is not known how the projected increase in frequency and severity of droughts in tropical rainforests will alter termite communities and the maintenance of ecosystem processes. Using a large-scale termite suppression experiment, we found that termite activity and abundance increased during drought in a Bornean forest. This increase resulted in accelerated litter decomposition, elevated soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">moistur</span></strong>e, greater soil nutrient heterogeneity, and higher seedling survival rates during the extreme El Niño drought of 2015–2016. Our work shows how an invertebrate group enhances ecosystem resistance to drought, providing evidence that the dual stressors of climate change and anthropogenic shifts in biotic communities will have various negative consequences for the maintenance of rainforest ecosystems.</p>

Quantification of drought during the collapse of the classic Maya civilization
<p>The demise of Lowland Classic Maya civilization during the Terminal Classic Period (~800 to 1000 CE) is a well-cited example of how past climate may have affected ancient societies. Attempts to estimate the magnitude of hydrologic change, however, have met with equivocal success because of the qualitative and indirect nature of available climate proxy data. We reconstructed the past isotopic composition (δ<sup>18</sup>O, δD, <sup>17</sup>O-excess, and d-excess) of water in Lake Chichancanab, Mexico, using a technique that involves isotopic analysis of the structurally bound water in sedimentary gypsum, which was deposited under drought conditions. The triple oxygen and hydrogen isotope data provide a direct measure of past changes in lake hydrology. We modeled the data and conclude that annual precipitation decreased between 41 and 54% (with intervals of up to 70% rainfall reduction during peak drought conditions) and that relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">humid</span></strong>ity declined by 2 to 7% compared to present-day conditions.</p>

Changing climate shifts timing of European floods
<p>A warming climate is expected to have an impact on the magnitude and timing of river floods; however, no consistent large-scale climate change signal in observed flood magnitudes has been identified so far. We analyzed the timing of river floods in Europe over the past five decades, using a pan-European database from 4262 observational hydrometric stations, and found clear patterns of change in flood timing. Warmer temperatures have led to earlier spring snowmelt floods throughout northeastern Europe; delayed winter storms associated with polar warming have led to later winter floods around the North Sea and some sectors of the Mediterranean coast; and earlier soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">moistur</span></strong>e maxima have led to earlier winter floods in western Europe.

Near-infrared mapping reveals the relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">humid</span></strong>ity within prominent downwelling regions. Juno’s measured gravity field differs substantially from the last available estimate and is one order of magnitude more precise. This has implications for the distribution of heavy elements in the interior, including the existence and mass of Jupiter’s core. The observed magnetic field exhibits smaller spatial variations than expected, indicative of a rich harmonic content.</p>

Stomatal VPD Response: There Is More to the Story Than ABA
<p>Guard cells shrink and close stomatal pores when air <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">humid</span></strong>ity decreases (i.e. when the difference between the vapor pressures of leaf and atmosphere [VPD] increases). The role of abscisic acid (ABA) in VPD-induced stomatal closure has been studied using ABA-related mutants that respond to VPD in some studies and not in others. The importance of ABA biosynthesis in guard cells versus vasculature for whole-plant stomatal regulation is unclear as well. Here, we show that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) lines carrying mutations in different steps of ABA biosynthesis as well as pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) <i>wilty</i> and tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) <i>flacca</i> ABA-deficient mutants had higher stomatal conductance compared with wild-type plants. To characterize the role of ABA production in different cells, we generated transgenic plants where ABA biosynthesis was rescued in guard cells or phloem companion cells of an ABA-deficient mutant. In both cases, the whole-plant stomatal conductance, stunted growth phenotype, and leaf ABA level were restored to wild-type values, pointing to the redundancy of ABA sources and to the effectiveness of leaf ABA transport. All ABA-deficient lines closed their stomata rapidly and extensively in response to high VPD, whereas plants with mutated protein kinase OST1 showed stunted VPD-induced responses. Another strongly ABA-insensitive mutant, defective in the six ABA PYR/RCAR receptors, responded to changes in VPD in both directions strongly and symmetrically, indicating that its VPD-induced closure could be passive hydraulic. We discuss that both the VPD-induced passive hydraulic stomatal closure and the stomatal VPD regulation of ABA-deficient mutants may be conditional on the initial pretreatment stomatal conductance.</p>

Invasion and adaptation of a warm-adapted species to montane localities: effect of acclimation potential
<p><i>Drosophila ananassae</i> has successfully invaded the cold and dry montane localities of the Western Himalayas in recent years. The ability of this desiccation- and cold-sensitive tropical species to evolve in response to seasonal changes in montane localities is largely unknown. Here, we investigated how this sensitive species adapt to seasonally varying environmental conditions that are lethal to its survival. We observed change in the frequency of dark and light morphs of <i>D. ananassae</i> in five mid-altitude localities during the last decade (2000–2010). We document invasion of <i>D. ananassae</i> to montane localities and increase in frequency of the dark morph. The stress tolerance of morphs (dark and light) remained unaffected of developmental acclimation. However, adult acclimation has shown significant effects on tolerance to various environmental stresses in morphs and effect of this acclimation persist for long durations. Desiccation and cold stress tolerance was increased after adult acclimation for respective stress in the dark morph; while tolerance of the light morph was not affected. Further, heat tolerance of the light morph was increased after adult heat acclimation with no influence on heat tolerance of the dark morph. Our results suggest a possible role of adult acclimation in successful invasion and adaptation of <i>D. ananassae</i> to montane localities. Future experiments should be carried out to determine whether the survival in adverse conditions of low <i>versus</i> high temperature and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">humid</span></strong>ity during seasonal changes is assisted by different acclimation abilities of the two morphs of <i>D. ananassae</i>.</p>

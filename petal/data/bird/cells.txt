Topological insulator laser: Theory
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical insulators are phases of matter characterized by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical edge states that propagate in a unidirectional manner that is robust to imperfections and disorder. These attributes make <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical insulator systems ideal candidates for enabling applications in quantum computation and spintronics. We propose a concept that exploits <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical effects in a unique way: the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical insulator laser. These are lasers whose lasing mode exhibits <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ically protected transport without magnetic fields. The underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical properties lead to a highly efficient laser, robust to defects and disorder, with single-mode lasing even at very high gain values. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical insulator laser alters current understanding of the interplay between disorder and lasing, and at the same time opens exciting possibilities in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical physics, such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ically protected transport in systems with gain. On the technological side, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical insulator laser provides a route to arrays of semiconductor lasers that operate as one single-mode high-power laser coupled efficiently into an output port.</p>

Topological insulator laser: Experiments
<p>Physical systems exhibiting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical invariants are naturally endowed with robustness against perturbations, as manifested in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical insulators—materials exhibiting robust electron transport, immune from scattering by defects and disorder. Recent years have witnessed intense efforts toward exploiting these phenomena in photonics. Here we demonstrate a nonmagnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical insulator laser system exhibiting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ically protected transport in the cavity. Its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical properties give rise to single-mode lasing, robustness against defects, and considerably higher slope efficiencies compared to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ically trivial counterparts. We further exploit the properties of active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical platforms by assembling the system from <i>S</i>-chiral microresonators, enforcing predetermined unidirectional lasing without magnetic fields. This work paves the way toward active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical devices with exciting properties and functionalities.</p>

Do varus or valgus outliers have higher forces in the medial or lateral compartments than those which are in-range after a kinematically aligned total knee arthroplasty?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aims of this study were to determine the proportion of patients   with outlier varus or valgus alignment in kinematically aligned   total knee arthroplasty (TKA), whether those with outlier varus   or valgus alignment have higher forces in the medial or lateral   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compart</span></strong>ments of the knee than those with in-range alignment and   whether measurements of the alignment of the limb, knee and components   predict <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compart</span></strong>ment forces.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The intra-operative forces in the medial and lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compart</span></strong>ments   were measured with an instrumented tibial insert in 67 patients   who underwent a kinematically aligned TKA during passive movement.

Measurements   of the alignment of the limb and the components included the hip-knee-ankle   (HKA) angle, proximal medial tibial angle (PMTA), and distal lateral   femoral angle (DLFA). Measurements of the alignment of the knee   and the components included the tibiofemoral angle (TFA), tibial   component angle (TCA) and femoral component angle (FCA).

Nonreciprocal lasing in topological cavities of arbitrary geometries
<p>Resonant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caviti</span></strong>es are essential building blocks governing many wave-based phenomena, but their geometry and reciprocity fundamentally limit the integration of optical devices. We report, at telecommunication wavelengths, geometry-independent and integrated nonreciprocal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caviti</span></strong>es that couple stimulated emission from one-way photonic edge states to a selected waveguide output with an isolation ratio in excess of 10 decibels. Nonreciprocity originates from unidirectional edge states at the boundary between photonic structures with distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical invariants. Our experimental demonstration of lasing from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caviti</span></strong>es provides the opportunity to develop complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical circuitry of arbitrary geometries for the integrated and robust generation and transport of photons in classical and quantum regimes.</p>

Observation of the topological Anderson insulator in disordered atomic wires
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>y and disorder have a rich combined influence on quantum transport. To probe their interplay, we synthesized one-dimensional chiral symmetric wires with controllable disorder via spectroscopic Hamiltonian engineering, based on the laser-driven coupling of discrete momentum states of ultracold atoms. Measuring the bulk evolution of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical indicator after a sudden quench, we observed the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical Anderson insulator phase, in which added disorder drives the band structure of a wire from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ically trivial to nontrivial. In addition, we observed the robustness of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ically nontrivial wires to weak disorder and measured the transition to a trivial phase in the presence of strong disorder. Atomic interactions in this quantum simulation platform may enable realizations of strongly interacting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical fluids.</p>

Shear properties of Earth’s inner core constrained by a detection of <i>J</i> waves in global correlation wavefield
<p>Seismic <i>J</i> waves, shear waves that traverse Earth’s inner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong>, provide direct constraints on the inner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong>’s solidity and shear properties. However, these waves have been elusive in the direct seismic wavefield because of their small amplitudes. We devised a new method to detect <i>J</i> waves in the earthquake coda correlation wavefield. They manifest through the similarity with other compressional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong>-sensitive signals. The inner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> is solid, but relatively soft, with shear-wave speeds and shear moduli of 3.42 ± 0.02 kilometers per second and 149.0 ± 1.6 gigapascals (GPa) near the inner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> boundary and 3.58 ± 0.02 kilometers per second and 167.4 ± 1.6 GPa in Earth’s center. The values are 2.5% lower than the widely used Preliminary Earth Reference Model. This provides new constraints on the dynamical interpretation of Earth’s inner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong>.</p>

Quantized electric multipole insulators
<p>The Berry phase provides a modern formulation of electric polarization in crystals. We extend this concept to higher electric multipole moments and determine the necessary conditions and minimal models for which the quadrupole and octupole moments are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ically quantized electromagnetic observables. Such systems exhibit gapped boundaries that are themselves lower-dimensional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical phases. Furthermore, they host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ically protected corner states carrying fractional charge, exhibiting fractionalization at the boundary of the boundary. To characterize these insulating phases of matter, we introduce a paradigm in which “nested” Wilson loops give rise to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical invariants that have been overlooked. We propose three realistic experimental implementations of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical behavior that can be immediately tested. Our work opens a venue for the expansion of the classification of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical phases of matter.</p>

Electrically tunable low-density superconductivity in a monolayer topological insulator
<p>Turning on superconductivity in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ically nontrivial insulator may provide a route to search for non-Abelian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical states. However, existing demonstrations of superconductor-insulator switches have involved only <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ically trivial systems. Here we report reversible, in situ electrostatic on-off switching of superconductivity in the recently established quantum spin Hall insulator monolayer tungsten ditelluride (WTe<sub>2</sub>). Fabricated into a van der Waals field-effect transistor, the monolayer’s ground state can be continuously gate-tuned from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical insulating to the superconducting state, with critical temperatures <i>T</i><sub>c</sub> up to ~1 kelvin. Our results establish monolayer WTe<sub>2</sub> as a material platform for engineering nanodevices that combine superconducting and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical phases of matter.</p>

Observation of bulk Fermi arc and polarization half charge from paired exceptional points
<p>The ideas of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>y have found tremendous success in closed physical systems, but even richer properties exist in the more general open or dissipative framework. We theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate a bulk Fermi arc that develops from non-Hermitian radiative losses in an open system of photonic crystal slabs. Moreover, we discover half-integer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical charges in the polarization of far-field radiation around the bulk Fermi arc. Both phenomena are shown to be direct consequences of the non-Hermitian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical properties of exceptional points, where resonances coincide in their frequencies and linewidths. Our work connects the fields of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical photonics, non-Hermitian physics, and singular optics, providing a framework to explore more complex non-Hermitian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical systems.</p>

Topological origin of equatorial waves
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>y sheds new light on the emergence of unidirectional edge waves in a variety of physical systems, from condensed matter to artificial lattices. Waves observed in geophysical flows are also robust to perturbations, which suggests a role for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>y. We show a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical origin for two well-known equatorially trapped waves, the Kelvin and Yanai modes, owing to the breaking of time-reversal symmetry by Earth’s rotation. The nontrivial structure of the bulk PoincaréÉééé wave modes encoded through the first Chern number of value 2 guarantees the existence of these waves. This invariant demonstrates that ocean and atmospheric waves share fundamental properties with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical insulators and that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>y plays an unexpected role in Earth’s climate system.</p>

Assembly of a nucleus-like structure during viral replication in bacteria
<p>We observed the assembly of a nucleus-like structure in bacteria during viral infection. Using fluorescence microscopy and cryo-electron tomography, we showed that <i>Pseudomonas chlororaphis</i> phage 201φ2-1 assembled a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compart</span></strong>ment that separated viral DNA from the cytoplasm. The phage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compart</span></strong>ment was centered by a bipolar tubulin-based spindle, and it segregated phage and bacterial proteins according to function. Proteins involved in DNA replication and transcription localized inside the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compart</span></strong>ment, whereas proteins involved in translation and nucleotide synthesis localized outside. Later during infection, viral capsids assembled on the cytoplasmic membrane and moved to the surface of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compart</span></strong>ment for DNA packaging. Ultimately, viral particles were released from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compart</span></strong>ment and the cell lysed. These results demonstrate that phages have evolved a specialized structure to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compart</span></strong>mentalize viral replication.</p>

Dynamic GLUT4 sorting through a syntaxin-6 compartment in muscle cells is derailed by insulin resistance-causing ceramide
<p>GLUT4 constitutively recycles between the plasma membrane and intracellular depots. Insulin shifts this dynamic equilibrium towards the plasma membrane by recruiting GLUT4 to the plasma membrane from insulin-responsive vesicles. Muscle is the primary site for dietary glucose deposition; however, how GLUT4 sorts into insulin-responsive vesicles, and if and how insulin resistance affects this process, is unknown. In L6 myoblasts stably expressing myc-tagged GLUT4, we analyzed the intracellular itinerary of GLUT4 as it internalizes from the cell surface and examined if such sorting is perturbed by C2-ceramide, a lipid metabolite causing insulin resistance. Surface-labeled GLUT4<i>myc</i> that internalized for 30 min accumulated in a Syntaxin-6 (Stx6)- and Stx16-positive perinuclear sub-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compart</span></strong>ment devoid of furin or internalized transferrin, and displayed insulin-responsive re-exocytosis. C2-ceramide dispersed the Stx6-positive sub-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compart</span></strong>ment and prevented insulin-responsive re-exocytosis of internalized GLUT4<i>myc</i>, even under conditions not affecting insulin-stimulated signaling towards Akt. Microtubule disruption with nocodazole prevented pre-internalized GLUT4<i>myc</i> from reaching the Stx6-positive perinuclear sub-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compart</span></strong>ment and from undergoing insulin-responsive exocytosis. Removing nocodazole allowed both parameters to recover, suggesting that the Stx6-positive perinuclear sub-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compart</span></strong>ment was required for GLUT4 insulin-responsiveness. Accordingly, Stx6 knockdown inhibited by ∼50% the ability of internalized GLUT4<i>myc</i> to undergo insulin-responsive re-exocytosis without altering its overall perinuclear accumulation. We propose that Stx6 defines the insulin-responsive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compart</span></strong>ment in muscle cells. Our data are consistent with a model where ceramide could cause insulin resistance by altering intracellular GLUT4 sorting.</p>

Second Chern number of a quantum-simulated non-Abelian Yang monopole
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical order is often quantified in terms of Chern numbers, each of which classifies a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical singularity. Here, inspired by concepts from high-energy physics, we use quantum simulation based on the spin degrees of freedom of atomic Bose-Einstein condensates to characterize a singularity present in five-dimensional non-Abelian gauge theories—a Yang monopole. We quantify the monopole in terms of Chern numbers measured on enclosing manifolds: Whereas the well-known first Chern number vanishes, the second Chern number does not. By displacing the manifold, we induce and observe a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical transition, where the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>y of the manifold changes to a trivial state.</p>

Structure of the maize photosystem I supercomplex with light-harvesting complexes I and II

mRNA structure determines specificity of a polyQ-driven phase separation

How distinct molecular compositions are established and maintained in these liquid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compart</span></strong>ments is unknown. Here, we report that secondary structure allows messenger RNAs (mRNAs) to self-associate and determines whether an mRNA is recruited to or excluded from liquid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compart</span></strong>ments. The polyQ-protein Whi3 induces conformational changes in RNA structure and generates distinct molecular fluctuations depending on the RNA sequence. These data support a model in which structure-based, RNA-RNA interactions promote assembly of distinct droplets and protein-driven, conformational dynamics of the RNA maintain this identity. Thus, the shape of RNA can promote the formation and coexistence of the diverse array of RNA-rich liquid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compart</span></strong>ments found in a single cell.</p>

Most of the proposed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical superconductors are realized in difficult-to-fabricate heterostructures at very low temperatures.

Observation of fractional Chern insulators in a van der Waals heterostructure
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ically ordered phases are characterized by long-range quantum entanglement and fractional statistics rather than by symmetry breaking.

A topological quantum optics interface

Interferon Regulatory Factor 5 Controls Necrotic Core Formation in Atherosclerotic Lesions by Impairing Efferocytosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Myeloid cells are central to atherosclerotic lesion development and vulnerable plaque formation.

Limited acclimation in leaf anatomy to experimental drought in tropical rainforest trees
<p>Dry periods are predicted to become more frequent and severe in the future in some parts of the tropics, including Amazonia, potentially causing reduced productivity, higher tree mortality and increased emissions of stored carbon. Using a long-term (12 year) through-fall exclusion (TFE) experiment in the tropics, we test the hypothesis that trees produce leaves adapted to cope with higher levels of water stress, by examining the following leaf characteristics: area, thickness, leaf mass per area, vein density, stomatal density, the thickness of palisade mesophyll, spongy mesophyll and both of the epidermal layers, internal cavity volume and the average cell sizes of the palisade and spongy mesophyll. We also test whether differences in leaf anatomy are consistent with observed differential drought-induced mortality responses among taxa, and look for relationships between leaf anatomy, and leaf water relations and gas exchange parameters. Our data show that trees do not produce leaves that are more xeromorphic in response to 12 years of soil moisture deficit. However, the drought treatment did result in increases in the thickness of the adaxial epidermis (TFE: 20.5 ± 1.5 µm, control: 16.7 ± 1.0 µm) and the internal cavity volume (TFE: 2.43 ± 0.50 mm<sup>3</sup> cm<sup>−2</sup>, control: 1.77 ± 0.30 mm<sup>3 </sup>cm<sup>−2</sup>). No consistent differences were detected between drought-resistant and drought-sensitive taxa, although interactions occurred between drought-sensitivity status and drought treatment for the palisade mesophyll thickness (<i>P</i> = 0.034) and the cavity volume of the leaves (<i>P</i> = 0.025). The limited response to water deficit probably reflects a tight co-ordination between leaf morphology, water relations and photosynthetic properties. This suggests that there is little plasticity in these aspects of plant anatomy in these taxa, and that phenotypic plasticity in leaf traits may not facilitate the acclimation of Amazonian trees to the predicted future reductions in dry season water availability.</p>

Gate-induced superconductivity in a monolayer topological insulator
<p>The layered semimetal tungsten ditelluride (WTe<sub>2</sub>) has recently been found to be a two-dimensional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical insulator (2D TI) when thinned down to a single monolayer, with conducting helical edge channels. We found that intrinsic superconductivity can be induced in this monolayer 2D TI by mild electrostatic doping at temperatures below 1 kelvin. The 2D TI–superconductor transition can be driven by applying a small gate voltage. This discovery offers possibilities for gate-controlled devices combining superconductivity and nontrivial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical properties, and could provide a basis for quantum information schemes based on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical protection.</p>

Photon-mediated interactions between quantum emitters in a diamond nanocavity
<p>Photon-mediated interactions between quantum systems are essential for realizing quantum networks and scalable quantum information processing. We demonstrate such interactions between pairs of silicon-vacancy (SiV) color centers coupled to a diamond nanophotonic cavity. When the optical transitions of the two color centers are tuned into resonance, the coupling to the common cavity mode results in a coherent interaction between them, leading to spectrally resolved superradiant and subradiant states. We use the electronic spin degrees of freedom of the SiV centers to control these optically mediated interactions. Such controlled interactions will be crucial in developing cavity-mediated quantum gates between spin qubits and for realizing scalable quantum network nodes.</p>

Topological protection of biphoton states
<p>The robust generation and propagation of multiphoton quantum states are crucial for applications in quantum information, computing, and communications. Although photons are intrinsically well isolated from the thermal environment, scaling to large quantum optical devices is still limited by scattering loss and other errors arising from random fabrication imperfections. The recent discoveries regarding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical phases have introduced avenues to construct quantum systems that are protected against scattering and imperfections. We experimentally demonstrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical protection of biphoton states, the building block for quantum information systems.

Evidence for Majorana bound states in an iron-based superconductor
<p>The search for Majorana bound states (MBSs) has been fueled by the prospect of using their non-Abelian statistics for robust quantum computation. Two-dimensional superconducting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical materials have been predicted to host MBSs as zero-energy modes in vortex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong>s.

The evolution of the peak under varying magnetic field, temperature, and tunneling barrier is consistent with the tunneling to a nearly pure MBS, separated from non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical bound states. This observation offers a potential platform for realizing and manipulating MBSs at a relatively high temperature.</p>

Ideal Weyl points and helicoid surface states in artificial photonic crystal structures

Coherent single-atom superradiance
<p>Superradiance is a quantum phenomenon emerging in macroscopic systems whereby correlated single atoms cooperatively emit photons. Demonstration of controlled collective atom-field interactions has resulted from the ability to directly imprint correlations with an atomic ensemble. Here we report cavity-mediated coherent single-atom superradiance: Single atoms with predefined correlation traverse a high–quality factor cavity one by one, emitting photons cooperatively with the <i>N</i> atoms that have already gone through the cavity (<i>N</i> represents the number of atoms). Enhanced collective photoemission of <i>N</i>-squared dependence was observed even when the intracavity atom number was less than unity. The correlation among single atoms was achieved by nanometer-precision position control and phase-aligned state manipulation of atoms by using a nanohole-array aperture. Our results demonstrate a platform for phase-controlled atom-field interactions.</p>

Structural insights into ion conduction by channelrhodopsin 2
<p>The light-gated ion channel channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2) from <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> is a major optogenetic tool. Photon absorption starts a well-characterized photocycle, but the structural basis for the regulation of channel opening remains unclear. We present high-resolution structures of ChR2 and the C128T mutant, which has a markedly increased open-state lifetime. The structure reveals two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caviti</span></strong>es on the intracellular side and two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caviti</span></strong>es on the extracellular side. They are connected by extended hydrogen-bonding networks involving water molecules and side-chain residues. Central is the retinal Schiff base that controls and synchronizes three gates that separate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caviti</span></strong>es. Separate from this network is the DC gate that comprises a water-mediated bond between C128 and D156 and interacts directly with the retinal Schiff base. Comparison with the C128T structure reveals a direct connection of the DC gate to the central gate and suggests how the gating mechanism is affected by subtle tuning of the Schiff base’s interactions.</p>

Distinguishing a Majorana zero mode using spin-resolved measurements

We use spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy to show that MZMs realized in self-assembled Fe chains on the surface of Pb have a spin polarization that exceeds that stemming from the magnetism of these chains. This feature, captured by our model calculations, is a direct consequence of the nonlocality of the Hilbert space of MZMs emerging from a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical band structure.

Real-time spectral interferometry probes the internal dynamics of femtosecond soliton molecules

By means of an emerging time-stretch technique, we resolve the evolution of femtosecond soliton molecules in the cavity of a few-cycle mode-locked laser. We track two- and three-soliton bound states over hundreds of thousands of consecutive cavity roundtrips, identifying fixed points and periodic and aperiodic molecular orbits.

Principles for designing proteins with cavities formed by curved β sheets

Nuclear magnetic resonance and crystal structures of the designs closely match the computational models, showing that β-sheet curvature can be controlled with atomic-level accuracy.

The structure and flexibility of conical HIV-1 capsids determined within intact virions

Robust spin-polarized midgap states at step edges of topological crystalline insulators

Myosins XI Are Involved in Exocytosis of Cellulose Synthase Complexes
<p>In plants, cellulose is synthesized at the cell surface by plasma membrane (PM)-localized cellulose synthase (CESA) complexes (CSCs). The molecular and cellular mechanisms that underpin delivery of CSCs to the PM, however, are poorly understood. Cortical microtubules have been shown to interact with CESA-containing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compart</span></strong>ments and mark the site for CSC delivery, but are not required for the delivery itself. Here, we demonstrate that myosin XI and the actin cytoskeleton mediate CSC delivery to the PM by coordinating the exocytosis of CESA-containing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compart</span></strong>ments. Measurement of cellulose content indicated that cellulose biosynthesis was significantly reduced in a <i>myosin xik xi1 xi2</i> triple-knockout mutant. By combining genetic and pharmacological disruption of myosin activity with quantitative live-cell imaging, we observed decreased abundance of PM-localized CSCs and reduced delivery rate of CSCs in myosin-deficient cells. These phenotypes correlated with a significant increase in failed vesicle secretion events at the PM as well as an abnormal accumulation of CESA-containing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compart</span></strong>ments at the cell cortex. Through high-resolution spatiotemporal assays of cortical vesicle behavior, we identified defects in CSC vesicle tethering and fusion at the PM. Furthermore, disruption of myosin activity reduced the delivery of several other secretory markers to the PM and reduced constitutive and receptor-mediated endocytosis. These findings reveal a previously undescribed role for myosin in vesicle secretion and cellulose production at the cytoskeleton-PM-cell wall nexus.</p>

Dynamic Changes between Two LHCX-Related Energy Quenching Sites Control Diatom Photoacclimation
<p>Marine diatoms are prominent phytoplankton organisms that perform photosynthesis in extremely variable environments. Diatoms possess a strong ability to dissipate excess absorbed energy as heat via nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ). This process relies on changes in carotenoid pigment composition (xanthophyll cycle) and on specific members of the light-harvesting complex family specialized in photoprotection (LHCXs), which potentially act as NPQ effectors. However, the link between light stress, NPQ, and the existence of different LHCX isoforms is not understood in these organisms. Using picosecond fluorescence analysis, we observed two types of NPQ in the pennate diatom <i>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</i> that were dependent on light conditions. Short exposure of low-light-acclimated cells to high light triggers the onset of energy quenching close to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> of photosystem II, while prolonged light stress activates NPQ in the antenna. Biochemical analysis indicated a link between the changes in the NPQ site/mechanism and the induction of different LHCX isoforms, which accumulate either in the antenna complexes or in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> complex. By comparing the responses of wild-type cells and transgenic lines with a reduced expression of the major LHCX isoform, LHCX1, we conclude that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> complex-associated NPQ is more effective in photoprotection than is the antenna complex. Overall, our data clarify the complex molecular scenario of light responses in diatoms and provide a rationale for the existence of a degenerate family of LHCX proteins in these algae.</p>

Stable Accumulation of Photosystem II Requires ONE-HELIX PROTEIN1 (OHP1) of the Light Harvesting-Like Family

Tagged null mutants of <i>OHP1</i> and <i>OHP2</i> (<i>ohp1</i> and <i>ohp2</i>) showed stunted growth with pale-green leaves on agar plates, and these mutants were unable to grow on soil. Leaf chlorophyll fluorescence and the composition of thylakoid membrane proteins revealed that <i>ohp1</i> deletion substantially affected photosystem II (PSII) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> protein function and led to reduced levels of photosystem I <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> proteins; however, it did not affect LHC accumulation. Transgenic <i>ohp1</i> plants rescued with OHP1-HA or OHP1-Myc proteins developed a normal phenotype. Using these tagged OHP1 proteins in transgenic plants, we localized OHP1 to thylakoid membranes, where it formed protein complexes with both OHP2 and High Chlorophyll Fluorescence244 (HCF244). We also found PSII <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> proteins D1/D2, HCF136, and HCF173 and a few other plant-specific proteins associated with the OHP1/OHP2-HCF244 complex, suggesting that these complexes are early intermediates in PSII assembly. OHP1 interacted directly with HCF244 in the complex. Therefore, OHP1 and HCF244 play important roles in the stable accumulation of PSII.</p>

Microtubule Array Patterns Have a Common Underlying Architecture in Hypocotyl Cells
<p>Microtubules at the plant cell cortex influence cell shape by patterning the deposition of cell wall materials. The elongated cells of the hypocotyl create a variety of microtubule array patterns with differing degrees of polymer coalignment and orientation to the cell’s growth axis. To gain insight into the mechanisms driving array organization, we investigated the underlying microtubule array architecture in light-grown epidermal cells with explicit reference to array pattern. We discovered that all nontransverse patterns share a common underlying array architecture, having a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> unimodal peak of coaligned microtubules in a split bipolarized arrangement. The growing microtubule plus ends extend toward the cell’s apex and base with a region of antiparallel microtubule overlap at the cell’s midzone. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> coalignment continuously shifts between ±30° from the cell’s longitudinal growth axis, forming a continuum of longitudinal and oblique arrays. Transverse arrays exhibit the same unimodal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> coalignment but form local domains of microtubules polymerizing in the same direction rather than a split bipolarized architecture. Quantitative imaging experiments and analysis of <i>katanin</i> mutants showed that the longitudinal arrays are created from microtubules originating on the outer periclinal cell face, pointing to a cell-directed, rather than self-organizing, mechanism for specifying the major array pattern classes in the hypocotyl cell.</p>

Storage Compartments for Capillary Water Rarely Refill in an Intact Woody Plant
<p>Water storage is thought to play an integral role in the maintenance of whole-plant water balance. The contribution of both living and dead cells to water storage can be derived from rehydration and water-release curves on excised plant material, but the underlying tissue-specific emptying/refilling dynamics remain unclear. Here, we used x-ray computed microtomography to characterize the refilling of xylem fibers, pith cells, and vessels under both excised and in vivo conditions in <i>Laurus nobilis</i>. In excised stems supplied with water, water uptake exhibited a biphasic response curve, and x-ray computed microtomography images showed that high water storage capacitance was associated with fiber and pith refilling as driven by capillary forces: fibers refilled more rapidly than pith cells, while vessel refilling was minimal. In excised stems that were sealed, fiber and pith refilling was associated with vessel emptying, indicating a link between tissue connectivity and water storage. In contrast, refilling of fibers, pith cells, and vessels was negligible in intact saplings over two time scales, 24 h and 3 weeks. However, those <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compart</span></strong>ments did refill slowly when the shoot was covered to prevent transpiration. Collectively, our data (1) provide direct evidence that storage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compart</span></strong>ments for capillary water refill in excised stems but rarely under in vivo conditions, (2) highlight that estimates of capacitance from excised samples should be interpreted with caution, as certain storage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compart</span></strong>ments may not be utilized in the intact plant, and (3) question the paradigm that fibers play a substantial role in daily discharge/recharge of stem capacitance in an intact tree.</p>

Rice Cellulose SynthaseA8 Plant-Conserved Region Is a Coiled-Coil at the Catalytic Core Entrance
<p>The crystallographic structure of a rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) cellulose synthase, OsCesA8, plant-conserved region (P-CR), one of two unique domains in the catalytic domain of plant CesAs, was solved to 2.4 ÅÅ resolution. Two antiparallel α-helices form a coiled-coil domain linked by a large extended connector loop containing a conserved trio of aromatic residues. The P-CR structure was fit into a molecular envelope for the P-CR domain derived from small-angle X-ray scattering data. The P-CR structure and molecular envelope, combined with a homology-based chain trace of the CesA8 catalytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong>, were modeled into a previously determined CesA8 small-angle X-ray scattering molecular envelope to produce a detailed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical model of the CesA8 catalytic domain. The predicted position for the P-CR domain from the molecular docking models places the P-CR connector loop into a hydrophobic pocket of the catalytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong>, with the coiled-coil aligned near the entrance of the substrate UDP-glucose into the active site. In this configuration, the P-CR coiled-coil alone is unlikely to regulate substrate access to the active site, but it could interact with other domains of CesA, accessory proteins, or other CesA catalytic domains to control substrate delivery.</p>

A Nitrogen-Fixing Subunit Essential for Accumulating 4Fe-4S-Containing Photosystem I Core Proteins
<p>Nitrogen-fixation-subunit-U (NFU)-type proteins have been shown to be involved in the biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters. We investigated the molecular function of a chloroplastic NFU-type iron-sulfur scaffold protein, NFU3, in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) using genetics approaches. Loss-of-function mutations in the <i>NFU3</i> gene caused yellow pigmentation in leaves, reductions in plant size, leaf size, and growth rate, delay in flowering and seeding, and decreases in seed production. Biochemical and physiological analyses indicated that these defects are due to the substantial reductions in the abundances of 4Fe-4S-containing photosystem I (PSI) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> subunits PsaA (where Psa stands for PSI), PsaB, and PsaC and a nearly complete loss of PSI activity. In addition to the substantial decreases in the amounts of PSI <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> proteins, the content of 3Fe-4S-containing ferredoxin-dependent glutamine oxoglutarate aminotransferases declined significantly in the <i>nfu3</i> mutants. Furthermore, the absorption spectrum of the recombinant NFU3 protein showed features characteristic of 4Fe-4S and 3Fe-4S clusters, and the in vitro reconstitution experiment indicated an iron-sulfur scaffold function of NFU3. These data demonstrate that NFU3 is involved in the assembly and transfer of 4Fe-4S and 3Fe-4S clusters and that NFU3 is required for the accumulation of 4Fe-4S- and 3Fe-4S-containing proteins, especially 4Fe-4S-containing PSI <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> subunits, in the Arabidopsis chloroplast.</p>

Axon degeneration and PGC-1α-mediated protection in a zebrafish model of α-synuclein toxicity
<p>α-synuclein (aSyn) expression is implicated in neurodegenerative processes, including Parkinson’s disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). In animal models of these diseases, axon pathology often precedes cell death, raising the question of whether aSyn has <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compart</span></strong>ment-specific toxic effects that could require early and/or independent therapeutic intervention. The relevance of axonal pathology to degeneration can only be addressed through longitudinal, <i>in vivo</i> monitoring of different neuronal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compart</span></strong>ments. With current imaging methods, dopaminergic neurons do not readily lend themselves to such a task in any vertebrate system. We therefore expressed human wild-type aSyn in zebrafish peripheral sensory neurons, which project elaborate superficial axons that can be continuously imaged <i>in vivo</i>. Axonal outgrowth was normal in these neurons but, by 2 days post-fertilization (dpf), many aSyn-expressing axons became dystrophic, with focal varicosities or diffuse beading. Approximately 20% of aSyn-expressing cells died by 3 dpf. Time-lapse imaging revealed that focal axonal swelling, but not overt fragmentation, usually preceded cell death. Co-expressing aSyn with a mitochondrial reporter revealed deficits in mitochondrial transport and morphology even when axons appeared overtly normal. The axon-protective protein Wallerian degeneration slow (WldS) delayed axon degeneration but not cell death caused by aSyn. By contrast, the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1α, which has roles in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and reactive-oxygen-species detoxification, abrogated aSyn toxicity in both the axon and the cell body. The rapid onset of axonal pathology in this system, and the relatively moderate degree of cell death, provide a new model for the study of aSyn toxicity and protection. Moreover, the accessibility of peripheral sensory axons will allow effects of aSyn to be studied in different neuronal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compart</span></strong>ments and might have utility in screening for novel disease-modifying compounds.</p>

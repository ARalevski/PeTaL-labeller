Effectiveness of open and arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (UKUFF)
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The appropriate management for patients with a degenerative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tear</span></strong>   of the rotator cuff remains controversial, but operative treatment,   particularly arthroscopic surgery, is increasingly being used. Our   aim in this paper was to compare the effectiveness of arthroscopic   with open repair of the rotator cuff.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 273 patients were recruited to a randomised comparison   trial (136 to arthroscopic surgery and 137 to open surgery) from   19 teaching and general hospitals in the United Kingdom. The surgeons   used their usual preferred method of repair. The Oxford Shoulder   Score (OSS), two years post-operatively, was the primary outcome   measure. Imaging of the shoulder was performed at one year after   surgery. The trial is registered with Current Controlled Trials,   ISRCTN97804283.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean OSS improved from 26.3 (standard deviation (<sc>sd</sc>)   8.2) at baseline, to 41.7 (<sc>sd</sc> 7.9) two years post-operatively   for arthroscopic surgery and from 25.0 (<sc>sd</sc> 8.0) to 41.5   (<sc>sd</sc> 7.9) for open surgery. Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis   showed no statistical difference between the groups at two years   (difference in OSS score -0.76; 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.75   to 1.22; p = 0.452). The confidence interval excluded the pre-determined   clinically important difference in the OSS of three points. The   rate of re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tear</span></strong> was not significantly different between the two groups   (46.4% for arthroscopic and 38.6% for open surgery; 95% CI -6.9   to 25.8; p = 0.256). Healed repairs had the most improved OSS. These   findings were the same when analysed per-protocol.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>There is no evidence of difference in effectiveness between open   and arthroscopic repair of rotator cuff <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tear</span></strong>s.

A prospective study of the incidence and outcomes of incidental dural tears in microendoscopic lumbar decompressive surgery
<p>Little information is available about the incidence   and outcome of incidental dural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tear</span></strong>s associated with microendoscopic   lumbar decompressive surgery. We prospectively examined the incidence   of dural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tear</span></strong>s and their influence on the outcome six months post-operatively   in 555 conse<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong>ive patients (mean age 47.4 years (13 to 89)) who   underwent this form of surgery. The incidence of dural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tear</span></strong>s was   5.05% (28/555). The risk factors were the age of the patient and   the procedure of bilateral decompression via a unilateral approach.   The rate of recovery of the Japanese Orthopaedic Association score   in patients with dural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tear</span></strong>s was significantly lower than that in   those without a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tear</span></strong> (77.7% <i>vs</i> 87.6%; p < 0.02),   although there were no significant differences in the improvement   of the Oswestry Disability Index between the two groups. Most dural   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tear</span></strong>s were small, managed by taking adequate care of symptoms of   low cerebrospinal fluid pressure, and did not require direct dural   repair. Routine MRI scans were undertaken six months post-operatively;   four patients with a dural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tear</span></strong> had recurrent or residual disc herniation   and two had further stenosis, possibly because the dural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tear</span></strong> prevented   adequate decompression and removal of the fragments of disc during   surgery; as yet, none of these patients have undergone further surgery. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014;96-B:641–5.</p>

Plate fixation <i>versus</i> intramedullary nailing of completely displaced midshaft fractures of the clavicle
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>This is a prospective randomised controlled trial comparing the   functional outcomes of plate fixation and elastic stable intramedullary   nailing (ESIN) of completely displaced mid-shaft fractures of the   clavicle in the active adult population.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We prospectively recruited 123 patients and randomised them to   either plate fixation or ESIN. Patients completed the Quick Disabilities   of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score at one to six weeks post-operatively.   They were followed up at six weeks, three and six months and one   year with radiographs, and their clinical outcome was assessed using   both the DASH and the Constant Score.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Plate fixation provided a faster functional recovery during the   first six months compared with ESIN, but there was no difference   after one year. The duration of surgery was shorter for ESIN (mean   53.4 minutes, 22 to 120) than for plate fixation (mean 69.7 minutes,   35 to 106, p < 0.001).

Contemporary Assessment of Left Ventricular Diastolic Function in Older Adults
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although age-associated changes in left ventricular diastolic function are well recognized, limited data exist characterizing measures of diastolic function in older adults, including both reference ranges reflecting the older adult population and prognostically relevant values for incident heart failure (HF), as well as their associations with circulating biomarkers of HF risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Among 5801 elderly participants in the ARIC study (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities; age range, 67–90 years; mean age, 76±5 years; 42% male; 21% black), we determined the continuous association of diastolic measures (tissue Doppler imaging [TDI] e’, E/e’, and left atrial size) with concomitant N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide and subsequent HF hospitalization or death. We also determined sex-specific 10th and 90th percentile limits for these measures using quantile regression in 401 participants free of prevalent cardiovascular disease and risk factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Each measure of diastolic function was robustly associated with N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide and incident HF or death. ARIC-based reference limits for TDI e’ (4.6 and 5.2 cm/s for septal and lateral TDI e’, respectively) were substantially lower than guideline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong> points (7 and 10 cm/s, respectively), whereas E/e’ and left atrial size demonstrated good agreement with guideline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong> points. TDI e’ was nonlinearly associated with incident HF or death, with inflection points for risk supportive of ARIC-based limits. ARIC-based limits for diastolic function improved risk discrimination over guideline-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong> points based on the integrated discrimination improvement (<i>P</i><0.001) and continuous net reclassification improvement (<i>P</i><0.001), reclassifying 42% of the study population as having normal diastolic function. We replicate these findings in the Copenhagen City Heart Study. With these limits, 46% had normal diastolic function and were at low risk of HF hospitalization or death (1%/y over a mean 1.7-year follow-up), 49% had 1 or 2 abnormal measures and were at intermediate risk (2.4%/y), and all 3 diastolic measures were abnormal in 5% who were at high risk (7.5%/y).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings suggest that left ventricular longitudinal relaxation velocity declines as a part of healthy aging and is largely prognostically benign. The use of age-based normative values when considering an elderly population improves the risk discrimination of diastolic measures for incident HF or death.</p></sec>

An empirical study of the wound effect on sap flux density measured with thermal dissipation probes
<p>The insertion of thermal dissipation (TD) sensors on tree stems for sap flux density (SFD) measurements can lead to SFD underestimations due to a wound formation close to the drill hole. However, the wound effect has not been assessed experimentally for this method yet. Here, we propose an empirical approach to investigate the effect of the wound healing on measured sap flux with TD probes. The approach was performed for both, diffuse-porous (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i> (Linnaeus)) and ring-porous (<i>Quercus petraea</i> (Lieblein)) species. Thermal dissipation probes were installed on different dates along the growing season to document the effects of the dynamic wound formation. The trees were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong> in autumn and additional sensors were installed in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong> stems, therefore, without potential effects of wound development. A range of water pressures was applied to the stem segments and SFDs were simultaneously measured by TD sensors as well as gravimetrically in the laboratory. The formation of wounds around sensors installed in living tree stems led to underestimation of SFD by 21.4 ± 3 and 47.5 ± 3.8% in beech and oak, respectively. The differences between SFD underestimations of diffuse-porous beech and ring-porous oak were, however, not statistically significant. Sensors with 5-, 11- and 22-week-old wounds also showed no significant differences, which implies that the influence of wound formation on SFD estimates was completed within the first few weeks after perforation. These results were confirmed by time courses of SFD measurements in the field. Field SFD values decreased immediately after sensor installation and reached stable values after ~2 weeks with similar underestimations to the ones observed in the laboratory. We therefore propose a feasible approach to correct directly field observations of SFD for potential underestimations due to the wound effect.</p>

Photoperiod and temperature responses of bud swelling and bud burst in four temperate forest tree species
<p>Spring phenology of temperate forest trees is optimized to maximize the length of the growing season while minimizing the risk of freezing damage. The release from winter dormancy is environmentally mediated by species-specific responses to temperature and photoperiod. We investigated the response of early spring phenology to temperature and photoperiod at different stages of dormancy release in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong>tings from four temperate tree species in controlled environments. By tracking bud development, we were able to identify the onset of bud swelling and bud growth in <i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i> L., <i>Fagus sylvatica</i> L., <i>Quercus petraea</i> (Mattuschka) Liebl. and <i>Picea abies</i> (L.) H. Karst. At a given early stage of dormancy release, the onset and duration of the bud swelling prior to bud burst are driven by concurrent temperature and photoperiod, while the maximum growth rate is temperature dependent only, except for <i>Fagus</i>, where long photoperiods also increased bud growth rates. Similarly, the later bud burst was controlled by temperature and photoperiod (in the photoperiod sensitive species <i>Fagus, Quercus</i> and <i>Picea</i>). We conclude that photoperiod is involved in the release of dormancy during the ecodormancy phase and may influence bud burst in trees that have experienced sufficient chilling. This study explored and documented the early bud swelling period that precedes and defines later phenological stages such as canopy greening in conventional phenological works. It is the early bud growth resumption that needs to be understood in order to arrive at a causal interpretation and modelling of tree phenology at a large scale. Classic spring phenology events mark visible endpoints of a cascade of processes as evidenced here.</p>

Cholesterol sulfate is a DOCK2 inhibitor that mediates tissue-specific immune evasion in the eye
<p>Although immune responses are essential to protect the body from infection, they can also harm tissues. Certain tissues and organs, including the eye, constitute specialized microenvironments that locally inhibit immune reactivity. Dedicator of cytokinesis protein 2 (DOCK2) is a Rac-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that is predominantly found in hematopoietic cells. DOCK2 plays a key role in immune surveillance because it is essential for the activation and migration of leukocytes. <i>DOCK2</i> mutations cause severe immunodeficiency in humans. We found that DOCK2-mediated Rac activation and leukocyte migration were effectively inhibited by cholesterol sulfate (CS), but not by cholesterol or other sulfated steroids. CS bound to the catalytic domain of DOCK2 and suppressed its GEF activity. Mass spectrometric quantification revealed that CS was most abundantly produced in the Harderian gland, which provides the lipids that form the oily layer of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tear</span></strong> film. Sulfation of cholesterol is mediated by the sulfotransferases SULT2B1b and, to a lesser extent, SULT2B1a, which are produced from the same gene through alternative splicing. By genetically inactivating <i>Sult2b1</i>, we showed that the lack of CS in mice augmented ultraviolet- and antigen-induced ocular surface inflammation, which was suppressed by administration of eye drops containing CS. Thus, CS is a naturally occurring DOCK2 inhibitor and contributes to the generation of the immunosuppressive microenvironment in the eye.</p>

Programmed DNA destruction by miniature CRISPR-Cas14 enzymes
<p>CRISPR-Cas systems provide microbes with adaptive immunity to infectious nucleic acids and are widely employed as genome editing tools. These tools use RNA-guided Cas proteins whose large size (950 to 1400 amino acids) has been considered essential to their specific DNA- or RNA-targeting activities. Here we present a set of CRISPR-Cas systems from uncultivated archaea that contain Cas14, a family of exceptionally compact RNA-guided nucleases (400 to 700 amino acids). Despite their small size, Cas14 proteins are capable of targeted single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) cleavage without restrictive sequence requirements. Moreover, target recognition by Cas14 triggers nonspecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong>ting of ssDNA molecules, an activity that enables high-fidelity single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping (Cas14-DETECTR). Metagenomic data show that multiple CRISPR-Cas14 systems evolved independently and suggest a potential evolutionary origin of single-effector CRISPR-based adaptive immunity.</p>

Structural basis of the nucleosome transition during RNA polymerase II passage
<p>Genomic DNA forms chromatin, in which the nucleosome is the repeating unit. The mechanism by which RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcribes the nucleosomal DNA remains unclear. Here we report the cryo–electron microscopy structures of RNAPII-nucleosome complexes in which RNAPII pauses at the superhelical locations SHL(−6), SHL(−5), SHL(−2), and SHL(−1) of the nucleosome. RNAPII pauses at the major histone-DNA contact sites, and the nucleosome interactions with the RNAPII subunits stabilize the pause. These structures reveal snapshots of nucleosomal transcription, in which RNAPII gradually <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tear</span></strong>s DNA from the histone surface while preserving the histone octamer. The nucleosomes in the SHL(−1) complexes are bound to a “foreign” DNA segment, which might explain the histone transfer mechanism. These results provide the foundations for understanding chromatin transcription and epigenetic regulation.</p>

High altitude may have driven short stature in Peruvians

Now, a group studying the genetics of Peruvians, one of the world's shorter populations, has turned up a gene variant that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong>s a person's height by more than 2 centimeters on average. The finding came out of tuberculosis study of 4000 residents of Lima wherein height was also measured. So far, the gene variant is not known outside Peru, where the demands of living at high altitude may have driven its evolution, but it could offer clues about how other mutations influence height.</p>

CRISPR-Cas12a target binding unleashes indiscriminate single-stranded DNase activity
<p>CRISPR-Cas12a (Cpf1) proteins are RNA-guided enzymes that bind and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong> DNA as components of bacterial adaptive immune systems. Like CRISPR-Cas9, Cas12a has been harnessed for genome editing on the basis of its ability to generate targeted, double-stranded DNA breaks. Here we show that RNA-guided DNA binding unleashes indiscriminate single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) cleavage activity by Cas12a that completely degrades ssDNA molecules. We find that target-activated, nonspecific single-stranded deoxyribonuclease (ssDNase) cleavage is also a property of other type V CRISPR-Cas12 enzymes. By combining Cas12a ssDNase activation with isothermal amplification, we create a method termed DNA endonuclease-targeted CRISPR trans reporter (DETECTR), which achieves attomolar sensitivity for DNA detection. DETECTR enables rapid and specific detection of human papillomavirus in patient samples, thereby providing a simple platform for molecular diagnostics.</p>

The formation of peak rings in large impact craters
<p>Large impacts provide a mechanism for resurfacing planets through mixing near-surface rocks with deeper material. Central peaks are formed from the dynamic uplift of rocks during crater formation. As crater size increases, central peaks transition to peak rings. Without samples, debate surrounds the mechanics of peak-ring formation and their depth of origin. Chicxulub is the only known impact structure on Earth with an unequivocal peak ring, but it is buried and only accessible through drilling. Expedition 364 sampled the Chicxulub peak ring, which we found was formed from uplifted, fractured, shocked, felsic basement rocks. The peak-ring rocks are cross-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong> by dikes and shear zones and have an unusually low density and seismic velocity. Large impacts therefore generate vertical fluxes and increase porosity in planetary crust.</p>

Coseismic rupturing stopped by Aso volcano during the 2016 <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> 7.1 Kumamoto earthquake, Japan
<p>Field investigations and seismic data show that the 16 April 2016 moment magnitude (<i>M</i><sub>w</sub>) 7.1 Kumamoto earthquake produced a ~40-kilometer-long surface rupture zone along the northeast-southwest–striking Hinagu-Futagawa strike-slip fault zone and newly identified faults on the western side of Aso caldera, Kyushu Island, Japan. The coseismic surface ruptures <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong> Aso caldera, including two volcanic cones inside it, but terminate therein. The data show that northeastward propagation of coseismic rupturing terminated in Aso caldera because of the presence of magma beneath the Aso volcanic cluster.

<p>The analysis and optimization of complex systems can be reduced to mathematical problems collectively known as combinatorial optimization. Many such problems can be mapped onto ground-state search problems of the Ising model, and various artificial spin systems are now emerging as promising approaches. However, physical Ising machines have suffered from limited numbers of spin-spin couplings because of implementations based on localized spins, resulting in severe scalability problems. We report a 2000-spin network with all-to-all spin-spin couplings. Using a measurement and feedback scheme, we coupled time-multiplexed degenerate optical parametric oscillators to implement maximum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong> problems on arbitrary graph topologies with up to 2000 nodes. Our coherent Ising machine outperformed simulated annealing in terms of accuracy and computation time for a 2000-node complete graph.</p>

Manipulation of Discrete Nanostructures by Selective Modulation of Noncovalent Forces
<sec><title>Nanotube Engineering</title><p>In general, the reversible self-assembly of nanotubes through noncovalent bonding either gives fully assembled or fully disassembled products. <bold>Fukino <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 499, published online 10 April; see the Perspective by <bold>Hudson and Manners</bold>) developed a system with an intermediate possibility. Hollow nanotube structures were assembled from ferrocene-based tetratopic pyridyl ligands mixed with AgBF<sub>4</sub>. Through oxidation of the ferrocene groups, the tubes could be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong> into stable, large rings and then reversibly reassembled into nanotubes by reduction of the ferrocene groups.</p></sec>

Regeneration of <i>Solanum tuberosum</i> Plants from Protoplasts Induces Widespread Genome Instability
<p>Nontransgenic genome editing in regenerable protoplasts, plant cells free of their cell wall, could revolutionize crop improvement because it reduces regulatory and technical complexity. However, plant tissue culture is known to engender frequent unwanted variation, termed somaclonal variation. To evaluate the contribution of large-scale genome instability to this phenomenon, we analyzed potatoes (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>) regenerated from either protoplasts or stem explants for copy number changes by comparison of Illumina read depth. Whereas a control set of eight plants that had been propagated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong>tings displayed no changes, all 15 protoplast regenerants tested were affected by aneuploidy or structural chromosomal changes. Certain chromosomes displayed segmental deletions and duplications ranging from one to many. Resampling different leaves of the same plant found differences in three regenerants, indicating frequent persistence of instability. By comparison, 33 regenerants from stem explants used for <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated transformation displayed less frequent but still considerable (18%) large-scale copy number changes. Repetition of certain instability patterns suggested greater susceptibility in specific genomic sites. These results indicate that tissue culture, depending on the protocol used, can induce genomic instability resulting in large-scale changes likely to compromise final plant phenotype.</p>

Biosynthesis of 2-Phenylethanol in Rose Petals Is Linked to the Expression of One Allele of <i>RhPAAS</i>
<p>Floral scent is one of the most important characters in horticultural plants. Roses (<i>Rosa</i> spp.) have been cultivated for their scent since antiquity. However, probably by selecting for cultivars with long vase life, breeders have lost the fragrant character in many modern roses, especially the ones bred for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong> flower market. The genetic inheritance of scent characters has remained elusive so far. In-depth knowledge of this quantitative trait is thus very much needed to breed more fragrant commercial cultivars. Furthermore, rose hybrids harbor a composite genomic structure, which complexifies quantitative trait studies. To understand rose scent inheritance, we characterized a segregating population from two diploid cultivars, <i>Rosa</i> × <i>hybrida</i> cv H190 and <i>Rosa wichurana</i>, which have contrasting scent profiles. Several quantitative trait loci for the major volatile compounds in this progeny were identified. One among these loci contributing to the production of 2-phenylethanol, responsible for the characteristic odor of rose, was found to be colocalized with a candidate gene belonging to the 2-phenylethanol biosynthesis pathway: the <i>PHENYLACETALDEHYDE SYNTHASE</i> gene <i>RhPAAS</i>. An in-depth allele-specific expression analysis in the progeny demonstrated that only one allele was highly expressed and was responsible for the production of 2-phenylethanol. Unexpectedly, its expression was found to start early during flower development, before the production of the volatile 2-phenylethanol, leading to the accumulation of glycosylated compounds in petals.</p>

Satisfaction, function and repair integrity after arthroscopic <i>versus</i> mini-open rotator cuff repair
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Advances in arthroscopic techniques for rotator cuff repair have   made the mini-open approach less popular. However, the mini-open   approach remains an important technique for repair for many surgeons.   The aims of this study were to compare the integrity of the repair,   the function of the shoulder and satisfaction post-operatively using   these two techniques in patients aged > 50 years.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We identified 22 patients treated with mini-open and 128 patients   treated with arthroscopic rotator cuff repair of July 2007 and June   2011. The mean follow-up was two years (1 to 5). Outcome was assessed   using the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) and Simple   Shoulder Test (SST) scores, and satisfaction. The integrity of the repair   was assessed using ultrasonography. A power analysis ensured sufficient   enrolment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was no statistically significant difference between the   age, function, satisfaction, or pain scores (p > 0.05) of the two   groups. The integrity of the repair and the mean SST scores were   significantly better in the mini-open group (91% of mini-open repairs   were intact <i>versus</i> 60% of arthroscopic repairs,   p = 0.023; mean SST score 10.9 (standard deviation (<sc>sd</sc>)   1.3) in the mini-open group; 8.9 (<sc>sd</sc> 3.5) in arthroscopic   group; p = 0.003). The ASES scores were also higher in the mini-open   group (mean ASES score 91.0 (<sc>sd</sc> 10.5) in mini-open group;   mean 82.70 (<sc>sd</sc> 19.8) in the arthroscopic group; p = 0.048).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The integrity of the repair and function of the shoulder were   better after a mini-open repair than after arthroscopic repair of   a rotator cuff <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tear</span></strong> in these patients.

Pre-operative functional mobility as an independent determinant of inpatient functional recovery after total knee arthroplasty during three periods that coincided with changes in clinical pathways
<sec><title>Aims </title><p>To investigate whether pre-operative functional mobility is a   determinant of delayed inpatient recovery of activities (IRoA) after   total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in three periods that coincided with   changes in the clinical pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>All patients (n = 682, 73% women, mean age 70 years, standard   deviation 9) scheduled for TKA between 2009 and 2015 were pre-operatively   screened for functional mobility by the Timed-up-and-Go test (TUG)   and De Morton mobility index (DEMMI). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong>-off point for delayed   IRoA was set on the day that 70% of the patients were recovered,   according to the Modified Iowa Levels of Assistance Scale (mILAS)   (a 5-item activity scale).

Complications following arthroscopic surgery of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The number of patients undergoing arthroscopic surgery of the   hip has increased significantly during the past decade. It has now   become an established technique for the treatment of many intra-   and extra-articular conditions affecting the hip. However, it has   a steep learning curve and is not without the risk of complications.   The purpose of this systematic review was to determine the prevalence   of complications during and following this procedure.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses   guidelines were used in designing this study. Two reviewers systematically   searched the literature for complications related to arthroscopy   of the hip. The research question and eligibility criteria were   established <i>a priori</i>. Pertinent data were abstracted   and analysed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We found 276 relevant studies with a total of 36 761 arthroscopies   that met the inclusion criteria. The mean age of the patients was   36.7 years (1.7 to 70) and the mean body mass index was 25.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (20.2   to 29.2). Femoroacetabular impingement and labral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tear</span></strong>s were the   most common indications for the procedure. The total number of complications   was 1222 (3.3%). Nerve injury (0.9%), mainly involving the pudendal   and lateral femoral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong>aneous nerves, and iatrogenic chondral and   labral injury (0.7%), were the two most common complications. There   were 58 major complications (0.2%), the most common being intra-abdominal   extravasation of fluid, which was found in 13 cases (0.04%). There   were three deaths (0.008%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Arthroscopic surgery of the hip is a procedure with a relatively   low rate of complications, although some may be significant in this   young cohort of patients.

Association Between Early Hyperoxia Exposure After Resuscitation From Cardiac Arrest and Neurological Disability
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Studies examining the association between hyperoxia exposure after resuscitation from cardiac arrest and clinical outcomes have reported conflicting results. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that early postresuscitation hyperoxia is associated with poor neurological outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This was a multicenter prospective cohort study. We included adult patients with cardiac arrest who were mechanically ventilated and received targeted temperature management after return of spontaneous circulation. We excluded patients with cardiac arrest caused by trauma or sepsis. Per protocol, partial pressure of arterial oxygen (Pa<sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub>) was measured at 1 and 6 hours after return of spontaneous circulation. Hyperoxia was defined as a Pa<sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub> >300 mm Hg during the initial 6 hours after return of spontaneous circulation. The primary outcome was poor neurological function at hospital discharge, defined as a modified Rankin Scale score >3. Multivariable generalized linear regression with a log link was used to test the association between Pa<sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub> and poor neurological outcome. To assess whether there was an association between other supranormal Pa<sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub> levels and poor neurological outcome, we used other Pa<sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong> points to define hyperoxia (ie, 100, 150, 200, 250, 350, 400 mm Hg).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of the 280 patients included, 105 (38%) had exposure to hyperoxia. Poor neurological function at hospital discharge occurred in 70% of patients in the entire cohort and in 77% versus 65% among patients with versus without exposure to hyperoxia respectively (absolute risk difference, 12%; 95% confidence interval, 1–23). Hyperoxia was independently associated with poor neurological function (relative risk, 1.23; 95% confidence interval, 1.11–1.35). On multivariable analysis, a 1-hour-longer duration of hyperoxia exposure was associated with a 3% increase in risk of poor neurological outcome (relative risk, 1.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.02–1.05). We found that the association with poor neurological outcome began at ≥300 mm Hg.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Early hyperoxia exposure after resuscitation from cardiac arrest was independently associated with poor neurological function at hospital discharge.</p></sec>

Fasting Versus Nonfasting and Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Accuracy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Recent recommendations favoring nonfasting lipid assessment may affect low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) estimation. The novel method of LDL-C estimation (LDL-C<sub>N</sub>) uses a flexible approach to derive patient-specific ratios of triglycerides to very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. This adaptability may confer an accuracy advantage in nonfasting patients over the fixed approach of the classic Friedewald method (LDL-C<sub>F</sub>).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used a US cross-sectional sample of 1 545  634 patients (959 153 fasting ≥10–12 hours; 586 481 nonfasting) from the second harvest of the Very Large Database of Lipids study to assess for the first time the impact of fasting status on novel LDL-C accuracy. Rapid ultracentrifugation was used to directly measure LDL-C content (LDL-C<sub>D</sub>). Accuracy was defined as the percentage of LDL-C<sub>D</sub> falling within an estimated LDL-C (LDL-C<sub>N</sub> or LDL-C<sub>F</sub>) category by clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong> points. For low estimated LDL-C (<70 mg/dL), we evaluated accuracy by triglyceride levels. The magnitude of absolute and percent differences between LDL-C<sub>D</sub> and estimated LDL-C (LDL-C<sub>N</sub> or LDL-C<sub>F</sub>) was stratified by LDL-C and triglyceride categories.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In both fasting and nonfasting samples, accuracy was higher with the novel method across all clinical LDL-C categories (range, 87%–94%) compared with the Friedewald estimation (range, 71%–93%; <i>P</i>≤0.001). With LDL-C <70 mg/dL, nonfasting LDL-C<sub>N</sub> accuracy (92%) was superior to LDL-C<sub>F</sub> accuracy (71%; <i>P</i><0.001). In this LDL-C range, 19% of fasting and 30% of nonfasting patients had differences ≥10 mg/dL between LDL-C<sub>F</sub> and LDL-C<sub>D</sub>, whereas only 2% and 3% of patients, respectively, had similar differences with novel estimation. Accuracy of LDL-C <70 mg/dL further decreased as triglycerides increased, particularly for Friedewald estimation (range, 37%–96%) versus the novel method (range, 82%–94%). With triglycerides of 200 to 399 mg/dL in nonfasting patients, LDL-C<sub>N</sub> <70 mg/dL accuracy (82%) was superior to LDL-C<sub>F</sub> (37%; <i>P</i><0.001). In this triglyceride range, 73% of fasting and 81% of nonfasting patients had ≥10 mg/dL differences between LDL-C<sub>F</sub> and LDL-C<sub>D</sub> compared with 25% and 20% of patients, respectively, with LDL-C<sub>N</sub>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Novel adaptable LDL-C estimation performs better in nonfasting samples than the fixed Friedewald estimation, with a particular accuracy advantage in settings of low LDL-C and high triglycerides. In addition to stimulating further study, these results may have immediate relevance for guideline committees, laboratory leadership, clinicians, and patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

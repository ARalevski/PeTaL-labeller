An unusual white dwarf star may be a surviving remnant of a subluminous Type Ia supernova
<p>Subluminous Type Ia <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">supernova</span></strong>e, such as the Type Iax–class prototype SN 2002cx, are described by a variety of models such as the failed detonation and partial deflagration of an accreting carbon-oxygen white dwarf star or the explosion of an accreting, hybrid carbon-oxygen-neon core. These models predict that bound remnants survive such events with, according to some simulations, a high kick velocity. We report the discovery of a high proper motion, low-mass white dwarf (LP 40-365) that travels at a velocity greater than the Galactic escape velocity and whose peculiar atmosphere is dominated by intermediate-mass elements. Strong evidence indicates that this partially burnt remnant was ejected following a subluminous Type Ia <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">supernova</span></strong> event. This supports the viability of single-degenerate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">supernova</span></strong> progenitors.</p>

iPTF16geu: A multiply imaged, gravitationally lensed type Ia supernova
<p>We report the discovery of a multiply imaged, gravitationally lensed type Ia <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">supernova</span></strong>, iPTF16geu (SN 2016geu), at redshift <i>z</i> = 0.409. This phenomenon was identified because the light from the stellar explosion was magnified more than 50 times by the curvature of space around matter in an intervening galaxy. We used high-spatial-resolution observations to resolve four images of the lensed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">supernova</span></strong>, approximately 0.3 arc seconds from the center of the foreground galaxy. The observations probe a physical scale of ~1 kiloparsec, smaller than is typical in other studies of extragalactic gravitational lensing. The large magnification and symmetric image configuration imply close alignment between the lines of sight to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">supernova</span></strong> and to the lens. The relative magnifications of the four images provide evidence for substructures in the lensing galaxy.</p>

An Integral View of Fast Shocks Around Supernova 1006
<sec><title>A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">supernova</span></strong> in 3D</title><p>When a star explodes, it expels matter at supersonic speeds. <bold>Nikolić <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 45, published online 14 February) used integral-field spectroscopy to obtain high-resolution, spatially resolved spectra of the shock waves associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">supernova</span></strong> 1006. The physical characteristics of the shocks around this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">supernova</span></strong> exhibit a strong spatial variation that suggests the presence of suprathermal (∼10 to 100 keV) protons, which are the potential seeds for generating cosmic rays.</p></sec>

Lifetime of the solar nebula constrained by meteorite paleomagnetism
<p>A key stage in planet formation is the evolution of a gaseous and magnetized solar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nebula</span></strong>. However, the lifetime of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nebula</span></strong>r magnetic field and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nebula</span></strong> are poorly constrained. We present paleomagnetic analyses of volcanic angrites demonstrating that they formed in a near-zero magnetic field (<0.6 microtesla) at 4563.5 ± 0.1 million years ago, ~3.8 million years after solar system formation. This indicates that the solar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nebula</span></strong> field, and likely the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nebula</span></strong>r gas, had dispersed by this time. This sets the time scale for formation of the gas giants and planet migration. Furthermore, it supports formation of chondrules after 4563.5 million years ago by non-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nebula</span></strong>r processes like planetesimal collisions. The core dynamo on the angrite parent body did not initiate until about 4 to 11 million years after solar system formation.</p>

Evidence for Two Distinct Populations of Type Ia Supernovae
<sec><title>Fast and Young</title><p>Type Ia <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">supernova</span></strong>e are thought to result from the thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf star accreting material from a companion star in a binary system. Their adoption as cosmic yardsticks has led to the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the universe. <bold>Wang <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 170, published online 7 March) show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">supernova</span></strong>e with higher expansion velocities are located in the central, brighter regions of their host galaxies and are found in larger, more luminous galaxies, suggesting that they are associated with younger stellar populations.</p></sec>

Fast molecular outflow from a dusty star-forming galaxy in the early Universe
<p>Galaxies grow inefficiently, with only a small percentage of the available gas converted into stars each free-fall time. Feedback processes, such as outflowing winds driven by radiation pressure, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">supernova</span></strong>e, or supermassive black hole accretion, can act to halt star formation if they heat or expel the gas supply. We report a molecular outflow launched from a dust-rich star-forming galaxy at redshift 5.3, 1 billion years after the Big Bang. The outflow reaches velocities up to 800 kilometers per second relative to the galaxy, is resolved into multiple clumps, and carries mass at a rate within a factor of 2 of the star formation rate. Our results show that molecular outflows can remove a large fraction of the gas available for star formation from galaxies at high redshift.</p>

Multimessenger observations of a flaring blazar coincident with high-energy neutrino IceCube-170922A
<p>Previous detections of individual astrophysical sources of neutrinos are limited to the Sun and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">supernova</span></strong> 1987A, whereas the origins of the diffuse flux of high-energy cosmic neutrinos remain unidentified. On 22 September 2017, we detected a high-energy neutrino, IceCube-170922A, with an energy of ~290 tera–electron volts. Its arrival direction was consistent with the location of a known γ-ray blazar, TXS 0506+056, observed to be in a flaring state. An extensive multiwavelength campaign followed, ranging from radio frequencies to γ-rays. These observations characterize the variability and energetics of the blazar and include the detection of TXS 0506+056 in very-high-energy γ-rays. This observation of a neutrino in spatial coincidence with a γ-ray–emitting blazar during an active phase suggests that blazars may be a source of high-energy neutrinos.</p>

Early spectra of the gravitational wave source GW170817: Evolution of a neutron star merger
<p>On 17 August 2017, Swope Supernova Survey 2017a (SSS17a) was discovered as the optical counterpart of the binary neutron star gravitational wave event GW170817. We report time-series spectroscopy of SSS17a from 11.75 hours until 8.5 days after the merger. Over the first hour of observations, the ejecta rapidly expanded and cooled. Applying blackbody fits to the spectra, we measured the photosphere cooling from [Formula] to [Formula] kelvin, and determined a photospheric velocity of roughly 30% of the speed of light. The spectra of SSS17a began displaying broad features after 1.46 days and evolved qualitatively over each subsequent day, with distinct blue (early-time) and red (late-time) components. The late-time component is consistent with theoretical models of r-process–enriched neutron star ejecta, whereas the blue component requires high-velocity, lanthanide-free material.</p>

Light curves of the neutron star merger GW170817/SSS17a: Implications for r-process nucleosynthesis
<p>On 17 August 2017, gravitational waves (GWs) were detected from a binary neutron star merger, GW170817, along with a coincident short gamma-ray burst, GRB 170817A. An optical transient source, Swope Supernova Survey 17a (SSS17a), was subsequently identified as the counterpart of this event. We present ultraviolet, optical, and infrared light curves of SSS17a extending from 10.9 hours to 18 days postmerger. We constrain the radioactively powered transient resulting from the ejection of neutron-rich material. The fast rise of the light curves, subsequent decay, and rapid color evolution are consistent with multiple ejecta components of differing lanthanide abundance. The late-time light curve indicates that SSS17a produced at least ~0.05 solar masses of heavy elements, demonstrating that neutron star mergers play a role in rapid neutron capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis in the universe.</p>

Swope Supernova Survey 2017a (SSS17a), the optical counterpart to a gravitational wave source
<p>On 17 August 2017, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and the Virgo interferometer detected gravitational waves (GWs) emanating from a binary neutron star merger, GW170817. Nearly simultaneously, the Fermi and INTEGRAL (INTErnational Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory) telescopes detected a gamma-ray transient, GRB 170817A. At 10.9 hours after the GW trigger, we discovered a transient and fading optical source, Swope Supernova Survey 2017a (SSS17a), coincident with GW170817. SSS17a is located in NGC 4993, an S0 galaxy at a distance of 40 megaparsecs. The precise location of GW170817 provides an opportunity to probe the nature of these cataclysmic events by combining electromagnetic and GW observations.</p>

Flight mechanics and control of escape manoeuvres in hummingbirds. I. Flight kinematics
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> A detailed examination of the body and wing kinematics of four hummingbird species in fast escape manoeuvres shows that they change wing trajectory significantly, and escape manoeuvres do not obey the ‘<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">helicopt</span></strong>er model’.</p>

Comparison Between Patent Ductus Arteriosus Stent and Modified Blalock-Taussig Shunt as Palliation for Infants With Ductal-Dependent Pulmonary Blood Flow
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Infants with ductal-dependent pulmonary blood flow may undergo palliation with either a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) stent or a modified Blalock-Taussig (BT) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shunt</span></strong>. A balanced multicenter comparison of these 2 approaches is lacking.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Infants with ductal-dependent pulmonary blood flow palliated with either a PDA stent or a BT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shunt</span></strong> from January 2008 to November 2015 were reviewed from the 4 member centers of the Congenital Catheterization Research Collaborative. Outcomes were compared by use of propensity score adjustment to account for baseline differences between groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>One hundred six patients with a PDA stent and 251 patients with a BT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shunt</span></strong> were included. The groups differed in underlying anatomy (expected 2-ventricle circulation in 60% of PDA stents versus 45% of BT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shunt</span></strong>s; <i>P</i>=0.001) and presence of antegrade pulmonary blood flow (61% of PDA stents versus 38% of BT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shunt</span></strong>s; <i>P</i><0.001). After propensity score adjustment, there was no difference in the hazard of the primary composite outcome of death or unplanned reintervention to treat cyanosis (hazard ratio, 0.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52–1.23; <i>P</i>=0.31). Other reinterventions were more common in the PDA stent group (hazard ratio, 29.8; 95% CI, 9.8–91.1; <i>P</i><0.001). However, the PDA stent group had a lower adjusted intensive care unit length of stay (5.3 days [95% CI, 4.2–6.7] versus 9.19 days [95% CI, 7.9–10.6]; <i>P</i><0.001), a lower risk of diuretic use at discharge (odds ratio, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.25–0.64; <i>P</i><0.001) and procedural complications (odds ratio, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2–0.77; <i>P</i>=0.006), and larger (152 mm<sup>2</sup>/m<sup>2</sup> [95% CI, 132–176] versus 125 mm<sup>2</sup>/m<sup>2</sup> [95% CI, 113–138]; <i>P</i>=0.029) and more symmetrical (symmetry index, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.8–0.89] versus 0.77 [95% CI, 0.75–0.8]; <i>P</i>=0.008] pulmonary arteries at the time of subsequent surgical repair or last follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In this multicenter comparison of palliative PDA stent and BT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shunt</span></strong> for infants with ductal-dependent pulmonary blood flow adjusted for differences in patient factors, there was no difference in the primary end point, death or unplanned reintervention to treat cyanosis. However, other markers of morbidity and pulmonary artery size favored the PDA stent group, supporting PDA stent as a reasonable alternative to BT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shunt</span></strong> in select patients.</p></sec>

At 6 years, we compared transplant-free survival and other outcomes between the groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Medical history was collected annually using medical record review, telephone interviews, and the death index. The cohort included 549 patients randomized and treated in the SVR trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Transplant-free survival for the RVPAS versus modified Blalock–Taussig <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shunt</span></strong> groups did not differ at 6 years (64% versus 59%, <i>P</i>=0.25) or with all available follow-up of 7.1±1.6 years (log-rank <i>P</i>=0.13). The RVPAS versus modified Blalock–Taussig <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shunt</span></strong> treatment effect had nonproportional hazards (<i>P</i>=0.009); the hazard ratio (HR) for death or transplant favored the RVPAS before stage II surgery (HR, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.48–0.92). The effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shunt</span></strong> type on death or transplant was not statistically significant between stage II to Fontan surgery (HR, 1.36; 95% confidence interval, 0.86–2.17; <i>P</i>=0.17) or after the Fontan procedure (HR, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.33–1.74; <i>P</i>=0.52). By 6 years, patients with RVPAS had a higher incidence of catheter interventions (0.38 versus 0.23/patient-year, <i>P</i><0.001), primarily because of more interventions between the stage II and Fontan procedures (HR, 1.72; 95% confidence interval, 1.00–3.03).

Duct Stenting Versus Modified Blalock-Taussig Shunt in Neonates With Duct-Dependent Pulmonary Blood Flow
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Infants born with cardiac abnormalities causing dependence on the arterial duct for pulmonary blood flow are often palliated with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shunt</span></strong> usually between the subclavian artery and either pulmonary artery. A so-called modified Blalock-Taussig <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shunt</span></strong> allows progress through early life to an age and weight at which repair or further more stable palliation can be safely achieved. Modified Blalock-Taussig <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shunt</span></strong>s continue to present concern for postprocedural instability and early mortality such that other alternatives continue to be explored. Duct stenting (DS) is emerging as one such alternative with potential for greater early stability and improved survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The purpose of this study was to compare postprocedural outcomes and survival to next-stage palliative or reparative surgery between patients undergoing a modified Blalock-Taussig <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shunt</span></strong> or a DS in infants with duct-dependent pulmonary blood flow. All patients undergoing cardiac surgery and congenital interventions in the United Kingdom are prospectively recruited to an externally validated national outcome audit. From this audit, participating UK centers identified infants <30 days of age undergoing either a Blalock-Taussig <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shunt</span></strong> or a DS for cardiac conditions with duct-dependent pulmonary blood flow between January 2012 and December 31, 2015. One hundred seventy-one patients underwent a modified Blalock-Taussig <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shunt</span></strong>, and in 83 patients, DS was attempted. Primary and secondary outcomes of survival and need for extracorporeal support were analyzed with multivariable logistic regression. Longer-term mortality before repair and reintervention were analyzed with Cox proportional hazards regression. All multivariable analyses accommodated a propensity score to balance patient characteristics between the groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>There was an early (to discharge) survival advantage for infants before next-stage surgery in the DS group (odds ratio, 4.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.37–13.14; <i>P</i>=0.012). There was also a difference in the need for postprocedural extracorporeal support in favor of the DS group (odds ratio, 0.22; 95% confidence interval, 0.05–1.05; <i>P</i>=0.058). Longer-term survival outcomes showed a reduced risk of death before repair in the DS group (hazard ratio, 0.25; 95% confidence interval, 0.07–0.85; <i>P</i>=0.026) but a slightly increased risk of reintervention (hazard ratio, 1.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.85–2.64; <i>P</i>=0.165).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>DS is emerging as a preferred alternative to a surgical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shunt</span></strong> for neonatal palliation with evidence for greater postprocedural stability and improved patient survival to destination surgical treatment.</p></sec>

Hawkmoths use nectar sugar to reduce oxidative damage from flight
<p>Nectar-feeding animals have among the highest recorded metabolic rates. High aerobic performance is linked to oxidative damage in muscles. Antioxidants in nectar are scarce to nonexistent. We propose that nectarivores use nectar sugar to mitigate the oxidative damage caused by the muscular demands of flight. We found that sugar-fed moths had lower oxidative damage to their flight muscle membranes than unfed moths. Using respirometry coupled with δ<sup>13</sup>C analyses, we showed that moths generate antioxidant potential by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shunt</span></strong>ing nectar glucose to the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), resulting in a reduction in oxidative damage to the flight muscles. We suggest that nectar feeding, the use of PPP, and intense exercise are causally linked and have allowed the evolution of powerful fliers that feed on nectar.</p>

Claudin-6, -10d and -10e contribute to seawater acclimation in the euryhaline puffer fish <i>Tetraodon nigroviridis</i>
<p>Expression profiles of <i>claudin-6, -10d</i> and -<i>10e</i> in the euryhaline teleost fish <i>Tetraodon nigroviridis</i> revealed <i>claudin-6</i> in brain, eye, gill and skin tissue, while <i>claudin-10d</i> and -<i>10e</i> were found in brain, gill and skin only. In fishes, the gill and skin are important tissue barriers that interface directly with surrounding water, but these organs generally function differently in osmoregulation. Therefore, roles for gill and skin claudin-6, -10d and -10e in the osmoregulatory strategies of <i>T. nigroviridis</i> were investigated. In the gill epithelium, claudin-6, -10d and -10e co-localized with Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase immunoreactive (NKA-ir) ionocytes, and differences in sub-cellular localization could be observed in hypoosmotic (freshwater, FW) versus hyperosmotic (seawater, SW) environments. Claudin-10d and -10e abundance increased in the gills of fish acclimated to SW versus FW, while claudin-6 abundance decreased in the gills of fish acclimated to SW. Taken together with our knowledge of claudin-6 and -10 function in other vertebrates, data support the idea that in SW-acclimated <i>T. nigroviridis</i>, these claudins are abundant in gill ionocytes, where they contribute to the formation of a Na<sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shunt</span></strong> and ‘leaky’ epithelium, both of which are characteristic of salt-secreting SW fish gills. Skin claudin-10d and -10e abundance also increased in fish acclimated to SW versus those in FW, but so did claudin-6. In skin, claudin-6 was found to co-localize with NKA-ir cells, but claudin-10d and -10e did not. This study provides direct evidence that the gill epithelium contains salinity-responsive tight junction proteins that are abundant primarily in ionocytes. These same proteins also appear to play a role in the osmoregulatory physiology of the epidermis.</p>

Gastrointestinal and renal responses to variable water intake in whitebellied sunbirds and New Holland honeyeaters
<p>Nectarivores face a constant challenge in terms of water balance, experiencing water loading or dehydration when switching between food plants or between feeding and fasting. To understand how whitebellied sunbirds and New Holland honeyeaters meet the challenges of varying preformed water load, we used the elimination of intramuscular-injected [<sup>14</sup>C]-<sc>l</sc>-glucose and <sup>3</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O to quantify intestinal and renal water handling on diets varying in sugar concentration. Both sunbirds and honeyeaters showed significant modulation of intestinal water absorption, allowing excess water to be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shunt</span></strong>ed through the intestine when on dilute diets. Despite reducing their fractional water absorption, both species showed linear increases in water flux and fractional body water turnover as water intake increased (both afternoon and morning), suggesting that the modulation of fractional water absorption was not sufficient to completely offset dietary water loads. In both species, glomerular filtration rate was independent of water gain (but was higher for the afternoon), as was renal fractional water reabsorption (measured in the afternoon). During the natural overnight fast, both sunbirds and honeyeaters arrested whole kidney function. Evaporative water loss in sunbirds was variable but correlated with water gain. Both sunbirds and honeyeaters appear to modulate intestinal water absorption as an important component of water regulation to help deal with massive preformed water loads. Shutting down glomerular filtration rate during the overnight fast is another way of saving energy for osmoregulatory function. Birds maintain osmotic balance on diets varying markedly in preformed water load by varying both intestinal water absorption and excretion through the intestine and kidneys.</p>

Atrial Fibrillation Burden in Young Patients With Congenital Heart Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) are assumed to be vulnerable to atrial fibrillation (AF) as a result of residual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shunt</span></strong>s, anomalous vessel anatomy, progressive valvulopathy, hypertension, and atrial scars from previous heart surgery. However, the risk of developing AF and the complications associated with AF in children and young adults with CHD have not been compared with those in control subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data from the Swedish Patient and Cause of Death registers were used to identify all patients with a diagnosis of CHD who were born from 1970 to 1993. Each patient with CHD was matched by birth year, sex, and county with 10 control subjects from the Total Population Register in Sweden. Follow-up data were collected until 2011.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 21 982 patients (51.6% men) with CHD and 219 816 matched control subjects, 654 and 328 developed AF, respectively.

According to a hierarchical CHD classification, patients with conotruncal defects had the highest risk (hazard ratio, 84.27; 95% confidence interval, 56.86–124.89). At the age of 42 years, 8.3% of all patients with CHD had a recorded diagnosis of AF.

We conducted the first randomized sham-controlled trial to evaluate the IASD in HF with EF ≥40%.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>REDUCE LAP-HF I (Reduce Elevated Left Atrial Pressure in Patients With Heart Failure) was a phase 2, randomized, parallel-group, blinded multicenter trial in patients with New York Heart Association class III or ambulatory class IV HF, EF ≥40%, exercise PCWP ≥25 mm Hg, and PCWP-right atrial pressure gradient ≥5 mm Hg. Participants were randomized (1:1) to the IASD versus a sham procedure (femoral venous access with intracardiac echocardiography but no IASD placement). The participants and investigators assessing the participants during follow-up were blinded to treatment assignment. The primary effectiveness end point was exercise PCWP at 1 month. The primary safety end point was major adverse cardiac, cerebrovascular, and renal events at 1 month. PCWP during exercise was compared between treatment groups using a mixed-effects repeated measures model analysis of covariance that included data from all available stages of exercise.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 94 patients were enrolled, of whom 44 met inclusion/exclusion criteria and were randomized to the IASD (n=22) and control (n=22) groups. Mean age was 70±9 years, and 50% were female. At 1 month, the IASD resulted in a greater reduction in PCWP compared with sham control (<i>P</i>=0.028 accounting for all stages of exercise). Peak PCWP decreased by 3.5±6.4 mm Hg in the treatment group versus 0.5±5.0 mm Hg in the control group (<i>P</i>=0.14).

Platelets Express Activated P2Y<sub>12</sub> Receptor in Patients With Diabetes Mellitus
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Platelets from patients with diabetes mellitus are hyperactive.

However, the underlying mechanism of hyperactivated platelets is not completely understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We measured P2Y<sub>12</sub> expression on platelets from patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and on platelets from rats with diabetes mellitus. We also assayed platelet P2Y<sub>12</sub> activation by measuring cAMP and VASP phosphorylation. The antiplatelet and antithrombotic effects of AR-C78511 and cangrelor were compared in rats. Finally, we explored the role of the nuclear factor-κB pathway in regulating P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor expression in megakaryocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Platelet P2Y<sub>12</sub> levels are 4-fold higher in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus compared with healthy subjects. P2Y<sub>12</sub> expression correlates with ADP-induced platelet aggregation (r=0.89, <i>P</i><0.01). P2Y<sub>12</sub> in platelets from patients with diabetes mellitus is constitutively activated. Although both AR-C78511, a potent P2Y<sub>12</sub> inverse agonist, and cangrelor have similar antiplatelet efficacy on platelets from healthy subjects, AR-C78511 exhibits more powerful antiplatelet effects on diabetic platelets than cangrelor (aggregation ratio 36±3% versus 49±5%, respectively, <i>P</i><0.05). Using a FeCl<sub>3</sub>-injury mesenteric arteriole thrombosis model in rats and an arteriovenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shunt</span></strong> thrombosis model in rats, we found that the inverse agonist AR-C78511 has greater antithrombotic effects on GK rats with diabetes mellitus than cangrelor (thrombus weight 4.9±0.3 mg versus 8.3±0.4 mg, respectively, <i>P</i><0.01).

The Optimal Timing of Stage 2 Palliation for Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In infants requiring 3-stage single-ventricle palliation for hypoplastic left heart syndrome, attrition after the Norwood procedure remains significant. The effect of the timing of stage 2 palliation (S2P), a physician-modifiable factor, on long-term survival is not well understood. We hypothesized that an optimal interval between the Norwood and S2P that both minimizes pre-S2P attrition and maximizes post-S2P survival exists and is associated with individual patient characteristics.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The National Institutes of Health/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Pediatric Heart Network Single Ventricle Reconstruction Trial public data set was used. Transplant-free survival (TFS) was modeled from (1) Norwood to S2P and (2) S2P to 3 years by using parametric hazard analysis. Factors associated with death or heart transplantation were determined for each interval. To account for staged procedures, risk-adjusted, 3-year, post-Norwood TFS (the probability of TFS at 3 years given survival to S2P) was calculated using parametric conditional survival analysis. TFS from the Norwood to S2P was first predicted. TFS after S2P to 3 years was then predicted and adjusted for attrition before S2P by multiplying by the estimate of TFS to S2P. The optimal timing of S2P was determined by generating nomograms of risk-adjusted, 3-year, post-Norwood, TFS versus the interval from the Norwood to S2P.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 547 included patients, 399 survived to S2P (73%). Of the survivors to S2P, 349 (87%) survived to 3-year follow-up. The median interval from the Norwood to S2P was 5.1 (interquartile range, 4.1–6.0) months. The risk-adjusted, 3-year, TFS was 68±7%. A Norwood-S2P interval of 3 to 6 months was associated with greatest 3-year TFS overall and in patients with few risk factors. In patients with multiple risk factors, TFS was severely compromised, regardless of the timing of S2P and most severely when S2P was performed early. No difference in the optimal timing of S2P existed when stratified by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shunt</span></strong> type.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In infants with few risk factors, progressing to S2P at 3 to 6 months after the Norwood procedure was associated with maximal TFS. Early S2P did not rescue patients with greater risk factor burdens. Instead, referral for heart transplantation may offer their best chance at long-term survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Protein crystallization promotes type 2 immunity and is reversible by antibody treatment
<p>Although spontaneous protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization is a rare event in vivo, Charcot-Leyden <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s (CLCs) consisting of galectin-10 (Gal10) protein are frequently observed in eosinophilic diseases, such as asthma. We found that CLCs derived from patients showed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> packing and Gal10 structure identical to those of Gal10 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s grown in vitro. When administered to the airways, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>line Gal10 stimulated innate and adaptive immunity and acted as a type 2 adjuvant. By contrast, a soluble Gal10 mutein was inert. Antibodies directed against key epitopes of the CLC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization interface dissolved preexisting CLCs in patient-derived mucus within hours and reversed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>-driven inflammation, goblet-cell metaplasia, immunoglobulin E (IgE) synthesis, and bronchial hyperreactivity (BHR) in a humanized mouse model of asthma. Thus, protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s may promote hallmark features of asthma and are targetable by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>-dissolving antibodies.</p>

Colossal grain growth yields single-crystal metal foils by contact-free annealing
<p>Single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> metals have distinctive properties owing to the absence of grain boundaries and strong anisotropy. Commercial single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> metals are usually synthesized by bulk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> growth or by deposition of thin films onto substrates, and they are expensive and small. We prepared extremely large single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> metal foils by “contact-free annealing” from commercial poly<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>line foils. The colossal grain growth (up to 32 square centimeters) is achieved by minimizing contact stresses, resulting in a preferred in-plane and out-of-plane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> orientation, and is driven by surface energy minimization during the rotation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> lattice followed by “consumption” of neighboring grains. Industrial-scale production of single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> metal foils is possible as a result of this discovery.</p>

Single-crystal x-ray diffraction structures of covalent organic frameworks
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization problem is an outstanding challenge in the chemistry of porous covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Their structural characterization has been limited to modeling and solutions based on powder x-ray or electron diffraction data. Single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s of COFs amenable to x-ray diffraction characterization have not been reported. Here, we developed a general procedure to grow large single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s of three-dimensional imine-based COFs (COF-300, hydrated form of COF-300, COF-303, LZU-79, and LZU-111). The high quality of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s allowed collection of single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> x-ray diffraction data of up to 0.83-angstrom resolution, leading to unambiguous solution and precise anisotropic refinement. Characteristics such as degree of interpenetration, arrangement of water guests, the reversed imine connectivity, linker disorder, and uncommon topology were deciphered with atomic precision—aspects impossible to determine without single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s.</p>

Electronic crystal growth
<p>Interacting atoms or molecules condense into liquid, and, when cooled further, they form a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>. The time evolution of the atomic or molecular ordering has been widely studied as a nonequilibrium emergence of order from a supercooled liquid or a glass. Interacting electrons in a variety of correlated electron systems also form <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s, but observing the time evolution of electronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization has been experimentally challenging. Here, working with an organic conductor exhibiting a supercooled charge liquid or charge glass as a metastable state, we observed electronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> growth through resistivity and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements. The temperature profile of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> growth is similar to those observed in classical systems and reveals two distinct regimes for the mechanism of electronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization.</p>

Light amplification by seeded Kerr instability
<p>Amplification of femtosecond laser pulses typically requires a lasing medium or a nonlinear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>. In either case, the chemical properties of the lasing medium or the momentum conservation in the nonlinear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> constrain the frequency and the bandwidth of the amplified pulses. We demonstrate high gain amplification (greater than 1000) of widely tunable (0.5 to 2.2 micrometers) and short (less than 60 femtosecond) laser pulses, up to intensities of 1 terawatt per square centimeter, by seeding the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ation instability in an Y<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> pumped by femtosecond near-infrared pulses. Our method avoids constraints related to doping and phase matching and therefore can occur in a wider pool of glasses and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s even at far-infrared frequencies and for single-cycle pulses. Such amplified pulses are ideal to study strong-field processes in solids and highly excited states in gases.</p>

Reducing the stochasticity of crystal nucleation to enable subnanosecond memory writing
<p>Operation speed is a key challenge in phase-change random-access memory (PCRAM) technology, especially for achieving subnanosecond high-speed cache memory. Commercialized PCRAM products are limited by the tens of nanoseconds writing speed, originating from the stochastic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> nucleation during the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization of amorphous germanium antimony telluride<i> </i>(Ge<sub>2</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>5</sub>). Here, we demonstrate an alloying strategy to speed up the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization kinetics. The scandium antimony telluride (Sc<sub>0.2</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub>) compound that we designed allows a writing speed of only 700 picoseconds without preprogramming in a large conventional PCRAM device. This ultrafast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization stems from the reduced stochasticity of nucleation through geometrically matched and robust scandium telluride (ScTe) chemical bonds that stabilize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> precursors in the amorphous state. Controlling nucleation through alloy design paves the way for the development of cache-type PCRAM technology to boost the working efficiency of computing systems.</p>

Structure of the C-terminal guanine nucleotide exchange factor module of Trio in an autoinhibited conformation reveals its oncogenic potential
<p>The C-terminal guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>e of Trio (TrioC) transfers signals from the Gα<sub>q/11</sub> subfamily of heterotrimeric G proteins to the small guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) RhoA, enabling Gα<sub>q/11</sub>-coupled G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) to control downstream events, such as cell motility and gene transcription. This conserved signal transduction axis is crucial for tumor growth in uveal melanoma. Previous studies indicate that the GEF activity of the TrioC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>e is autoinhibited, with release of autoinhibition upon Gα<sub>q/11</sub> binding. Here, we determined the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> structure of TrioC in its basal state and found that the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain interacts with the Dbl homology (DH) domain in a manner that occludes the Rho GTPase binding site, thereby suggesting the molecular basis of TrioC autoinhibition. Biochemical and biophysical assays revealed that disruption of the autoinhibited conformation destabilized and activated the TrioC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>e in vitro. Last, mutations in the DH-PH interface found in patients with cancer activated TrioC and, in the context of full-length Trio, led to increased abundance of guanosine triphosphate–bound RhoA (RhoA·GTP) in human cells. These mutations increase mitogenic signaling through the RhoA axis and, therefore, may represent cancer drivers operating in a Gα<sub>q/11</sub>-independent manner.</p>

Crystal-clear treatment for allergic disease
<p>Charcot-Leyden <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s (CLCs) are protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s produced by human eosinophils, immune cells typically associated with allergy and parasitic worm (helminth) infection.

Although described over 160 years ago, the biological relevance of CLCs to type 2 immunity has remained unknown. On page 751 of this issue, Persson <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) confirm anecdotal evidence that CLCs are a key feature of severe asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. They demonstrate that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s, but not the soluble proteins, are powerful promoters of allergic inflammation and can be targeted with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>-dissolving antibodies to reverse disease symptoms.</p>

Giant piezoelectricity of Sm-doped Pb(Mg<sub>1/3</sub>Nb<sub>2/3</sub>)O<sub>3</sub>-PbTiO<sub>3</sub> single crystals
<p>High-performance piezoelectrics benefit transducers and sensors in a variety of electromechanical applications. The materials with the highest piezoelectric charge coefficients (<i>d</i><sub>33</sub>) are relaxor-PbTiO<sub>3</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s, which were discovered two decades ago. We successfully grew Sm-doped Pb(Mg<sub>1/3</sub>Nb<sub>2/3</sub>)O<sub>3</sub>-PbTiO<sub>3</sub> (Sm-PMN-PT) single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s with even higher <i>d</i><sub>33</sub> values ranging from 3400 to 4100 picocoulombs per newton, with variation below 20% over the as-grown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> boule, exhibiting good property uniformity. We characterized the Sm-PMN-PT on the atomic scale with scanning transmission electron microscopy and made first-principles calculations to determine that the giant piezoelectric properties arise from the enhanced local structural heterogeneity introduced by Sm<sup>3+</sup> dopants. Rare-earth doping is thus identified as a general strategy for introducing local structural heterogeneity in order to enhance the piezoelectricity of relaxor ferroelectric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s.</p>

Extraordinary plasticity of an inorganic semiconductor in darkness
<p>Inorganic semiconductors generally tend to fail in a brittle manner. Here, we report that extraordinary “plasticity” can take place in an inorganic semiconductor if the deformation is carried out “in complete darkness.” Room-temperature deformation tests of zinc sulfide (ZnS) were performed under varying light conditions. ZnS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s immediately fractured when they deformed under light irradiation. In contrast, it was found that ZnS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s can be plastically deformed up to a deformation strain of ε<sub>t</sub> = 45% in complete darkness. In addition, the optical bandgap of the deformed ZnS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s was distinctly decreased after deformation. These results suggest that dislocations in ZnS become mobile in complete darkness and that multiplied dislocations can affect the optical bandgap over the whole <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>. Inorganic semiconductors are not necessarily intrinsically brittle.</p>

Chiromagnetic nanoparticles and gels

Robust epitaxial growth of two-dimensional heterostructures, multiheterostructures, and superlattices

A reverse flow during the temperature-swing stage in the sequential vapor deposition growth process allowed us to cool the existing 2D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s to prevent undesired thermal degradation and uncontrolled homogeneous nucleation, thus enabling highly robust block-by-block epitaxial growth.

Mechanistic basis for a molecular triage reaction
<p>Newly synthesized proteins are triaged between biosynthesis and degradation to maintain cellular homeostasis, but the decision-making mechanisms are unclear. We reconstituted the core reactions for membrane targeting and ubiquitination of nascent tail-anchored membrane proteins to understand how their fate is determined. The central six-component triage system is divided into an uncommitted client-SGTA complex, a self-sufficient targeting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>e, and an embedded but self-sufficient quality control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>e. Client-SGTA engagement of the targeting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>e induces rapid, private, and committed client transfer to TRC40 for successful biosynthesis. Commitment to ubiquitination is dictated primarily by comparatively slower client dissociation from SGTA and nonprivate capture by the BAG6 subunit of the quality control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>e. Our results provide a paradigm for how priority and time are encoded within a multichaperone triage system.</p>

miR-22 Is a Novel Mediator of Vascular Smooth Muscle Cell Phenotypic Modulation and Neointima Formation

Furthermore, normal and diseased human femoral arteries were harvested, and various in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro models of VSMC phenotype switching were conducted to examine miR-22 expression during VSMC phenotype switching.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Expression of miR-22 was closely regulated during VSMC phenotypic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ation. miR-22 overexpression significantly increased expression of VSMC marker genes and inhibited VSMC proliferation and migration, whereas the opposite effect was observed when endogenous miR-22 was knocked down. As expected, 2 previously reported miR-22 target genes, MECP2 (methyl-CpG binding protein 2) and histone deacetylase 4, exhibited a regulatory role in VSMC phenotypic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ation. A transcriptional regulator and oncoprotein, EVI1 (ecotropic virus integration site 1 protein homolog), has been identified as a novel miR-22 target gene in VSMC phenotypic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ation. It is noteworthy that overexpression of miR-22 in the injured vessels significantly reduced the expression of its target genes, decreased VSMC proliferation, and inhibited neointima formation in wire-injured femoral arteries, whereas the opposite effect was observed with local application of a miR-22 inhibitor to injured arteries. We next examined the clinical relevance of miR-22 expression and its target genes in human femoral arteries. We found that miR-22 expression was significantly reduced, whereas MECP2 and EVI1 expression levels were dramatically increased, in diseased in comparison with healthy femoral human arteries. This inverse relationship between miR-22 and MECP2 and EVI1 was evident in both healthy and diseased human femoral arteries.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our data demonstrate that miR-22 and EVI1 are novel regulators of VSMC function, specifically during neointima hyperplasia, offering a novel therapeutic opportunity for treating vascular diseases.</p></sec>

RAF1/BRAF dimerization integrates the signal from RAS to ERK and ROKα
<p>Downstream of growth factor receptors and of the guanine triphosphatase (GTPase) RAS, heterodimers of the serine/threonine kinases BRAF and RAF1 are critical upstream kinases and activators of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>e containing the mitogen-activated and extracellular signal–regulated kinase kinase (MEK) and their targets, the extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) family. Either direct or scaffold protein–mediated interactions among the components of the ERK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>e (the MAPKKKs BRAF and RAF1, MEK, and ERK) facilitate signal transmission. RAF1 also has essential functions in the control of tumorigenesis and migration that are mediated through its interaction with the kinase ROKα, an effector of the GTPase RHO and regulator of cytoskeletal rearrangements. We combined mutational and kinetic analysis with mathematical modeling to show that the interaction of RAF1 with ROKα is coordinated with the role of RAF1 in the ERK pathway. We found that the phosphorylated form of RAF1 that interacted with and inhibited ROKα was generated during the interaction of RAF1 with the ERK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>e. This mechanism adds plasticity to the ERK pathway, enabling signal diversification at the level of both ERK and RAF. Furthermore, by connecting ERK activation with the regulation of ROKα and cytoskeletal rearrangements by RAF1, this mechanism has the potential to precisely coordinate the proper timing of proliferation with changes in cell shape, adhesion, or motility.</p>

Neural representations across species
<p>A plethora of studies in rodents have described spatially tuned neurons, including place cells in the hippocampus and grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), suggesting a crucial role of the hippocampal formation in spatial navigation (<i>1</i>). Human studies have, in turn, shown that the hippocampal formation is involved in declarative memory (memories of facts and events) (<i>2</i>). What, then, is the function of the hippocampus? Is it involved in memory or in spatial navigation, or does it have a more general function that encompasses both? Several studies have shown that place cells remap, changing the location at which they respond, following geometrical changes in the environment, and that they can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ated by nonspatial factors, according to the animals' specific tasks (<i>3</i>). These findings highlight the coding of cognitive components, challenging the notion that place cells represent an invariant spatial map. Although grid cells also realign with physical changes in the environment (<i>4</i>), the geometrical structure of their fields has been considered to provide a more invariant spatial representation. But do grid cells encode cognitive aspects as well? On pages 1443 and 1447 of this issue, Boccara <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) and Butler <i>et al.</i> (<i>6</i>), respectively, show that this is the case, providing compelling evidence that grid cells are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ated by reward location. Complementing these studies, Baraduc <i>et al.</i> (<i>7</i>) showed that variations in spatially tuned neurons in the monkey hippocampus are accompanied by a “schema” of the task. Together these studies provide insights on how neurons in the hippocampal formation go beyond purely spatial representations and are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ated by cognitive factors.</p>

Templated nanofiber synthesis via chemical vapor polymerization into liquid crystalline films

The process uses low concentrations of radical monomers formed initially in the vapor phase and then diffused into the liquid-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> template. This minimizes monomer-induced changes to the liquid-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> phase and enables access to nanofiber arrays with complex yet precisely defined structures and compositions.

Experimental observation of high thermal conductivity in boron arsenide

The single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> BAs has better thermal conductivity than other metals and semiconductors.

Here we identify a simple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>, Tl<sub>3</sub>VSe<sub>4</sub>, with a calculated phonon κ [0.16 Watts per meter-Kelvin (W/m-K)] one-half that of our measured κ (0.30 W/m-K) at 300 K, approaching disorder κ values, although Raman spectra, specific heat, and temperature dependence of κ reveal typical phonon characteristics. Adding a transport component based on uncorrelated oscillators explains the measured κ and suggests that a two-channel model is necessary for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s with ultralow κ.</p>

3D charge and 2D phonon transports leading to high out-of-plane <i>ZT</i> in n-type SnSe crystals
<p>Thermoelectric technology enables the harvest of waste heat and its direct conversion into electricity. The conversion efficiency is determined by the materials figure of merit <i>ZT</i>. Here we show a maximum <i>ZT</i> of ~2.8 ± 0.5 at 773 kelvin in n-type tin selenide (SnSe) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s out of plane. The thermal conductivity in layered SnSe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s is the lowest in the out-of-plane direction [two-dimensional (2D) phonon transport]. We doped SnSe with bromine to make n-type SnSe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s with the overlapping interlayer charge density (3D charge transport). A continuous phase transition increases the symmetry and diverges two converged conduction bands. These two factors improve carrier mobility, while preserving a large Seebeck coefficient. Our findings can be applied in 2D layered materials and provide a new strategy to enhance out-of-plane electrical transport properties without degrading thermal properties.</p>

A liquid-liquid transition in supercooled aqueous solution related to the HDA-LDA transition
<p>Simulations and theory suggest that the thermodynamic anomalies of water may be related to a phase transition between two supercooled liquid states, but so far this phase transition has not been observed experimentally because of preemptive ice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization. We used calorimetry, infrared spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate a water-rich hydrazinium trifluoroacetate solution in which the local hydrogen bond structure surrounding a water molecule resembles that in neat water at elevated pressure, but which does not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lize upon cooling. Instead, this solution underwent a sharp, reversible phase transition between two homogeneous liquid states. The hydrogen-bond structures of these two states are similar to those established for high- and low-density amorphous (HDA and LDA) water. Such structural similarity supports theories that predict a similar sharp transition in pure water under pressure if ice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization could be suppressed.</p>

Architecture of eukaryotic mRNA 3′-end processing machinery
<p>Newly transcribed eukaryotic precursor messenger RNAs (pre-mRNAs) are processed at their 3′ ends by the ~1-megadalton multiprotein cleavage and polyadenylation factor (CPF). CPF cleaves pre-mRNAs, adds a polyadenylate tail, and triggers transcription termination, but it is unclear how its various enzymes are coordinated and assembled. Here, we show that the nuclease, polymerase, and phosphatase activities of yeast CPF are organized into three <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>es. Using electron cryomicroscopy, we determined a 3.5-angstrom-resolution structure of the ~200-kilodalton polymerase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>e. This revealed four β propellers, in an assembly markedly similar to those of other protein complexes that bind nucleic acid. Combined with in vitro reconstitution experiments, our data show that the polymerase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>e brings together factors required for specific and efficient polyadenylation, to help coordinate mRNA 3′-end processing.</p>

Crystallization and vitrification of electrons in a glass-forming charge liquid
<p>Charge ordering (CO) is a phenomenon in which electrons in solids <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lize into a periodic pattern of charge-rich and charge-poor sites owing to strong electron correlations. This usually results in long-range order. In geometrically frustrated systems, however, a glassy electronic state without long-range CO has been observed. We found that a charge-ordered organic material with an isosceles triangular lattice shows charge dynamics associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization and vitrification of electrons, which can be understood in the context of an energy landscape arising from the degeneracy of various CO patterns.

These similarities may provide insight into our understanding of the liquid-glass transition.</p>

<i>Trichoderma</i> Histone Deacetylase HDA-2 Modulates Multiple Responses in Arabidopsis
<p><i>Trichoderma</i> spp. are a rich source of secondary metabolites and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which may induce plant defenses and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ate plant growth. In filamentous fungi, chromatin modifications regulate secondary metabolism. In this study we investigated how the absence of histone deacetylase HDA-2 in the <i>Trichoderma atroviride</i> strain Δ<i>hda-2</i> impacts its effect on a host, Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The production of VOCs and their impact on plant growth and development were assessed as well. The Δ<i>hda-2</i> strain was impaired in its ability to colonize Arabidopsis roots, thus affecting the promotion of plant growth and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ation of plant defenses against foliar pathogens <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> and <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i>, which normally result from interaction with <i>T. atroviride</i>. Furthermore, Δ<i>hda-2</i> VOCs were incapable of triggering plant defenses to counterattack foliar pathogens. The Δ<i>hda-2</i> overproduced the VOC 6-pentyl-2H-pyran-2-one (6-PP), which resulted in enhanced root branching and differentially regulated phytohormone-related genes. Analysis of ten VOCs (including 6-PP) revealed that three of them positively regulated plant growth, whereas six had the opposite effect. Assessment of secondary metabolites, detoxification, and communication with plant-related genes showed a dual role for HDA-2 in <i>T. atroviride</i> gene expression regulation during its interaction with plants. Chromatin immunoprecipitation of acetylated histone H3 on the promoters of plant-responsive genes in Δ<i>hda-2</i> showed, in the presence of Arabidopsis, low levels of <i>epl-1</i> and <i>abc-2</i> compared with that in the wild type; whereas <i>ctf-1</i> presented high constitutive levels, supporting a dual role of HDA-2 in gene regulation. This work highlights the importance of HDA-2 as a global regulator in <i>Trichoderma</i> to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ate multiple responses in Arabidopsis.</p>

Root Gravitropism Is Regulated by a Crosstalk between <i>para</i>-Aminobenzoic Acid, Ethylene, and Auxin
<p>Plants respond to gravitational force through directional growth along the gravity vector. Although auxin is the central component of the root graviresponse, it works in concert with other plant hormones. Here, we show that the folate precursor <i>para</i>-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) is a key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ator of the auxin-ethylene interplay during root gravitropism in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). In gravistimulated roots, PABA promotes an asymmetric auxin response, which causes the asymmetric growth responsible for root curvature. This activity requires the auxin response transcription factors AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR7 (ARF7) and ARF19 as well as ethylene biosynthesis and signaling, indicating that PABA activity requires both auxin and ethylene pathways. Similar to ethylene, exogenous PABA reverses the agravitropic root growth of the auxin transport mutant <i>pin-formed2</i> (<i>pin2</i>) and the auxin biosynthetic double mutant with loss of function of <i>weak ethylene insensitive</i> (<i>wei</i>) genes, <i>wei8wei2</i>, but not the <i>pin2wei8wei2</i> triple mutant. This finding suggests that PABA regulates the ethylene-dependent reciprocal compensation between auxin transport and biosynthesis. Furthermore, manipulation of endogenous free PABA levels by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ating the expression of the gene encoding its glucosylation enzyme, UDP-GLYCOSYL TRANSFERASE75B1, impacts the root graviresponse, suggesting that endogenous free PABA levels may play a crucial role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ating the auxin-ethylene cross talk necessary for root gravitropism.</p>

The <i>MicroRNA390</i>/<i>TRANS-ACTING SHORT INTERFERING RNA3</i> Module Mediates Lateral Root Growth under Salt Stress via the Auxin Pathway
<p>Salt-induced developmental plasticity in a plant root system strongly depends on auxin signaling. However, the molecular events underlying this process are poorly understood. <i>MicroRNA390</i> (<i>miR390</i>), <i>trans-actin small interfering RNA</i>s (<i>tasiRNA</i>s), and <i>AUXIN RESPONSE FACTORs</i> (<i>ARFs</i>) form a regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>e involved in controlling lateral root (LR) growth. Here, we found that <i>miR390</i> expression was strongly induced by exposure to salt during LR formation in poplar (<i>Populus</i> spp.) plants. <i>miR390</i> overexpression stimulated LR development and increased salt tolerance, whereas <i>miR390</i> knockdown caused by a short tandem target mimic repressed LR growth and compromised salt resistance. <i>ARF3.1</i>, <i>ARF3.2</i>, and <i>ARF4</i> expression was inhibited significantly by the presence of salt, and transcript abundance was decreased dramatically in the <i>miR390</i>-overexpressing line but increased in the <i>miR390</i>-knockdown line. Constitutive expression of <i>ARF4m</i> harboring mutated <i>trans-acting small interfering ARF</i>-binding sites removed the salt resistance of the <i>miR390</i> overexpressors. <i>miR390</i> positively regulated auxin signaling in LRs subjected to salt, but <i>ARF4</i> inhibited auxin signaling. Salinity stabilized the poplar Aux/IAA repressor INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID17.1, and overexpression of an auxin/salt-resistant form of this repressor suppressed LR growth in <i>miR390</i>-overexpressing and <i>ARF4</i>-RNA interfering lines in the presence of salt. Thus, the <i>miR390/TAS3/ARFs</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>e is a key regulator, via <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ating the auxin pathway, of LR growth in poplar subjected to salt stress.</p>

The sHSP22 Heat Shock Protein Requires the ABI1 Protein Phosphatase to Modulate Polar Auxin Transport and Downstream Responses
<p>The phytohormones abscisic acid (ABA) and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) response pathways interact synergistically or antagonistically to regulate plant development and environmental adaptation. Here, we show that <i>ABI1</i>, a key negative regulator of ABA signaling, is essential for auxin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ated root development. We performed a microarray analysis using the loss-of-function mutant <i>abi1-3</i> and Col-0 seedlings treated with IAA. For <i>sHSP22</i>, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) small heat shock protein-encoding gene, the induction by IAA was dependent on <i>ABI1</i>. <i>shsp22</i> displayed enhanced sensitivity to ABA in primary root growth. In contrast, overexpression of full-length, but not truncated sHSP22 lacking signal peptide and ER-retention sequences, resulted in decreased ABA sensitivity. Overexpressed (OX) <i>sHSP22</i> partially rescued the ABA hypersensitivity of <i>abi1-3</i>. In addition, <i>sHSP22</i> is involved in auxin-regulated hypocotyl elongation at high temperature treatment. <i>sHSP22</i> also affected accumulation of auxin efflux carrier PIN proteins due to potentiated intracellular trafficking. And <i>sHSP22 OX</i> lines initiated more lateral roots after auxin application. Our results suggest that sHSP22 regulates auxin response through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ating auxin polar transport, and ABI1-sHSP22 provides a novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>e orchestrating ABA and auxin signaling crosstalk in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>).</p>

Multifunctional RNA Binding Protein OsTudor-SN in Storage Protein mRNA Transport and Localization
<p>The multifunctional RNA-binding protein Tudor-SN plays multiple roles in transcriptional and posttranscriptional processes due to its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ar domain structure, consisting of four tandem <i>Staphylococcus</i> nuclease (SN)-like domains (4SN), followed by a carboxyl-terminal Tudor domain, followed by a fifth partial SN sequence (Tsn). In plants, it confers stress tolerance, is a component of stress granules and P-bodies, and may participate in stabilizing and localizing RNAs to specific subdomains of the cortical-endoplasmic reticulum in developing rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) endosperm. Here, we show that, in addition to the intact rice OsTudor-SN protein, the 4SN and Tsn <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>es exist as independent polypeptides, which collectively may coassemble to form a complex population of homodimer and heteroduplex species. The 4SN and Tsn <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>es exhibit different roles in RNA binding and as a protein scaffold for stress-associated proteins and RNA-binding proteins. Despite their distinct individual properties, mutations in both the 4SN and Tsn <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>es mislocalize storage protein mRNAs to the cortical endoplasmic reticulum. These results indicate that the two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ar peptide regions of OsTudor-SN confer different cellular properties but cooperate in mRNA localization, a process linking its multiple functions in the nucleus and cytoplasm.</p>

The MicroRNA390/TAS3 Pathway Mediates Symbiotic Nodulation and Lateral Root Growth
<p>Legume roots form two types of postembryonic organs, lateral roots and symbiotic nodules. Nodule formation is the result of the interaction of legumes with rhizobia and requires the mitotic activation and differentiation of root cells as well as an independent, but coordinated, program that allows infection by rhizobia. MicroRNA390 (miR390) is an evolutionarily conserved microRNA that targets the <i>Trans-Acting Short Interference RNA3</i> (<i>TAS3</i>) transcript. Cleavage of <i>TAS3</i> by ARGONAUTE7 results in the production of trans-acting small interference RNAs, which target mRNAs encoding AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR2 (ARF2), ARF3, and ARF4. Here, we show that activation of the miR390/<i>TAS3</i> regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>e by overexpression of miR390 in <i>Medicago truncatula</i> promotes lateral root growth but prevents nodule organogenesis, rhizobial infection, and the induction of two key nodulation genes, <i>Nodulation Signaling Pathway1</i> (<i>NSP1</i>) and <i>NSP2</i>. Accordingly, inactivation of the miR390/<i>TAS3</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>e, either by expression of a miR390 target mimicry construct or mutations in <i>ARGONAUTE7</i>, enhances nodulation and rhizobial infection, alters the spatial distribution of the nodules, and increases the percentage of nodules with multiple meristems.

Disclosing the Molecular Basis of the Postharvest Life of Berry in Different Grapevine Genotypes
<p>The molecular events that characterize postripening grapevine berries have rarely been investigated and are poorly defined. In particular, a detailed definition of changes occurring during the postharvest dehydration, a process undertaken to make some particularly special wine styles, would be of great interest for both winemakers and plant biologists. We report an exhaustive survey of transcriptomic and metabolomic responses in berries representing six grapevine genotypes subjected to postharvest dehydration under identical controlled conditions. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ation of phenylpropanoid metabolism clearly distinguished the behavior of genotypes, with stilbene accumulation as the major metabolic event, although the transient accumulation/depletion of anthocyanins and flavonols was the prevalent variation in genotypes that do not accumulate stilbenes. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ation of genes related to phenylpropanoid/stilbene metabolism highlighted the distinct metabolomic plasticity of genotypes, allowing for the identification of candidate structural and regulatory genes. In addition to genotype-specific responses, a core set of genes was consistently <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ated in all genotypes, representing the common features of berries undergoing dehydration and/or commencing senescence. This included genes controlling ethylene and auxin metabolism as well as genes involved in oxidative and osmotic stress, defense responses, anaerobic respiration, and cell wall and carbohydrate metabolism. Several transcription factors were identified that may control these shared processes in the postharvest berry. Changes representing both common and genotype-specific responses to postharvest conditions shed light on the cellular processes taking place in harvested berries stored under dehydrating conditions for several months.</p>

Gastrointestinal and renal responses to variable water intake in whitebellied sunbirds and New Holland honeyeaters
<p>Nectarivores face a constant challenge in terms of water balance, experiencing water loading or dehydration when switching between food plants or between feeding and fasting. To understand how whitebellied sunbirds and New Holland honeyeaters meet the challenges of varying preformed water load, we used the elimination of intramuscular-injected [<sup>14</sup>C]-<sc>l</sc>-glucose and <sup>3</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O to quantify intestinal and renal water handling on diets varying in sugar concentration. Both sunbirds and honeyeaters showed significant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ation of intestinal water absorption, allowing excess water to be shunted through the intestine when on dilute diets. Despite reducing their fractional water absorption, both species showed linear increases in water flux and fractional body water turnover as water intake increased (both afternoon and morning), suggesting that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ation of fractional water absorption was not sufficient to completely offset dietary water loads. In both species, glomerular filtration rate was independent of water gain (but was higher for the afternoon), as was renal fractional water reabsorption (measured in the afternoon). During the natural overnight fast, both sunbirds and honeyeaters arrested whole kidney function. Evaporative water loss in sunbirds was variable but correlated with water gain. Both sunbirds and honeyeaters appear to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ate intestinal water absorption as an important component of water regulation to help deal with massive preformed water loads. Shutting down glomerular filtration rate during the overnight fast is another way of saving energy for osmoregulatory function. Birds maintain osmotic balance on diets varying markedly in preformed water load by varying both intestinal water absorption and excretion through the intestine and kidneys.</p>

A transcription factor hierarchy defines an environmental stress response network
<p>Environmental stresses are universally encountered by microbes, plants, and animals. Yet systematic studies of stress-responsive transcription factor (TF) networks in multicellular organisms have been limited.

Using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, we identified genome-wide targets of 21 ABA-related TFs to construct a comprehensive regulatory network in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. Determinants of dynamic TF binding and a hierarchy among TFs were defined, illuminating the relationship between differential gene expression patterns and ABA pathway feedback regulation.

The nanostructural transformations produced in our experiments show promising pathways to developing gradient nanograined metals for engineering applications requiring both high strength and high toughness—for example, in structural components of aircraft and spacecraft.</p>

<i>Drosophila</i> insulin release is triggered by adipose Stunted ligand to brain Methuselah receptor
<p>Animals adapt their growth rate and body size to available nutrients by a general <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ation of insulin–insulin-like growth factor signaling. In <i>Drosophila</i>, dietary amino acids promote the release in the hemolymph of brain insulin-like peptides (Dilps), which in turn activate systemic organ growth. Dilp secretion by insulin-producing cells involves a relay through unknown cytokines produced by fat cells. Here, we identify Methuselah (Mth) as a secretin-incretin receptor subfamily member required in the insulin-producing cells for proper nutrient coupling. We further show, using genetic and ex vivo organ culture experiments, that the Mth ligand Stunted (Sun) is a circulating insulinotropic peptide produced by fat cells. Therefore, Sun and Mth define a new cross-organ circuitry that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ates physiological insulin levels in response to nutrients.</p>

A global genetic interaction network maps a wiring diagram of cellular function
<p>We generated a global genetic interaction network for <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, constructing more than 23 million double mutants, identifying about 550,000 negative and about 350,000 positive genetic interactions. This comprehensive network maps genetic interactions for essential gene pairs, highlighting essential genes as densely connected hubs. Genetic interaction profiles enabled assembly of a hierarchical model of cell function, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>es corresponding to protein complexes and pathways, biological processes, and cellular compartments. Negative interactions connected functionally related genes, mapped core bioprocesses, and identified pleiotropic genes, whereas positive interactions often mapped general regulatory connections among gene pairs, rather than shared functionality. The global network illustrates how coherent sets of genetic interactions connect protein complex and pathway <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>es to map a functional wiring diagram of the cell.</p>

Pinstatic Acid Promotes Auxin Transport by Inhibiting PIN Internalization
<p>Polar auxin transport plays a pivotal role in plant growth and development. PIN-FORMED (PIN) auxin efflux carriers regulate directional auxin movement by establishing local auxin maxima, minima, and gradients that drive multiple developmental processes and responses to environmental signals. Auxin has been proposed to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ate its own transport by regulating subcellular PIN trafficking via processes such as clathrin-mediated PIN endocytosis and constitutive recycling. Here, we further investigated the mechanisms by which auxin affects PIN trafficking by screening auxin analogs and identified pinstatic acid (PISA) as a positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ator of polar auxin transport in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). PISA had an auxin-like effect on hypocotyl elongation and adventitious root formation via positive regulation of auxin transport. PISA did not activate SCF<sup>TIR1/AFB</sup> signaling and yet induced PIN accumulation at the cell surface by inhibiting PIN internalization from the plasma membrane. This work demonstrates PISA to be a promising chemical tool to dissect the regulatory mechanisms behind subcellular PIN trafficking and auxin transport.</p>

Ethylene Response Factor ERF11 Activates <i>BT4</i> Transcription to Regulate Immunity to <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i>
<p><i>Pseudomonas syringae</i>, a major hemibiotrophic bacterial pathogen, causes many devastating plant diseases. However, the transcriptional regulation of plant defense responses to <i>P. syringae</i> remains largely unknown. Here, we found that gain-of-function of <i>BTB AND TAZ DOMAIN PROTEIN 4</i> (<i>BT4</i>) enhanced the resistance of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) to <i>Pst</i> DC3000 (<i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv. <i>tomato</i> DC3000). Disruption of <i>BT4</i> also weakened the salicylic acid (SA)-induced defense response to <i>Pst</i> DC3000 in <i>bt4</i> mutants. Further investigation indicated that, under <i>Pst</i> infection, transcription of <i>BT4</i> is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ated by components of both the SA and ethylene (ET) signaling pathways. Intriguingly, the specific binding elements of ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR (ERF) proteins, including dehydration responsive/C-repeat elements and the GCC box, were found in the putative promoter of <i>BT4</i>. Based on publicly available microarray data and transcriptional confirmation, we determined that <i>ERF11</i> is inducible by salicylic acid and <i>Pst</i> DC3000 and is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ated by the SA and ET signaling pathways. Consistent with the function of <i>BT4</i>, loss-of-function of <i>ERF11</i> weakened Arabidopsis resistance to <i>Pst</i> DC3000 and the SA-induced defense response. Biochemical and molecular assays revealed that ERF11 binds specifically to the GCC box of the <i>BT4</i> promoter to activate its transcription. Genetic studies further revealed that the <i>BT4</i>-regulated Arabidopsis defense response to <i>Pst</i> DC3000 functions directly downstream of ERF11. Our findings indicate that transcriptional activation of <i>BT4</i> by ERF11 is a key step in SA/ET-regulated plant resistance against <i>Pst</i> DC3000, enhancing our understanding of plant defense responses to hemibiotrophic bacterial pathogens.</p>

Comparative Transcriptomic Analysis Provides Insight into the Domestication and Improvement of Pear (<i>P. pyrifolia</i>) Fruit
<p>Knowledge of the genetic changes that occurred during the domestication and improvement of perennial trees at the RNA level is limited. Here, we used RNA sequencing analysis to compare representative sets of wild, landrace, and improved accessions of pear (<i>Pyrus pyrifolia</i>) to gain insight into the genetic changes associated with domestication and improvement. A close population relationship and similar nucleotide diversity was observed between the wild and landrace groups, whereas the improved group had substantially reduced nucleotide diversity. A total of 11.13 Mb of genome sequence was identified as bearing the signature of selective sweeps that occurred during pear domestication, whereas a distinct and smaller set of genomic regions (4.04 Mb) was identified as being associated with subsequent improvement efforts. The expression diversity of selected genes exhibited a 20.89% reduction from the wild group to the landrace group, but a 23.13% recovery was observed from the landrace to the improved group, showing a distinctly different pattern with variation of sequence diversity. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>e-trait association analysis identified 16 distinct coexpression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>es, six of which were highly associated with important fruit traits. The candidate trait-linked differentially expressed genes associated with stone cell formation, fruit size, and sugar content were identified in the selected regions, and many of these could also be mapped to the previously reported quantitative trait loci. Thus, our study reveals the specific pattern of domestication and improvement of perennial trees at the transcriptome level, and provides valuable genetic sources of fruit traits that could contribute to pear breeding and improvement.</p>

NIN Acts as a Network Hub Controlling a Growth Module Required for Rhizobial Infection
<p>The symbiotic infection of root cells by nitrogen-fixing rhizobia during nodulation requires the transcription factor Nodule Inception (NIN). Our root hair transcriptomic study extends NIN’s regulon to include <i>Rhizobium Polar Growth</i> and genes involved in cell wall modification, gibberellin biosynthesis, and a comprehensive group of nutrient (N, P, and S) uptake and assimilation genes, suggesting that NIN’s recruitment to nodulation was based on its role as a growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>e, a role shared with other NIN-Like Proteins. The expression of jasmonic acid genes in <i>nin</i> suggests the involvement of NIN in the resolution of growth versus defense outcomes. We find that the regulation of the growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>e component Nodulation Pectate Lyase by NIN, and its function in rhizobial infection, are conserved in hologalegina legumes, highlighting its recruitment as a major event in the evolution of nodulation. We find that Nodulation Pectate Lyase is secreted to the infection chamber and the lumen of the infection thread. Gene network analysis using the transcription factor mutants for <i>ERF Required for Nodulation1</i> and <i>Nuclear Factor-Y Subunit A1</i> confirms hierarchical control of NIN over <i>Nuclear Factor-Y Subunit A1</i> and shows that ERF Required for Nodulation1 acts independently to control infection. We conclude that while NIN shares functions with other NIN-Like Proteins, the conscription of key infection genes to NIN’s control has made it a central regulatory hub for rhizobial infection.</p>

GOLDEN2-LIKE Transcription Factors Regulate <i>WRKY40</i> Expression in Response to Abscisic Acid
<p>Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) GARP (Golden2, ARR-B, Psr1) family transcription factors, GOLDEN2-LIKE1 and -2 (GLK1/2), function in different biological processes; however, whether and how these transcription factors <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ate the response to abscisic acid (ABA) remain unknown. In this study, we used a <i>glk1 glk2</i> double mutant to examine the role of GLK1/2 in the ABA response. The <i>glk1 glk2</i> double mutant displayed ABA-hypersensitive phenotypes during seed germination and seedling development and an osmotic stress-resistant phenotype during seedling development. Genome-wide RNA sequencing analysis of the <i>glk1 glk2</i> double mutant revealed that GLK1/2 regulate several ABA-responsive genes, including <i>WRKY40</i>, in the presence of ABA. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and gel retardation assays showed that GLK1/2 directly associate with the <i>WRKY40</i> promoter via the recognition of a consensus sequence. Additionally, RNA sequencing analysis of the <i>glk1 glk2</i> double mutant and <i>wrky40</i> single mutant revealed that GLK1/2 and WRKY40 control a common set of downstream target genes in response to ABA. Furthermore, results of a genetic interaction test showed that the <i>glk1 glk2 wrky40</i> triple mutant displayed similar ABA hypersensitivity to the <i>wrky40</i> single mutant and the <i>glk1 glk2</i> double mutant, while the <i>glk1 glk2 wrky40 abi5-c</i> (<i>ABI5 CRISPR/Cas9</i> mutant) quadruple mutant displayed similar ABA hyposensitivity to the <i>abi5-7</i> single mutant. Based on these results, we propose that the GLK1/2-WRKY40 transcription <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>e plays a negative regulatory role in the ABA response.</p>

ABI5-BINDING PROTEIN2 Coordinates CONSTANS to Delay Flowering by Recruiting the Transcriptional Corepressor TPR2
<p>ABI5-BINDING PROTEIN2 (AFP2) negatively regulates the abscisic acid signal by accelerating ABI5 degradation during seed germination in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The abscisic acid signal is reported to delay flowering by up-regulating <i>Flowering Locus C</i> expression, but the role of AFP2 in regulating flowering time is unknown. Here, we found that flowering time was markedly delayed and <i>CONSTANS</i> (<i>CO</i>) expression was reduced in a transgenic Arabidopsis line overexpressing <i>AFP2</i> under LD conditions. Conversely, the loss-of-function <i>afp2</i> mutant showed slightly earlier flowering, with higher <i>CO</i> expression. These data suggest that <i>AFP2</i> negatively regulates photoperiod-dependent flowering time by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ating the CO signal. We then found that <i>AFP2</i> exhibited circadian expression rhythms that peaked during the night. Furthermore, the C-terminus of AFP2 interacted with CO, while its N-terminal ethylene response factor–associated amphiphilic repression motif interacted with the transcriptional corepressor TOPLESS-related protein2 (TPR2). Thus, AFP2 bridges CO and TPR2 to form the CO-AFP2-TPR2 complex. Biochemical and genetic analyses showed that AFP2 mediated CO degradation during the night. AFP2 also recruited histone deacetylase activity at <i>Flowering Locus T</i> chromatin through its interaction with TPR2. Taken together, our results reveal an elaborate mechanism by which AFP2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ates flowering time through coordinating the activity and stability of CO.</p>

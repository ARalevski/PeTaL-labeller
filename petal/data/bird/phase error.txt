Fault-tolerant detection of a quantum error
<p>A critical component of any quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>–correcting scheme is detection of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>s by using an ancilla system. However, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>s occurring in the ancilla can propagate onto the logical qubit, irreversibly corrupting the encoded information. We demonstrate a fault-tolerant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>-detection scheme that suppresses spreading of ancilla <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>s by a factor of 5, while maintaining the assignment fidelity. The same method is used to prevent propagation of ancilla excitations, increasing the logical qubit dephasing time by an order of magnitude. Our approach is hardware-efficient, as it uses a single multilevel transmon ancilla and a cavity-encoded logical qubit, whose interaction is engineered in situ by using an off-resonant sideband drive. The results demonstrate that hardware-efficient approaches that exploit system-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong> models can yield advances toward fault-tolerant quantum computation.</p>

Prevalence and Predictors of Cholesterol Screening, Awareness, and Statin Treatment Among US Adults With Familial Hypercholesterolemia or Other Forms of Severe Dyslipidemia (1999–2014)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and other extreme elevations in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol significantly increase the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; however, recent data suggest that prescription rates for statins remain low in these patients. National rates of screening, awareness, and treatment with statins among individuals with FH or severe dyslipidemia are unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data from the 1999 to 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were used to estimate prevalence rates of self-reported screening, awareness, and statin therapy among US adults (n=42 471 weighted to represent 212 million US adults) with FH (defined using the Dutch Lipid Clinic criteria) and with severe dyslipidemia (defined as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels ≥190 mg/dL). Logistic regression was used to identify sociodemographic and clinical correlates of hypercholesterolemia awareness and statin therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The estimated US prevalence of definite/probable FH was 0.47% (standard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>, 0.03%) and of severe dyslipidemia was 6.6% (standard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>, 0.2%). The frequency of cholesterol screening and awareness was high (>80%) among adults with definite/probable FH or severe dyslipidemia; however, statin use was uniformly low (52.3% [standard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>, 8.2%] of adults with definite/probable FH and 37.6% [standard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>, 1.2%] of adults with severe dyslipidemia). Only 30.3% of patients with definite/probable FH on statins were taking a high-intensity statin. The prevalence of statin use in adults with severe dyslipidemia increased over time (from 29.4% to 47.7%) but not faster than trends in the general population (from 5.7% to 17.6%). Older age, health insurance status, having a usual source of care, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and having a personal history of early atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease were associated with higher statin use.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Despite the high prevalence of cholesterol screening and awareness, only ≈50% of adults with FH are on statin therapy, with even fewer prescribed a high-intensity statin; young and uninsured patients are at the highest risk for lack of screening and for undertreatment. This study highlights an imperative to improve the frequency of cholesterol screening and statin prescription rates to better identify and treat this high-risk population. Additional studies are needed to better understand how to close these gaps in screening and treatment.</p></sec>

Suppressing relaxation in superconducting qubits by quasiparticle pumping
<p>Dynamical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong> suppression techniques are commonly used to improve coherence in quantum systems. They reduce dephasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>s by applying control pulses designed to reverse erroneous coherent evolution driven by environmental noise. However, such methods cannot correct for irreversible processes such as energy relaxation. We investigate a complementary, stochastic approach to reducing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>s: Instead of deterministically reversing the unwanted qubit evolution, we use control pulses to shape the noise environment dynamically. In the context of superconducting qubits, we implement a pumping sequence to reduce the number of unpaired electrons (quasiparticles) in close proximity to the device. A 70% reduction in the quasiparticle density results in a threefold enhancement in qubit relaxation times and a comparable reduction in coherence variability.</p>

Dopamine neurons encode performance error in singing birds
<p>Many behaviors are learned through trial and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong> by matching performance to internal goals. Yet neural mechanisms of performance evaluation remain poorly understood. We recorded basal ganglia–projecting dopamine neurons in singing zebra finches as we controlled perceived song quality with distorted auditory feedback. Dopamine activity was phasically suppressed after distorted syllables, consistent with a worse-than-predicted outcome, and was phasically activated at the precise moment of the song when a predicted distortion did not occur, consistent with a better-than-predicted outcome. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong> response magnitude depended on distortion probability. Thus, dopaminergic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong> signals can evaluate behaviors that are not learned for reward and are instead learned by matching performance outcomes to internal goals.</p>

Prediction of the pre-morbid 3D anatomy of the proximal humerus based on statistical shape modelling
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Restoring the pre-morbid anatomy of the proximal humerus is a   goal of anatomical shoulder arthroplasty, but reliance is placed   on the surgeon’s experience and on anatomical estimations. The purpose   of this study was to present a novel method, ‘Statistical Shape   Modelling’, which accurately predicts the pre-morbid proximal humeral anatomy   and calculates the 3D geometric parameters needed to restore normal   anatomy in patients with severe degenerative osteoarthritis or a   fracture of the proximal humerus.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>From a database of 57 humeral CT scans 3D humeral reconstructions   were manually created. The reconstructions were used to construct   a statistical shape model (SSM), which was then tested on a second   set of 52 scans. For each humerus in the second set, 3D reconstructions   of four diaphyseal segments of varying lengths were created. These   reconstructions were chosen to mimic severe osteoarthritis, a fracture   of the surgical neck of the humerus and a proximal humeral fracture   with diaphyseal extension. The SSM was then applied to the diaphyseal   segments to see how well it predicted proximal morphology, using   the actual proximal humeral morphology for comparison.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>With the metaphysis included, mimicking osteoarthritis, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>s   of prediction for retroversion, inclination, height, radius of curvature   and posterior and medial offset of the head of the humerus were   2.9° (± 2.3°), 4.0° (± 3.3°), 1.0 mm (± 0.8 mm), 0.8 mm (± 0.6 mm),   0.7 mm (± 0.5 mm) and 1.0 mm (± 0.7 mm), respectively. With the   metaphysis excluded, mimicking a fracture of the surgical neck,   the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>s of prediction for retroversion, inclination, height, radius   of curvature and posterior and medial offset of the head of the   humerus were 3.8° (± 2.9°), 3.9° (± 3.4°), 2.4 mm (± 1.9 mm), 1.3   mm (± 0.9 mm), 0.8 mm    (± 0.5 mm) and 0.9 mm (± 0.6 mm), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study reports a novel, computerised method that accurately   predicts the pre-morbid proximal humeral anatomy even in challenging   situations.

Dual role for Hox genes and Hox co-factors in conferring leg motoneuron survival and identity in <i>Drosophila</i>
<p>Adult <i>Drosophila</i> walk using six multi-jointed legs, each controlled by ∼50 leg motoneurons (MNs). Although MNs have stereotyped morphologies, little is known about how they are specified. Here, we describe the function of Hox genes and <i>homothorax</i> (<i>hth</i>), which encodes a Hox co-factor, in <i>Drosophila</i> leg MN development. Removing either Hox or Hth function from a single neuroblast (NB) lineage results in MN apoptosis. A single Hox gene, <i>Antennapedia</i> (<i>Antp</i>), is primarily responsible for MN survival in all three thoracic segments. When cell death is blocked, partially penetrant axon branching <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>s are observed in Hox mutant MNs. When single MNs are mutant, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>s in both dendritic and axon arborizations are observed. Our data also suggest that Antp levels in post-mitotic MNs are important for specifying their identities. Thus, in addition to being essential for survival, Hox and <i>hth</i> are required to specify accurate MN morphologies in a level-dependent manner.</p>

Modeling Major Adverse Outcomes of Pediatric and Adult Patients With Congenital Heart Disease Undergoing Cardiac Catheterization
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Risk standardization for adverse events after congenital cardiac catheterization is needed to equitably compare patient outcomes among different hospitals as a foundation for quality improvement. The goal of this project was to develop a risk-standardization methodology to adjust for patient characteristics when comparing major adverse outcomes in the NCDR’s (National Cardiovascular Data Registry) IMPACT Registry (Improving Pediatric and Adult Congenital Treatment).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Between January 2011 and March 2014, 39 725 consecutive patients within IMPACT undergoing cardiac catheterization were identified. Given the heterogeneity of interventional procedures for congenital heart disease, new procedure-type risk categories were derived with empirical data and expert opinion, as were markers of hemodynamic vulnerability. A multivariable hierarchical logistic regression model to identify patient and procedural characteristics predictive of a major adverse event or death after cardiac catheterization was derived in 70% of the cohort and validated in the remaining 30%.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The rate of major adverse event or death was 7.1% and 7.2% in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively. Six procedure-type risk categories and 6 independent indicators of hemodynamic vulnerability were identified.

The paradox of mutations and cancer
<p>The past decade has witnessed the cataloging of genetic mutations in cancer genomes, providing new insights into how and in what ways cancer can develop and spread (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). The focus has been on defining specific “driver” mutations, genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>s in cancer cells that reveal basic biological processes gone awry that are required for cancer initiation and progression. These drivers are the target of new therapies—this concept is central to precision oncology efforts to treat patients according to the genetic changes that are present in their tumors (<i>3</i>). Along the way, it has also become apparent that cancer genomes harbor many additional “passenger” mutations (<i>4</i>). Patterns of driver and passenger DNA mutations derived from cancer genomes have provided clues about the different ways that cancer can manifest as a disease of genetic mutations (<i>5</i>, <i>6</i>). In some circumstances, they can be linked to strong environmental carcinogens (for example, mutation patterns caused by tobacco smoke, ultraviolet radiation, or the fungal toxin aflatoxin) (<i>7</i>). Moreover, these forensic mutational patterns can be used to estimate how long it has taken for a tumor to develop (<i>5</i>). On page 911 of this issue, Martincorena <i>et al.</i> (<i>8</i>) turned their attention toward the detection of mutations in normal tissue, addressing a long-standing paradox that mutations arise in normal tissues but do not necessarily lead to cancer.</p>

Controlled crack propagation for atomic precision handling of wafer-scale two-dimensional materials
<p>Although flakes of two-dimensional (2D) heterostructures at the micrometer scale can be formed with adhesive-tape exfoliation methods, isolation of 2D flakes into monolayers is extremely time consuming because it is a trial-and-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong> process. Controlling the number of 2D layers through direct growth also presents difficulty because of the high nucleation barrier on 2D materials. We demonstrate a layer-resolved 2D material splitting technique that permits high-throughput production of multiple monolayers of wafer-scale (5-centimeter diameter) 2D materials by splitting single stacks of thick 2D materials grown on a single wafer. Wafer-scale uniformity of hexagonal boron nitride, tungsten disulfide, tungsten diselenide, molybdenum disulfide, and molybdenum diselenide monolayers was verified by photoluminescence response and by substantial retention of electronic conductivity. We fabricated wafer-scale van der Waals heterostructures, including field-effect transistors, with single-atom thickness resolution.</p>

Topological protection of biphoton states
<p>The robust generation and propagation of multiphoton quantum states are crucial for applications in quantum information, computing, and communications. Although photons are intrinsically well isolated from the thermal environment, scaling to large quantum optical devices is still limited by scattering loss and other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>s arising from random fabrication imperfections. The recent discoveries regarding topological phases have introduced avenues to construct quantum systems that are protected against scattering and imperfections. We experimentally demonstrate topological protection of biphoton states, the building block for quantum information systems. We provide clear evidence of the robustness of the spatial features and the propagation constant of biphoton states generated within a nanophotonics lattice with nontrivial topology and propose a concrete path to build robust entangled states for quantum gates.</p>

Metropolitan versus small-town influenza
<p>Every year, influenza epidemics occur during winter in regions with temperate climates. The duration, size, and precise timing of influenza epidemics vary from season to season—the numbers of hospitalizations and deaths can be substantial. The influenza epidemic in the winter of 2017–2018 in the United States was extraordinarily severe and long, straining the health care system capacity. Various external factors have been proposed to explain the duration, size, and precise timing of seasonal influenza epidemics, including weakened immune systems during winter, increased social crowding indoors, school leave during the Christmas holiday, and the lower humidity in winter. Inferring the relative importance of each of those factors is difficult because they act on a dynamic process that responds sensitively to changes and that is only observable with a measure of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong> (<i>1</i>–<i>4</i>). How can we determine what is driving influenza epidemics? On page 75 of this issue, Dalziel <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) demonstrate how influenza epidemics in a city are driven by fluctuations in humidity, modulated by the population size. This implies that influenza control measures could work differently in large metropolitan areas compared to small towns.</p>

Measurement of a superconducting qubit with a microwave photon counter
<p>Fast, high-fidelity measurement is a key ingredient for quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong> correction. Conventional approaches to the measurement of superconducting qubits, involving linear amplification of a microwave probe tone followed by heterodyne detection at room temperature, do not scale well to large system sizes. We introduce an approach to measurement based on a microwave photon counter demonstrating raw single-shot measurement fidelity of 92%. Moreover, the intrinsic damping of the photon counter is used to extract the energy released by the measurement process, allowing repeated high-fidelity quantum nondemolition measurements. Our scheme provides access to the classical outcome of projective quantum measurement at the millikelvin stage and could form the basis for a scalable quantum-to-classical interface.</p>

Reconfigurable system for automated optimization of diverse chemical reactions

The system software controls the user-selected reagents and unit operations (reactors and separators), processes reaction analytics (high-performance liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, vibrational spectroscopy), and conducts automated optimizations. The capabilities of this system are demonstrated in high-yielding implementations of C-C and C-N cross-coupling, olefination, reductive amination, nucleophilic aromatic substitution (S<sub>N</sub>Ar), photoredox catalysis, and a multistep sequence. The graphical user interface enables users to initiate optimizations, monitor progress remotely, and analyze results. Subsequent users of an optimized procedure need only download an electronic file, comparable to a smartphone application, to implement the protocol on their own apparatus.</p>

Efficient coding explains the universal law of generalization in human perception
<p>Perceptual generalization and discrimination are fundamental cognitive abilities. For example, if a bird eats a poisonous butterfly, it will learn to avoid preying on that species again by generalizing its past experience to new perceptual stimuli. In cognitive science, the “universal law of generalization” seeks to explain this ability and states that generalization between stimuli will follow an exponential function of their distance in “psychological space.” Here, I challenge existing theoretical explanations for the universal law and offer an alternative account based on the principle of efficient coding. I show that the universal law emerges inevitably from any information processing system (whether biological or artificial) that minimizes the cost of perceptual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong> subject to constraints on the ability to process or transmit information.</p>

Boosting neurogenesis, researchers speculate, might prevent or treat depression, Alzheimer's disease, and other brain disorders. But a controversial study in <i>Nature </i>this week threatens to dash such hopes by suggesting that the production of neurons declines sharply after early development and grinds to a halt by adulthood. The unsuccessful search for new neurons in adult human and monkey brains is disappointing to many.

Resonantly driven CNOT gate for electron spins
<p>Single-qubit rotations and two-qubit CNOT operations are crucial ingredients for universal quantum computing. Although high-fidelity single-qubit operations have been achieved using the electron spin degree of freedom, realizing a robust CNOT gate has been challenging because of rapid nuclear spin dephasing and charge noise. We demonstrate an efficient resonantly driven CNOT gate for electron spins in silicon. Our platform achieves single-qubit rotations with fidelities greater than 99%, as verified by randomized benchmarking. Gate control of the exchange coupling allows a quantum CNOT gate to be implemented with resonant driving in ~200 nanoseconds. We used the CNOT gate to generate a Bell state with 78% fidelity (corrected for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>s in state preparation and measurement).

A new mitotic activity comes into focus
<p>During mitosis, each duplicated chromosome must be accurately attached to the microtubule spindle, which pulls the chromosomes to opposite poles of the cell, where they are segregated to daughter cells. A number of mitotic kinases orchestrate mitosis to ensure accurate segregation, including cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), the Polo-like kinases, and the Aurora kinases (<i>1</i>). The kinase ATR (ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related), which is involved in DNA damage responses during interphase of the cell cycle, has also been shown to prevent chromosome segregation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>s (<i>2</i>). However, this role of ATR was presumed to be an indirect effect.

Use of CRISPR-modified human stem cell organoids to study the origin of mutational signatures in cancer
<p>Mutational processes underlie cancer initiation and progression. Signatures of these processes in cancer genomes may explain cancer etiology and could hold diagnostic and prognostic value. We developed a strategy that can be used to explore the origin of cancer-associated mutational signatures. We used CRISPR-Cas9 technology to delete key DNA repair genes in human colon organoids, followed by delayed subcloning and whole-genome sequencing. We found that mutation accumulation in organoids deficient in the mismatch repair gene <i>MLH1</i> is driven by replication <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>s and accurately models the mutation profiles observed in mismatch repair–deficient colorectal cancers. Application of this strategy to the cancer predisposition gene <i>NTHL1</i>, which encodes a base excision repair protein, revealed a mutational footprint (signature 30) previously observed in a breast cancer cohort. We show that signature 30 can arise from germline <i>NTHL1</i> mutations.</p>

We found at least one of five tested compounds (acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid, thiacloprid, and thiamethoxam) in 75% of all samples, 45% of samples contained two or more of these compounds, and 10% contained four or five. Our results confirm the exposure of bees to neonicotinoids in their food throughout the world. The coexistence of neonicotinoids and other pesticides may increase harm to pollinators.

Actin protects mammalian eggs against chromosome segregation errors
<p>Chromosome segregation is driven by a spindle that is made of microtubules but is generally thought to be independent of actin. Here, we report an unexpected actin-dependent mechanism that drives the accurate alignment and segregation of chromosomes in mammalian eggs. Prominent actin filaments permeated the microtubule spindle in eggs of several mammalian species, including humans. Disrupting actin in mouse eggs led to significantly increased numbers of misaligned chromosomes as well as lagging chromosomes during meiosis I and II. We found that actin drives accurate chromosome segregation by promoting the formation of functional kinetochore fibers, the microtubule bundles that align and segregate the chromosomes. Thus, actin is essential to prevent chromosome segregation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>s in eggs, which are a leading cause of miscarriages, infertility, and Down syndrome.</p>

New developments for protein quality control
<p>The cellular proteome is maintained by a dynamic balance between protein synthesis and degradation, known as proteostasis. An imperative of successful proteostasis is the detection and removal of misfolded proteins by quality control pathways. Proteins that result from translation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>s, misfolding, or age-induced or chemical damage, as well as orphan proteins (which result from inappropriate stoichiometry of multiprotein complexes), are all subject to a variety of degradative pathways to limit their cellular accumulation, which can be toxic (<i>1</i>). One of the striking features of degradative quality control is the juxtaposition of high specificity for misfolded versions of normal proteins with the very broad range of substrates that can be accommodated by each pathway. On pages 472 and 471 of this issue, Yanagitani <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) and Nguyen <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>), respectively, show that a newly discovered quality control pathway is used to bring about the sweeping changes in proteome content that are observed in the differentiation of relatively “cellular” reticulocytes to the highly specialized hemoglobin-rich red blood cells (erythrocytes) (<i>4</i>, <i>5</i>).</p>

Decoding of position in the developing neural tube from antiparallel morphogen gradients

Analysis of the observed responses indicates that the underlying interpretation strategy minimizes patterning <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>s in response to the joint input of noisy opposing gradients. We reverse-engineered a transcriptional network that provides a mechanistic basis for the observed cell fate decisions and accounts for the precision and dynamics of pattern formation.

Stem cell divisions, somatic mutations, cancer etiology, and cancer prevention
<p>Cancers are caused by mutations that may be inherited, induced by environmental factors, or result from DNA replication <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>s (R). We studied the relationship between the number of normal stem cell divisions and the risk of 17 cancer types in 69 countries throughout the world. The data revealed a strong correlation (median = 0.80) between cancer incidence and normal stem cell divisions in all countries, regardless of their environment. The major role of R mutations in cancer etiology was supported by an independent approach, based solely on cancer genome sequencing and epidemiological data, which suggested that R mutations are responsible for two-thirds of the mutations in human cancers. All of these results are consistent with epidemiological estimates of the fraction of cancers that can be prevented by changes in the environment.

Cell-wide analysis of protein thermal unfolding reveals determinants of thermostability
<p>Temperature-induced cell death is thought to be due to protein denaturation, but the determinants of thermal sensitivity of proteomes remain largely uncharacterized. We developed a structural proteomic strategy to measure protein thermostability on a proteome-wide scale and with domain-level resolution. We applied it to <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, <i>Thermus thermophilus</i>, and human cells, yielding thermostability data for more than 8000 proteins. Our results (i) indicate that temperature-induced cellular collapse is due to the loss of a subset of proteins with key functions, (ii) shed light on the evolutionary conservation of protein and domain stability, and (iii) suggest that natively disordered proteins in a cell are less prevalent than predicted and (iv) that highly expressed proteins are stable because they are designed to tolerate translational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>s that would lead to the accumulation of toxic misfolded species.</p>

DNA damage is a pervasive cause of sequencing errors, directly confounding variant identification
<p>Mutations in somatic cells generate a heterogeneous genomic population and may result in serious medical conditions. Although cancer is typically associated with somatic variations, advances in DNA sequencing indicate that cell-specific variants affect a number of phenotypes and pathologies. Here, we show that mutagenic damage accounts for the majority of the erroneous identification of variants with low to moderate (1 to 5%) frequency. More important, we found signatures of damage in most sequencing data sets in widely used resources, including the 1000 Genomes Project and The Cancer Genome Atlas, establishing damage as a pervasive cause of sequencing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>s. The extent of this damage directly confounds the determination of somatic variants in these data sets.</p>

Encoding vocal culture
<p>How does an inexperienced young animal acquire proper communication skills that will serve it well as an adult in a complex social environment? Juvenile songbirds acquire their vocal repertoire by imitating songs from adults. But song imitation per se is not the ultimate goal of their vocal development (<i>1</i>). Birdsong may carry information about species identity, group identity (local culture), individual identity, and—perhaps most important—about a bird's qualities as a potential mate (<i>2</i>, <i>3</i>). There is some tension between these developmental goals: Because birds can imitate songs very accurately, local song convergence could compromise individual identity. Similarly, the accumulation of geographical drifts in song structure could potentially compromise the species-specific “signature” of the song. On pages 1278 and 1282 of this issue, Gadagkar <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) and Araki <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>), respectively, discover neuronal coding of singing performance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong> and of species song identity. Together, their findings reveal an elegant natural solution that alleviates the tension between cultural transmission and retaining a species-specific “signature” in songs over generations.</p>

One brain, many genomes
<p>We each begin life as a single cell harboring a single genome, which—over the course of development—gives rise to the trillions of cells that make up the body. From skin cells to heart cells to neurons of the brain, each bears a copy of the original cell's genome. But as anyone who has used a copy machine or played the childhood game of “telephone” knows, copies are never perfect. Every cell in an individual actually has a unique genome, an imperfect copy of its cellular ancestor differentiated by inevitable somatic mutations arising from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>s in DNA replication and other mutagenic forces (<i>1</i>). Somatic mutation is the fundamental process leading to all genetic diseases, including cancer; every inherited genetic disease also has its origins in such mutation events that occurred in an ancestor's germline cells. Yet how many and what kinds of somatic mutations accumulate in our cells as we develop and age has long been unknown and a blind spot in our understanding of the origins of genetic disease.</p>

Cyclin A2 is an RNA binding protein that controls <i>Mre11</i> mRNA translation
<p>Cyclin A2 activates the cyclin-dependent kinases Cdk1 and Cdk2 and is expressed at elevated levels from S phase until early mitosis. We found that mutant mice that cannot elevate cyclin A2 are chromosomally unstable and tumor-prone. Underlying the chromosomal instability is a failure to up-regulate the meiotic recombination 11 (Mre11) nuclease in S phase, which leads to impaired resolution of stalled replication forks, insufficient repair of double-stranded DNA breaks, and improper segregation of sister chromosomes. Unexpectedly, cyclin A2 controlled Mre11 abundance through a C-terminal RNA binding domain that selectively and directly binds <i>Mre11</i> transcripts to mediate polysome loading and translation. These data reveal cyclin A2 as a mechanistically diverse regulator of DNA replication combining multifaceted kinase-dependent functions with a kinase-independent, RNA binding–dependent role that ensures adequate repair of common replication <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>s.</p>

Visualizing Embolism Propagation in Gas-Injected Leaves
<p>Because the xylem in leaves is thought to be at the greatest risk of cavitation, reliable and efficient methods to characterize leaf xylem vulnerability are of interest. We report a method to generate leaf xylem vulnerability curves (VCs) by gas injection. Using optical light transmission, we visualized embolism propagation in grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) and red oak (<i>Quercus rubra</i>) leaves injected with positive gas pressure. This resulted in a rapid, stepwise reduction of transmitted light, identical to that observed during leaf dehydration, confirming that the optical method detects gas bubbles and provides insights into the air-seeding hypothesis. In red oak, xylem VCs generated using gas injection were similar to those generated using bench dehydration, but indicated 50% loss of conductivity at lower tension (∼0.4 MPa) in grapevine. In determining VC, this method eliminates the need to ascertain xylem tension, thus avoiding potential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>s in water potential estimations. It is also much faster (1 h per VC). However, severing the petiole and applying high-pressure gas could affect air-seeding and the generated VC. We discuss potential artifacts arising from gas injection and recommend comparison of this method with a more standard procedure before it is assumed to be suitable for a given species.</p>

Structure-Function Analysis of Chloroplast Proteins via Random Mutagenesis Using Error-Prone PCR
<p>Site-directed mutagenesis of chloroplast genes was developed three decades ago and has greatly advanced the field of photosynthesis research. Here, we describe a new approach for generating random chloroplast gene mutants that combines <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>-prone polymerase chain reaction of a gene of interest with chloroplast complementation of the knockout <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> mutant. As a proof of concept, we targeted a 300-bp sequence of the <i>petD</i> gene that encodes subunit IV of the thylakoid membrane-bound cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub><i>f</i> complex. By sequencing chloroplast transformants, we revealed 149 mutations in the 300-bp target <i>petD</i> sequence that resulted in 92 amino acid substitutions in the 100-residue target subunit IV sequence. Our results show that this method is suited to the study of highly hydrophobic, multisubunit, and chloroplast-encoded proteins containing cofactors such as hemes, iron-sulfur clusters, and chlorophyll pigments. Moreover, we show that mutant screening and sequencing can be used to study photosynthetic mechanisms or to probe the mutational robustness of chloroplast-encoded proteins, and we propose that this method is a valuable tool for the directed evolution of enzymes in the chloroplast.</p>

Function of the Plant DNA Polymerase Epsilon in Replicative Stress Sensing, a Genetic Analysis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Faithful transmission of the genetic information is essential in all living organisms. DNA replication is therefore a critical step of cell proliferation, because of the potential occurrence of replication <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>s or DNA damage when progression of a replication fork is hampered causing replicative stress. Like other types of DNA damage, replicative stress activates the DNA damage response, a signaling cascade allowing cell cycle arrest and repair of lesions. The replicative DNA polymerase ε (Pol ε) was shown to activate the S-phase checkpoint in yeast in response to replicative stress, but whether this mechanism functions in multicellular eukaryotes remains unclear. Here, we explored the genetic interaction between Pol ε and the main elements of the DNA damage response in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We found that mutations affecting the polymerase domain of Pol ε trigger ATR-dependent signaling leading to SOG1 activation, WEE1-dependent cell cycle inhibition, and tolerance to replicative stress induced by hydroxyurea, but result in enhanced sensitivity to a wide range of DNA damaging agents. Using knock-down lines, we also provide evidence for the direct role of Pol ε in replicative stress sensing. Together, our results demonstrate that the role of Pol ε in replicative stress sensing is conserved in plants, and provide, to our knowledge, the first genetic dissection of the downstream signaling events in a multicellular eukaryote.</p>

Reconstruction of Haplotype-Blocks Selected during Experimental Evolution
<p>The genetic analysis of experimentally evolving populations typically relies on short reads from pooled individuals (Pool-Seq). While this method provides reliable allele frequency estimates, the underlying haplotype structure remains poorly characterized. With small population sizes and adaptive variants that start from low frequencies, the interpretation of selection signatures in most Evolve and Resequencing studies remains challenging. To facilitate the characterization of selection targets, we propose a new approach that reconstructs selected haplotypes from replicated time series, using Pool-Seq data. We identify selected haplotypes through the correlated frequencies of alleles carried by them. Computer simulations indicate that selected haplotype-blocks of several Mb can be reconstructed with high confidence and low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong> rates, even when allele frequencies change only by 20% across three replicates. Applying this method to real data from <i>D. melanogaster</i> populations adapting to a hot environment, we identify a selected haplotype-block of 6.93 Mb. We confirm the presence of this haplotype-block in evolved populations by experimental haplotyping, demonstrating the power and accuracy of our haplotype reconstruction from Pool-Seq data. We propose that the combination of allele frequency estimates with haplotype information will provide the key to understanding the dynamics of adaptive alleles.</p>

Gene Tree Discordance Can Generate Patterns of Diminishing Convergence over Time
<p>Phenotypic convergence is an exciting outcome of adaptive evolution, occurring when different species find similar solutions to the same problem. Unraveling the molecular basis of convergence provides a way to link genotype to adaptive phenotypes, but can also shed light on the extent to which molecular evolution is repeatable and predictable. Many recent genome-wide studies have uncovered a striking pattern of diminishing convergence over time, ascribing this pattern to the presence of intramolecular epistatic interactions. Here, we consider gene tree discordance as an alternative cause of changes in convergence levels over time in a primate dataset. We demonstrate that gene tree discordance can produce patterns of diminishing convergence by itself, and that controlling for discordance as a cause of apparent convergence makes the pattern disappear. We also show that synonymous substitutions, where neither selection nor epistasis should be prevalent, have the same diminishing pattern of molecular convergence in primates. Finally, we demonstrate that even in situations where biological discordance is not possible, discordance due to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>s in species tree inference can drive similar patterns. Though intramolecular epistasis could in principle create a pattern of declining convergence over time, our results suggest a possible alternative explanation for this widespread pattern. These results contribute to a growing appreciation not just of the presence of gene tree discordance, but of the unpredictable effects this discordance can have on analyses of molecular evolution.</p>

Simultaneous high-resolution pH and spectrophotometric recordings of oxygen binding in blood microvolumes
<p>Oxygen equilibrium curves have been widely used to understand oxygen transport in numerous organisms. A major challenge has been to monitor oxygen binding characteristics and concomitant pH changes as they occur <i>in vivo</i>, in limited sample volumes. Here we report a technique allowing highly resolved and simultaneous monitoring of pH and blood pigment saturation in minute blood volumes. We equipped a gas diffusion chamber with a broad-range fibre-optic spectrophotometer and a micro-pH optode and recorded changes of pigment oxygenation along oxygen partial pressure (<i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>) and pH gradients to test the setup. Oxygen binding parameters derived from measurements in only 15 μl of haemolymph from the cephalopod <i>Octopus vulgaris</i> showed low instrumental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong> (0.93%) and good agreement with published data. Broad-range spectra, each resolving 2048 data points, provided detailed insight into the complex absorbance characteristics of diverse blood types. After consideration of photobleaching and intrinsic fluorescence, pH optodes yielded accurate recordings and resolved a sigmoidal shift of 0.03 pH units in response to changing <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> from 0 to 21 kPa. Highly resolved continuous recordings along pH gradients conformed to stepwise measurements at low rates of pH changes. In this study we showed that a diffusion chamber upgraded with a broad-range spectrophotometer and an optical pH sensor accurately characterizes oxygen binding with minimal sample consumption and manipulation. We conclude that the modified diffusion chamber is highly suitable for experimental biologists who demand high flexibility, detailed insight into oxygen binding as well as experimental and biological accuracy combined in a single setup.</p>

Artifactual mutations resulting from DNA lesions limit detection levels in ultrasensitive sequencing applications
<p>The need in cancer research or evolutionary biology to detect rare mutations or variants present at very low frequencies (<10<sup>−5</sup>) poses an increasing demand on lowering the detection limits of available methods. Here we demonstrated that amplifiable DNA lesions introduce important <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong> sources in ultrasensitive technologies such as single molecule PCR (smPCR) applications (e.g. droplet-digital PCR), or next-generation sequencing (NGS) based methods. Using templates with known amplifiable lesions (8-oxoguanine, deaminated 5-methylcytosine, uracil, and DNA heteroduplexes), we assessed with smPCR and duplex sequencing that templates with these lesions were amplified very efficiently by proofreading polymerases (except uracil), leading to G->T, and to a lesser extent, to unreported G->C substitutions at 8-oxoguanine lesions, and C->T transitions in amplified uracil containing templates. Long heat incubations common in many DNA extraction protocols significantly increased the number of G->T substitutions. Moreover, in ∼50-80% smPCR reactions we observed the random amplification preference of only one of both DNA strands explaining the known ‘PCR jackpot effect’, with the result that a lesion became indistinguishable from a true mutation or variant. Finally, we showed that artifactual mutations derived from uracil and 8-oxoguanine could be significantly reduced by DNA repair enzymes.</p>

Despite the potential implications of such findings, no large-scale efforts to measure or improve clinical interpretation were subsequently undertaken.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We compared clinical interpretation of stenosis severity in coronary lesions with an independent assessment using quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) in 175 randomly selected patients undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention at 7 US hospitals in 2011. To assess agreement, we calculated mean difference in percent diameter stenosis between clinical interpretation and QCA and a Cohen weighted κ statistic. Of 216 treated lesions, median percent diameter stenosis was 80.0% (quartiles 1 and 3, 80.0% and 90.0%), with 213 (98.6%) assessed as ≥70%. Mean difference in percent diameter stenosis between clinical interpretation and QCA was 8.2±8.4%, reflecting an average higher percent diameter stenosis by clinical interpretation (<i>P</i><0.001). A weighted κ of 0.27 (95% confidence interval, 0.18–0.36) was found between the 2 measurements.

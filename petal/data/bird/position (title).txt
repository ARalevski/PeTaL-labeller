Wide Variation in Reported Rates of Stroke Across Cohorts of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Oral anticoagulants decrease ischemic stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) but increase the risk of bleeding. For the average patient with AF, the threshold of annual ischemic stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> where the benefit of anticoagulation outweighs the bleeding risk (net clinical benefit) has been shown to be ≈1% to 2%. Guideline recommendations for oral anticoagulants in AF are based on the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc stroke risk point scores, assuming that those scores translate to fixed stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s. However, the relationship between stroke point scores and annual stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s may vary substantially across populations. We sought to comprehensively assess the reported <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of stroke in patients with AF and the relationship of stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s to stroke risk point scores.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A systematic review of cohort studies and randomized controlled trials enrolled patients with nonvalvular AF not treated with oral anticoagulants.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of the 3552 studies screened, we identified 34 studies eligible for analysis. Overall stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s in cohort studies were highly heterogeneous (Q=5706.54, <i>P</i><0.001; I<sup>2</sup> = 99.6%) and ranged from 0.45% to 9.28% per year, despite being of similar objective study quality. The mean North American stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> was less than one-third that of the mean European stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> (<i>P</i><0.0001). However, a random effects regression indicated that between-study variability was not significantly accounted for by cohort region, prospective versus retrospective design, calendar year of study, or outcome event cluster. At a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score of 1, 76% of cohorts reported ischemic stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s <1% per year and only 18% of cohorts reported a stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> >2% per year. At a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score of 2, 27% of cohorts reported stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s below 1% per year, 40% reported stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s between 1 and 2% per year, and 33% reported stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s >2% per year.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Substantial variation exists across cohorts in overall stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s corresponding to CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc point scores.

Direct Determination of the Mutation Rate in the Bumblebee Reveals Evidence for Weak Recombination-Associated Mutation and an Approximate Rate Constancy in Insects
<p>Accu<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> knowledge of the mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> provides a base line for inferring expected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of evolution, for testing evolutionary hypotheses and for estimation of key parameters. Advances in sequencing technology now permit direct estimates of the mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> from sequencing of close relatives. Within insects there have been three prior such estimates, two in nonsocial insects (<i>Drosophila</i>: 2.8 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> per bp per haploid genome per generation; <i>Heliconius</i>: 2.9 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>) and one in a social species, the honeybee (3.4 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>). Might the honeybee’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> be ∼20% higher because it has an exceptionally high recombination <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> and recombination may be directly or indirectly mutagenic? To address this possibility, we provide a direct estimate of the mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> in the bumblebee (<i>Bombus terrestris</i>), this being a close relative of the honeybee but with a much lower recombination <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>. We confirm that the crossover <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> of the bumblebee is indeed much lower than honeybees (8.7 cM/Mb vs. 37 cM/Mb). Importantly, we find no significant difference in the mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s: we estimate for bumblebees a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> of 3.6 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> per haploid genome per generation (95% confidence intervals 2.38 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> and 5.37 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>) which is just 5% higher than the estimate that of honeybees. Both genomes have approximately one new mutation per haploid genome per generation. While we find evidence for a direct coupling between recombination and mutation (also seen in honeybees), the effect is so weak as to leave almost no footprint on any between-species differences. The similarity in mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s suggests an approximate constancy of the mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> in insects.</p>

Hospital Variation in Time to Epinephrine for Nonshockable In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>For patients with in-hospital cardiac arrests attributable to nonshockable rhythms, delays in epinephrine administration beyond 5 minutes is associated with worse survival. However, the extent of hospital variation in delayed epinephrine administration and its effect on hospital-level outcomes is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Within Get With The Guidelines-Resuscitation, we identified 103 932 adult patients (≥18 years) at 548 hospitals with an in-hospital cardiac arrest attributable to a nonshockable rhythm who received at least 1 dose of epinephrine between 2000 and 2014. We constructed 2-level hierarchical regression models to quantify hospital variation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of delayed epinephrine administration (>5 minutes) and its association with hospital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of survival to discharge and survival with functional recovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, 13 213 (12.7%) patients had delays to epinephrine, and this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> varied markedly across hospitals (range, 0%–53.8%). The odds of delay in epinephrine administration were 58% higher at 1 randomly selected hospital in comparison with a similar patient at another randomly selected hospital (median odds ratio, 1.58; 95% confidence interval, 1.51–1.64). The median risk-standardized survival <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> was 12.0% (range, 5.4%–31.9%), and the risk-standardized survival with functional recovery was 7.4% (range, 0.9%–30.8%).

In comparison with a median survival <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> of 12.9% (interquartile range, 11.1%–15.4%) at hospitals in the lowest quartile of epinephrine delay, risk-standardized survival was 16% lower at hospitals in the quartile with the highest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> of epinephrine delays (10.8%; interquartile range, 9.7%–12.7%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Delays in epinephrine administration following in-hospital cardiac arrest are common and variy across hospitals.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
ANGUSTIFOLIA Regulates Actin Filament Alignment for Nuclear Positioning in Leaves
<p>During dark adaptation, plant nuclei move centripetally toward the midplane of the leaf blade; thus, the nuclei on both the adaxial and abaxial sides become <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioned at the inner periclinal walls of cells. This centripetal nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning implies that a characteristic cell polarity exists within a leaf, but little is known about the mechanism underlying this process. Here, we show that ANGUSTIFOLIA (AN) and ACTIN7 regulate centripetal nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves. Two mutants defective in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning of nuclei in the dark were isolated and designated as <i>unusual nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning1</i> (<i>unp1</i>) and <i>unp2</i>. In the dark, nuclei of <i>unp1</i> were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioned at the anticlinal walls of adaxial and abaxial mesophyll cells and abaxial pavement cells, whereas the nuclei of <i>unp2</i> were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioned at the anticlinal walls of mesophyll and pavement cells on both the adaxial and abaxial sides. <i>unp1</i> was caused by a dominant-negative mutation in <i>ACTIN7</i>, and <i>unp2</i> resulted from a recessive mutation in <i>AN</i>. Actin filaments in <i>unp1</i> were fragmented and reduced in number, which led to pleiotropic defects in nuclear morphology, cytoplasmic streaming, and plant growth. The mutation in <i>AN</i> caused aberrant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning of nuclei-associated actin filaments at the anticlinal walls. AN was detected in the cytosol, where it interacted physically with plant-specific dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinases (DYRKPs) and itself. The DYRK inhibitor (1<i>Z</i>)-1-(3-ethyl-5-hydroxy-2(3<i>H</i>)-benzothiazolylidene)-2-propanone significantly inhibited dark-induced nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning. Collectively, these results suggest that the AN-DYRKP complex regulates the alignment of actin filaments during centripetal nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning in leaf cells.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
A Novel Mechanism, Linked to Cell Density, Largely Controls Cell Division in <i>Synechocystis</i>
<p>Many studies have investigated the various genetic and environmental factors regulating cyanobacterial growth. Here, we investigated the growth and metabolism of <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 under different nitrogen sources, light intensities, and CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. Cells grown on urea showed the highest growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s. However, for all conditions tested, the daily growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s in batch cultures decreased steadily over time, and stationary phase was obtained with similar cell densities. Unexpectedly, metabolic and physiological analyses showed that growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s during log phase were not controlled primarily by the availability of photoassimilates. Further physiological investigations indicated that nutrient limitation, quorum sensing, light quality, and light intensity (self-shading) were not the main factors responsible for the decrease in the growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> and the onset of the stationary phase. Moreover, cell division <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s in fed-batch cultures were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ively correlated with the dilution <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s. Hence, not only light, CO<sub>2</sub>, and nutrients can affect growth but also a cell-cell interaction. Accordingly, we propose that cell-cell interaction may be a factor responsible for the gradual decrease of growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s in batch cultures during log phase, culminating with the onset of stationary phase.</p>

Human mutation rate a legacy from our past
<p>Humans should be more like paramecia. That's because their mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> is orders of magnitude lower than a human's. Those <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s increase when genes involved in copying or repairing DNA stop working correctly. Although some mutations are good for generating variety that allows organisms to adapt to changing environments, too many can cause disease and birth defects. At a meeting in Tempe, Arizona, researchers documented mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s in dozens of species and found that the species's specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> is inversely related to the so-called "effective population" size. Small populations are less able to get rid of or compensate for genetic changes that increase mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>. In the past, mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s were thought to be so stable that they were "molecular clocks" useful for dating species' divergences. But researchers are now recognizing that mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s vary from species to species.</p>

Variable Mesophyll Conductance among Soybean Cultivars Sets a Tradeoff between Photosynthesis and Water-Use-Efficiency
<p>Photosynthetic efficiency is a critical determinant of crop yield potential, although it remains below the theoretical optimum in modern crop varieties. Enhancing mesophyll conductance (i.e. the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> of carbon dioxide diffusion from substomatal cavities to the sites of carboxylation) may increase photosynthetic and water use efficiencies. To improve water use efficiency, mesophyll conductance should be increased without concomitantly increasing stomatal conductance. Here, we partition the variance in mesophyll conductance to within- and among-cultivar components across soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) grown under both controlled and field conditions and examine the covariation of mesophyll conductance with photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>, stomatal conductance, water use efficiency, and leaf mass per area. We demonst<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> that mesophyll conductance varies more than 2-fold and that 38% of this variation is due to cultivar identity. As expected, mesophyll conductance is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ively correlated with photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s. However, a strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive correlation between mesophyll and stomatal conductance among cultivars apparently impedes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive scaling between mesophyll conductance and water use efficiency in soybean. Contrary to expectations, photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s and mesophyll conductance both increased with increasing leaf mass per area. The presence of genetic variation for mesophyll conductance suggests that there is potential to increase photosynthesis and mesophyll conductance by selecting for greater leaf mass per area. Increasing water use efficiency, though, is unlikely unless there is simultaneous stabilizing selection on stomatal conductance.</p>

Spontaneous Mutation Accumulation in <i>Daphnia pulex</i> in Selection-Free vs. Competitive Environments
<p>Understanding the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s, spectra, and fitness effects of spontaneous mutations is fundamental to answering key questions in evolution, molecular biology, disease genetics, and conservation biology. To estimate mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ate the effect of selection on new mutations, we propagated mutation accumulation (MA) lines of <i>Daphnia pulex</i> for more than 82 generations and maintained a non-MA population under conditions where selection could act. Both experiments were started with the same obligate asexual progenitor clone. By sequencing 30 genomes and implementing a series of validation steps that informed the bioinformatic analyses, we identified a total of 477 single nucleotide mutations (SNMs) in the MA lines, corresponding to a mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> of 2.30 × 10<sup>−9</sup> (95% CI 1.90–2.70 × 10<sup>−9</sup>) per nucleotide per generation. The high overall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of 4.82 × 10<sup>−5</sup> per site per generation was due to a large ameiotic recombination event spanning an entire arm of a chromosome (∼6 Mb) and several hemizygous deletion events spanning ∼2 kb each. In the non-MA population, we found significantly fewer mutations than expected based on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> derived from the MA experiment, indicating purifying selection was likely acting to remove new deleterious mutations. We observed a surprisingly high level of genetic variability in the non-MA population, which we propose to be driven by balancing selection. Our findings suggest that both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive and negative selection on new mutations is powerful and effective in a strictly clonal population.</p>

Detecting Adaptation in Protein-Coding Genes Using a Bayesian Site-Heterogeneous Mutation-Selection Codon Substitution Model
<p>Codon substitution models have traditionally attempted to uncover signatures of adaptation within protein-coding genes by contrasting the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions. Another modeling approach, known as the mutation–selection framework, attempts to explicitly account for selective patterns at the amino acid level, with some approaches allowing for heterogeneity in these patterns across codon sites. Under such a model, substitutions at a given <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion occur at the neutral or nearly neutral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> when they are synonymous, or when they correspond to replacements between amino acids of similar fitness; substitutions from high to low (low to high) fitness amino acids have comparatively low (high) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s. Here, we study the use of such a mutation–selection framework as a null model for the detection of adaptation. Following previous works in this direction, we include a deviation parameter that has the effect of capturing the surplus, or deficit, in non-synonymous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s, relative to what would be expected under a mutation–selection modeling framework that includes a Dirichlet process approach to account for across-codon-site variation in amino acid fitness profiles. We use simulations, along with a few real data sets, to study the behavior of the approach, and find it to have good power with a low false-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>. Altogether, we emphasize the potential of recent mutation–selection models in the detection of adaptation, calling for further model refinements as well as large-scale applications.</p>

<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Fractures of the distal femur can be challenging to manage and   are on the increase in the elderly osteoporotic population. Management   with casting or bracing can unacceptably limit a patient’s ability   to bear weight, but historically, operative fixation has been associated   with a high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> of re-operation.

Hemiarthroplasty proximal femoral endoprostheses following tumour reconstruction
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Dislocation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s are reportedly lower in patients requiring   proximal femoral hemiarthroplasty than for patients undergoing hip   arthroplasty for neoplasia. Without acetabular replacement, pain   due to acetabular wear necessitating revision surgery has been described.

Age-Specific Trends in Incidence, Mortality, and Comorbidities of Heart Failure in Denmark, 1995 to 2012
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The cumulative burden and importance of cardiovascular risk factors have changed over the past decades. Specifically, obesity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s have increased among younger people, whereas cardiovascular health has improved in the elderly. Little is known regarding how these changes have impacted the incidence and the mortality <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of heart failure. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the age-specific trends in the incidence and 1-year mortality <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s following a first-time diagnosis of heart failure in Denmark between 1995 and 2012.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We included all Danish individuals >18 years of age with a first-time in-hospital diagnosis of heart failure. Data were collected from 3 nationwide Danish registries. Annual incidence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of heart failure and 1-year standardized mortality <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s were calculated under the assumption of a Poisson distribution.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We identified 210 430 individuals with a first-time diagnosis of heart failure between 1995 and 2012; the annual incidence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s per 10 000 person-years declined among older individuals (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s in 1995 versus 2012: 164 versus 115 in individuals >74 years, 63 versus 35 in individuals 65–74 years, and 20 versus 17 in individuals 55–64 years; <i>P</i><0.0001 for all) but increased among the younger (0.4 versus 0.7 in individuals 18–34 years, 1.3 versus 2.0 in individuals 35–44 years, and 5.0 versus 6.4 in individuals 45–54 years; <i>P</i><0.0001 for all). The proportion of patients with incident heart failure ≤50 years of age doubled from 3% in 1995 to 6% in 2012 (<i>P</i><0.0001). Sex- and age-adjusted incidence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> ratios for 2012 versus 1996 were 0.69 (95% confidence interval, 0.67–0.71; <i>P</i><0.0001) among people >50 years of age, and 1.52 (95% confidence interval, 1.33–1.73; <i>P</i><0.0001) among individuals ≤50 years of age; it remained essentially unchanged on additional adjustment for diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, and hypertension. Standardized 1-year mortality <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s declined for middle-aged patients with heart failure but remained constant for younger (<45 years) and elderly (≥65 years) patients.

Repeat Coronary Revascularization After Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery in Older Adults
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>A major advantage of coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) relative to percutaneous coronary intervention is its durability, yet there is a paucity of information on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s and predictors of repeat coronary revascularization after CABG in the modern era.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We included patients ≥65 years from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons’ National Adult Cardiac Surgery Database who were undergoing first-time isolated CABG from 1991 to 2007 (n=723 134, median age 73 years). After linking to Medicare claims data, long-term outcomes of CABG (up to 18 years after surgery) were examined by use of cumulative incidence curves. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard analysis was used to identify factors associated with 1- and 5-year repeat revascularization trends and variability. We found that the overall 18-year survival <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> was 20%. Cumulative incidences of any repeat revascularization (percutaneous coronary intervention or CABG, yet most often percutaneous coronary intervention) were 2%, 7%, 13%, and 16% at 1, 5, 10, and 18 years after surgery, respectively. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of repeat CABG procedures were quite low for all time points (0.1%, 0.6%, 1.3%, and 1.7%, respectively). Female sex, disease severity represented by a history of percutaneous coronary intervention, preoperative dialysis, and partial revascularization were strongly associated with a higher revascularization <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>, whereas advanced age, left main disease, and smoking were associated with a lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>. There was approximately a 2-fold variation in repeat revascularization <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s across centers at 1 year (interquartile range 1.7–3.6%) and 5 years (interquartile range 6.7–12.0%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Repeat revascularization is performed infrequently among older patients who undergo CABG; however, these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s vary substantially by patient subgroups and among providers.</p></sec>

Mortality and Cerebrovascular Events After Heart Rhythm Disorder Management Procedures
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Recognition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s and causes of hard, patient-centered outcomes of death and cerebrovascular events (CVEs) after heart rhythm disorder management (HRDM) procedures is an essential step for the development of quality improvement programs in electrophysiology laboratories. Our primary aim was to assess and characterize death and CVEs (stroke or transient ischemic attack) after HRDM procedures over a 17-year period.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed a retrospective cohort study of all patients undergoing HRDM procedures between January 2000 and November 2016 at the Mayo Clinic. Patients from all 3 tertiary academic centers (Rochester, Phoenix, and Jacksonville) were included in the study. All in-hospital deaths and CVEs after HRDM procedures were identified and were further characterized as directly or indirectly related to the HRDM procedure. Subgroup analysis of death and CVE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s was performed for ablation, device implantation, electrophysiology study, lead extraction, and defibrillation threshold testing procedures.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 48 913 patients (age, 65.7±6.6 years; 64% male) who underwent a total of 62 065 HRDM procedures were included in the study. The overall mortality and CVE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s in the cohort were 0.36% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31–0.42) and 0.12% (95% CI, 0.09–0.16), respectively.

Specialized Adult Congenital Heart Disease Care
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Clinical guidelines recommend specialized care for adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) patients. In reality, few patients receive such dedicated care. We sought to examine the impact of specialized care on ACHD patient mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We examined referral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s to specialized ACHD centers and ACHD patient mortality <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s between 1990 and 2005 in the population-based Quebec Congenital Heart Disease database (n=71 467). This period covers several years before and after the publication of guidelines endorsing specialized care for ACHD patients. A time-series design, based on Joinpoint and Poisson regression analyses, was used to assess the changes in annual referral and patient mortality <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s. The association between specialized ACHD care and all-cause mortality was assessed in both case–control and cohort studies. The time-series analysis demonst<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>d a significant increase in referral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s to specialized ACHD centers in 1997 (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> ratio, +7.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI], +6.6% to +8.2%). In parallel, a significant reduction in expected ACHD patient mortality was observed after year 2000 (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> ratio, −5.0%;95% CI, −10.8% to −0.8%). In exploratory post hoc cohort and case–control analyses, specialized ACHD care was independently associated with reduced mortality (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.65–0.94) and a reduced odds of death (adjusted odds ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.08–0.97), respectively. This effect was predominantly driven by patients with severe congenital heart disease (hazard ratio, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.22–0.67).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>A significant increase in referrals to specialized ACHD centers followed the introduction of the clinical guidelines.

Although guidelines recommend primary care physician (PCP) follow-up for patients who are subsequently discharged, little is known about the relationship between physician follow-up and clinical outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>An observational study was conducted on patients with higher baseline risk, defined as having diabetes mellitus or established cardiovascular disease, who were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated for chest pain, discharged, and without adverse clinical outcomes for 30 days in Ontario from 2004 to 2010. Multivariable proportional hazard models were constructed to adjust for potential confounding between physician groups (cardiologist, PCP, or none). Among 56767 included patients, 17% were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated by cardiologists, 58% were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated by PCPs alone, and 25% had no physician follow-up. The mean age was 66±15 years, and 53% were male. The highest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of diagnostic testing, medical therapy, and coronary revascularization were seen among patients treated by cardiologists. At 1 year, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> of death or MI was 5.5% (95% confidence interval, 5.0–5.9) in the cardiology group, 7.7% (95% confidence interval, 7.4–7.9) in the PCP group, and 8.6% (95% confidence interval, 8.2–9.1) in the no-physician group. After adjustment, cardiologist follow-up was associated with significantly lower adjusted hazard ratio of death or MI compared with PCP (hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.78–0.92) and no physician (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.71–0.88) follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Among patients with higher baseline cardiovascular risk who were discharged from the emergency department after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ation for chest pain in Ontario, follow-up with a cardiologist was associated with a decreased risk of all-cause mortality or hospitalization for MI at 1 year compared with follow-up with a PCP or no physician follow-up.</p></sec>

The receptor tyrosine kinase EphA2 promotes glutamine metabolism in tumors by activating the transcriptional coactivators YAP and TAZ
<p>Malignant tumors reprogram cellular metabolism to support cancer cell proliferation and survival. Although most cancers depend on a high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> of aerobic glycolysis, many cancer cells also display addiction to glutamine. Glutamine transporters and glutaminase activity are critical for glutamine metabolism in tumor cells. We found that the receptor tyrosine kinase EphA2 activated the TEAD family transcriptional coactivators YAP and TAZ (YAP/TAZ), likely in a ligand-independent manner, to promote glutamine metabolism in cells and mouse models of HER2-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive breast cancer. Overexpression of EphA2 induced the nuclear accumulation of YAP and TAZ and increased the expression of YAP/TAZ target genes. Inhibition of the GTPase Rho or the kinase ROCK abolished EphA2-dependent YAP/TAZ nuclear localization. Silencing <i>YAP</i> or <i>TAZ</i> substantially reduced the amount of intracellular glutamate through decreased expression of <i>SLC1A5</i> and <i>GLS</i>, respectively, genes that encode proteins that promote glutamine uptake and metabolism. The regulatory DNA elements of both <i>SLC1A5</i> and <i>GLS</i> contain TEAD binding sites and were bound by TEAD4 in an EphA2-dependent manner. In patient breast cancer tissues, <i>EphA2</i> expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ively correlated with that of <i>YAP</i> and <i>TAZ</i>, as well as that of <i>GLS</i> and <i>SLC1A5</i>. Although high expression of <i>EphA2</i> predicted enhanced metastatic potential and poor patient survival, it also rendered HER2-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive breast cancer cells more sensitive to glutaminase inhibition. The findings define a previously unknown mechanism of EphA2-mediated glutaminolysis through YAP/TAZ activation in HER2-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive breast cancer and identify potential therapeutic targets in patients.</p>

PSMA redirects cell survival signaling from the MAPK to the PI3K-AKT pathways to promote the progression of prostate cancer
<p>Increased abundance of the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) on prostate epithelium is a hallmark of advanced metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) and correlates negatively with prognosis. However, direct evidence that PSMA functionally contributes to PCa progression remains elusive. We gene<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>d mice bearing PSMA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive or PSMA-negative PCa by crossing PSMA-deficient mice with transgenic PCa (TRAMP) models, enabling direct assessment of PCa incidence and progression in the presence or absence of PSMA. Compared with PSMA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive tumors, PSMA-negative tumors were smaller, lower-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grade</span></strong>, and more apoptotic with fewer blood vessels, consistent with the recognized proangiogenic function of PSMA. Relative to PSMA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive tumors, tumors lacking PSMA had less than half the abundance of type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R), less activity in the survival pathway mediated by PI3K-AKT signaling, and more activity in the proliferative pathway mediated by MAPK-ERK1/2 signaling. Biochemically, PSMA interacted with the scaffolding protein RACK1, disrupting signaling between the β<sub>1</sub> integrin and IGF-1R complex to the MAPK pathway, enabling activation of the AKT pathway instead. Manipulation of PSMA abundance in PCa cell lines recapitulated this signaling pathway switch. Analysis of published databases indicated that IGF-1R abundance, cell proliferation, and expression of transcripts for antiapoptotic markers <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ively correlated with PSMA abundance in patients, suggesting that this switch may be relevant to human PCa. Our findings suggest that increase in PSMA in prostate tumors contributes to progression by altering normal signal transduction pathways to drive PCa progression and that enhanced signaling through the IGF-1R/β<sub>1</sub> integrin axis may occur in other tumors.</p>

Social place-cells in the bat hippocampus
<p>Social animals have to know the spatial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ions of conspecifics. However, it is unknown how the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion of others is represented in the brain. We designed a spatial observational-learning task, in which an observer bat mimicked a demonstrator bat while we recorded hippocampal dorsal-CA1 neurons from the observer bat. A neuronal subpopulation represented the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion of the other bat, in allocentric coordinates. About half of these “social place-cells” represented also the observer’s own <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion—that is, were place cells. The representation of the demonstrator bat did not reflect self-movement or trajectory planning by the observer. Some neurons represented also the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion of inanimate moving objects; however, their representation differed from the representation of the demonstrator bat. This suggests a role for hippocampal CA1 neurons in social-spatial cognition.</p>

The fading American dream: Trends in absolute income mobility since 1940
<p>We estimated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of “absolute income mobility”—the fraction of children who earn more than their parents—by combining data from U.S. Census and Current Population Survey cross sections with panel data from de-identified tax records. We found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of absolute mobility have fallen from approximately 90% for children born in 1940 to 50% for children born in the 1980s. Increasing Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s alone cannot restore absolute mobility to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s experienced by children born in the 1940s. However, distributing current GDP growth more equally across income groups as in the 1940 birth cohort would reverse more than 70% of the decline in mobility. These results imply that reviving the “American dream” of high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of absolute mobility would require economic growth that is shared more broadly across the income distribution.</p>

SHORTROOT-Mediated Increase in Stomatal Density Has No Impact on Photosynthetic Efficiency
<p>The coordinated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning of veins, mesophyll cells, and stomata across a leaf is crucial for efficient gas exchange and transpiration and, therefore, for overall function. In monocot leaves, stomatal cell files are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioned at the flanks of underlying longitudinal leaf veins, rather than directly above or below. This pattern suggests either that stomatal formation is inhibited in epidermal cells directly in contact with the vein or that specification is induced in cell files beyond the vein. The SHORTROOT pathway specifies distinct cell types around the vasculature in subepidermal layers of both root and shoots, with cell type identity determined by distance from the vein. To test whether the pathway has the potential to similarly pattern epidermal cell types, we expanded the expression domain of the rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> ssp <i>japonica</i>) <i>OsSHR2</i> gene, which we show is restricted to developing leaf veins, to include bundle sheath cells encircling the vein. In transgenic lines, which were gene<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>d using the orthologous <i>ZmSHR1</i> gene to avoid potential silencing of <i>OsSHR2</i>, stomatal cell files were observed both in the normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion and in more distant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ions from the vein. Contrary to theoretical predictions, and to phenotypes observed in eudicot leaves, the increase in stomatal density did not enhance photosynthetic capacity or increase mesophyll cell density. Collectively, these results suggest that the SHORTROOT pathway may coordinate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning of veins and stomata in monocot leaves and that distinct mechanisms may ope<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> in monocot and eudicot leaves to coordinate stomatal patterning with the development of underlying mesophyll cells.</p>

Characterization of Trichome-Expressed BAHD Acyltransferases in <i>Petunia axillaris</i> Reveals Distinct Acylsugar Assembly Mechanisms within the Solanaceae
<p>Acylsugars are synthesized in the glandular trichomes of the Solanaceae family and are implicated in protection against abiotic and biotic stress. Acylsugars are composed of either sucrose or glucose esterified with varying numbers of acyl chains of differing length. In tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>), acylsugar assembly requires four acylsugar acyltransferases (ASATs) of the BAHD superfamily. Tomato ASATs catalyze the sequential esterification of acyl-coenzyme A thioesters to the R4, R3, R3′, and R2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ions of sucrose, yielding a tetra-acylsucrose. <i>Petunia</i> spp. synthesize acylsugars that are structurally distinct from those of tomato. To explore the mechanisms underlying this chemical diversity, a <i>Petunia</i> <i>axillaris</i> transcriptome was mined for trichome preferentially expressed BAHDs. A combination of phylogenetic analyses, gene silencing, and biochemical analyses coupled with structural elucidation of metabolites revealed that acylsugar assembly is not conserved between tomato and petunia. In <i>P. axillaris</i>, tetra-acylsucrose assembly occurs through the action of four ASATs, which catalyze sequential addition of acyl groups to the R2, R4, R3, and R6 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ions. Notably, in <i>P. axillaris</i>, PaxASAT1 and PaxASAT4 catalyze the acylation of the R2 and R6 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ions of sucrose, respectively, and no clear orthologs exist in tomato. Similarly, petunia acylsugars lack an acyl group at the R3′ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion, and congruently, an ortholog of SlASAT3, which catalyzes acylation at the R3′ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion in tomato, is absent in <i>P. axillaris</i>. Furthermore, where putative orthologous relationships of ASATs are predicted between tomato and petunia, these are not supported by biochemical assays. Overall, these data demonst<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> the considerable evolutionary plasticity of acylsugar biosynthesis.</p>

A Comprehensively Curated Genome-Scale Two-Cell Model for the Heterocystous Cyanobacterium <i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120
<p><i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120 is a nitrogen-fixing filamentous cyanobacterium. Under nitrogen-limiting conditions, a fraction of the vegetative cells in each filament terminally differentiate to nongrowing heterocysts. Heterocysts are metabolically and structurally specialized to enable O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive nitrogen fixation. The functionality of the filament, as an association of vegetative cells and heterocysts, is postulated to depend on metabolic exchange of electrons, carbon, and fixed nitrogen. In this study, we compile and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ate a comprehensive cu<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>d stoichiometric model of this two-cell system, with the objective function based on the growth of the filament under diazotrophic conditions. The predicted growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> under nitrogen-replete and -deplete conditions, as well as the effect of external carbon and nitrogen sources, was thereafter verified. Furthermore, the model was utilized to comprehensively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ate the optimality of putative metabolic exchange reactions between heterocysts and vegetative cells. The model suggested that optimal growth requires at least four exchange metabolites. Several combinations of exchange metabolites resulted in predicted growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s that are higher than growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s achieved by only considering exchange of metabolites previously suggested in the literature. The cu<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>d model of the metabolic network of <i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120 enhances our ability to understand the metabolic organization of multicellular cyanobacteria and provides a platform for further study and engineering of their metabolism.</p>

Genome-Wide Biases in the Rate and Molecular Spectrum of Spontaneous Mutations in <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> and <i>Vibrio fischeri</i>
<p>The vast diversity in nucleotide com<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion and architecture among bacterial genomes may be partly explained by inherent biases in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s and spectra of spontaneous mutations. Bacterial genomes with multiple chromosomes are relatively unusual but some are relevant to human health, none more so than the causative agent of cholera, <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>. Here, we present the genome-wide mutation spectra in wild-type and mismatch repair (MMR) defective backgrounds of two <i>Vibrio</i> species, the low-%GC squid symbiont <i>V. fischeri</i> and the pathogen <i>V. cholerae</i>, collected under conditions that greatly minimize the efficiency of natural selection. In apparent contrast to their high diversity in nature, both wild-type <i>V. fischeri</i> and <i>V. cholerae</i> have among the lowest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s for base-substitution mutations (bpsms) and insertion–deletion mutations (indels) that have been measured, below 10<sup>−</sup><sup>3</sup>/genome/generation. <i>Vibrio fischeri</i> and <i>V. cholerae</i> have distinct mutation spectra, but both are AT-biased and produce a surprising number of multi-nucleotide indels. Furthermore, the loss of a functional MMR system caused the mutation spectra of these species to converge, implying that the MMR system itself contributes to species-specific mutation patterns. Bpsm and indel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s varied among genome regions, but do not explain the more rapid evolutionary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of genes on chromosome 2, which likely result from weaker purifying selection. More generally, the very low mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of <i>Vibrio</i> species correlate inversely with their immense population sizes and suggest that selection may not only have maximized replication fidelity but also optimized other polygenic traits relative to the constraints of genetic drift.</p>

Dynamic Convergent Evolution Drives the Passage Adaptation across 48 Years’ History of H3N2 Influenza Evolution
<p>Influenza viruses are often propagated in a diverse set of culturing media and additional substitutions known as passage adaptation can cause extra evolution in the target strain, leading to ineffective vaccines. Using 25,482 H3N2 HA1 sequences cu<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>d from Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data and National Center for Biotechnology Information databases, we found that passage adaptation is a very dynamic process that changes over time and evolves in a seesaw like pattern. After crossing the species boundary from bird to human in 1968, the influenza H3N2 virus evolves to be better adapted to the human environment and passaging them in embryonated eggs (i.e., an avian environment) leads to increasingly stronger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive selection. On the contrary, passage adaptation to the mammalian cell lines changes from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive selection to negative selection. Using two statistical tests, we identified 19 codon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ions around the receptor binding domain strongly contributing to passage adaptation in the embryonated egg. These sites show strong convergent evolution and overlap extensively with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ively selected sites identified in humans, suggesting that passage adaptation can confound many of the earlier studies on influenza evolution. Interestingly, passage adaptation in recent years seems to target a few codon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ions in antigenic surface epitopes, which makes it difficult to produce antigenically unaltered vaccines using embryonic eggs. Our study outlines another interesting scenario whereby both convergent and adaptive evolution are working in synchrony driving viral adaptation. Future studies from sequence analysis to vaccine production need to take careful consideration of passage adaptation.</p>

Measuring gill paracellular permeability with polyethylene glycol-4000 in freely swimming trout: proof of principle
<p>The influence of swimming activity on gill paracellular permeability has not been measured previously in fishes. We critically assessed the use of tritium-labeled polyethylene glycol ([<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000) for this purpose, a substance that is also a classic marker for extracellular fluid volume, glomerular filtration <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> and drinking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>. Tests (8 h) on resting freshwater trout showed that when measuring [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance from the plasma in the efflux direction, correction for a large excretion via glomerular filtration was essential, necessitating urinary catheterization. When measuring [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance from the water in the influx direction, correction for a significant uptake by drinking was essential, necessitating terminal gut removal, whereas glomerular filtration losses were minimal. After correction for these alternate routes of loss and uptake, [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s by efflux from the plasma and by influx from the water were identical, showing that gill paracellular permeability is not rectified, and can be measured in either direction. The influx technique with terminal gut removal was used to assess gill paracellular permeability in trout without urinary catheters freely swimming at 1.2 body lengths s<sup>−1</sup> for 8 h. Branchial [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> (by influx from the water) increased significantly by ~80% in accord with a similar measured increase in O<sub>2</sub> consumption <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>. Thus in trout, gill paracellular permeability does increase during exercise, in accord with the traditional concept of the osmorespiratory compromise.</p>

<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aims of this study were to establish the incidence of acute   Achilles tendon rupture (AATR) in a North American population, to   select demographic subgroups and to examine trends in the management   of this injury in the province of Ontario, Canada.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Patients ≥ 18 years of age who presented with an AATR to an emergency   department in Ontario, Canada between 1 January 2003 and 31 December   2013 were identified using administrative databases. The overall   and annual incidence density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> (IDR) of AATR were calculated   for all demographic subgroups. The annual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> of surgical repair   was also calculated and compared between demographic subgroups.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 27 607 patients (median age, 44 years; interquartile   range 26 to 62; 66.5% male) sustained an AATR. The annual IDR increased   from 18.0 to 29.3 per 100 000 person-years between 2003 and 2013.   The mean IDR was highest among men between the ages of 40 and 49   years (46.0/100 000 person-years). The annual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> of surgical repair dropped   from 20.1 in 2003 to 9.2 per 100 AATRs in 2013.

The outcome and complications of vascularised fibular grafts
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Free vascularised fibular grafting has been used for the treatment   of large bony defects for more than 40 years. However, there is   little information about the risk factors for failure and whether   newer locking techniques of fixation improve the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of union.   The purpose of this study was to compare the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of union of free   fibular grafts fixed with locking and traditional techniques, and   to quantify the risk factors for nonunion and failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A retrospective review involved 134 consecutive procedures over   a period of 20 years. Of these, 25 were excluded leaving 109 patients   in the study. There were 66 men and 43 women, with a mean age of   33 years (5 to 78). Most (62) were performed for oncological indications,   and the most common site (52) was the lower limb. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> of union   was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and risk factors for   nonunion were assessed using Cox regression. All patients were followed   up for at least one year.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> of union was 82% at two years and 97% at five years.   Union was achieved after the initial procedure in 76 patients (70%)   at a mean of ten months (3 to 19), and overall union was achieved   in 99 patients (91%)<bold>. </bold>No surgical factor, including   the use of locked fixation or supplementary corticocancellous bone   grafts increased the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> of union. A history of smoking was significantly   associated with a risk of nonunion.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Free vascularised fibular grafting is a successful form of treatment   for large bony defects. These results suggest that the use of modern   techniques of fixation does not affect the risk of nonunion when   compared with traditional forms of fixation, and smoking increases   the risk of nonunion following this procedure.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:134–8.</p></sec>

Ten-year follow-up study of three alternative bearing surfaces used in total hip arthroplasty in young patients
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We present the ten-year data of a cohort of patients, aged between   18 and 65 years (mean age 52.7 years; 19 to 64), who underwent total   hip arthroplasty. Patients were randomised to be treated with a   cobalt-chrome (CoCr) femoral head with an ultra-high molecular weight   polyethylene (UHMWPE), highly cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) or   ceramic-on-ceramic (CoC) bearing surface.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 102 hips (91 patients) were randomised into the three   groups. At ten years, 97 hips were available for radiological and   functional follow-up. Two hips (two patients) had been revised (one   with deep infection and one for periprosthetic fracture) and three   were lost to follow-up. Radiological analysis was performed using   a validated digital assessment programme to give linear, directional   and volumetric wear of the two polyethylene groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was a significantly reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> of steady-state linear   wear with XLPE (0.07 mm/yr) compared with UHMWPE (0.37 mm/yr) (p   = 0.001). Volumetric wear was also significantly reduced in the   XLPE group (29.29 mm<sup>3</sup>/yr) compared with the UHMWPE group   (100.75mm<sup>3</sup>/yr) (p = 0.0001). There were six patients   with UHMWPE who had non-progressive osteolysis and none in the XLPE   group. All three bearing groups had significant improvements in   12-item short form health survey scores, Western Ontario and McMaster   Universities Osteoarthritis Index score and Harris Hip Score. However,   the improvement in HSS was significantly less in the UHMWPE group   (p = 0.0188) than in the other two groups.</p><p>At ten years, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of volumetric and linear wear in the   XLPE group remain low and predominantly below the estimated threshold   for osteolysis (1 mm/yr). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> of linear wear in the XLPE group   was three times less than in the UHMWPE group at five-year follow-up   and five times less at ten years. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> of volumetric wear was also   three times less in the XLPE group at ten years.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>While CoC also performs well, XLPE at ten years remains a safe   and excellent bearing option in young patients, with low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of   wear and no evidence of osteolysis.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1590–5.</p></sec>

Failure of treatment was assessed according to a definition   determined by a Delphi-based consensus. Logistic regression analysis   was performed to assess the predictors of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive culture and risk   factors for failure. The mean follow-up was 33 months (24 to 48).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 163 two-stage revision arthroplasties involving 84   total hip arthroplasties (THAs) and 79 total knee arthroplasties   (TKAs) were reviewed.

Appropriate hinge position for prevention of unstable lateral hinge fracture in open wedge high tibial osteotomy
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Open wedge high tibial osteotomy (OWHTO) for medial-compartment   osteoarthritis of the knee can be complicated by intra-operative   lateral hinge fracture (LHF).

Frequency, Predictors, and Impact of Combined Antiplatelet Therapy on Venous Thromboembolism in Patients With Symptomatic Atherosclerosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Observational studies suggest that symptomatic atherosclerosis may be associated with risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Prior randomized studies have demonst<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>d a significant reduction in recurrent VTE with aspirin monotherapy. Whether VTE risk is associated with more severe symptomatic atherosclerosis and more intensive antiplatelet therapy reduces VTE risk beyond aspirin monotherapy is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>TRA2P-TIMI 50 (Thrombin Receptor Antagonist in Secondary Prevention of Atherothrombotic Ischemic Events–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) (vorapaxar) and PEGASUS-TIMI 54 (Prevention of Cardiovascular Events in Patients With Prior Heart Attack Using Ticagrelor Compared to Placebo on a Background of Aspirin–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 54) (ticagrelor) were blinded, randomized placebo-controlled trials of antiplatelet therapy for the prevention of ischemic events in stable patients with symptomatic atherosclerosis. Two blinded vascular specialists systematically identified symptomatic venous thromboembolic events in both trials.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 47 611 patients with stable vascular disease followed for 3 years in both studies there were 343 VTE events in 301 patients (Kaplan-Meier <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> at 3 years, 0.9% for placebo). The risk of VTE was independently associated with age, body mass index, polyvascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and malignancy. The burden of atherosclerosis manifested as an increasing number of symptomatic vascular territories was associated with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grade</span></strong>d increase in the 3-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of VTE (0.76% for 1, 1.53% for 2, and 2.45% for 3 territories). More intensive antiplatelet therapy (vorapaxar and ticagrelor pooled) significantly reduced the risk of VTE by 29% compared with background antiplatelet therapy, from 0.93% to 0.64% at 3 years (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% confidence interval, 0.56–0.89; <i>P</i>=0.003).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> of VTE in patients with atherosclerosis is ≈0.3% per year while on treatment with ≥1 antiplatelet agent, with increased risk independently associated with the number of symptomatic vascular territories.

Prognostic Value of Coronary Artery Calcium in the PROMISE Study (Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is an established predictor of future major adverse atherosclerotic cardiovascular events in asymptomatic individuals. However, limited data exist as to how CAC compares with functional testing (FT) in estimating prognosis in symptomatic patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In the PROMISE trial (Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ation of Chest Pain), patients with stable chest pain (or dyspnea) and intermediate pretest probability for obstructive coronary artery disease were randomized to FT (exercise electrocardiography, nuclear stress, or stress echocardiography) or anatomic testing. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated those who underwent CAC testing as part of the anatomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ation (n=4209) and compared that with results of FT (n=4602). We stratified CAC and FT results as normal or mildly, mode<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>ly, or severely abnormal (for CAC: 0, 1–99 Agatston score [AS], 100–400 AS, and >400 AS, respectively; for FT: normal, mild=late <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive treadmill, mode<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>=early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive treadmill or single-vessel ischemia, and severe=large ischemic region abnormality). The primary end point was all-cause death, myocardial infarction, or unstable angina hospitalization over a median follow-up of 26.1 months. Cox regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and C statistics to determine predictive and discriminatory values.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, the distribution of normal or mildly, mode<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>ly, or severely abnormal test results was significantly different between FT and CAC (FT: normal, n=3588 [78.0%]; mild, n=432 [9.4%]; mode<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>, n=217 [4.7%]; severe, n=365 [7.9%]; CAC: normal, n=1457 [34.6%]; mild, n=1340 [31.8%]; mode<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>, n=772 [18.3%]; severe, n=640 [15.2%]; <i>P</i><0.0001). Mode<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> and severe abnormalities in both arms robustly predicted events (mode<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>: CAC: HR, 3.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.81–5.44; and FT: HR, 2.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.46–4.83; severe: CAC: HR, 3.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.99–6.36; and FT: HR, 3.88; 95% confidence interval, 2.58–5.85). In the CAC arm, the majority of events (n=112 of 133, 84%) occurred in patients with any <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive CAC test (score >0), whereas fewer than half of events occurred in patients with mildly, mode<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>ly, or severely abnormal FT (n=57 of 132, 43%; <i>P</i><0.001). In contrast, any abnormality on FT was significantly more specific for predicting events (78.6% for FT versus 35.2% for CAC; <i>P</i><0.001). Overall discriminatory ability in predicting the primary end point of mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and unstable angina hospitalization was similar and fair for both CAC and FT (C statistic, 0.67 versus 0.64).

Systolic Blood Pressure Trajectory, Frailty, and All-Cause Mortality >80 Years of Age
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Clinical trials show benefit from lowering systolic blood pressure (SBP) in people ≥80 years of age, but nonrandomized epidemiological studies suggest lower SBP may be associated with higher mortality. This study aimed to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ate associations of SBP with all-cause mortality by frailty category >80 years of age and to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ate SBP trajectories before death.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A population-based cohort study was conducted using electronic health records of 144 403 participants ≥80 years of age registered with family practices in the United Kingdom from 2001 to 2014. Participants were followed for ≤5 years. Clinical records of SBP were analyzed. Frailty status was classified using the e-Frailty Index into the categories of fit, mild, mode<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>, and severe. All-cause mortality was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated by frailty status and mean SBP in Cox proportional-hazards models. SBP trajectories were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated using person months as observations, with mean SBP and antihypertensive treatment status estimated for each person month. Fractional polynomial models were used to estimate SBP trajectories over 5 years before death.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>During follow-up, 51 808 deaths occurred. Mortality <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s increased with frailty level and were greatest at SBP <110 mm Hg. In fit women, mortality was 7.7 per 100 person years at SBP 120 to 139 mm Hg, 15.2 at SBP 110 to 119 mm Hg, and 22.7 at SBP <110 mm Hg. For women with severe frailty, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s were 16.8, 25.2, and 39.6, respectively. SBP trajectories showed an accele<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>d decline in the last 2 years of life. The relative odds of SBP <120 mm Hg were higher in the last 3 months of life than 5 years previously in both treated (odds ratio, 6.06; 95% confidence interval, 5.40–6.81) and untreated (odds ratio, 6.31; 95% confidence interval, 5.30–7.52) patients. There was no evidence of intensification of antihypertensive therapy in the final 2 years of life.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>A terminal decline of SBP in the final 2 years of life suggests that nonrandomized epidemiological associations of low SBP with higher mortality may be accounted for by reverse causation if participants with lower blood pressure values are closer, on average, to the end of life.</p></sec>

β<sub>2</sub>-Glycoprotein I/IgA Immune Complexes
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Antiphospholipid syndrome is characterized by recurrent thrombosis and gestational morbidity in patients with antiphospholipid autoantibodies (aPLs). Predictive value of the presence of aPLs is low, and new markers are necessary to identify aPL carriers at higher risk and take preventive measures on them. The presence of circulating immune complexes of IgA bound to β<sub>2</sub>-glycoprotein I (B2A-CIC) has been associated with occurrence of acute thrombotic events. In this work we study its possible predictive value for the appearance of acute thrombotic events in patients who are going to undergo transplant surgery, a well-known trigger of acute thrombotic events in aPL carriers.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed a follow-up study based on the Magnum 12+12 Cohort of patients who received a kidney transplant (n=1339). Three groups were established: group 1 patients who were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive for IgA anti-β<sub>2</sub>-glycoprotein I (aB2GP1) and B2A-CIC (n=125); group 2 patients who were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive only for IgA aB2GP1 (n=240); and control group, patients who were negative for IgA aB2GP1 (n=974). Levels of autoantibodies and B2A-CIC were quantified immediately before the transplant surgery and patients were followed up for 6 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In group 1, 46.4% of patients experienced any type of thrombosis versus 10.4% in group 2 (<i>P</i><0.001) and 8.6% in the control group (<i>P</i><0.001). The incidence of graft thrombosis in group 1 (31.2%) was significantly higher than that observed in group 2 (3.3%, <i>P</i><0.001) and the control group (2.6%, <i>P</i><0.001). In a multivariate analysis, the presence of B2A-CIC was an independent variable to experience any type of posttransplant thrombosis (hazard ratio, 6.72; 95% confidence interval, 4.81–9.37) and, prominently, for graft thrombosis (hazard ratio, 14.75; 95% confidence interval, 9.11–23.89). No significant differences were found between B2A-CIC–negative and control group patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The presence of B2A-CIC is a predictor of acute thrombotic events. Patients who were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive for IgA aB2GP1 only are at risk of experiencing thrombosis if they are B2A-CIC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive. If they are B2A-CIC–negative patients, they have the same risk as the control group. Treatments to prevent acute thrombotic events should focus on B2A-CIC–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive patients.</p></sec>

Assessment of the European Society of Cardiology 0-Hour/1-Hour Algorithm to Rule-Out and Rule-In Acute Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The new European Society of Cardiology guidelines to rule-in and rule-out acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in the emergency department include a rapid assessment algorithm based on high-sensitivity cardiac troponin and sampling at 0 and 1 hour. Emergency department physicians require high sensitivity to confidently rule-out AMI, whereas cardiologists aim to minimize false-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive results.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>High-sensitivity troponin I and T assays were used to measure troponin concentrations in patients presenting with chest-pain symptoms and being investigated for possible acute coronary syndrome at hospitals in New Zealand, Australia, and Canada. AMI outcomes were independently adjudicated by at least 2 physicians. The European Society of Cardiology algorithm performance with each assay was assessed by the sensitivity and proportion with AMI ruled out and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive predictive value and proportion ruled-in.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>There were 2222 patients with serial high-sensitivity troponin T and high-sensitivity troponin I measurements. The high-sensitivity troponin T algorithm ruled out 1425 (64.1%) with a sensitivity of 97.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 94.0%–98.8%) and ruled-in 292 (13.1%) with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive predictive value of 63.4% (95% CI, 57.5%–68.9%).</p><p>The high-sensitivity troponin I algorithm ruled out 1205 (54.2%) with a sensitivity of 98.8% (95% CI, 96.4%–99.7%)) and ruled-in 310 (14.0%) with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive predictive value of 68.1% (95% CI, 62.6%–73.2%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The sensitivity of the European Society of Cardiology rapid assessment 0-/1-hour algorithm to rule-out AMI with high-sensitivity troponin may be insufficient for some emergency department physicians to confidently send patients home. These algorithms may prove useful to identify patients requiring expedited management. However, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive predictive value was modest for both algorithms.</p></sec>

Myxofibrosarcoma of the extremity and trunk
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Myxofibrosarcomas (MFSs) are malignant soft-tissue sarcomas characteristically   presenting as painless slowly growing masses in the extremities.   Locally infiltrative growth means that the risk of local recurrence   is high. We reviewed our experience to make recommendations about   resection st<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>gies and the role of the multidisciplinary team   in the management of these tumours.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Patients with a primary or recurrent MFS who were treated surgically   in our unit between 1997 and 2012 were included in the study. Clinical   records and imaging were reviewed. A total of 50 patients with a   median age of 68.4 years (interquartile range 61.6 to 81.8) were   included. There were 35 men; 49 underwent surgery in our unit.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The lower limb was the most common site (32/50, 64%).

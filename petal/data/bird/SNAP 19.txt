Convective oxygen transport during development in embryos of the snapping turtle <i>Chelydra serpentina</i>
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> Late stage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">snap</span></strong>ping turtle embryos present increased oxygen carrying capacity and decreased cardiac output index and heart rate, which contribute to the reported patterns of turtle whole-egg <i>êV̇V̇V̇V̇V̇</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>.</p>

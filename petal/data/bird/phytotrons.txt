Metabolic Control of Tobacco Pollination by Sugars and Invertases
<p>Pollination in flowering plants is initiated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>ation of pollen grains on stigmas followed by fast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> of pollen tubes representing highly energy-consuming processes. The symplastic isolation of pollen grains and tubes requires import of Suc available in the apoplast. We show that the functional coupling of Suc cleavage by invertases and uptake of the released hexoses by monosaccharide transporters are critical for pollination in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>). Transcript profiling, in situ hybridization, and immunolocalization of extracellular invertases and two monosaccharide transporters in vitro and in vivo support the functional coupling in supplying carbohydrates for pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>ation and tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> evidenced by spatiotemporally coordinated expression. Detection of vacuolar invertases in maternal tissues by these approaches revealed metabolic cross talk between male and female tissues and supported the requirement for carbohydrate supply in transmitting tissue during pollination. Tissue-specific expression of an invertase inhibitor and addition of the chemical invertase inhibitor miglitol strongly reduced extracellular invertase activity and impaired pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>ation. Measurements of (competitive) uptake of labeled sugars identified two import pathways for exogenously available Suc into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>ating pollen operating in parallel: direct Suc uptake and via the hexoses after cleavage by extracellular invertase. Reduction of extracellular invertase activity in pollen decreases Suc uptake and severely compromises pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>ation. We further demonstrate that Glc as sole carbon source is sufficient for pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>ation, whereas Suc is supporting tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>, revealing an important regulatory role of both the invertase substrate and products contributing to a potential metabolic and signaling-based multilayer regulation of pollination by carbohydrates.</p>

Ethylene Receptors Signal via a Noncanonical Pathway to Regulate Abscisic Acid Responses
<p>Ethylene is a gaseous plant hormone perceived by a family of receptors in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) including ETHYLENE RESPONSE1 (ETR1) and ETR2. Previously we showed that <i>etr1</i>-<i>6</i> loss-of-function plants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>ate better and <i>etr2</i>-<i>3</i> loss-of-function plants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>ate worse than wild-type under NaCl stress and in response to abscisic acid (ABA). In this study, we expanded these results by showing that ETR1 and ETR2 have contrasting roles in the control of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>ation under a variety of inhibitory conditions for seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>ation such as treatment with KCl, CuSO<sub>4</sub>, ZnSO<sub>4</sub>, and ethanol. Pharmacological and molecular biology results support a model where ETR1 and ETR2 are indirectly affecting the expression of genes encoding ABA signaling proteins to affect ABA sensitivity. The receiver domain of ETR1 is involved in this function in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>ation under these conditions and controlling the expression of genes encoding ABA signaling proteins. Epistasis analysis demonstrated that these contrasting roles of ETR1 and ETR2 do not require the canonical ethylene signaling pathway. To explore the importance of receptor-protein interactions, we conducted yeast two-hybrid screens using the cytosolic domains of ETR1 and ETR2 as bait. Unique interacting partners with either ETR1 or ETR2 were identified. We focused on three of these proteins and confirmed the interactions with receptors. Loss of these proteins led to faster <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>ation in response to ABA, showing that they are involved in ABA responses. Thus, ETR1 and ETR2 have both ethylene-dependent and -independent roles in plant cells that affect responses to ABA.</p>

Rice Morphology Determinant-Mediated Actin Filament Organization Contributes to Pollen Tube Growth
<p>For successful fertilization in angiosperms, rapid tip <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> in pollen tubes delivers the male gamete into the ovules. The actin-binding protein-mediated organization of the actin cytoskeleton within the pollen tube plays a crucial role in this polarized process. However, the mechanism underlying the polarity of the actin filament (F-actin) array and behaviors in pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that an actin-organizing protein, Rice Morphology Determinant (RMD), a type II formin from rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), controls pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> by modulating the polarity and distribution of the F-actin array. The rice <i>rmd</i> mutant exhibits abnormal pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and a decreased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>ation rate of the pollen grain in vitro and in vivo. The <i>rmd</i> pollen tubes display a disorganized F-actin pattern with disrupted apical actin density and shank longitudinal cable direction/arrangement, indicating the novel role of RMD in F-actin polarity during tip <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. Consistent with this role, RMD localizes at the tip of the rice pollen tube, which is essential for pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and polarity as well as F-actin organization. Furthermore, the direction and characteristics of the RMD-guided F-actin array positively regulate the deposition of cell wall components and the pattern and velocity of cytoplasmic streaming during rice pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. Collectively, our results suggest that RMD is essential for the spatial regulation of pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> via modulating F-actin organization and array orientation in rice. This work provides insights into tip-focused cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and polarity.</p>

Reduction in Root Secondary Growth as a Strategy for Phosphorus Acquisition
<p>We tested the hypothesis that reduced root secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> of dicotyledonous species improves phosphorus acquisition. Functional-structural modeling in SimRoot indicates that, in common bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>), reduced root secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> reduces root metabolic costs, increases root length, improves phosphorus capture, and increases shoot biomass in low-phosphorus soil. Observations from the field and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">greenhous</span></strong>e confirm that, under phosphorus stress, resource allocation is shifted from secondary to primary root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>, genetic variation exists for this response, and reduced secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> improves phosphorus capture from low-phosphorus soil. Under low phosphorus in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">greenhous</span></strong>e mesocosms, genotypes with reduced secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> had 39% smaller root cross-sectional area, 60% less root respiration, 27% greater root length, 78% greater shoot phosphorus content, and 68% greater shoot mass than genotypes with advanced secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. In the field under low phosphorus, these genotypes had 43% smaller root cross-sectional area, 32% greater root length, 58% greater shoot phosphorus content, and 80% greater shoot mass than genotypes with advanced secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. Secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> eliminated arbuscular mycorrhizal associations as cortical tissue was destroyed. These results support the hypothesis that reduced root secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> is an adaptive response to low phosphorus availability and merits investigation as a potential breeding target.</p>

The Transcription Factor ATHB5 Affects GA-Mediated Plasticity in Hypocotyl Cell Growth during Seed Germination
<p>Gibberellic acid (GA)-mediated cell expansion initiates the seed-to-seedling transition in plants and is repressed by DELLA proteins. Using digital single-cell analysis, we identified a cellular subdomain within the midhypocotyl, whose expansion drives the final step of this developmental transition under optimal conditions. Using network inference, the transcription factor ATHB5 was identified as a genetic factor whose localized expression promotes GA-mediated expansion specifically within these cells. Both this protein and its putative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>-promoting target <i>EXPANSIN3</i> are repressed by DELLA, and coregulated at single-cell resolution during seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>ation. The cellular domains of hormone sensitivity were explored within the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) embryo by putting seeds under GA-limiting conditions and quantifying cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> responses. The middle and upper hypocotyl have a greater requirement for GA to promote cell expansion than the lower embryo axis. Under these conditions, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>ation was still completed following enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> within the radicle and lower axis. Under GA-limiting conditions, the <i>athb5</i> mutant did not show a phenotype at the level of seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>ation, but it did at a cellular level with reduced cell expansion in the hypocotyl relative to the wild type. These data reveal that the spatiotemporal cell expansion events driving this transition are not determinate, and the conditional use of GA-ATHB5-mediated hypocotyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> under optimal conditions may be used to optionally support rapid seedling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. This study demonstrates that multiple genetic and spatiotemporal cell expansion mechanisms underlie the seed to seedling transition in Arabidopsis.</p>

Stage-Specific Gene Profiling of Germinal Cells Helps Delineate the Mitosis/Meiosis Transition
<p>In flowering plants, germ lines are induced from somatic meristems within reproductive organs. Within anthers, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>al cell initials first undergo several rounds of mitotic proliferation before synchronously entering meiosis. Our understanding of the progression and the molecular basis of this mitosis to meiosis transition is still limited. Taking advantage of the correlation between anther length and premeiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>al cell development in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), we studied the transcriptome dynamics of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>al cells at three sequential stages, mitotic archesporial cells, enlarging pollen mother cells at the premeiosis interphase, and pollen mother cells at the early prophase of meiosis, using laser microdissection-based expression profiling. Our analysis showed that cells undergoing the mitosis-meiosis switch exhibit robust transcriptional changes. The three stages are distinguished by the expression of genes encoding transcription factor subsets, meiotic chromosome recombination proteins, and distinct E3 ubiquitin ligases, respectively. The transcription level of genes encoding protein turnover machinery was significantly higher in these three stages of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>al cells than in mature pollen, parenchyma cells, or seedlings. Our experimental results further indicate that many meiotic genes are not only transcribed, but also translated prior to meiosis. We suggest that the enlarging pollen mother cells stage represents a crucial turning point from mitosis to meiosis for developing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>al cells.</p>

F-Actin Mediated Focusing of Vesicles at the Cell Tip Is Essential for Polarized Growth
<p>F-actin has been shown to be essential for tip <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> in an array of plant models, including <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. One hypothesis is that diffusion can transport secretory vesicles, while actin plays a regulatory role during secretion. Alternatively, it is possible that actin-based transport is necessary to overcome vesicle transport limitations to sustain secretion. Therefore, a quantitative analysis of diffusion, secretion kinetics, and cell geometry is necessary to clarify the role of actin in polarized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis, we first show that secretory vesicles move toward and accumulate at the tip in an actin-dependent manner. We then depolymerized F-actin to decouple vesicle diffusion from actin-mediated transport and measured the diffusion coefficient and concentration of vesicles. Using these values, we constructed a theoretical diffusion-based model for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>, demonstrating that with fast-enough vesicle fusion kinetics, diffusion could support normal cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> rates. We further refined our model to explore how experimentally extrapolated vesicle fusion kinetics and the size of the secretion zone limit diffusion-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. This model predicts that diffusion-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> is dependent on the size of the region of exocytosis at the tip and that diffusion-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> would be significantly slower than normal cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. To further explore the size of the secretion zone, we used a cell wall degradation enzyme cocktail and determined that the secretion zone is smaller than 6 μm in diameter at the tip. Taken together, our results highlight the requirement for active transport in polarized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and provide important insight into vesicle secretion during tip <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>.</p>

Abscisic Acid Modulates Seed Germination via ABA INSENSITIVE5-Mediated PHOSPHATE1

The transcription of <i>PHO1</i> was obviously enhanced during seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>ation and early seedling development and repressed by exogenous ABA. The <i>pho1</i> mutants (<i>pho1-2</i>, <i>pho1-4</i>, and <i>pho1-5</i>) showed ABA-hypersensitive phenotypes, whereas the <i>PHO1</i>-overexpressing lines were ABA-insensitive during seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>ation and early seedling development. The expression of <i>PHO1</i> was repressed in the <i>ABI5</i>-overexpressing line and elevated in the <i>abi5</i> mutant, and ABI5 can bind to the <i>PHO1</i> promoter in vitro and in vivo, indicating that ABI5 directly down-regulated <i>PHO1</i> expression.

5′ to 3′ mRNA Decay Contributes to the Regulation of Arabidopsis Seed Germination by Dormancy
<p>The regulation of plant gene expression, necessary for development and adaptive responses, relies not only on RNA transcription but also on messenger RNA (mRNA) fate. To understand whether seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>ation relies on the degradation of specific subsets of mRNA, we investigated whether the 5′ to 3′ RNA decay machinery participated in the regulation of this process. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seeds of <i>exoribonuclease4</i> (<i>xrn4</i>) and <i>varicose</i> (<i>vcs</i>) mutants displayed distinct dormancy phenotypes. Transcriptome analysis <i>of xrn4-5</i> and <i>vcs-8</i> mutant seeds allowed us to identify genes that are likely to play a role in the control of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>ation. Study of 5′ untranslated region features of these transcripts revealed that specific motifs, secondary energy, and GC content could play a role in their degradation by XRN4 and VCS, and Gene Ontology clustering revealed novel actors of seed dormancy and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>ation. Several specific transcripts identified as being putative targets of XRN4 and VCS in seeds (<i>PECTIN LYASE-LIKE</i>, <i>ASPARTYL PROTEASE</i>, <i>DWD-HYPERSENSITIVE-TO-ABA3</i>, and <i>YELLOW STRIPE-LIKE5</i>) were further studied by reverse genetics, and their functional roles in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>ation process were confirmed by mutant analysis. These findings suggest that completion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>ation and its regulation by dormancy also depend on the degradation of specific subsets of mRNA.</p>

Differential radial growth patterns between beech (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i> L.) and oak (<i>Quercus robur</i> L.) on periodically waterlogged soils
<p>Climate scenarios for northern Central Europe project rising temperatures and increasing frequency and intensity of droughts but also a shift in precipitation pattern with more humid winters. This in turn may result in soil waterlogging during the following spring, leading to increasing stress for trees growing on hydric sites. The influence of waterlogging on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> of common beech and pedunculate oak has been studied intensively on seedlings under experimental conditions. However, the question remains whether results of these studies can be transferred to mature trees growing under natural conditions. To test this, we investigated general <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> patterns and climate–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> relationships in four mature stands of beech and oak growing on hydromorphic soils (Stagnosols) in northeast Germany using dendrochronological methods. Our results confirmed the expected tolerance of oak to strong water-level fluctuations. Neither extremely wet conditions during spring nor summer droughts significantly affected its radial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. Oak <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> responded positively to warmer temperatures during previous year October and March of the current year of ring formation. Contrary to our expectations, also beech showed relatively low sensitivity to periods of high soil water saturation. Instead, summer drought turned out to be the main climatic factor influencing ring width of beech even under the specific periodically wet soil conditions of our study. This became evident from general climate–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> correlations over the last century as well as from discontinuous (pointer year) analysis with summer drought being significantly correlated to the occurrence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> depressions. As ring width of the two species is affected by differing climate parameters, species-specific chronologies show no coherence in high-frequency variations even for trees growing in close proximity. We assume differences in rooting depth as the main reason for the differing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> patterns and climate correlations of the two species under study. Our results indicate that under the projected future climate scenarios, beech may suffer from increasing drought stress even on hydromorphic soils. Oak might be able to maintain a sufficient hydraulic status during summer droughts by reaching water in deeper soil strata with its root system. Wet phases with waterlogged soil conditions during spring or summer appear to have only a little direct influence on radial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> of both species.</p>

ABA Suppresses Root Hair Growth via the OBP4 Transcriptional Regulator
<p>Plants modify organ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and tune morphogenesis in response to various endogenous and environmental cues. At the cellular level, organ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> is often adjusted by alterations in cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this control remain poorly understood. In this study, we identify the DNA BINDING WITH ONE FINGER (DOF)-type transcription regulator OBF BINDING PROTEIN4 (OBP4) as a repressor of cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. Ectopic expression of <i>OBP4</i> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) inhibits cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>, resulting in severe dwarfism and the repression of genes involved in the regulation of water transport, root hair development, and stress responses. Among the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors known to control root hair <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>, OBP4 binds the <i>ROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE6-LIKE2</i> (<i>RSL2</i>) promoter to repress its expression. The accumulation of OBP4 proteins is detected in expanding root epidermal cells, and its expression level is increased by the application of abscisic acid (ABA) at concentrations sufficient to inhibit root hair <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. ABA-dependent induction of <i>OBP4</i> is associated with the reduced expression of <i>RSL2</i>. Furthermore, ectopic expression of <i>OBP4</i> or loss of <i>RSL2</i> function results in ABA-insensitive root hair <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. Taken together, our results suggest that OBP4-mediated transcriptional repression of <i>RSL2</i> contributes to the ABA-dependent inhibition of root hair <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> in Arabidopsis.</p>

Correlation between genome reduction and bacterial growth

To investigate the relationship between genome reduction and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>, a series of <i>Escherichia coli</i> strains carrying genomes reduced in a stepwise manner were used. Intensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> analyses revealed that the accumulation of multiple genomic deletions caused decreases in the exponential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> rate and the saturated cell density in a deletion-length-dependent manner as well as gradual changes in the patterns of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> dynamics, regardless of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> media. Accordingly, a perspective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> model linking genome evolution to genome engineering was proposed.

The joint influence of photoperiod and temperature during growth cessation and development of dormancy in white spruce (<i>Picea glauca</i>)
<p>Timely responses to environmental cues enable the synchronization of phenological life-history transitions essential for the health and survival of north-temperate and boreal tree species. While photoperiodic cues will remain persistent under climate change, temperature cues may vary, contributing to possible asynchrony in signals influencing developmental and physiological transitions essential to forest health. Understanding the relative contribution of photoperiod and temperature as determinants of the transition from active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> to dormancy is important for informing adaptive forest management decisions that consider future climates. Using a combination of photoperiod (long = 20 h or short = 8 h day lengths) and temperature (warm = 22 °C/16 °C and cool = 8 °C/4 °C day/night, respectively) treatments, we used microscopy, physiology and modeling to comprehensively examine hallmark traits of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>–dormancy transition—including bud formation, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> cessation, cold hardiness and gas exchange—within two provenances of white spruce [<i>Picea glauca</i> (Moench) Voss] spanning a broad latitude in Alberta, Canada. Following exposure to experimental treatments, seedlings were transferred to favorable conditions, and the depth of dormancy was assessed by determining the timing and ability of spruce seedlings to resume <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. Short photoperiods promoted bud development and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> cessation, whereas longer photoperiods extended the growing season through the induction of lammas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. In contrast, cool temperatures under both photoperiodic conditions delayed bud development. Photoperiod strongly predicted the development of cold hardiness, whereas temperature predicted photosynthetic rates associated with active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. White spruce was capable of attaining endodormancy, but its release was environmentally determined. Dormancy depth varied substantially across experimental treatments suggesting that environmental cues experienced within one season could affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> in the following season, which is particularly important for a determinate species such as white spruce. The joint influence of these environmental cues points toward the importance of including local constant photoperiod and shifting temperature cues into predictive models that consider how climate change may affect northern forests.</p>

<p>Salinity impairs seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>ation and seedling establishment. We investigated the role of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) CALMODULIN-BINDING TRANSCRIPTION ACTIVATOR 6 (CAMTA6) in salinity stress responses during early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>ation. Compared with the wild type, the <i>camta6-4</i> and <i>camta6-5</i> mutants were more tolerant to NaCl and abscisic acid (ABA) and accumulated less Na<sup>+</sup>. In contrast, 4- to 11-d-old <i>camta6</i> seedlings were more sensitive to NaCl. In <i>camta6</i>, expression of <i>HIGH-AFFINITY K<sup>+</sup> TRANSPORTER1</i> (<i>AtHKT1;1</i>), encoding an Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> transporter, was restricted to the radicles and was not enhanced by NaCl or ABA. During <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>ation, the <i>camta6 hkt1</i> double mutant was as sensitive as the wild type and <i>hkt1</i> to NaCl, suggesting that HKT1;1 is crucial for the salt tolerance of <i>camta6</i>. An ABA response element in the <i>HKT1;1</i> promoter was found to be indispensable for the enhanced expression of the gene in response to NaCl and to ABA. Transcriptome analysis of the wild type and <i>camta6-5</i> with and without salt treatment revealed 1,020 up-regulated and 1,467 down-regulated salt-responsive genes in the wild type. Among these, 638 up-regulated and 1,242 down-regulated genes were classified as CAMTA6-dependent. Expression of several known salt stress-associated genes, including <i>SALT OVERLY SENSITIVE1</i> and <i>Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> ANTIPORTER</i>, was impaired in <i>camta6</i> mutants. Bioinformatics analysis of the 5′ upstream sequences of the salt-responsive CAMTA6-dependent up-regulated genes revealed the CACGTGTC motif as the most prominent element, representing an ABA response element and a potential CAMTA-binding site.

The Spermine Synthase OsSPMS1 Regulates Seed Germination, Grain Size, and Yield
<p>Polyamines, including putrescine, spermidine, and spermine, play essential roles in a wide variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) contains four putative spermidine/spermine synthase (SPMS)-encoding genes (<i>OsSPMS1</i>, <i>OsSPMS2</i>, <i>OsSPMS3</i>, and <i>OsACAULIS5</i>), but none have been functionally characterized. In this study, we used a reverse genetic strategy to investigate the biological function of <i>OsSPMS1</i>. We generated several homozygous RNA interference (RNAi) and overexpression (OE) lines of <i>OsSPMS1</i>. Phenotypic analysis indicated that <i>OsSPMS1</i> negatively regulates seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>ation, grain size, and grain yield per plant. The ratio of spermine to spermidine was significantly lower in the RNAi lines and considerably higher in the OE lines than in the wild type, suggesting that OsSPMS1 may function as a SPMS. <i>S</i>-Adenosyl-<sc>l</sc>-methionine is a common precursor of polyamines and ethylene biosynthesis. The 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) and ethylene contents in seeds increased significantly in RNAi lines and decreased in OE lines, respectively, compared with the wild type. Additionally, the reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>ation rates and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> defects of OE lines could be rescued with ACC treatment. These data suggest that <i>OsSPMS1</i> affects ethylene synthesis and may regulate seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>ation and plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> by affecting the ACC and ethylene pathways. Most importantly, an <i>OsSPMS1</i> knockout mutant showed an increase in grain yield per plant in a high-yield variety, Suken118, suggesting that <i>OsSPMS1</i> is an important target for yield enhancement in rice.</p>

SEIPIN Proteins Mediate Lipid Droplet Biogenesis to Promote Pollen Transmission and Reduce Seed Dormancy
<p>Lipid droplets (LDs) are ubiquitous organelles in plant cells, but their physiological roles are largely unknown. To gain insight into the function of LDs in plants, we have characterized the Arabidopsis homologs of SEIPIN proteins, which are crucial factors for LD biogenesis in yeast and animals. <i>SEIPIN1</i> is expressed almost exclusively in embryos, while <i>SEIPIN2</i> and <i>SEIPIN3</i> have broader expression profiles with maximal levels in embryos and pollen, where LDs accumulate most abundantly. Genetic analysis demonstrates that all three <i>SEIPINs</i> contribute to proper LD biogenesis in embryos, whereas in pollen, only <i>SEIPIN2</i> and <i>SEIPIN3</i> play a significant role. The double <i>seipin2 seipin3</i> and triple <i>seipin</i> mutants accumulate extremely enlarged LDs in seeds and pollen, which hinders their subsequent mobilization during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>ation. Interestingly, electron microscopy analysis reveals the presence of nuclear LDs attached to type I nucleoplasmic reticulum in triple <i>seipin</i> mutant embryos, supporting that SEIPINs are essential for maintaining the correct polarity of LD budding at the nuclear envelope, restricting it to the outer membrane. In pollen, the perturbations in LD biogenesis and turnover are coupled to reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>ation in vitro and with lower fertilization efficiency in vivo. In seeds, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>ation per se is not affected in <i>seipin2 seipin3</i> and triple <i>seipin</i> mutants, but there is a striking increase in seed dormancy levels. Our findings reveal the relevance of SEIPIN-dependent LD biogenesis in pollen transmission and in adjusting the timing of seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>ation, two key adaptive traits of great importance in agriculture.</p>

A Novel Mechanism, Linked to Cell Density, Largely Controls Cell Division in <i>Synechocystis</i>
<p>Many studies have investigated the various genetic and environmental factors regulating cyanobacterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. Here, we investigated the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and metabolism of <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 under different nitrogen sources, light intensities, and CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. Cells grown on urea showed the highest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> rates. However, for all conditions tested, the daily <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> rates in batch cultures decreased steadily over time, and stationary phase was obtained with similar cell densities. Unexpectedly, metabolic and physiological analyses showed that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> rates during log phase were not controlled primarily by the availability of photoassimilates. Further physiological investigations indicated that nutrient limitation, quorum sensing, light quality, and light intensity (self-shading) were not the main factors responsible for the decrease in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> rate and the onset of the stationary phase. Moreover, cell division rates in fed-batch cultures were positively correlated with the dilution rates. Hence, not only light, CO<sub>2</sub>, and nutrients can affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> but also a cell-cell interaction. Accordingly, we propose that cell-cell interaction may be a factor responsible for the gradual decrease of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> rates in batch cultures during log phase, culminating with the onset of stationary phase.</p>

AtAIRP2 E3 Ligase Affects ABA and High-Salinity Responses by Stimulating Its ATP1/SDIRIP1 Substrate Turnover
<p>AtAIRP2 is a cytosolic RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase that positively regulates an abscisic acid (ABA) response in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Yeast two-hybrid screening using AtAIRP2 as bait identified ATP1 (AtAIRP2 Target Protein1) as a substrate of AtAIRP2. ATP1 was found to be identical to SDIRIP1, which was reported recently to be a negative factor in ABA signaling and a target protein of the RING E3 ligase SDIR1. Accordingly, ATP1 was renamed ATP1/SDIRIP1. A specific interaction between AtAIRP2 and ATP1/SDIRIP1 and ubiquitination of ATP1/SDIRIP1 by AtAIRP2 were demonstrated in vitro and in planta. The turnover of ATP1/SDIRIP1 was regulated by AtAIRP2 in cell-free degradation and protoplast cotransfection assays. The ABA-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>ation assay of <i>35S</i>:<i>ATP1/SDIRIP1-RNAi/atairp2</i> double mutant progeny revealed that ATP1/SDIRIP1 acts downstream of AtAIRP2. AtAIRP2 and SDIR1 reciprocally complemented the ABA- and salt-insensitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>ation phenotypes of <i>sdir1</i> and <i>atairp2</i> mutants, respectively, indicating their combinatory roles in seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>ation. Subcellular localization and bimolecular fluorescence complementation experiments in the presence of MG132, a 26S proteasome inhibitor, showed that AtAIRP2 and ATP1/SDIRIP1 were colocalized to the cytosolic spherical body, which lies in close proximity to the nucleus, in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>) leaf cells. The 26S proteasome subunits RPN12a and RPT1 and the molecular chaperones HSP70 and HSP101 were colocalized to these discrete punctae-like structures. These results raised the possibility that AtAIRP2 and ATP1/SDIRIP1 interact in the cytosolic spherical compartment. Collectively, our data suggest that the down-regulation of ATP1/SDIRIP1 by AtAIRP2 and SDIR1 RING E3 ubiquitin ligases is critical for ABA and high-salinity responses during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>ation in Arabidopsis.</p>

Metal Tolerance Protein 8 Mediates Manganese Homeostasis and Iron Reallocation during Seed Development and Germination
<p>Metal accumulation in seeds is a prerequisite for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>ation and establishment of plants but also for micronutrient delivery to humans. To investigate metal transport processes and their interactions in seeds, we focused on METAL TOLERANCE PROTEIN8 (MTP8), a tonoplast transporter of the manganese (Mn) subclade of cation diffusion facilitators, which in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) is expressed in embryos of seeds. The x-ray fluorescence imaging showed that expression of MTP8 was responsible for Mn localization in subepidermal cells on the abaxial side of the cotyledons and in cortical cells of the hypocotyl. Accordingly, under low Mn availability, MTP8 increased seed stores of Mn, required for efficient seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>ation. In mutant embryos lacking expression of <i>VACUOLAR IRON TRANSPORTER1</i> (<i>VIT1</i>), MTP8 built up iron (Fe) hotspots in <i>MTP8</i>-expressing cells types, suggesting that MTP8 transports Fe in addition to Mn. In <i>mtp8 vit1</i> double mutant seeds, Mn and Fe were distributed in all cell types of the embryo. An Fe transport function of MTP8 was confirmed by its ability to complement Fe hypersensitivity of a yeast mutant defective in vacuolar Fe transport. Imbibing <i>mtp8-1</i> mutant seeds in the presence of Mn or subjecting seeds to wet-dry cycles showed that MTP8 conferred Mn tolerance. During <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>ation, MTP8 promoted reallocation of Fe from the vasculature. These results indicate that cell type-specific accumulation of Mn and Fe in seeds depends on MTP8 and that this transporter plays an important role in the generation of seed metal stores as well as for metal homeostasis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>ation efficiency under challenging environmental conditions.</p>

Jasmonic Acid Enhances Al-Induced Root Growth Inhibition<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>Phytohormones such as ethylene and auxin are involved in the regulation of the aluminum (Al)-induced root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> inhibition. Although jasmonate (JA) has been reported to play a crucial role in the regulation of root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and development in response to environmental stresses through interplay with ethylene and auxin, its role in the regulation of root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> response to Al stress is not yet known. In an attempt to elucidate the role of JA, we found that exogenous application of JA enhanced the Al-induced root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> inhibition. Furthermore, phenotype analysis with mutants defective in either JA biosynthesis or signaling suggests that JA is involved in the regulation of Al-induced root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> inhibition. The expression of the JA receptor CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 (COI1) and the key JA signaling regulator MYC2 was up-regulated in response to Al stress in the root tips. This process together with COI1-mediated Al-induced root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> inhibition under Al stress was controlled by ethylene but not auxin. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that many responsive genes under Al stress were regulated by JA signaling. The differential responsive of microtubule organization-related genes between the wild-type and <i>coi1-2</i> mutant is consistent with the changed depolymerization of cortical microtubules in <i>coi1</i> under Al stress. In addition, ALMT-mediated malate exudation and thus Al exclusion from roots in response to Al stress was also regulated by COI1-mediated JA signaling. Together, this study suggests that root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> inhibition is regulated by COI1-mediated JA signaling independent from auxin signaling and provides novel insights into the phytohormone-mediated root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> inhibition in response to Al stress.</p>

Isoprene Acts as a Signaling Molecule in Gene Networks Important for Stress Responses and Plant Growth
<p>Isoprene synthase converts dimethylallyl diphosphate to isoprene and appears to be necessary and sufficient to allow plants to emit isoprene at significant rates. Isoprene can protect plants from abiotic stress but is not produced naturally by all plants; for example, Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) do not produce isoprene. It is typically present at very low concentrations, suggesting a role as a signaling molecule; however, its exact physiological role and mechanism of action are not fully understood. We transformed Arabidopsis with a <i>Eucalyptus globulus isoprene synthase</i>. The regulatory mechanisms of photosynthesis and isoprene emission were similar to those of native emitters, indicating that regulation of isoprene emission is not specific to isoprene-emitting species. Leaf chlorophyll and carotenoid contents were enhanced by isoprene, which also had a marked positive effect on hypocotyl, cotyledon, leaf, and inflorescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> in Arabidopsis. By contrast, leaf and stem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> was reduced in tobacco engineered to emit isoprene. Expression of genes belonging to signaling networks or associated with specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> regulators (e.g. gibberellic acid that promotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and jasmonic acid that promotes defense) and genes that lead to stress tolerance was altered by isoprene emission. Isoprene likely executes its effects on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and stress tolerance through direct regulation of gene expression. Enhancement of jasmonic acid-mediated defense signaling by isoprene may trigger a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>-defense tradeoff leading to variations in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> response. Our data support a role for isoprene as a signaling molecule.</p>

The ADAPTOR PROTEIN-3 Complex Mediates Pollen Tube Growth by Coordinating Vacuolar Targeting and Organization
<p>Pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> is an essential step for successful plant reproduction. Vacuolar trafficking and dynamic organization are important for pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>; however, the key proteins involved in these processes are not well understood. Here, we report that the ADAPTOR PROTEIN-3 (AP-3) complex and its tonoplast cargo PROTEIN S-ACYL TRANSFERASE10 (PAT10) are critical for pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). AP-3 is a heterotetrameric protein complex consisting of four subunits, δ, β, µ, and σ. AP-3 regulates tonoplast targeting of several cargoes, such as PAT10. We show that functional loss of any of the four AP-3 subunits reduces plant fertility. In <i>ap-3</i> mutants, pollen development was normal but pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> was compromised, leading to reduced male transmission. Functional loss of <i>PAT10</i> caused a similar reduction in pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>, suggesting that the tonoplast association of PAT10 mediated by AP-3 is crucial for this process. Indeed, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> gradient during pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> was reduced significantly due to <i>AP-3</i> loss of function, consistent with the abnormal targeting of CALCINUERIN B-LIKE2 (CBL2) and CBL3, whose tonoplast association depends on PAT10. Furthermore, we show that the pollen tubes of <i>ap-3</i> mutants have vacuoles with simplified tubules and bulbous structures, indicating that AP-3 affects vacuolar organization. Our results demonstrate a role for AP-3 in plant reproduction and provide insights into the role of vacuoles in polarized cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>.</p>

Pollen-Expressed Leucine-Rich Repeat Extensins Are Essential for Pollen Germination and Growth
<p>During pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>, the walls of the tube provide the mechanical strength resisting turgor pressure to protect two sperm cells. Cell wall proteins may play an important role in this process. Pollen tube cell wall proteins known as leucine-rich repeat extensins (LRXs) harbor a leucine-rich repeat domain and an extensin domain. In this study, the functions of four pollen-expressed LRXs, LRX8, LRX9, LRX10, and LRX11 (LRX8–11), were characterized in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). <i>LRX8–11</i> displayed a consistent expression pattern in mature pollen grains and pollen tubes. In a phenotypic analysis of four single mutants, six double mutants, four triple mutants, and a quadruple mutant, the triple and quadruple mutant plants displayed markedly reduced seed set and decreased male transmission efficiency accompanied by compromised pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>ation and pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. GFP-fused LRX8, LRX10, and LRX11 were found to be localized to pollen tube cell walls. An immunohistochemical analysis of pollen tube cell wall polysaccharides showed an increase in the amount of rhamnogalacturonan I in the subapical walls of pollen tubes of the <i>lrx9 lrx10 lrx11</i> and <i>lrx8 lrx9 lrx11</i> mutants and a decrease in the content of fucosylated xyloglucans in <i>lrx8 lrx9 lrx11</i> compared with wild-type plants. Moreover, the callose content in the apical walls of pollen tubes increased in the <i>lrx8 lrx9 lrx11</i> mutant. In conclusion, we propose that LRX8–11 function synergistically to maintain pollen tube cell wall integrity; thus, they play critical roles in pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>ation and pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>.</p>

Control of Adventitious Root Architecture in Rice by Darkness, Light, and Gravity
<p>Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) is a semiaquatic plant that is well adapted to partial flooding. Rice stems develop adventitious root (AR) primordia at each node that slowly mature but emerge only when the plant gets flooded, leading to the formation of a whole new secondary root system upon flooding. AR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> is induced by ethylene that accumulates in submerged plant tissues due to its lowered diffusion rate in water. Here, we report that the architecture of the secondary root system in flooded rice plants is controlled not only by altered gas diffusion but also by gravity and light. While ethylene promotes the emergence and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> of ARs, gravity and light determine their gravitropic setpoint angle (i.e. the deviation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> direction relative to vertical). ARs grow upward at about 120° in the dark and downward at 54° in the light. The upward <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> direction is conserved in <i>indica</i> and <i>japonica</i> rice varieties, suggestive of a conserved trait in rice. Experiments with a klinostat and with inverted stem orientation revealed that gravity promotes upward <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> by about 10°. Red, far-red, and blue light lead to negative phototropism in a dose-dependent manner, with blue light being most effective, indicating that phytochrome and blue light signaling control AR system architecture. The <i>cpt1</i> (<i>coleoptile phototropism1</i>) mutant, which lacks one of the phototropin-interacting CPT proteins, shows reduced sensitivity to blue light. Hence, the gravitropic setpoint angle of rice ARs is controlled by genetic and environmental factors that likely balance the need for oxygen supply (upward <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>) with avoidance of root desiccation (downward <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>).</p>

UV-B Inhibits Leaf Growth through Changes in Growth Regulating Factors and Gibberellin Levels
<p>Ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation affects leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> in a wide range of species.

We conducted kinematic analyses of cell division and expansion to understand the impact of UV-B radiation on these cellular processes. Our results demonstrate that the decrease in leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> in UV-B-irradiated leaves is a consequence of a reduction in cell production and a shortened <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> zone (GZ).

Combined effects of defoliation and water stress on pine growth and non-structural carbohydrates
<p>Climate change is expected to increase both pest insect damage and the occurrence of severe drought. There is therefore a need to better understand the combined effects of biotic and abiotic damage on tree <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> in order to predict the multi-factorial effect of climate change on forest ecosystem productivity. Indeed, the effect of stress interactions on tree <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> is an increasingly important topic that greatly lacks experiments and data, and it is unlikely that the impact of combined stresses can be extrapolated from the outcomes of studies that focused on a single stress. We developed an original manipulative study under real field conditions where we applied artificial defoliation and induced water stress on 10-year-old (∼10 m high) maritime pine trees (<i>Pinus pinaster</i> Ait.). Tree response to combined stresses was quantitatively assessed following tree secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and carbohydrate pools. Such a design allowed us to address the crucial question of combined stresses on trees under stand conditions, sharing soil supplies with neighboring trees. Our initial hypotheses were that (i) moderate defoliation can limit the impact of water stress on tree <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> through reduced transpiration demand by a tree canopy partly defoliated and that (ii) defoliation results in reduced non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) pools, affecting tree tolerance to drought. Our results showed additive effects of defoliation and water stress on tree <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and contradict our initial hypothesis. Indeed, under stand conditions, we found that partial defoliation does not limit the impact of water stress through reduced transpiration. Our study also highlighted that, even if NSC in all organs were affected by defoliation, tree response to water stress was not triggered. We found that stem NSC were maintained or increased during the entire growing season, supporting literature-based hypotheses such as an active maintenance of the hydraulic system or another limiting resource for tree <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> under defoliation. We also observed a significant decrease in root carbohydrates, which suggests a shift in the root carbon balance under defoliation. The decrease in carbohydrate supply under defoliation may not counterbalance the carbon use for mineral and water uptakes or a translocation to other tissues.</p>

Organ-coordinated response of early post-germination mahogany seedlings to drought
<p>Water deficit tolerance during post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>ation stages is critical for seedling recruitment. In this work, we studied the effect of water deficit on morphological and biochemical responses in different organs of newly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>ated mahogany (<i>Swietenia macrophylla</i> King) seedlings, a woody species that occurs in the Amazon rainforest. The root : shoot ratio increased under water deficit. The leaf number and water potential were not altered, although reductions in leaf area and stomatal conductance were observed. Osmotic potential became more negative in leaves of seedlings under severe stress. Water deficit increased fructose, glucose, sucrose and myo-inositol levels in leaves. Stems accumulated fructose, glucose and <sc>l</sc>-proline. Nitric oxide (NO) levels increased in the vascular cylinder of roots under severe stress while superoxide anion levels decreased due to augmented superoxide dismutase activity in this organ. Water deficit induced glutathione reductase activity in both roots and stems. Upon moderate or severe stress, catalase activity decreased in leaves and remained unaffected in the other seedling organs, allowing for an increase of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) levels in leaves. Overall, the increase of signaling molecules in distinct organs—NO in roots, <sc>l</sc>-proline in stems and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and myo-inositol in leaves—contributed to the response of mahogany seedlings to water deficit by triggering biochemical processes that resulted in the attenuation of oxidative stress and the establishment of osmotic adjustment. Therefore, this body of evidence reveals that the development of newly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>ated mahogany seedlings may occur in both natural habitats and crop fields even when water availability is greatly limited.</p>

Redemption for self-reactive antibodies
<p>Immunity to pathogens and tolerance to self are cardinal features of immune systems. Immunological specificity is encoded by receptors expressed on the surface of lymphocytes that are generated through random assembly of variable, diversity, and joining (VDJ) gene segments during B and T lymphocyte development. In addition, B lymphocytes further diversify this initial repertoire through somatic hypermutation of antibody genes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>al centers (transient structures that form in lymphoid organs in which high-affinity antibodies arise). On page 223 of this issue, Burnett <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) devise a strategy to track the fate of self-reactive B cells in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>al centers elicited by a foreign antigen that structurally mimics a self-antigen (antigen mimicry). The authors provide evidence that hypermutation of antibody genes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>al centers can repair self-reactive antibodies. These results have implications for how broadly neutralizing antibodies to HIV-1 may be formed.</p>

Arabidopsis <i>VAC14</i> Is Critical for Pollen Development through Mediating Vacuolar Organization
<p>Pollen viability depends on dynamic vacuolar changes during pollen development involving increases and decreases of vacuolar volume through water and osmolite accumulation and vacuolar fission. Mutations in <i>FAB1A</i> to <i>FAB1D</i>, the genes encoding phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate [PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>]-converting kinases, are male gametophyte lethal in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) due to defective vacuolar fission after pollen mitosis I, suggesting a key role of the phospholipid in dynamic vacuolar organization. However, other genetic components that regulate the production of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> and its involvement in pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>ation and tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> are unknown. Here, we identified and characterized Arabidopsis VAC14, a homolog of the yeast and metazoan VAC14s that are crucial for the production of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>. <i>VAC14</i> is constitutively expressed and highly present in developing pollen. Loss of function of <i>VAC14</i> was male gametophyte lethal due to defective pollen development. Ultrastructural studies showed that vacuolar fission after pollen mitosis I was compromised in <i>vac14</i> mutant microspores, which led to pollen abortion. We further showed that inhibiting the production of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> or exogenous application of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> mimicked or rescued the pollen developmental defect of the <i>vac14</i> mutant, respectively. Genetic interference and pharmacological approaches suggested a role of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> in pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>ation and tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>.

Vacuolar Iron Stores Gated by NRAMP3 and NRAMP4 Are the Primary Source of Iron in Germinating Seeds
<p>During seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>ation, iron (Fe) stored in vacuoles is exported by the redundant NRAMP3 and NRAMP4 transporter proteins. A double <i>nramp3 nramp4</i> mutant is unable to mobilize Fe stores and does not develop in the absence of external Fe. We used RNA sequencing to compare gene expression in <i>nramp3 nramp4</i> and wild type during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>ation and early seedling development. Even though sufficient Fe was supplied, the Fe-responsive transcription factors <i>bHLH38</i>, <i>39</i>, <i>100</i>, and <i>101</i> and their downstream targets <i>FRO2</i> and <i>IRT1</i> mediating Fe uptake were strongly upregulated in the <i>nramp3 nramp4</i> mutant. Activation of the Fe deficiency response was confirmed by increased ferric chelate reductase activity in the mutant. At early stages, genes important for chloroplast redox control (<i>FSD1</i> and <i>SAPX</i>), Fe homeostasis (<i>FER1</i> and <i>SUFB</i>), and chlorophyll metabolism (<i>HEMA1</i> and <i>NYC1</i>) were downregulated, indicating limited Fe availability in plastids. In contrast, expression of <i>FRO3</i>, encoding a ferric reductase involved in Fe import into the mitochondria, was maintained, and Fe-dependent enzymes in the mitochondria were unaffected in <i>nramp3 nramp4</i>. Together, these data show that a failure to mobilize Fe stores during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>ation triggered Fe deficiency responses and strongly affected plastids, but not mitochondria.</p>

RAPTOR Controls Developmental Growth Transitions by Altering the Hormonal and Metabolic Balance
<p>Vegetative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> requires the systemic coordination of numerous cellular processes, which are controlled by regulatory proteins that monitor extracellular and intracellular cues and translate them into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> decisions. In eukaryotes, one of the central factors regulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> is the serine/threonine protein kinase Target of Rapamycin (TOR), which forms complexes with regulatory proteins. To understand the function of one such regulatory protein, Regulatory-Associated Protein of TOR 1B (RAPTOR1B), in plants, we analyzed the effect of <i>raptor1b</i> mutations on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and physiology in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) by detailed phenotyping, metabolomic, lipidomic, and proteomic analyses. Mutation of <i>RAPTOR1B</i> resulted in a strong reduction of TOR kinase activity, leading to massive changes in central carbon and nitrogen metabolism, accumulation of excess starch, and induction of autophagy. These shifts led to a significant reduction of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> that occurred nonlinearly during developmental stage transitions. This phenotype was accompanied by changes in cell morphology and tissue anatomy. In contrast to previous studies in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), we found that the Arabidopsis <i>raptor1b</i> mutation did not affect chloroplast development or photosynthetic electron transport efficiency; however, it resulted in decreased CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate and increased stomatal conductance. The <i>raptor1b</i> mutants also had reduced abscisic acid levels. Surprisingly, abscisic acid feeding experiments resulted in partial complementation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> phenotypes, indicating the tight interaction between TOR function and hormone synthesis and signaling in plants.</p>

Auxin Efflux Carrier ZmPGP1 Mediates Root Growth Inhibition under Aluminum Stress
<p>Auxin has been shown to enhance root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> inhibition under aluminum (Al) stress in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). However, in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), auxin may play a negative role in the Al-induced inhibition of root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. In this study, we identified mutants deficient in the maize auxin efflux carrier P-glycoprotein (ZmPGP1) after ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis and used them to elucidate the contribution of ZmPGP1 to Al-induced root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> inhibition. Root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> in the <i>zmpgp1</i> mutant, which forms shortened roots and is hyposensitive to auxin, was less inhibited by Al stress than that in the inbred line B73. In the <i>zmpgp1</i> mutants, the root tips displayed higher auxin accumulation and enhanced auxin signaling under Al stress, which was also consistent with the increased expression of auxin-responsive genes. Based on the behavior of the auxin-responsive marker transgene, <i>DR5rev:RFP</i>, we concluded that Al stress reduced the level of auxin in the root tip, which contrasts with the tendency of Al stress-induced Arabidopsis plants to accumulate more auxin in their root tips. In addition, Al stress induced the expression of <i>ZmPGP1</i>. Therefore, in maize, Al stress is associated with reduced auxin accumulation in root tips, a process that is regulated by ZmPGP1 and thus causes inhibition of root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. This study provides further evidence about the role of auxin and auxin polar transport in Al-induced root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> regulation in maize.</p>

Monogalactosyldiacylglycerol Facilitates Synthesis of Photoactive Protochlorophyllide in Etioplasts
<p>Cotyledon cells of dark-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>ated angiosperms develop etioplasts that are plastids containing unique internal membranes called prolamellar bodies (PLBs). Protochlorophyllide (Pchlide), a precursor of chlorophyll, accumulates in PLBs and forms a ternary complex with NADPH and light-dependent NADPH:protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (LPOR), which allows for the rapid formation of chlorophyll after illumination while avoiding photodamage. PLBs are 3D lattice structures formed by the lipid bilayer rich in monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG). Although MGDG was found to be required for the formation and function of the thylakoid membrane in chloroplasts in various plants, the roles of MGDG in PLB formation and etioplast development are largely unknown. To analyze the roles of MGDG in etioplast development, we suppressed <i>MGD1</i> encoding the major isoform of MGDG synthase by using a dexamethasone-inducible artificial microRNA in etiolated Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings. Strong <i>MGD1</i> suppression caused a 36% loss of MGDG in etiolated seedlings, together with a 41% decrease in total Pchlide content. The loss of MGDG perturbed etioplast membrane structures and impaired the formation of the photoactive Pchlide-LPOR-NADPH complex and its oligomerization, without affecting LPOR accumulation. The <i>MGD1</i> suppression also impaired the formation of Pchlide from protoporphyrin IX via multiple enzymatic reactions in etioplast membranes, which suggests that MGDG is required for the membrane-associated processes in the Pchlide biosynthesis pathway. Suppressing <i>MGD1</i> at several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>ation stages revealed that MGDG biosynthesis at an early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>ation stage is particularly important for Pchlide accumulation. MGDG biosynthesis may provide a lipid matrix for Pchlide biosynthesis and the formation of Pchlide-LPOR complexes as an initial step of etioplast development.</p>

Circadian, Carbon, and Light Control of Expansion Growth and Leaf Movement
<p>We used Phytotyping<sup>4D</sup> to investigate the contribution of clock and light signaling to the diurnal regulation of rosette expansion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and leaf movement in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Wild-type plants and clock mutants with a short (<i>lhycca1</i>) and long (<i>prr7prr9</i>) period were analyzed in a T24 cycle and in T-cycles that were closer to the mutants’ period. Wild types also were analyzed in various photoperiods and after transfer to free-running light or darkness. Rosette expansion and leaf movement exhibited a circadian oscillation, with superimposed transients after dawn and dusk. Diurnal responses were modified in clock mutants. <i>lhycca1</i> exhibited an inhibition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> at the end of night and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> rose earlier after dawn, whereas <i>prr7prr9</i> showed decreased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> for the first part of the light period. Some features were partly rescued by a matching T-cycle, like the inhibition in <i>lhycca1</i> at the end of the night, indicating that it is due to premature exhaustion of starch. Other features were not rescued, revealing that the clock also regulates expansion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> more directly. Expansion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> was faster at night than in the daytime, whereas published work has shown that the synthesis of cellular components is faster in the day than at nighttime. This temporal uncoupling became larger in short photoperiods and may reflect the differing dependence of expansion and biosynthesis on energy, carbon, and water. While it has been proposed that leaf expansion and movement are causally linked, we did not observe a consistent temporal relationship between expansion and leaf movement.</p>

<i>O-</i>Acyl Sugars Protect a Wild Tobacco from Both Native Fungal Pathogens and a Specialist Herbivore
<p><i>O</i>-Acyl sugars (<i>O</i>-AS) are abundant trichome-specific metabolites that function as indirect defenses against herbivores of the wild tobacco <i>Nicotiana attenuata</i>; whether they also function as generalized direct defenses against herbivores and pathogens remains unknown. We characterized natural variation in <i>O-</i>AS among 26 accessions and examined their influence on two native fungal pathogens, <i>Fusarium brachygibbosum</i> U4 and <i>Alternaria</i> sp. U10, and the specialist herbivore <i>Manduca sexta</i>. At least 15 different <i>O-</i>AS structures belonging to three classes were found in <i>N. attenuata</i> leaves. A 3-fold quantitative variation in total leaf <i>O-</i>AS was found among the natural accessions. Experiments with natural accessions and crosses between high- and low-<i>O-</i>AS accessions revealed that total <i>O-</i>AS levels were associated with resistance against herbivores and pathogens. Removing <i>O-</i>AS from the leaf surface increased <i>M. sexta</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> rate and plant fungal susceptibility. <i>O</i>-AS supplementation in artificial diets and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>ation medium reduced <i>M. sexta</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and fungal spore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>ation, respectively. Finally, silencing the expression of a putative branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase E1 β-subunit-encoding gene (<i>NaBCKDE1B</i>) in the trichomes reduced total leaf <i>O-</i>AS by 20% to 30% and increased susceptibility to <i>Fusarium</i> pathogens. We conclude that <i>O-</i>AS function as direct defenses to protect plants from attack by both native pathogenic fungi and a specialist herbivore and infer that their diversification is likely shaped by the functional interactions among these biotic stresses.</p>

EXO70C2 Is a Key Regulatory Factor for Optimal Tip Growth of Pollen
<p>The exocyst, a eukaryotic tethering complex, coregulates targeted exocytosis as an effector of small GTPases in polarized cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. In land plants, several exocyst subunits are encoded by double or triple paralogs, culminating in tens of EXO70 paralogs. Out of 23 <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> EXO70 isoforms, we analyzed seven isoforms expressed in pollen. Genetic and microscopic analyses of single mutants in <i>EXO70A2</i>, <i>EXO70C1</i>, <i>EXO70C2</i>, <i>EXO70F1</i>, <i>EXO70H3</i>, <i>EXO70H5</i>, and <i>EXO70H6</i> genes revealed that only a loss-of-function <i>EXO70C2</i> allele resulted in a significant male-specific transmission defect (segregation 40%:51%:9%) due to aberrant pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. Mutant pollen tubes grown in vitro exhibited an enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> rate and a decreased thickness of the tip cell wall, causing tip bursts. However, <i>exo70C2</i> pollen tubes could frequently recover and restart their speedy elongation, resulting in a repetitive stop-and-go <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> dynamics. A pollen-specific depletion of the closest paralog, <i>EXO70C1</i>, using artificial microRNA in the <i>exo70C2</i> mutant background, resulted in a complete pollen-specific transmission defect, suggesting redundant functions of EXO70C1 and EXO70C2. Both EXO70C1 and EXO70C2, GFP tagged and expressed under the control of their native promoters, localized in the cytoplasm of pollen grains, pollen tubes, and also root trichoblast cells. The expression of EXO70C2-GFP complemented the aberrant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> of <i>exo70C2</i> pollen tubes. The absent EXO70C2 interactions with core exocyst subunits in the yeast two-hybrid assay, cytoplasmic localization, and genetic effect suggest an unconventional EXO70 function possibly as a regulator of exocytosis outside the exocyst complex. In conclusion, EXO70C2 is a novel factor contributing to the regulation of optimal tip <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> of Arabidopsis pollen tubes.</p>

The Microtubule-Associated Protein MAP18 Affects ROP2 GTPase Activity during Root Hair Growth
<p>Establishment and maintenance of the polar site are important for root hair tip <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. We previously reported that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN18 (MAP18) functions in controlling the direction of pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and root hair elongation. Additionally, the Rop GTPase ROP2 was reported as a positive regulator of both root hair initiation and tip <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> in Arabidopsis. Both loss of function of <i>ROP2</i> and knockdown of <i>MAP18</i> lead to a decrease in root hair length, whereas overexpression of either <i>MAP18</i> or <i>ROP2</i> causes multiple tips or a branching hair phenotype. However, it is unclear whether MAP18 and ROP2 coordinately regulate root hair <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. In this study, we demonstrate that MAP18 and ROP2 interact genetically and functionally. MAP18 interacts physically with ROP2 in vitro and in vivo and preferentially binds to the inactive form of the ROP2 protein. MAP18 promotes ROP2 activity during root hair tip <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. Further investigation revealed that MAP18 competes with RhoGTPase GDP DISSOCIATION INHIBITOR1/SUPERCENTIPEDE1 for binding to ROP2, in turn affecting the localization of active ROP2 in the plasma membrane of the root hair tip. These results reveal a novel function of MAP18 in the regulation of ROP2 activation during root hair <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>.</p>

Constitutive Expression of Arabidopsis <i>SMALL AUXIN UP RNA19</i> (<i>SAUR19</i>) in Tomato Confers Auxin-Independent Hypocotyl Elongation<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The plant hormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA or auxin) mediates the elongation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> of shoot tissues by promoting cell expansion. According to the acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> theory proposed in the 1970s, auxin activates plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases (PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases) to facilitate cell expansion by both loosening the cell wall through acidification and promoting solute uptake. Mechanistically, however, this process is poorly understood. Recent findings in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) have demonstrated that auxin-induced <i>SMALL AUXIN UP RNA</i> (<i>SAUR</i>) genes promote elongation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and play a key role in PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activation by inhibiting PP2C.D family protein phosphatases. Here, we extend these findings by demonstrating that SAUR proteins also inhibit tomato PP2C.D family phosphatases and that AtSAUR19 overexpression in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) confers the same suite of phenotypes as previously reported for Arabidopsis. Furthermore, we employ a custom image-based method for measuring hypocotyl segment elongation with high resolution and a method for measuring cell wall mechanical properties, to add mechanistic details to the emerging description of auxin-mediated cell expansion. We find that constitutive expression of GFP-AtSAUR19 bypasses the normal requirement of auxin for elongation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> by increasing the mechanical extensibility of excised hypocotyl segments. In contrast, hypocotyl segments overexpressing a PP2C.D phosphatase are specifically impaired in auxin-mediated elongation. The time courses of auxin-induced <i>SAUR</i> expression and auxin-dependent elongation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> were closely correlated. These findings indicate that induction of <i>SAUR</i> expression is sufficient to elicit auxin-mediated expansion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> by activating PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases to facilitate apoplast acidification and mechanical wall loosening.</p>

Previous studies have independently uncovered key roles of the LOW PHOSPHATE RESPONSE1 (LPR1) ferroxidase, the tonoplast-localized ALUMINUM SENSITIVE3 (ALS3)/SENSITIVE TO ALUMINUM RHIZOTOXICITY1 (STAR1) transporter complex, and the SENSITIVE TO PROTON RHIZOTOXICITY1 (STOP1; a transcription factor)-ALUMINUM-ACTIVATED MALATE TRANSPORTER1 (ALMT1; a malate transporter) regulatory module in mediating this response by controlling iron (Fe) homeostasis in roots, but how these three components interact to regulate PR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> under Pi deficiency remains unknown. Here, we dissected genetic relationships among these three key components and found that (1) STOP1, ALMT1, and LPR1 act downstream of ALS3/STAR1 in controlling PR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> under Pi deficiency; (2) ALS3/STAR1 inhibits the STOP1-ALMT1 pathway by repressing STOP1 protein accumulation in the nucleus; and (3) STOP1-ALMT1 and LPR1 control PR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> under Pi deficiency in an interdependent manner involving the promotion of malate-dependent Fe accumulation in roots. Furthermore, this malate-mediated Fe accumulation depends on external Pi availability. We also performed a detailed analysis of the dynamic changes in the tissue-specific Fe accumulation patterns in the root tips of plants exposed to Pi deficiency. The results indicate that the degree of inhibition of PR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> induced by Pi deficiency is not linked to the level of Fe accumulated in the root apical meristem or the elongation zone. Our work provides insights into the molecular mechanism that regulates the root developmental response to Pi deficiency.</p>

SIAMESE-RELATED1 Is Regulated Posttranslationally and Participates in Repression of Leaf Growth under Moderate Drought
<p>The plant cell cycle is tightly regulated by factors that integrate endogenous cues and environmental signals to adapt plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> to changing conditions. Under drought, cell division in young leaves is blocked by an active mechanism, reducing the evaporative surface and conserving energy resources. The molecular function of cyclin-dependent kinase-inhibitory proteins (CKIs) in regulating the cell cycle has already been well studied, but little is known about their involvement in cell cycle regulation under adverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> conditions. In this study, we show that the transcript of the CKI gene <i>SIAMESE-RELATED1</i> (<i>SMR1</i>) is quickly induced under moderate drought in young Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves. Functional characterization further revealed that SMR1 inhibits cell division and affects meristem activity, thereby restricting the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> of leaves and roots. Moreover, we demonstrate that SMR1 is a short-lived protein that is degraded by the 26S proteasome after being ubiquitinated by a Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase. Consequently, overexpression of a more stable variant of the SMR1 protein leads to a much stronger phenotype than overexpression of the native SMR1. Under moderate drought, both the <i>SMR1</i> transcript and SMR1 protein accumulate. Despite this induction, <i>smr1</i> mutants do not show overall tolerance to drought stress but do show less <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> inhibition of young leaves under drought. Surprisingly, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>-repressive hormone ethylene promotes <i>SMR1</i> induction, but the classical drought hormone abscisic acid does not.</p>

LRX Proteins Play a Crucial Role in Pollen Grain and Pollen Tube Cell Wall Development<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Leu-rich repeat extensins (LRXs) are chimeric proteins containing an N-terminal Leu-rich repeat (LRR) and a C-terminal extensin domain. LRXs are involved in cell wall formation in vegetative tissues and required for plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. However, the nature of their role in these cellular processes remains to be elucidated. Here, we used a combination of molecular techniques, light microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy to characterize mutants of pollen-expressed <i>LRXs</i> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis</i> <i>thaliana</i>). Mutations in multiple pollen-expressed <i>lrx</i> genes cause severe defects in pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong></span></strong>ation and pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>, resulting in a reduced seed set. Physiological experiments demonstrate that manipulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> availability partially suppresses the pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> defects, suggesting that LRX proteins influence Ca<sup>2+</sup>-related processes. Furthermore, we show that LRX protein localizes to the cell wall, and its LRR-domain (which likely mediates protein-protein interactions) is associated with the plasma membrane. Mechanical analyses by cellular force microscopy and finite element method-based modeling revealed significant changes in the material properties of the cell wall and the fine-tuning of cellular biophysical parameters in the mutants compared to the wild type. The results indicate that LRX proteins might play a role in cell wall-plasma membrane communication, influencing cell wall formation and cellular mechanics.</p>

A Model of Leaf Coordination to Scale-Up Leaf Expansion from the Organ to the Canopy
<p>Process-based crop <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> models are popular tools with which to analyze and understand the impact of crop management, genotype-by-environment interactions, or climate change. The ability to predict leaf area development is critical to predict crop <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>, particularly under conditions of limited resources. Here, we aimed at deciphering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> coordination rules between wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) plant organs (i.e. between leaves within a stem, between laminae and sheaths, and between the mainstem and axillary tillers) to model the dynamics of canopy development. We found a unique relationship between laminae area and leaf rank for the mainstem and its tillers, which was robust across a range of sowing dates and plant densities. Robust relationships between laminae and sheath areas also were found, highlighting the tight control of organ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> within and between phytomers. These relationships identified at the phytomer scale were used to develop a simulation model of leaf area dynamics at the canopy level that was integrated in the wheat model SiriusQuality. The model was then evaluated using several independent experiments. The model accurately predicts leaf area dynamics under different scenarios of nitrogen and water limitations. It accounted for 85%, 64%, and 73% of the variability of the surface area of leaf cohorts, total leaf area index, and total green area index, respectively. The process-based model of the dynamics of leaf area described here is a key element to quantify the value of candidate traits for use in plant breeding and to project the impact of climate change on wheat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>.</p>

Clathrin Heavy Chain Subunits Coordinate Endo- and Exocytic Traffic and Affect Stomatal Movement
<p>The current model for vesicular traffic to and from the plasma membrane is accepted, but the molecular requirements for this coordination are not well defined. We have identified the <i>hot ABA-deficiency suppressor1</i> mutant, which has a stomatal function defect, as a <i>clathrin heavy chain1</i> (<i>CHC1</i>) mutant allele and show that it has a decreased rate of endocytosis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> defects that are shared with other <i>chc1</i> mutant alleles. We used <i>chc1</i> alleles and the related <i>chc2</i> mutant as tools to investigate the effects that clathrin defects have on secretion pathways and plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. We show that secretion and endocytosis at the plasma membrane are sensitive to CHC1 and CHC2 function in seedling roots and that <i>chc</i> mutants have physiological defects in stomatal function and plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> that have not been described previously. These findings suggest that clathrin supports specific functions in multiple cell types. Stomata movement and gas exchange are altered in <i>chc</i> mutants, indicating that clathrin is important for stomatal regulation. The aberrant function of <i>chc</i> mutant stomata is consistent with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> phenotypes observed under different water and light conditions, which also are similar to those of the secretory SNARE mutant, <i>syp121</i>. The <i>syp121</i> and <i>chc</i> mutants have impaired endocytosis and exocytosis compared with the wild type, indicating a link between SYP121-dependent secretion and clathrin-dependent endocytosis at the plasma membrane. Our findings provide evidence that clathrin and SYP121 functions are important for the coordination of endocytosis and exocytosis and have an impact on stomatal function, gas exchange, and vegetative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>).</p>

Root Cell-Specific Regulators of Phosphate-Dependent Growth
<p>Cellular specialization in abiotic stress responses is an important regulatory feature driving plant acclimation. Our in silico approach of iterative coexpression, interaction, and enrichment analyses predicted root cell-specific regulators of phosphate starvation response networks in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). This included three uncharacterized genes termed Phosphate starvation-induced gene interacting Root Cell Enriched (<i>PRCE1</i>, <i>PRCE2</i>, and <i>PRCE3</i>). Root cell-specific enrichment of 12 candidates was confirmed in promoter-GFP lines. T-DNA insertion lines of 11 genes showed changes in phosphate status and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> responses to phosphate availability compared with the wild type. Some mutants (<i>cbl1</i>, <i>cipk2</i>, <i>prce3</i>, and <i>wdd1</i>) displayed strong biomass gain irrespective of phosphate supply, while others (<i>cipk14</i>, <i>mfs1</i>, <i>prce1</i>, <i>prce2</i>, and <i>s6k2</i>) were able to sustain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> under low phosphate supply better than the wild type. Notably, root or shoot phosphate accumulation did not strictly correlate with organ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. Mutant response patterns markedly differed from those of master regulators of phosphate homeostasis, <i>PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE1</i> (<i>PHR1</i>) and <i>PHOSPHATE2</i> (<i>PHO2</i>), demonstrating that negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> responses in the latter can be overcome when cell-specific regulators are targeted. RNA sequencing analysis highlighted the transcriptomic plasticity in these mutants and revealed PHR1-dependent and -independent regulatory circuits with gene coexpression profiles that were highly correlated to the quantified physiological traits. The results demonstrate how in silico prediction of cell-specific, stress-responsive genes uncovers key regulators and how their manipulation can have positive impacts on plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> under abiotic stress.</p>

The REVEILLE Clock Genes Inhibit Growth of Juvenile and Adult Plants by Control of Cell Size
<p>The circadian clock is a complex regulatory network that enhances plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and fitness in a constantly changing environment. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the clock is composed of numerous regulatory feedback loops in which <i>REVEILLE8</i> (<i>RVE8</i>) and its homologs <i>RVE4</i> and <i>RVE6</i> act in a partially redundant manner to promote clock pace. Here, we report that the remaining members of the <i>RVE8</i> clade, <i>RVE3</i> and <i>RVE5</i>, play only minor roles in the regulation of clock function. However, we find that RVE8 clade proteins have unexpected functions in the modulation of light input to the clock and the control of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> at multiple stages of development. In seedlings, these proteins repress hypocotyl elongation in a daylength- and sucrose-dependent manner. Strikingly, adult <i>rve4 6 8</i> and <i>rve3 4 5 6 8</i> mutants are much larger than wild-type plants, with both increased leaf area and biomass. This size phenotype is associated with a faster <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> rate and larger cell size and is not simply due to a delay in the transition to flowering. Gene expression and epistasis analysis reveal that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> phenotypes of <i>rve</i> mutants are due to the misregulation of <i>PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR4</i> (<i>PIF4</i>) and <i>PIF5</i> expression. Our results show that even small changes in <i>PIF</i> gene expression caused by the perturbation of clock gene function can have large effects on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> of adult plants.</p>

A Comprehensively Curated Genome-Scale Two-Cell Model for the Heterocystous Cyanobacterium <i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120
<p><i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120 is a nitrogen-fixing filamentous cyanobacterium. Under nitrogen-limiting conditions, a fraction of the vegetative cells in each filament terminally differentiate to nongrowing heterocysts. Heterocysts are metabolically and structurally specialized to enable O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive nitrogen fixation. The functionality of the filament, as an association of vegetative cells and heterocysts, is postulated to depend on metabolic exchange of electrons, carbon, and fixed nitrogen. In this study, we compile and evaluate a comprehensive curated stoichiometric model of this two-cell system, with the objective function based on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> of the filament under diazotrophic conditions. The predicted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> rate under nitrogen-replete and -deplete conditions, as well as the effect of external carbon and nitrogen sources, was thereafter verified. Furthermore, the model was utilized to comprehensively evaluate the optimality of putative metabolic exchange reactions between heterocysts and vegetative cells. The model suggested that optimal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> requires at least four exchange metabolites. Several combinations of exchange metabolites resulted in predicted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> rates that are higher than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> rates achieved by only considering exchange of metabolites previously suggested in the literature. The curated model of the metabolic network of <i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120 enhances our ability to understand the metabolic organization of multicellular cyanobacteria and provides a platform for further study and engineering of their metabolism.</p>

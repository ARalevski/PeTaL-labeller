CHLOROPLAST RIBOSOME ASSOCIATED Supports Translation under Stress and Interacts with the Ribosomal 30S Subunit
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>es, which originated from cyanobacteria, comprise a large subunit (50S) and a small subunit (30S) containing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>al RNAs (rRNAs) and various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>al proteins. Genes for many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>al proteins, as well as proteins with auxiliary roles in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>e biogenesis or functioning, reside in the nucleus. Here, we identified Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>E ASSOCIATED (CRASS), a member of the latter class of proteins, based on the tight coexpression of its mRNA with transcripts for nucleus-encoded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>al proteins. CRASS was acquired during the evolution of embryophytes and is localized to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> stroma. Loss of CRASS results in minor defects in development, photosynthetic efficiency, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> translation activity under controlled growth conditions, but these phenotypes are greatly exacerbated under stress conditions induced by the translational inhibitors lincomycin and chloramphenicol or by cold treatment. The CRASS protein comigrates with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>al particles and coimmunoprecipitates with the 16S rRNA and several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>al proteins, particularly the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>al proteins of the 30S subunit (PRPS1 and PRPS5). The association of CRASS with PRPS1 and PRPS5 is independent of rRNA and is not detectable in yeast two-hybrid experiments, implying that either CRASS interacts indirectly with PRPS1 and PRPS5 via another component of the small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>al subunit or that it recognizes structural features of the multiprotein/rRNA particle. CRASS plays a role in the biogenesis and/or stability of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>e that becomes critical under certain stressful conditions when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>al activity is compromised.</p>

Importance of Translocon Subunit Tic56 for rRNA Processing and Chloroplast Ribosome Assembly
<p>Toc159-containing complexes at the outer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> envelope membrane form stable supercomplexes with a 1-MD translocon at the inner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> envelope membrane of which Tic56 is one essential subunit. While the single mutants <i>tic56-1</i> and <i>ppi2</i> (<i>toc159</i>) have an albino phenotype and are able to grow heterotrophically, we find the double mutant to be embryo lethal. Comprehensive quantitative proteome profiling with both single mutants in combination with GeneChip analyses identified a posttranscriptional defect in the accumulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>al proteins and diminished expression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> encoded proteins. In the <i>tic56-1</i> mutant, the assembly of functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>es is furthermore hampered by a processing defect of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> 23S rRNA. Spectinomycin-treatment of wild-type plants phenocopies the molecular phenotype of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> proteome accumulation in <i>tic56-1</i> and to a smaller degree also <i>ppi2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s, suggesting that a defect in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> translation is largely responsible for the phenotype of both import mutants. Import experiments with the <i>tic56-3</i> mutant revealed no significant defect in the import of small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>al protein 16 in the absence of full-length Tic56, suggesting that the defect in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>e assembly in <i>tic56-1</i> may be independent of a function of Tic56 in protein import. Our data establish a previously unknown link between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> protein import, the processing of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> rRNAs, and the assembly of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>es and provide further knowledge on the function of the translocon components and the molecular basis for their albino phenotype.</p>

Selective Elimination of Membrane-Damaged Chloroplasts via Microautophagy
<p>Plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s constantly accumulate damage caused by visible wavelengths of light during photosynthesis. Our previous study revealed that entire photodamaged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s are subjected to vacuolar digestion through an autophagy process termed chlorophagy; however, how this process is induced and executed remained poorly understood. In this study, we monitored intracellular induction of chlorophagy in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves and found that mesophyll cells damaged by high visible light displayed abnormal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s with a swollen shape and 2.5 times the volume of normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s. In wild-type plants, the activation of chlorophagy decreased the number of swollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s. In the autophagy-deficient <i>autophagy</i> mutants, the swollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s persisted, and dysfunctional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s that had lost chlorophyll fluorescence accumulated in the cytoplasm. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> swelling and subsequent induction of chlorophagy were suppressed by the application of exogenous mannitol to increase the osmotic pressure outside <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s or by overexpression of VESICLE INDUCING PROTEIN IN PLASTID1, which maintains <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> envelope integrity. Microscopic observations of autophagy-related membranes showed that swollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s were partly surrounded by autophagosomal structures and were engulfed directly by the tonoplast, as in microautophagy. Our results indicate that an elevation in osmotic potential inside the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> due to high visible light-derived envelope damage results in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> swelling and serves as an induction factor for chlorophagy, and this process mobilizes entire <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s via tonoplast-mediated sequestering to avoid the cytosolic accumulation of dysfunctional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s.</p>

Revisiting the Algal “Chloroplast Lipid Droplet”: The Absence of an Entity That Is Unlikely to Exist
<p>The precise localization of the lipid droplets and the metabolic pathways associated with oil production are crucial to the engineering of microalgae for biofuel production. Several studies have reported detecting lipid droplets within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> of the microalga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, which accumulates considerable amounts of triacylglycerol and starch within the cell under nitrogen deprivation or high-light stress conditions. Starch undoubtedly accumulates within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>, but there have been debates on the localization of the lipid droplets, which are cytosolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organell</span></strong>es in other organisms. Although it is impossible to prove an absence, we tried to repeat experiments that previously indicated the presence of lipid droplets in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s. Here, we present microscopic results showing no evidence for the presence of lipid droplets within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> stroma, even though some lipid droplets existed in close association with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> or were largely engulfed by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s. These lipid droplets are cytosolic structures, distinct from the plastoglobules present in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> stroma. These results not only contrast with the old ideas but also point out that what were previously thought to be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> lipid droplets are likely to be embedded within <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> invaginations in association with the outer envelope of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> without intervention of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">endoplasmic reticulum</span></strong>. These findings point to the intriguing possibility of a tight metabolic flow from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> to the lipid droplet through a close association rather than direct contact of both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organell</span></strong>es.</p>

Balance between Cytosolic and Chloroplast Translation Affects Leaf Variegation
<p>The development of functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s relies on the fine coordination of expressions of both nuclear and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> genomes. We have been using the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>yellow variegated</i> (<i>var2</i>) leaf variegation mutant as a tool to dissect the regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> development. In this work, we screened for <i>var2</i> genetic enhancer modifiers termed <i>enhancer of variegation</i> (<i>evr</i>) mutants and report the characterization of the first <i>EVR</i> locus, <i>EVR1</i>. We showed that <i>EVR1</i> encodes the cytosolic 80S <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>e 40S small subunit protein RPS21B and the loss of <i>EVR1</i> causes the enhancement of <i>var2</i> leaf variegation. We further demonstrated that combined S21 activities from EVR1 and its close homolog, EVR1L1, are essential for Arabidopsis, and they act redundantly in regulating leaf development and <i>var2</i> leaf variegation. Moreover, using additional cytosolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>al protein mutants, we showed that although mutations in cytosolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>al proteins all enhance <i>var2</i> leaf variegation to varying degrees, the 40S subunit appears to have a more profound role over the 60S subunit in regulating VAR2-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> development. Comprehensive genetic analyses with <i>var2</i> suppressors that are defective in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> translation established that the enhancement of <i>var2</i> leaf variegation by cytosolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>al protein mutants is dependent on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> translation. Based on our data, we propose a model that incorporates the suppression and enhancement of <i>var2</i> leaf variegation, and hypothesize that VAR2/AtFtsH2 may be intimately involved in the balancing of cytosolic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> translation programs during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> biogenesis.</p>

Prolines in Transit Peptides Are Crucial for Efficient Preprotein Translocation into Chloroplasts
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s import many preproteins that can be classified based on their physicochemical properties. The cleavable N-terminal transit peptide (TP) of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> preproteins contains all the information required for import into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s through Toc/Tic translocons. The question of whether and how the physicochemical properties of preproteins affect TP-mediated import into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s has not been elucidated. Here, we present evidence that Pro residues in TP mediate efficient translocation through the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> envelope membranes for proteins containing transmembrane domains (TMDs) or proteins prone to aggregation. By contrast, the translocation of soluble proteins through the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> envelope membranes is less dependent on TP prolines. Proless TPs failed to mediate protein translocation into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s; instead, these mutant TPs led to protein mistargeting to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> envelope membranes or nonspecific protein aggregation during import into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s. The mistargeting of TMD-containing proteins caused by Pro-less TPs in wild-type protoplasts was mimicked by wild-type TPs in <i>hsp93-V</i> protoplasts, in which preprotein translocation is compromised. We propose that the physicochemical properties of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> proteins affect protein translocation through the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> envelope, and prolines in TP have a crucial role in the efficient translocation of TMD-containing proteins.</p>

Efficient Plastid Transformation in Arabidopsis
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> transformation is routine in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) but 100-fold less frequent in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), preventing its use in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> biology. A recent study revealed that null mutations in <i>ACC2</i>, encoding a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>-targeted acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase, cause hypersensitivity to spectinomycin. We hypothesized that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> transformation efficiency should increase in the <i>acc2</i> background, because when ACC2 is absent, fatty acid biosynthesis becomes dependent on translation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>-encoded ACC β-carboxylase subunit. We bombarded <i>ACC2</i>-defective Arabidopsis leaves with a vector carrying a selectable spectinomycin resistance (<i>aadA</i>) gene and <i>gfp</i>, encoding the green fluorescence protein GFP. Spectinomycin-resistant clones were identified as green cell clusters on a spectinomycin medium. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> transformation was confirmed by GFP accumulation from the second open reading frame of a polycistronic messenger RNA, which would not be translated in the cytoplasm. We obtained one to two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> transformation events per bombarded sample in spectinomycin-hypersensitive Slavice and Columbia <i>acc2</i> knockout backgrounds, an approximately 100-fold enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> transformation frequency. Slavice and Columbia are accessions in which plant regeneration is uncharacterized or difficult to obtain. A practical system for Arabidopsis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> transformation will be obtained by creating an <i>ACC2</i> null background in a regenerable Arabidopsis accession. The recognition that the duplicated ACCase in Arabidopsis is an impediment to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> transformation provides a rational template to implement <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> transformation in related recalcitrant crops.</p>

Specialized Plastids Trigger Tissue-Specific Signaling for Systemic Stress Response in Plants
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s comprise a complex set of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organell</span></strong>es in plants that can undergo distinctive patterns of differentiation and redifferentiation during their lifespan. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s localized to the epidermis and vascular parenchyma are distinctive in size, structural features, and functions. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s are termed “sensory” <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s, and here we show their proteome to be distinct from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s, with specialized stress-associated features. The distinctive sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> proteome in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) derives from spatiotemporal regulation of nuclear genes encoding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>-targeted proteins.

Pausing of Chloroplast Ribosomes Is Induced by Multiple Features and Is Linked to the Assembly of Photosynthetic Complexes<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Many mRNAs contain pause sites that briefly interrupt the progress of translation. Specific features that induce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>e pausing have been described; however, their individual contributions to pause-site formation, and the overall biological significance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>e pausing, remain largely unclear. We have taken advantage of the compact genome of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s to carry out a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> genome-wide survey of pause sites, as a basis for studying the impact of pausing on posttranslational processes. Based on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>al profiling of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> mRNAs, we demonstrate that a combination of factors—mRNA secondary structure, internal Shine-Dalgarno sequences, and positively charged amino acids in the nascent peptide chain—explains 95% of the major pause sites on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> mRNAs, whereas codon usage has little impact. The distribution of the pause sites is nonrandom and conforms to distinct patterns in the vicinity of sequences coding for transmembrane domains, which depend on their orientation within the membrane as well as being next to sequences coding for cofactor binding sites. We found strong indications that the mechanisms causing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>al pausing and at least some of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>es pause sites are conserved between distantly related plant species. In addition, the positions of features that cause pausing are well conserved in photoautotrophic plants, but less so in their nonphotosynthetic, parasitic relatives, implying that the synthesis and assembly of photosynthetic multiprotein complexes requires localized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>e pausing.</p>

Plant Temperature Acclimation and Growth Rely on Cytosolic Ribosome Biogenesis Factor Homologs
<p>Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) REI1-LIKE (REIL) proteins, REIL1 and REIL2, are homologs of a yeast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>e biogenesis factor that participates in late cytoplasmic 60S <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>al subunit maturation. Here, we report that the inhibited growth of the <i>reil1-1 reil2-1</i> mutant at 10°C can be rescued by the expression of amino-terminal FLUORESCENT PROTEIN (FP)-REIL fusions driven by the <i>UBIQUITIN10</i> promoter, allowing the analysis of REIL function in planta. Arabidopsis REIL1 appears to be functionally conserved, based on the cytosolic localization of FP-REIL1 and the interaction of native REIL1 with the 60S subunit in wild-type plants. In contrast to its yeast homologs, REIL1 also was present in translating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>e fractions. Systems analysis revealed that wild-type Arabidopsis remodels the cytosolic translation machinery when grown at 10°C by accumulating cytosolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>e subunits and inducing the expression of cytosolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>al RNA, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>al genes, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>e biogenesis factors, and translation initiation or elongation factors. In the <i>reil1-1 reil2-1</i> mutant, all processes associated with inhibited growth were delayed, although the plants maintained cellular integrity or acquired freezing tolerance. REIL proteins also were implicated in plant-specific processes: nonacclimated <i>reil1-1 reil2-1</i> exhibited cold-acclimation responses, including activation of the DREB/CBF regulon. In addition, acclimated <i>reil1-1 reil2-1</i> plants failed to activate <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T</i> expression in mature leaves. Therefore, in the wild type, REIL function may contribute to temperature perception by suppressing premature cold responses during growth at nonstressful temperatures. In conclusion, we suggest that Arabidopsis REIL proteins influence cold-induced plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>e remodeling and enhance the accumulation of cytosolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>e subunits after cold shift either by de novo synthesis or by recycling them from the translating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>e fraction.</p>

The Rubisco Chaperone BSD2 May Regulate Chloroplast Coverage in Maize Bundle Sheath Cells
<p>In maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), Bundle Sheath Defective2 (BSD2) plays an essential role in Rubisco biogenesis and is required for correct bundle sheath (BS) cell differentiation. Yet, BSD2 RNA and protein levels are similar in mesophyll (M) and BS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s, although Rubisco accumulates only in BS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s. This raises the possibility of additional BSD2 roles in cell development. To test this hypothesis, transgenic lines were created that overexpress and underexpress BSD2 in both BS and M cells, driven by the cell type-specific Rubisco Small Subunit (RBCS) or Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxylase (PEPC) promoters or the ubiquitin promoter. Genetic crosses showed that each of the transgenes could complement Rubisco deficiency and seedling lethality conferred by the <i>bsd2</i> mutation. This was unexpected, as RBCS-BSD2 lines lacked BSD2 in M <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s and PEPC-BSD2 lines expressed half the wild-type BSD2 level in BS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s. We conclude that BSD2 does not play a vital role in M cells and that BS BSD2 is in excess of requirements for Rubisco accumulation. BSD2 levels did affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> coverage in BS cells. In PEPC-BSD2 lines, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> coverage decreased 30% to 50%, whereas lines with increased BSD2 content exhibited a 25% increase. This suggests that BSD2 has an ancillary role in BS cells related to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> size. Gas exchange showed decreased photosynthetic rates in PEPC-BSD2 lines despite restored Rubisco function, correlating with reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> coverage and pointing to CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion changes. Conversely, increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> coverage did not result in increased Rubisco abundance or photosynthetic rates. This suggests another limitation beyond <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> volume, most likely Rubisco biogenesis and/or turnover rates.</p>

The AAA-ATPase MIDASIN 1 Functions in Ribosome Biogenesis and Is Essential for Embryo and Root Development
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>e biogenesis is an orchestrated process that relies on many assembly factors. The AAA-ATPase Midasin 1 (Mdn1) functions as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>e assembly factor in yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>), but the roles of MDN1 in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) are poorly understood. Here, we showed that the Arabidopsis null mutant of <i>MDN1</i> is embryo-lethal. Using the weak mutant <i>mdn1</i>-<i>1</i>, which maintains viability, we found that MDN1 is critical for the regular pattern of auxin maxima in the globular embryo and functions in root meristem maintenance. By detecting the subcellular distribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>e proteins, we noted that <i>mdn1</i>-<i>1</i> impairs nuclear export of the pre-60S <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>al particle. The processing of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>al precusor RNAs, including 35S, 27SB, and 20S, is also affected in this mutant. MDN1 physically interacts with PESCADILLO2 (PES2), an essential assembly factor of the 60S <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>e, and the observed mislocalization of PES2 in <i>mdn1</i>-<i>1</i> further implied that MDN1 plays an indispensable role in 60S <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>e biogenesis. Therefore, the observed hypersensitivity of <i>mdn1</i>-<i>1</i> to a eukaryotic translation inhibitor and high-sugar conditions might be associated with the defect in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>e biogenesis. Overall, this work establishes a role of Arabidopsis MDN1 in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>e biogenesis, which agrees with its roles in embryogenesis and root development.</p>

MoChlo: A Versatile, Modular Cloning Toolbox for Chloroplast Biotechnology
<p>Plant synthetic biology is a rapidly evolving field with new tools constantly emerging to drive innovation. Of particular interest is the application of synthetic biology to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> biotechnology to generate plants capable of producing new metabolites, vaccines, biofuels, and high-value chemicals. Progress made in the assembly of large DNA molecules, composing multiple transcriptional units, has significantly aided in the ability to rapidly construct novel vectors for genetic engineering. In particular, Golden Gate assembly has provided a facile molecular tool for standardized assembly of synthetic genetic elements into larger DNA constructs. In this work, a complete modular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> cloning system, MoChlo, was developed and validated for fast and flexible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> engineering in plants. A library of 128 standardized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>-specific parts (47 promoters, 38 5′ untranslated regions [5′UTRs], nine promoter:5′UTR fusions, 10 3′UTRs, 14 genes of interest, and 10 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>-specific destination vectors) were mined from the literature and modified for use in MoChlo assembly, along with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>-specific destination vectors. The strategy was validated by assembling synthetic operons of various sizes and determining the efficiency of assembly. This method was successfully used to generate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> transformation vectors containing up to seven transcriptional units in a single vector (∼10.6-kb synthetic operon). To enable researchers with limited resources to engage in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> biotechnology, and to accelerate progress in the field, the entire kit, as described, is available through Addgene at minimal cost.

ARSENATE INDUCED CHLOROSIS 1/ TRANSLOCON AT THE OUTER ENVOLOPE MEMBRANE OF CHLOROPLASTS 132 Protects Chloroplasts from Arsenic Toxicity
<p>Arsenic (As) is highly toxic to plants and detoxified primarily through complexation with phytochelatins (PCs) and other thiol compounds. To understand the mechanisms of As toxicity and detoxification beyond PCs, we isolated an arsenate-sensitive mutant of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), <i>arsenate induced chlorosis1</i> (<i>aic1</i>), in the background of the PC synthase-defective mutant <i>cadmium-sensitive1-3</i> (<i>cad1-3</i>). Under arsenate stress, <i>aic1 cad1-3</i> showed larger decreases in chlorophyll content and the number and size of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s than <i>cad1-3</i> and a severely distorted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> structure. The <i>aic1</i> single mutant also was more sensitive to arsenate than the wild type (Columbia-0). As concentrations in the roots, shoots, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s were similar between <i>aic1 cad1-3</i> and <i>cad1-3</i>. Using genome resequencing and complementation, <i>TRANSLOCON AT THE OUTER ENVOLOPE MEMBRANE OF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>132</i> (<i>TOC132</i>) was identified as the mutant gene, which encodes a translocon protein involved in the import of preproteins from the cytoplasm into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s. Proteomic analysis showed that the proteome of <i>aic1 cad1-3</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s was more affected by arsenate stress than that of <i>cad1-3</i>. A number of proteins related to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>es, photosynthesis, compound synthesis, and thioredoxin systems were less abundant in <i>aic1 cad1-3</i> than in <i>cad1-3</i> under arsenate stress. Our results indicate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s are a sensitive target of As toxicity and that AIC1/Toc132 plays an important role in protecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s from As toxicity.</p>

Establishment of Photosynthesis through Chloroplast Development Is Controlled by Two Distinct Regulatory Phases
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s develop from undifferentiated pro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s present in meristematic tissue. Thus, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> biogenesis is closely connected to leaf development, which restricts our ability to study the process of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> biogenesis per se. As a consequence, we know relatively little about the regulatory mechanisms behind the establishment of the photosynthetic reactions and how the activities of the two genomes involved are coordinated during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> development. We developed a single cell-based experimental system from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) with high temporal resolution allowing for investigations of the transition from pro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s to functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s. Using this unique cell line, we could show that the establishment of photosynthesis is dependent on a regulatory mechanism involving two distinct phases. The first phase is triggered by rapid light-induced changes in gene expression and the metabolome. The second phase is dependent on the activation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> and generates massive changes in the nuclear gene expression required for the transition to photosynthetically functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s. The second phase also is associated with a spatial transition of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s from clusters around the nucleus to the final position at the cell cortex. Thus, the establishment of photosynthesis is a two-phase process with a clear checkpoint associated with the second regulatory phase allowing coordination of the activities of the nuclear and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> genomes.</p>

Three-Dimensional Analysis of Chloroplast Structures Associated with Virus Infection
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s are multifunctional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organell</span></strong>es whose morphology is affected by environmental stresses. Although the three-dimensional (3D) architecture of thylakoid membranes has been reported previously, a 3D visualization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> under stress has not been explored. In this work, we used a positive-strand RNA ((+)RNA) virus, barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) to observe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> structural changes during infection by electron tomography. The analyses revealed remodeling of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> membranes, characterized by the clustering of outer membrane-invaginated spherules in inner membrane-derived packets. Diverse morphologies of cytoplasmic invaginations (CIs) were evident with spherules at the periphery and different sized openings connecting the CIs to the cytoplasm. Immunoelectron microscopy of these viral components verified that the aberrant membrane structures were sites for BSMV replication. The BSMV αa replication protein localized at the surface of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s and played a prominent role in eliciting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> membrane rearrangements. In sum, our results have revealed the 3D structure of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s induced by BSMV infection. These findings contribute to our understanding of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> morphological changes under stress conditions and during assembly of plant (+)RNA virus replication complexes.</p>

The DEAD-box RNA Helicase RH50 Is a 23S-4.5S rRNA Maturation Factor that Functionally Overlaps with the Plastid Signaling Factor GUN1
<p>DEAD-box RNA helicases (DBRHs) modulate RNA secondary structure, allowing RNA molecules to adopt the conformations required for interaction with their target proteins. RH50 is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>-located DBRH that colocalizes and is coexpressed with GUN1, a central factor in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>-to-nucleus signaling. When combined with mutations that impair <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> gene expression (<i>prors1</i>-<i>1</i>, <i>prpl11</i>-<i>1</i>, <i>prps1</i>-<i>1</i>, <i>prps21</i>-<i>1</i>, <i>prps17</i>-<i>1</i>, and <i>prpl24</i>-<i>1</i>), <i>rh50</i> and <i>gun1</i> mutations evoke similar patterns of epistatic effects. These observations, together with the synergistic growth phenotype of the double mutant <i>rh50</i>-<i>1 gun1</i>-<i>102</i>, suggest that RH50 and GUN1 are functionally related and that this function is associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> gene expression, in particular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>e functioning. However, <i>rh50</i>-<i>1</i> itself is not a gun mutant, although—like <i>gun1</i>-<i>102—</i>the <i>rh50</i>-<i>1</i> mutation suppresses the down-regulation of nuclear genes for photosynthesis induced by the <i>prors1</i>-<i>1</i> mutation. The RH50 protein comigrates with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>al particles, and is required for efficient translation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> proteins. RH50 binds to transcripts of the 23S-4.5S intergenic region and, in its absence, levels of the corresponding rRNA processing intermediate are strongly increased, implying that RH50 is required for the maturation of the 23S and 4.5S rRNAs. This inference is supported by the finding that loss of RH50 renders <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> protein synthesis sensitive to erythromycin and exposure to cold. Based on these results, we conclude that RH50 is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> rRNA maturation factor.</p>

Light and Plastid Signals Regulate Different Sets of Genes in the Albino Mutant Pap7-1
<p>Plants possessing dysfunctional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s due to defects in pigment biosynthesis or translation are known to repress photosynthesis-associated nuclear genes via retrograde signals from the disturbed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organell</span></strong>es toward the nucleus. These signals are thought to be essential for proper biogenesis and function of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>. Mutants lacking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>-encoded RNA polymerase-associated proteins (PAPs) display a genetic arrest in eoplast-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> transition leading to an albino phenotype in the light. Retrograde signaling in these mutants, therefore, could be expected to be similar as under conditions inducing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> dysfunction. To answer this question, we performed plastome- and genomewide array analyses in the <i>pap7</i>-<i>1</i> mutant of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). In parallel, we determined the potential overlap with light-regulated expression networks. To this end, we performed a comparative expression profiling approach using light- and dark-grown wild-type plants as relative control for the expression profiles obtained from light-grown <i>pap7</i>-<i>1</i> mutants. Our data indicate a specific impact of retrograde signals on metabolism-related genes in <i>pap7</i>-<i>1</i> mutants reflecting the starvation situation of the albino seedlings. In contrast, light regulation of PhANGs and other nuclear gene groups appears to be fully functional in this mutant, indicating that a block in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> biogenesis per se does not repress expression of them as suggested by earlier studies. Only genes for light harvesting complex proteins displayed a significant repression indicating an exclusive retrograde impact on this gene family. Our results indicate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s and arrested <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s each emit specific signals that control different target gene modules both in positive and negative manner.</p>

Chemoattractant concentration–dependent tuning of ERK signaling dynamics in migrating neutrophils
<p>The directed migration (chemotaxis) of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong>s toward the bacterial peptide <i>N</i>-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (<i>f</i>MLP) is a crucial process in immune defense against invading bacteria. While navigating through a gradient of increasing concentrations of <i>f</i>MLP, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong>-like HL-60 cells switch from exhibiting directional migration at low <i>f</i>MLP concentrations to exhibiting circuitous migration at high <i>f</i>MLP concentrations. The extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) pathway is implicated in balancing this <i>f</i>MLP concentration–dependent switch in migration modes. We investigated the role and regulation of ERK signaling through single-cell analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong> migration in response to different <i>f</i>MLP concentrations over time. We found that ERK exhibited gradated, rather than all-or-none, responses to <i>f</i>MLP concentration. Maximal ERK activation occurred in response to about 100 nM <i>f</i>MLP, and ERK inactivation was promoted by p38. Furthermore, we found that directional migration of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong>s reached a maximal extent at about 100 nM <i>f</i>MLP and that ERK, but not p38, was required for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong> migration. Thus, our data suggest that, in chemotactic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong>s responding to <i>f</i>MLP, ERK displays gradated activation and p38-dependent inhibition and that these ERK dynamics promote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong> migration.</p>

The Pentatricopeptide Repeat Protein SOT5/EMB2279 Is Required for Plastid <i>rpl2</i> and <i>trnK</i> Intron Splicing
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> biogenesis and development are highly complex processes requiring interaction between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> and nuclear genomic products. Using a high-throughput screen for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> biogenesis suppressors in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), we identified a <i>suppressor of thf1</i> (<i>sot5</i>) that displays virescent and serrated leaves. Further characterization revealed that <i>sot5</i> mutants are defective in leaf adaxial and abaxial polarity and act as enhancers of <i>asymmetric leaves2</i>. Map-based cloning identified <i>SOT5</i> as a gene previously named <i>EMB2279</i> that encodes a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>-targeted pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein with 11 PPR motifs. A G-to-A mutation in <i>sot5</i> leads to a significant decrease in splicing efficiency, generating two additional mRNA variants. As reported previously, the <i>sot5</i> null mutation is embryo lethal. SOT5 is predicted to bind to specific RNA sequences found in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> <i>rpl2</i> and <i>trnK</i> genes, and we found decreased splicing efficiency of the <i>rpl2</i> and <i>trnK</i> genes in <i>sot5</i> mutants. Together, our results reveal that the PPR protein SOT5/EMB2279 is required for intron splicing of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> <i>rpl2</i> and <i>trnK</i>, providing insights into the role of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> translation in the coupled development between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s and leaves.</p>

Chloroplast Ca<sup>2+</sup> Fluxes into and across Thylakoids Revealed by Thylakoid-Targeted Aequorin Probes
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s require a fine-tuned control of their internal Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, which is crucial for many aspects of photosynthesis and for other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>-localized processes. Increasing evidence suggests that calcium regulation within <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s also may influence Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathways in the cytosol. To investigate the involvement of thylakoids in Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis and in the modulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in vivo, we targeted the bioluminescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> reporter aequorin as a YFP fusion to the lumen and the stromal surface of thylakoids in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Thylakoid localization of aequorin-based probes in stably transformed lines was confirmed by confocal microscopy, immunogold labeling, and biochemical analyses. In resting conditions in the dark, free Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in the thylakoid lumen were maintained at about 0.5 μ<sc>m</sc>, which was a 3- to 5-fold higher concentration than in the stroma. Monitoring of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in different intra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> subcompartments (stroma, thylakoid membrane, and thylakoid lumen) revealed the occurrence of stimulus-specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, characterized by unique kinetic parameters. Oxidative and salt stresses initiated pronounced free Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes in the thylakoid lumen. Localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases also were observed on the thylakoid membrane surface, mirroring transient Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes observed for the bulk stroma, but with specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics. Moreover, evidence was obtained for dark-stimulated intrathylakoid Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes, suggesting a new scenario for light-to-dark-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluxes inside <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s. Hence, thylakoid-targeted aequorin reporters can provide new insights into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> Ca<sup>2+</sup> storage and signal transduction. These probes represent novel tools with which to investigate the role of thylakoids in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling networks within <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s and plant cells.</p>

The Plastid Genome of <i>Polytoma uvella</i> Is the Largest Known among Colorless Algae and Plants and Reflects Contrasting Evolutionary Paths to Nonphotosynthetic Lifestyles
<p>The loss of photosynthesis is frequently associated with parasitic or pathogenic lifestyles, but it also can occur in free-living, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>-bearing lineages. A common consequence of becoming nonphotosynthetic is the reduction in size and gene content of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> genome. In exceptional circumstances, it can even result in the complete loss of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> DNA (ptDNA) and its associated gene expression system, as reported recently in several lineages, including the nonphotosynthetic green algal genus <i>Polytomella</i>. Closely related to <i>Polytomella</i> is the polyphyletic genus <i>Polytoma</i>, the members of which lost photosynthesis independently of <i>Polytomella</i>. Species from both genera are free-living organisms that contain nonphotosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s, but unlike <i>Polytomella</i>, <i>Polytoma</i> members have retained a genome in their colorless <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>. Here, we present the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> genome of <i>Polytoma uvella</i>: to our knowledge, the first report of ptDNA from a nonphotosynthetic chlamydomonadalean alga. The <i>P. uvella</i> ptDNA contains 25 protein-coding genes, most of which are related to gene expression and none are connected to photosynthesis. However, despite its reduced coding capacity, the <i>P. uvella</i> ptDNA is inflated with short repeats and is tens of kilobases larger than the ptDNAs of its closest known photosynthetic relatives, <i>Chlamydomonas leiostraca</i> and <i>Chlamydomonas applanata</i>. In fact, at approximately 230 kb, the ptDNA of <i>P. uvella</i> represents the largest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> genome currently reported from a nonphotosynthetic alga or plant. Overall, the <i>P. uvella</i> and <i>Polytomella</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> genomes reveal two very different evolutionary paths following the loss of photosynthesis: expansion and complete deletion, respectively. We hypothesize that recombination-based DNA-repair mechanisms are at least partially responsible for the different evolutionary outcomes observed in such closely related nonphotosynthetic algae.</p>

Rac signal adaptation controls neutrophil mobilization from the bone marrow
<p>Mobilization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong>s from the bone marrow determines <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong> blood counts and thus is medically important. Balanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong> mobilization from the bone marrow depends on the retention-promoting chemokine CXCL12 and its receptor CXCR4 and the egression-promoting chemokine CXCL2 and its receptor CXCR2. Both pathways activate the small guanosine triphosphatase Rac, leaving the role of this signaling event in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong> retention and egression ambiguous. On the assumption that active Rac determines persistent directional cell migration, we generated a mathematical model to link chemokine-mediated Rac modulation to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong> egression time. Our computer simulation indicated that, in the bone marrow, where the retention signal predominated, egression time strictly depended on the time it took Rac to return to its basal activity (namely, adaptation). This prediction was validated in mice lacking the Rac inhibitor ArhGAP15. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong>s in these mice showed prolonged Rac adaptation and cell-autonomous retention in the bone marrow. Our model thus demonstrates that mobilization in the presence of two spatially defined opposing chemotactic cues strictly depends on inhibitors shaping the time course of signal adaptation. Furthermore, our findings might help to find new modes of intervention to treat conditions characterized by excessively low or high circulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong>s.</p>

The phytosphingosine-CD300b interaction promotes zymosan-induced, nitric oxide–dependent neutrophil recruitment
<p>Zymosan is a glucan that is a component of the yeast cell wall. Here, we determined the mechanisms underlying the zymosan-induced accumulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong>s in mice. Loss of the receptor CD300b reduced the number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong>s recruited to dorsal air pouches in response to zymosan, but not in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a bacterial membrane component recognized by Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). An inhibitor of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis reduced the number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong>s in the zymosan-treated air pouches of wild-type mice to an amount comparable to that in <i>CD300b<sup>−/−</sup></i> mice. Treatment with clodronate liposomes decreased the number of NO-producing, CD300b<sup>+</sup> inflammatory dendritic cells (DCs) in wild-type mice, thus decreasing NO production and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong> recruitment. Similarly, CD300b deficiency decreased the NO-dependent recruitment of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong>s to zymosan-treated joint cavities, thus ameliorating subsequent arthritis. We identified phytosphingosine, a lipid component of zymosan, as a potential ligand of CD300b. Phytosphingosine stimulated NO production in inflammatory DCs and promoted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong> recruitment in a CD300b-dependent manner. Together, these results suggest that the phytosphingosine-CD300b interaction promotes zymosan-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong> accumulation by inducing NO production by inflammatory DCs and that CD300b may contribute to antifungal immunity.</p>

SULTR3s Function in Chloroplast Sulfate Uptake and Affect ABA Biosynthesis and the Stress Response
<p>Plants are major sulfur reducers in the global sulfur cycle. Sulfate, the major natural sulfur source in soil, is absorbed by plant roots and transported into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s, where it is reduced and assimilated into Cys for further metabolic processes. Despite its importance, how sulfate is transported into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s is poorly understood. We previously demonstrated using single Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) genetic mutants that each member of the sulfate transporter (SULTR) subfamily 3 was able to transport sulfate across the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> envelope membrane. To resolve the function of SULTR3s, we constructed a <i>sultr3</i> quintuple mutant completely knocking out all five members of the subfamily. Here we report that all members of the <i>SULTR3</i> subfamily show <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> membrane localization. Sulfate uptake by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s of the quintuple mutant is reduced by more than 50% compared with the wild type. Consequently, Cys and abscisic acid (ABA) content are reduced to ∼67 and ∼20% of the wild-type level, respectively, and strong positive correlations are found among sulfate, Cys, and ABA content. The <i>sultr3</i> quintuple mutant shows obvious growth retardation with smaller rosettes and shorter roots. Seed germination of the <i>sultr3</i> quintuple mutant is hypersensitive to exogenous ABA and salt stress, but is rescued by sulfide supplementation. Furthermore, sulfate-induced stomatal closure is abolished in the quintuple mutant, strongly suggesting that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> sulfate is required for stomatal closure. Our genetic analyses unequivocally demonstrate that sulfate transporter subfamily 3 is responsible for more than half of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> sulfate uptake and influences downstream sulfate assimilation and ABA biosynthesis.</p>

Here, we describe a new approach for generating random <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> gene mutants that combines error-prone polymerase chain reaction of a gene of interest with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> complementation of the knockout <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> mutant. As a proof of concept, we targeted a 300-bp sequence of the <i>petD</i> gene that encodes subunit IV of the thylakoid membrane-bound cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub><i>f</i> complex. By sequencing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> transformants, we revealed 149 mutations in the 300-bp target <i>petD</i> sequence that resulted in 92 amino acid substitutions in the 100-residue target subunit IV sequence. Our results show that this method is suited to the study of highly hydrophobic, multisubunit, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>-encoded proteins containing cofactors such as hemes, iron-sulfur clusters, and chlorophyll pigments. Moreover, we show that mutant screening and sequencing can be used to study photosynthetic mechanisms or to probe the mutational robustness of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>-encoded proteins, and we propose that this method is a valuable tool for the directed evolution of enzymes in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>.</p>

RECX Interacts with Mitochondrial RECA to Maintain Mitochondrial Genome Stability
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> and mitochondrial genomes are essential for photosynthesis and respiration, respectively. RECA and RECG, which are plant-specific homologs of the bacterial homologous recombination repair proteins RecA and RecG, maintain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organell</span></strong>e genome stability by suppressing aberrant recombination between short dispersed repeats (SDRs) in the moss <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. In this study, we analyzed the plant-specific factor RECX, a homolog of bacterial RecX that regulates RecA. RECX fused to GFP colocalized with mitochondrial RECA1 and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> RECA2 on mitochondrial and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> nucleoids, respectively. Knockout (KO) and overexpression (OEX) of <i>RECX</i> did not alter the <i>P. patens</i> morphological phenotype. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA, however, showed that products from recombination between SDRs increased significantly in <i>RECX</i> OEX mitochondria and modestly in <i>RECX</i> KO mitochondria. By contrast, analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> DNA revealed no substantial alteration in the number of products from recombination between SDRs in <i>RECX</i> KO and OEX <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s. Yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed interactions between RECX and RECA1 and between RECX and RECA2. Expression profiles showed a positive correlation between <i>RECX</i> and factors maintaining the stability of both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organell</span></strong>e genomes and <i>RECA1</i>. Collectively, these results suggest that RECX maintains mitochondrial genome stability, likely by modulating RECA1 activity, and that the compromised function of RECX induces mitochondrial genome instability.</p>

Identification of Putative Substrates of SEC2, a Chloroplast Inner Envelope Translocase
<p>Most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> proteins are synthesized in the cytosol and imported into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s. Many imported proteins are further targeted to the thylakoid membrane and lumen by the SEC1, TAT, or SRP/ALB3 translocases. Others are targeted to the inner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> envelope membrane by undescribed translocases. Recently, a second SEC system (SEC2) consisting of SCY2, SECE2, and SECA2 was found in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> envelope. Null mutants of <i>SCY2</i> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) exhibit a severe embryo-lethal phenotype. To investigate the function of the SEC2 system in plants, we used inducible RNA interference to knock down <i>SCY2</i> in Arabidopsis. Seedlings cultured with inducer were chlorotic with aberrant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s and undeveloped thylakoids, indicating an essential role for SCY2 in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> biogenesis beyond embryo development. In <i>SCY2</i> down-regulated seedlings, several thylakoid membrane proteins, including SCY1, ALB3, and TATC, and inner envelope membrane proteins, including TIC40, TIC110, and FTSH12, were reduced substantially, suggesting that they may be SEC2 substrates. Additional insight was achieved by the in vitro reconstitution of protein integration into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> membranes. The results show that SCY1 and ALB3 target directly to the thylakoid membrane and are likely independent of SEC2. FTSH12 was integrated into the envelope membrane in a coupled import-integration reaction that was impaired by the SECA inhibitor sodium azide. The stromal intermediate of TIC40 integrated into the envelope in a reaction that was largely inhibited when antibodies against epitope-tagged SCY2 or SECE2 were applied. These data demonstrate that the SEC2 translocase likely integrates a subset of inner envelope membrane proteins, such as FTSH12 and TIC40.</p>

Mechanism of Dual Targeting of the Phytochrome Signaling Component HEMERA/pTAC12 to Plastids and the Nucleus
<p>HEMERA (HMR) is a nuclear and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>ial dual-targeted protein. While it functions in the nucleus as a transcriptional coactivator in phytochrome signaling to regulate a distinct set of light-responsive, growth-relevant genes, in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s it is known as pTAC12, which associates with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>-encoded RNA polymerase, and is essential for inducing the plastomic photosynthetic genes and initiating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> biogenesis. However, the mechanism of targeting HMR to the nucleus and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s is still poorly understood. Here, we show that HMR can be directly imported into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s through a transit peptide residing in the N-terminal 50 amino acids. Upon cleavage of the transit peptide and additional proteolytic processing, mature HMR, which begins from Lys-58, retains its biochemical properties in phytochrome signaling. Unexpectedly, expression of mature HMR failed to rescue not only the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>ial but also the nuclear defects of the <i>hmr</i> mutant. This is because the predicted nuclear localization signals of HMR are nonfunctional, and therefore mature HMR is unable to accumulate in either <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s or the nucleus. Surprisingly, fusing the transit peptide of the small subunit of Rubisco with mature HMR rescues both its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>ial and nuclear localization and functions. These results, combined with the observation that the nuclear form of HMR has the same reduced molecular mass as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>ial HMR, support a retrograde protein translocation mechanism in which HMR is targeted first to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s, processed to the mature form, and then relocated to the nucleus.</p>

Shoot Removal Induces Chloroplast Development in Roots via Cytokinin Signaling
<p>The development of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s is regulated by various developmental, environmental, and hormonal cues. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> development is repressed in roots via auxin signaling. However, roots develop <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s when they are detached from the shoot. In contrast to auxin, cytokinin positively affects <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> development in roots, but the role and signaling pathway of cytokinin in the root greening response remain unclear. To understand the regulatory pathways of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> development in the plant stress response, we examined the mechanisms underlying the conditional greening of detached roots. In wild-type Arabidopsis roots, shoot removal activates type B ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR (ARR)-mediated cytokinin signaling and induces chlorophyll accumulation and photosynthetic remodeling. ARR1 and ARR12 are essential for up-regulating nucleus- and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>-encoded genes associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> development in detached roots. In this process, WOUND INDUCED DEDIFFERENTIATION1 and class B GATA transcription factors (B-GATAs) act upstream and downstream of ARRs, respectively. Overexpression of B-GATAs promotes root greening, as does shoot removal, dependent on a light signaling transcription factor, LONG HYPOCOTYL5. Auxin represses the root greening response independent of ARR signaling. <i>GNC-LIKE</i> (<i>GNL</i>), a B-GATA, is strongly up-regulated in detached roots via ARR1 and ARR12 but is repressed by auxin, so <i>GNL</i> may function at the point of convergence of cytokinin and auxin signaling in the root greening response.</p>

Two Chloroplast Proteins Suppress Drought Resistance by Affecting ROS Production in Guard Cells
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> as the site for photosynthesis is an essential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organell</span></strong>e in plants, but little is known about its role in stomatal regulation and drought resistance. In this study, we show that two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>ic proteins essential for thylakoid formation negatively regulate drought resistance in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). By screening a mutant pool with T-DNA insertions in nuclear genes encoding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>ic proteins, we identified an <i>HCF106</i> knockdown mutant exhibiting increased resistance to drought stress. The <i>hcf106</i> mutant displayed elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in guard cells, improved stomatal closure, and reduced water loss under drought conditions. The HCF106 protein was found to physically interact with THF1, a previously identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>ic protein crucial for thylakoid formation. The <i>thf1</i> mutant phenotypically resembled the <i>hcf106</i> mutant and displayed more ROS accumulation in guard cells, increased stomatal closure, reduced water loss, and drought resistant phenotypes compared to the wild type. The <i>hcf106thf1</i> double mutant behaved similarly as the <i>thf1</i> single mutant. These results suggest that HCF106 and THF1 form a complex to modulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> function and that the complex is important for ROS production in guard cells and stomatal control in response to environmental stresses. Our results also suggest that modulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>ic proteins could be a way for improving drought resistance in crops.</p>

Analysis of Arabidopsis Accessions Hypersensitive to a Loss of Chloroplast Translation
<p>Natural accessions of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) differ in their ability to tolerate a loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> translation. These differences can be attributed in part to variation in a duplicated nuclear gene (<i>ACC2</i>) that targets homomeric acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACCase) to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s. This functional redundancy allows limited fatty acid biosynthesis to occur in the absence of heteromeric ACCase, which is encoded in part by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> genome. In the presence of functional <i>ACC2</i>, tolerant alleles of several nuclear genes, not yet identified, enhance the growth of seedlings and embryos disrupted in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> translation. <i>ACC2</i> knockout mutants, by contrast, are hypersensitive. Here we describe an expanded search for hypersensitive accessions of Arabidopsis, evaluate whether all of these accessions are defective in <i>ACC2</i>, and characterize genotype-to-phenotype relationships for homomeric ACCase variants identified among 855 accessions with sequenced genomes. Null alleles with <i>ACC2</i> nonsense mutations, frameshift mutations, small deletions, genomic rearrangements, and defects in RNA splicing are included among the most sensitive accessions examined. By contrast, most missense mutations affecting highly conserved residues failed to eliminate ACC2 function. Several accessions were identified where sensitivity could not be attributed to a defect in either ACC2 or Tic20-IV, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> membrane channel required for ACC2 uptake. Overall, these results underscore the central role of <i>ACC2</i> in mediating Arabidopsis response to a loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> translation, highlight future applications of this system to analyzing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> protein import, and provide valuable insights into the mutational landscape of an important metabolic enzyme that is highly conserved throughout eukaryotes.</p>

Fibroblast-Specific Genetic Manipulation of p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase In Vivo Reveals Its Central Regulatory Role in Fibrosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In the heart, acute injury induces a fibrotic healing response that generates collagen-rich scarring that is at first protective but if inappropriately sustained can worsen heart disease.

The mitogen-activated protein kinase p38α (<i>Mapk14</i> gene) is known to influence the cardiac injury response, but its direct role in orchestrating programmed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibroblast</span></strong> differentiation and fibrosis in vivo is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A conditional <i>Mapk14</i> allele was used to delete the p38α encoding gene specifically in cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibroblast</span></strong>s or myo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibroblast</span></strong>s with 2 different tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase–expressing gene–targeted mouse lines.

Escaping the traps of your own hunters
<p>During the first days of an infection, protection is almost entirely provided by innate immunity, a large part of which consists of one type of immune cell—the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong>. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong>s form the largest group of immune cells in the body [humans produce ∼10<sup>11</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong>s daily (<i>1</i>)], and they carry out a number of defense mechanisms, including pathogen ingestion (phagocytosis) and the production of toxic chemicals that kill intruders directly. They can also cause severe hyperinflammatory diseases, such as lethal influenza-associated lung destruction (<i>2</i>, <i>3</i>). In 2004, another <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong> defense system was discovered. In a final act of protection, dying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong>s mix their nuclear DNA with toxic components from their cytosolic granules and release it explosively to form a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong> extracellular trap (NET) in the surrounding environment. This process is called NETosis (<i>4</i>). In addition to carrying genetic information, DNA is a very long (each nucleus contains ∼2 m of DNA) and sticky polyanionic molecule. Hence, DNA binds to surfaces such as bacterial cell walls by means of charge interactions (<i>5</i>). Through this immobilization on NETs, pathogens are brought into direct contact with cytotoxic molecules on the NET-DNA complex. However, free extracellular DNA is also a potent trigger of severe side effects in the body, for example, by forming immune complexes with anti nuclear antibodies (antibodies that can bind to DNA) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (<i>6</i>) or by directly clogging blood vessels and establishing vessel-blocking thrombi (<i>7</i>). Consequently, finding mechanisms that mediate the degradation of NETs has been a matter of intense research. On page 1202 of this issue, Jiménez-Alcéázar <i>et al.</i> (<i>8</i>) describe two deoxyribonucleases (DNases) [DNase1 and DNase1-like 3 (DNase1L3)], which cleave DNA and together degrade freshly formed NETs. By doing so, they inhibit otherwise lethal immunopathologies such as thrombus-mediated organ failure.</p>

Mitotic transcription and waves of gene reactivation during mitotic exit
<p>Although the genome is generally thought to be transcriptionally silent during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s, technical limitations have prevented sensitive mapping of transcription during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s and mitotic exit. Thus, the means by which the interphase expression pattern is transduced to daughter cells have been unclear. We used 5-ethynyluridine to pulse-label transcripts during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s and mitotic exit and found that many genes exhibit transcription during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s, as confirmed with fluorescein isothiocyanate–uridine 5′-triphosphate labeling, RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization, and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The first round of transcription immediately after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s primarily activates genes involved in the growth and rebuilding of daughter cells, rather than cell type–specific functions. We propose that the cell’s transcription pattern is largely retained at a low level through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s, whereas the amplitude of transcription observed in interphase is reestablished during mitotic exit.</p>

Holliday junction resolvases mediate chloroplast nucleoid segregation

NADPH Thioredoxin Reductase C and Thioredoxins Act Concertedly in Seedling Development
<p>Thiol-dependent redox regulation of enzyme activity plays a central role in the rapid acclimation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> metabolism to ever-fluctuating light availability. This regulatory mechanism relies on ferredoxin reduced by the photosynthetic electron transport chain, which fuels reducing power to thioredoxins (Trxs) via a ferredoxin-dependent Trx reductase. In addition, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s harbor an NADPH-dependent Trx reductase, which has a joint Trx domain at the carboxyl terminus, termed NTRC. Thus, a relevant issue concerning <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> function is to establish the relationship between these two redox systems and its impact on plant development. To address this issue, we generated Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants combining the deficiency of NTRC with those of Trxs <i>f</i>, which participate in metabolic redox regulation, and that of Trx <i>x</i>, which has antioxidant function. The <i>ntrc-trxf1f2</i> and, to a lower extent, <i>ntrc-trxx</i> mutants showed severe growth-retarded phenotypes, decreased photosynthesis performance, and almost abolished light-dependent reduction of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. Moreover, the combined deficiency of both redox systems provokes aberrant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> ultrastructure. Remarkably, both the <i>ntrc-trxf1f2</i> and <i>ntrc-trxx</i> mutants showed high mortality at the seedling stage, which was overcome by the addition of an exogenous carbon source. Based on these results, we propose that NTRC plays a pivotal role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> redox regulation, being necessary for the activity of diverse Trxs with unrelated functions. The interaction between the two thiol redox systems is indispensable to sustain photosynthesis performed by cotyledons <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s, which is essential for early plant development.</p>

pTAC10, a Key Subunit of Plastid-Encoded RNA Polymerase, Promotes Chloroplast Development
<p>Regulation of photosynthetic gene expression by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>-encoded RNA polymerase (PEP) is essential for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> development. The activity of PEP largely relies on at least 12 PEP-associated proteins (PAPs) encoded in the nuclear genome of plant cells. A recent model proposed that these PAPs regulate the establishment of the PEP complex through broad PAP-PEP or PAP-PAP interactions. In this study, we identified the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedling-lethal mutant <i>ptac10-1</i>, which has defects in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> development, and found that the mutant phenotype is caused by the suppression of <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> S1 RNA-BINDING DOMAIN PROTEIN</i> (<i>pTAC10/PAP3</i>). Analysis of the heterozygous mutant and <i>pTAC10</i>-overexpressing transgenic plants indicated that the expression level of <i>pTAC10</i> is tightly linked to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> development. Characterization of the interaction of pTAC10 with PAPs revealed that pTAC10 interacts with other PAPs, such as FSD2, FSD3, TrxZ, pTAC7, and pTAC14, but it does not interact with PEP core enzymes, such as rpoA and rpoB. Analysis of pTAC10 interactions using truncated pTAC10 proteins showed that the pTAC10 carboxyl-terminal region downstream of the S1 domain is involved in the pTAC10-PAP interaction. Furthermore, overexpression of truncated <i>pTAC10s</i> lacking the C-terminal regions downstream of the S1 domain could not rescue the <i>ptac10-1</i> mutant phenotype and induced an abnormal whitening phenotype in Columbia-0 plants. Our observations suggested that these pTAC10-PAP interactions are essential for the formation of the PEP complex and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> development.</p>

Unlike ORRM1, the other known ORRM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> editing factor, ORRM6, does not contain RNA editing interacting protein/multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organell</span></strong>ar RNA editing factor (RIP/MORF) boxes, which are required for ORRM1 to interact with site-specific pentatricopeptide repeat protein editing factors. ORRM6 interacts with RIP1/MORF8, RIP2/MORF2, and RIP9/MORF9, known components of RNA editosomes. While some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> RRM proteins are involved in other forms of RNA processing and translation, the primary function of ORRM6 is evidently to mediate <i>psbF</i>-C77 editing, like the essential site-specific pentatricopeptide repeat protein LOW PSII ACCUMULATION66. Stable expression in the <i>orrm6</i> mutants of a nucleus-encoded, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>-targeted PsbF protein from a <i>psbF</i> gene carrying a T at nucleotide 77 significantly increases leaf and plant sizes, chlorophyll content, and PSII activity. These transformants demonstrate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> RNA editing can be bypassed through the expression of nucleus-encoded, edited forms of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> genes.</p>

Ubiquitin-Proteasome Dependent Regulation of the GOLDEN2-LIKE 1 Transcription Factor in Response to Plastid Signals
<p>Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) GOLDEN2-LIKE (GLK) transcription factors promote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> biogenesis by regulating the expression of photosynthesis-related genes. Arabidopsis GLK1 is also known to participate in retrograde signaling from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s to the nucleus. To elucidate the mechanism by which GLK1 is regulated in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> signals, we biochemically characterized Arabidopsis GLK1 protein. Expression analysis of GLK1 protein indicated that GLK1 accumulates in aerial tissues. Both tissue-specific and Suc-dependent accumulation of GLK1 were regulated primarily at the transcriptional level. In contrast, norflurazon- or lincomycin-treated <i>gun1</i>-<i>101</i> mutant expressing normal levels of <i>GLK1</i> mRNA failed to accumulate GLK1 protein, suggesting that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> signals directly regulate the accumulation of GLK1 protein in a GUN1-independent manner. Treatment of the <i>glk1glk2</i> mutant expressing functional GFP-GLK1 with a proteasome inhibitor, MG-132, induced the accumulation of polyubiquitinated GFP-GLK1. Furthermore, the level of endogenous GLK1 in plants with damaged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s was partially restored when those plants were treated with MG-132. Collectively, these data indicate that the ubiquitin-proteasome system participates in the degradation of Arabidopsis GLK1 in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> signals.</p>

The cryo-EM structure of a ribosome–Ski2-Ski3-Ski8 helicase complex
<p>Ski2-Ski3-Ski8 (Ski) is a helicase complex functioning with the RNA-degrading exosome to mediate the 3′-5′ messenger RNA (mRNA) decay in turnover and quality-control pathways. We report that the Ski complex directly associates with 80<i>S</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>es presenting a short mRNA 3′ overhang. We determined the structure of an endogenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>e-Ski complex using cryo–electron microscopy (EM) with a local resolution of the Ski complex ranging from 4 angstroms (Å) in the core to about 10 Å for intrinsically flexible regions. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>e binding displaces the autoinhibitory domain of the Ski2 helicase, positioning it in an open conformation near the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>al mRNA entry tunnel. We observe that the mRNA 3′ overhang is threaded directly from the small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>al subunit to the helicase channel of Ski2, primed for ongoing exosome-mediated 3′-5′ degradation.</p>

Chloroplast Damage Induced by the Inhibition of Fatty Acid Synthesis Triggers Autophagy in Chlamydomonas
<p>Fatty acids are synthesized in the stroma of plant and algal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s by the fatty acid synthase complex. Newly synthesized fatty acids are then used to generate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>ial lipids that are essential for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> structure and function. Here, we show that inhibition of fatty acid synthesis in the model alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> activates autophagy, a highly conserved catabolic process by which cells degrade intracellular material under adverse conditions to maintain cell homeostasis. Treatment of <i>Chlamydomonas</i> cells with cerulenin, a specific fatty acid synthase inhibitor, stimulated lipidation of the autophagosome protein ATG8 and enhanced autophagic flux. We found that inhibition of fatty acid synthesis decreased monogalactosyldiacylglycerol abundance, increased lutein content, down-regulated photosynthesis, and increased the production of reactive oxygen species. Electron microscopy revealed a high degree of thylakoid membrane stacking in cerulenin-treated cells. Moreover, global transcriptomic analysis of these cells showed an up-regulation of genes encoding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> proteins involved in protein folding and oxidative stress and the induction of major catabolic processes, including autophagy and proteasome pathways. Thus, our results uncovered a link between lipid metabolism, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> integrity, and autophagy through a mechanism that involves the activation of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> quality control system.</p>

SMALL AUXIN UP RNA62/75 Are Required for the Translation of Transcripts Essential for Pollen Tube Growth
<p>Successful pollen tube elongation is critical for double fertilization, but the biological functions of pollen tube genes and the regulatory machinery underlying this crucial process are largely unknown. A previous translatomic study revealed two Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>SAUR</i> (<i>SMALL AUXIN UP RNA</i>) genes, <i>SAUR62</i> and <i>SAUR75</i>, whose expression is up-regulated by pollination. Here, we found that both SAUR62 and SAUR75 localized mainly to pollen tube nuclei. The siliques of homozygous <i>saur62</i> (<i>saur62/−</i>), <i>saur75</i> (<i>saur75/−</i>), and the <i>SAUR62</i>/<i>75</i> RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown line had many aborted seeds. These lines had normal pollen viability but defective in vitro and in vivo pollen tube growth, with branching phenotypes. Immunoprecipitation with transgenic SAUR62/75-GFP flowers revealed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>al protein RPL12 family members as potential interacting partners, and their individual interactions were confirmed further by yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays. Polysome profiling showed reduced 80S <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>e abundance in homozygous <i>saur62</i>, <i>saur75</i>, <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>al large subunit12c</i>, and <i>SAUR62/75</i> RNAi flowers, suggesting that SAUR62/75 play roles in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>e assembly. To clarify their roles in translation, we analyzed total proteins from RNAi versus wild-type flowers by isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation, revealing significantly reduced expression of factors participating in pollen tube wall biogenesis and F-actin dynamics, which are critical for the elastic properties of tube elongation. Indeed, RNAi pollen tubes showed mislocalization of deesterified and esterified pectins and F-actin organization. Thus, the biological roles of SAUR62/75 and their RPL12 partners are critical in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>al pre-60S subunit assembly for efficient pollen tube elongation and subsequent fertilization.</p>

Coordination of Chloroplast Development through the Action of the GNC and GLK Transcription Factor Families
<p>Fundamental questions regarding how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s develop from pro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s remain poorly understood despite their central importance to plant life. Two families of nuclear transcription factors, the GATA NITRATE-INDUCIBLE CARBON-METABOLISM-INVOLVED (GNC) and GOLDEN TWO-LIKE (GLK) families, have been implicated in directly and positively regulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> development. Here, we determined the degree of functional overlap between the two transcription factor families in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), characterizing their ability to regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> biogenesis both alone and in concert. We determined the DNA-binding motifs for GNC and GLK2 using protein-binding microarrays; the enrichment of these motifs in transcriptome datasets indicates that GNC and GLK2 are repressors and activators of gene expression, respectively. ChIP-seq analysis of GNC identified <i>PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR</i> and brassinosteroid activity genes as targets whose repression by GNC facilitates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> biogenesis. In addition, GNC targets and represses genes involved in ERECTA signaling and thereby facilitates stomatal development. Our results define key regulatory features of the GNC and GLK transcription factor families that contribute to the control of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> biogenesis and photosynthetic activity, including areas of independence and cross talk.</p>

Ribosomal RNA Biogenesis and Its Response to Chilling Stress in <i>Oryza sativa</i>
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>e biogenesis is crucial for plant growth and environmental acclimation. Processing of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>al RNAs (rRNAs) is an essential step in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>e biogenesis and begins with transcription of the rDNA. The resulting precursor-rRNA (pre-rRNA) transcript undergoes systematic processing, where multiple endonucleolytic and exonucleolytic cleavages remove the external and internal transcribed spacers (ETS and ITS). The processing sites and pathways for pre-rRNA processing have been deciphered in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> and, to some extent, in <i>Xenopus laevis</i>, mammalian cells, and Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). However, the processing sites and pathways remain largely unknown in crops, particularly in monocots such as rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), one of the most important food resources in the world. Here, we identified the rRNA precursors produced during rRNA biogenesis and the critical endonucleolytic cleavage sites in the transcribed spacer regions of pre-rRNAs in rice. We further found that two pre-rRNA processing pathways, distinguished by the order of 5′ ETS removal and ITS1 cleavage, coexist in vivo. Moreover, exposing rice to chilling stress resulted in the inhibition of rRNA biogenesis mainly at the pre-rRNA processing level, suggesting that these energy-intensive processes may be reduced to increase acclimation and survival at lower temperatures. Overall, our study identified the pre-rRNA processing pathway in rice and showed that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>e biogenesis is quickly inhibited by low temperatures, which may shed light on the link between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>e biogenesis and environmental acclimation in crop plants.</p>

Plastid Translation Elongation Factor Tu Is Prone to Heat-Induced Aggregation Despite Its Critical Role in Plant Heat Tolerance
<p>Translation elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) is a conserved GTP-binding protein essential for protein translation in prokaryotes and in eukaryotic mitochondria and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s. EF-Tu also has a GTP/GDP-independent chaperone activity that may function in acclimation to heat. Here, we report that the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> EF-Tu, Rabe1b, rapidly becomes insoluble at temperatures as low as 35°C in vitro and 41°C in vivo, with more than 90% aggregation after 9 h at 45°C in vivo. Based on its established function in protein translation, heat-induced aggregation likely inactivates Rabe1b. To determine the effect of heat-induced aggregation, we isolated an Arabidopsis <i>rabe1b</i> knockdown mutant and discovered it to be highly compromised in heat tolerance. Overexpression of constitutive GTP- or GDP-bound mutant forms of Rabe1b in Arabidopsis and virus-induced silencing of <i>Rabe1b</i> in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) also reduced heat tolerance. Compromised heat tolerance in the Arabidopsis <i>rabe1b</i> mutant and in the lines overexpressing constitutive GTP- or GDP-bound mutant Rabe1b proteins was associated with reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> translation under heat stress. The Arabidopsis <i>rabe1b</i> mutant also showed compromised heat-induced expression of <i>HsfA2</i> and its target genes. Constitutive overexpression of HsfA2 activated its target genes but only partially restored the heat tolerance of the <i>rabe1b</i> mutant. These results strongly suggest that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> protein EF-Tu is heat sensitive and acts as a critical limiting factor in plant heat stress responses, primarily functioning in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> protein translation but also in protein folding and retrograde signaling of nuclear heat-responsive gene expression.</p>

Control of Retrograde Signaling by Rapid Turnover of GENOMES UNCOUPLED1
<p>The exchange of signals between cellular compartments coordinates development and differentiation, modulates metabolic pathways, and triggers responses to environmental conditions. The proposed central regulator of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>-to-nucleus retrograde signaling, GENOMES UNCOUPLED1 (GUN1), is present at very low levels, which has hampered the discovery of its precise molecular function. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) GUN1 protein accumulates to detectable levels only at very early stages of leaf development, where it functions in the regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> biogenesis. <i>GUN1</i> mRNA is present at high levels in all tissues, but GUN1 protein undergoes rapid degradation (with an estimated half-life of ∼4 h) in all tissues where <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> biogenesis has been completed. The rapid turnover of GUN1 is controlled mainly by the chaperone ClpC1, suggesting degradation of GUN1 by the Clp protease. Degradation of GUN1 slows under stress conditions that alter retrograde signaling, thus ensuring that the plant has sufficient GUN1 protein. We also find that the pentatricopeptide repeat motifs of GUN1 are important determinants of GUN1 stability. Moreover, overexpression of <i>GUN1</i> causes an early flowering phenotype, suggesting a function of GUN1 in developmental phase transitions beyond <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> biogenesis. Taken together, our results provide new insight into the regulation of GUN1 by proteolytic degradation, uncover its function in early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> biogenesis, and suggest a role in developmental phase transitions.</p>

The Pentatricopeptide Repeat Protein EMB2654 Is Essential for Trans-Splicing of a Chloroplast Small Ribosomal Subunit Transcript
<p>We report the partial complementation and subsequent comparative molecular analysis of two nonviable mutants impaired in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> translation, one (<i>emb2394</i>) lacking the RPL6 protein, and the other (<i>emb2654</i>) carrying a mutation in a gene encoding a P-class pentatricopeptide repeat protein. We show that EMB2654 is required for the trans-splicing of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> <i>rps12</i> transcript and that therefore the <i>emb2654</i> mutant lacks Rps12 protein and fails to assemble the small subunit of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>e, explaining the loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> translation and consequent embryo-lethal phenotype. Predictions of the EMB2654 binding site match a small RNA “footprint” located on the 5′ half of the trans-spliced intron that is almost absent in the partially complemented mutant. EMB2654 binds sequence specifically to this target sequence in vitro. Altered patterns in nuclease-protected small RNA fragments in <i>emb2654</i> show that EMB2654 binding must be an early step in, or prior to, the formation of a large protein-RNA complex covering the free ends of the two <i>rps12</i> intron halves.</p>

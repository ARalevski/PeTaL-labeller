The apo-structure of the leucine sensor Sestrin2 is still elusive
<p>Sestrin2 is a GATOR2-interacting protein that directly binds leucine and is required for the inhibition of mTORC1 under leucine deprivation, indicating that it is a leucine sensor for the mTORC1 pathway. We recently reported the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of Sestrin2 in complex with leucine [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID, 5DJ4] and demonstrated that mutations in the leucine-binding pocket that alter the affinity of Sestrin2 for leucine result in a corresponding change in the leucine sensitivity of mTORC1 in cells. A lower resolution <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of human Sestrin2 (PDB ID, 5CUF), which was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lized in the absence of exogenous leucine, showed Sestrin2 to be in a nearly identical conformation as the leucine-bound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e. On the basis of this observation, it has been argued that leucine binding does not affect the conformation of Sestrin2 and that Sestrin2 may not be a sensor for leucine. We show that simple analysis of the reported “apo”-Sestrin2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e reveals the clear presence of prominent, unmodeled electron density in the leucine-binding pocket that exactly accommodates the leucine observed in the higher resolution <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e. Refining the reported apo-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e with leucine eliminated the large <i>F</i><sub>obs</sub>-<i>F</i><sub>calc</sub> difference density at this position and improved the working and free R factors of the model. Consistent with this result, our own <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of Sestrin2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lized in the absence of exogenous leucine also contained electron density that is best explained by leucine. Thus, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of apo-Sestrin2 remains elusive.</p>

Protein crystallization promotes type 2 immunity and is reversible by antibody treatment
<p>Although spontaneous protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization is a rare event in vivo, Charcot-Leyden <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s (CLCs) consisting of galectin-10 (Gal10) protein are frequently observed in eosinophilic diseases, such as asthma. We found that CLCs derived from patients showed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> packing and Gal10 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e identical to those of Gal10 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s grown in vitro. When administered to the airways, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lin</span></strong>e Gal10 stimulated innate and adaptive immunity and acted as a type 2 adjuvant. By contrast, a soluble Gal10 mutein was inert. Antibodies directed against key epitopes of the CLC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization interface dissolved preexisting CLCs in patient-derived mucus within hours and reversed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>-driven inflammation, goblet-cell metaplasia, immunoglobulin E (IgE) synthesis, and bronchial hyperreactivity (BHR) in a humanized mouse model of asthma. Thus, protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s may promote hallmark features of asthma and are targetable by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>-dissolving antibodies.</p>

Phonon-mediated quantum state transfer and remote qubit entanglement
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phonon</span></strong>s, and in particular surface acoustic wave <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phonon</span></strong>s, have been proposed as a means to coherently couple distant solid-state quantum systems.

Using a 2-millimeter-long acoustic quantum communication channel, equivalent to a 500-nanosecond delay line, we demonstrate the emission and recapture of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phonon</span></strong> by one superconducting qubit, quantum state transfer between two superconducting qubits with a 67% efficiency, and, by partial transfer of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phonon</span></strong>, generation of an entangled Bell pair with a fidelity of 84%.</p>

Colossal grain growth yields single-crystal metal foils by contact-free annealing
<p>Single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> metals have distinctive properties owing to the absence of grain boundaries and strong anisotropy. Commercial single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> metals are usually synthesized by bulk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> growth or by deposition of thin films onto substrates, and they are expensive and small. We prepared extremely large single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> metal foils by “contact-free annealing” from commercial poly<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lin</span></strong>e foils. The colossal grain growth (up to 32 square centimeters) is achieved by minimizing contact stresses, resulting in a preferred in-plane and out-of-plane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> orientation, and is driven by surface energy minimization during the rotation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> lattice followed by “consumption” of neighboring grains. Industrial-scale production of single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> metal foils is possible as a result of this discovery.</p>

Extra strengthening and work hardening in gradient nanotwinned metals
<p>Gradient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es exist ubiquitously in nature and are increasingly being introduced in engineering. However, understanding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al gradient–related mechanical behaviors in all gradient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es, including those in engineering materials, has been challenging. We explored the mechanical performance of a gradient nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">twin</span></strong>ned <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e with highly tunable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al gradients in pure copper. A large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al gradient allows for superior work hardening and strength that can exceed those of the strongest component of the gradient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e. We found through systematic experiments and atomistic simulations that this unusual behavior is afforded by a unique patterning of ultrahigh densities of dislocations in the grain interiors. These observations not only shed light on gradient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es, but may also indicate a promising route for improving the mechanical properties of materials through gradient design.</p>

Comprehensive computational design of ordered peptide macrocycles
<p>Mixed-chirality peptide macrocycles such as cyclosporine are among the most potent therapeutics identified to date, but there is currently no way to systematically search the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al space spanned by such compounds. Natural proteins do not provide a useful guide: Peptide macrocycles lack regular secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es and hydrophobic cores, and can contain local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es not accessible with <sc>l</sc>-amino acids. Here, we enumerate the stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es that can be adopted by macrocyclic peptides composed of <sc>l</sc>- and <sc>d</sc>-amino acids by near-exhaustive backbone sampling followed by sequence design and energy landscape calculations. We identify more than 200 designs predicted to fold into single stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es, many times more than the number of currently available unbound peptide macrocycle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es. Nuclear magnetic resonance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es of 9 of 12 designed 7- to 10-residue macrocycles, and three 11- to 14-residue bicyclic designs, are close to the computational models. Our results provide a nearly complete coverage of the rich space of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es possible for short peptide macrocycles and vastly increase the available starting scaffolds for both rational drug design and library selection methods.</p>

D<sub>4</sub> dopamine receptor high-resolution structures enable the discovery of selective agonists
<p>Dopamine receptors are implicated in the pathogenesis and treatment of nearly every neuropsychiatric disorder. Although thousands of drugs interact with these receptors, our molecular understanding of dopaminergic drug selectivity and design remains clouded. To illuminate dopamine receptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e, function, and ligand recognition, we determined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es of the D<sub>4</sub> dopamine receptor in its inactive state bound to the antipsychotic drug nemonapride, with resolutions up to 1.95 angstroms.

Single-crystal x-ray diffraction structures of covalent organic frameworks
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization problem is an outstanding challenge in the chemistry of porous covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al characterization has been limited to modeling and solutions based on powder x-ray or electron diffraction data. Single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s of COFs amenable to x-ray diffraction characterization have not been reported. Here, we developed a general procedure to grow large single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s of three-dimensional imine-based COFs (COF-300, hydrated form of COF-300, COF-303, LZU-79, and LZU-111). The high quality of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s allowed collection of single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> x-ray diffraction data of up to 0.83-angstrom resolution, leading to unambiguous solution and precise <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">an<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotropi</span></strong></span></strong>c refinement.

Coherent, atomically thin transition-metal dichalcogenide superlattices with engineered strain

We report coherent atomically thin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superlattic</span></strong>es in which different transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers—despite large lattice mismatches—are repeated and laterally integrated without dislocations within the monolayer plane. Grown by an omnidirectional epitaxy, these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superlattic</span></strong>es display fully matched lattice constants across heterointerfaces while maintaining an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotropi</span></strong>c lattice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e and triangular symmetry. This strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">epitaxi</span></strong>al strain is precisely engineered via the nanoscale supercell dimensions, thereby enabling broad tuning of the optical properties and producing photoluminescence peak shifts as large as 250 millielectron volts. We present theoretical models to explain this coherent growth and the energetic interplay governing the ripple formation in these strained monolayers. Such coherent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superlattic</span></strong>es provide building blocks with targeted functionalities at the atomically thin limit.</p>

Observation of chiral phonons
<p>Chirality reveals symmetry breaking of the fundamental interaction of elementary particles. In condensed matter, for example, the chirality of electrons governs many unconventional transport phenomena such as the quantum Hall effect. Here we show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phonon</span></strong>s can exhibit intrinsic chirality in monolayer tungsten diselenide. The broken inversion symmetry of the lattice lifts the degeneracy of clockwise and counterclockwise <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phonon</span></strong> modes at the corners of the Brillouin zone. We identified the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phonon</span></strong>s by the intervalley transfer of holes through hole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phonon</span></strong> interactions during the indirect infrared absorption, and we confirmed their chirality by the infrared circular dichroism arising from pseudoangular momentum conservation.

The bacterial Ras/Rap1 site-specific endopeptidase RRSP cleaves Ras through an atypical mechanism to disrupt Ras-ERK signaling
<p>The Ras–extracellular signal–regulated kinase pathway is critical for controlling cell proliferation, and its aberrant activation drives the growth of various cancers. Because many pathogens produce toxins that inhibit Ras activity, efforts to develop effective Ras inhibitors to treat cancer could be informed by studies of Ras inhibition by pathogens. <i>Vibrio vulnificus</i> causes fatal infections in a manner that depends on multifunctional autoprocessing repeats-in-toxin, a toxin that releases bacterial effector domains into host cells. One such domain is the Ras/Rap1-specific endopeptidase (RRSP), which site-specifically cleaves the Switch I domain of the small GTPases Ras and Rap1. We solved the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of RRSP and found that its backbone shares a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al fold with the EreA/ChaN-like superfamily of enzymes. Unlike other proteases in this family, RRSP is not a metalloprotease. Through nuclear magnetic resonance analysis and nucleotide exchange assays, we determined that the processing of KRAS by RRSP did not release any fragments or cause KRAS to dissociate from its bound nucleotide but instead only locally affected its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e. However, this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al alteration of KRAS was sufficient to disable guanine nucleotide exchange factor–mediated nucleotide exchange and prevent KRAS from binding to RAF. Thus, RRSP is a bacterial effector that represents a previously unrecognized class of protease that disconnects Ras from its signaling network while inducing limited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al disturbance in its target.</p>

A disease-linked <i>ULBP6</i> polymorphism inhibits NKG2D-mediated target cell killing by enhancing the stability of NKG2D ligand binding
<p>NKG2D (natural killer group 2, member D) is an activating receptor found on the surface of immune cells, including natural killer (NK) cells, which regulates innate and adaptive immunity through recognition of the stress-induced ligands ULBP1 (UL16 binding protein 1) to ULBP6 and MICA/B. Similar to class I human leukocyte antigen (HLA), these NKG2D ligands have a major histocompatibility complex–like fold and exhibit pronounced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymorph</span></strong>ism, which influences human disease susceptibility. However, whereas class I HLA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymorph</span></strong>isms occur predominantly in the α1α2 groove and affect antigen binding, the effects of most NKG2D ligand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymorph</span></strong>isms are unclear. We studied the molecular and functional consequences of the two major alleles of <i>ULBP6</i>, the most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymorph</span></strong>ic <i>ULBP</i> gene, which are associated with autoimmunity and relapse after stem cell transplantation. Surface plasmon resonance and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lography studies revealed that the arginine-to-leucine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymorph</span></strong>ism within ULBP0602 affected the NKG2D-ULBP6 interaction by generating an energetic hotspot. This resulted in an NKG2D-ULBP0602 affinity of 15.5 nM, which is 10- to 1000-fold greater than the affinities of other ULBP-NKG2D interactions and limited NKG2D-mediated activation. In addition, soluble ULBP0602 exhibited high-affinity competitive binding for NKG2D and partially suppressed NKG2D-mediated activation of NK cells by other NKG2D ligands. These effects resulted in a decrease in a range of NKG2D-mediated effector functions. Our results reveal that <i>ULBP</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymorph</span></strong>isms affect the strength of human lymphocyte responses to cellular stress signals and may offer opportunities for therapeutic intervention.</p>

Three-dimensional genome structures of single diploid human cells

Two-channel model for ultralow thermal conductivity of crystalline Tl<sub>3</sub>VSe<sub>4</sub>
<p>Solids with ultralow thermal conductivity are of great interest as thermal barrier coatings for insulation or thermoelectrics for energy conversion. However, the theoretical limits of lattice thermal conductivity (κ) are unclear. In typical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phonon</span></strong> picture is valid, whereas lowest κ values occur in highly disordered materials where this picture fails and heat is supposedly carried by random walk among uncorrelated oscillators. Here we identify a simple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>, Tl<sub>3</sub>VSe<sub>4</sub>, with a calculated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phonon</span></strong> κ [0.16 Watts per meter-Kelvin (W/m-K)] one-half that of our measured κ (0.30 W/m-K) at 300 K, approaching disorder κ values, although Raman spectra, specific heat, and temperature dependence of κ reveal typical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phonon</span></strong> characteristics. Adding a transport component based on uncorrelated oscillators explains the measured κ and suggests that a two-channel model is necessary for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s with ultralow κ.</p>

A liquid-liquid transition in supercooled aqueous solution related to the HDA-LDA transition
<p>Simulations and theory suggest that the thermodynamic anomalies of water may be related to a phase transition between two supercooled liquid states, but so far this phase transition has not been observed experimentally because of preemptive ice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization. We used calorimetry, infrared spectroscopy, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecular dynam</span></strong>ics simulations to investigate a water-rich hydrazinium trifluoroacetate solution in which the local hydrogen bond <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e surrounding a water molecule resembles that in neat water at elevated pressure, but which does not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lize upon cooling. Instead, this solution underwent a sharp, reversible phase transition between two homogeneous liquid states. The hydrogen-bond <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es of these two states are similar to those established for high- and low-density amorphous (HDA and LDA) water. Such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al similarity supports theories that predict a similar sharp transition in pure water under pressure if ice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization could be suppressed.</p>

Electronic crystal growth
<p>Interacting atoms or molecules condense into liquid, and, when cooled further, they form a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>. The time evolution of the atomic or molecular ordering has been widely studied as a nonequilibrium emergence of order from a supercooled liquid or a glass. Interacting electrons in a variety of correlated electron systems also form <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s, but observing the time evolution of electronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization has been experimentally challenging. Here, working with an organic conductor exhibiting a supercooled charge liquid or charge glass as a metastable state, we observed electronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> growth through resistivity and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements. The temperature profile of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> growth is similar to those observed in classical systems and reveals two distinct regimes for the mechanism of electronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization.</p>

Femtosecond electron-phonon lock-in by photoemission and x-ray free-electron laser
<p>The interactions that lead to the emergence of superconductivity in iron-based materials remain a subject of debate. It has been suggested that electron-electron correlations enhance electron-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phonon</span></strong> coupling in iron selenide (FeSe) and related pnictides, but direct experimental verification has been lacking. Here we show that the electron-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phonon</span></strong> coupling strength in FeSe can be quantified by combining two time-domain experiments into a “coherent lock-in” measurement in the terahertz regime. X-ray diffraction tracks the light-induced femtosecond coherent lattice motion at a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phonon</span></strong> frequency, and photoemission monitors the subsequent coherent changes in the electronic band <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e. Comparison with theory reveals a strong enhancement of the coupling strength in FeSe owing to correlation effects. Given that the electron-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phonon</span></strong> coupling affects superconductivity exponentially, this enhancement highlights the importance of the cooperative interplay between electron-electron and electron-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phonon</span></strong> interactions.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Exploiting CELLULOSE SYNTHASE (CESA) Class Specificity to Probe Cellulose Microfibril Biosynthesis
<p>Cellulose microfibrils are the basic units of cellulose in plants. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of these microfibrils is at least partly determined by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of the cellulose synthase complex. In higher plants, this complex is composed of 18 to 24 catalytic subunits known as CELLULOSE SYNTHASE A (CESA) proteins. Three different classes of CESA proteins are required for cellulose synthesis and for secondary cell wall cellulose biosynthesis these classes are represented by CESA4, CESA7, and CESA8. To probe the relationship between CESA proteins and microfibril <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e, we created mutant cesa proteins that lack catalytic activity but retain sufficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al integrity to allow assembly of the cellulose synthase complex. Using a series of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants and genetic backgrounds, we found consistent differences in the ability of these mutant cesa proteins to complement the cellulose-deficient phenotype of the <i>cesa</i> null mutants. The best complementation was observed with catalytically inactive cesa4, while the equivalent mutation in cesa8 exhibited significantly lower levels of complementation. Using a variety of biophysical techniques, including solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance and Fourier transform infrared microscopy, to study these mutant plants, we found evidence for changes in cellulose microfibril <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e, but these changes largely correlated with cellulose content and reflected differences in the relative proportions of primary and secondary cell walls. Our results suggest that individual CESA classes have similar roles in determining cellulose microfibril <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e, and it is likely that the different effects of mutating members of different CESA classes are the consequence of their different catalytic activity and their influence on the overall rate of cellulose synthesis.</p>

Structural and Biochemical Characterization of Cinnamoyl-CoA Reductases
<p>Cinnamoyl-coenzyme A reductase (CCR) catalyzes the reduction of hydroxycinnamoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) esters using NADPH to produce hydroxycinnamyl aldehyde precursors in lignin synthesis. The catalytic mechanism and substrate specificity of cinnamoyl-CoA reductases from sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>), a strategic plant for bioenergy production, were deduced from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es, site-directed mutagenesis, and kinetic and thermodynamic analyses. Although SbCCR1 displayed higher affinity for caffeoyl-CoA or <i>p</i>-coumaroyl-CoA than for feruloyl-CoA, the enzyme showed significantly higher activity for the latter substrate. Through molecular docking and comparisons between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es of the <i>Vitis vinifera</i> dihydroflavonol reductase and SbCCR1, residues threonine-154 and tyrosine-310 were pinpointed as being involved in binding CoA-conjugated phenylpropanoids. Threonine-154 of SbCCR1 and other CCRs likely confers strong substrate specificity for feruloyl-CoA over other cinnamoyl-CoA thioesters, and the T154Y mutation in SbCCR1 led to broader substrate specificity and faster turnover. Through data mining using our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al and biochemical information, four additional putative <i>CCR</i> genes were discovered from sorghum genomic data. One of these, SbCCR2, displayed greater activity toward <i>p</i>-coumaroyl-CoA than did SbCCR1, which could imply a role in the synthesis of defense-related lignin. Taken together, these findings provide knowledge about critical residues and substrate preference among CCRs and provide, to our knowledge, the first three-dimensional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e information for a CCR from a monocot species.</p>

Structural basis for chemokine recognition by a G protein–coupled receptor and implications for receptor activation
<p>Chemokines orchestrate cell migration for development, immune surveillance, and disease by binding to cell surface heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide–binding protein (G protein)–coupled receptors (GPCRs). The array of interactions between the nearly 50 chemokines and their 20 GPCR targets generates an extensive signaling network to which promiscuity and biased agonism add further complexity. The receptor CXCR4 recognizes both monomeric and dimeric forms of the chemokine CXCL12, which is a distinct example of ligand bias in the chemokine family. We demonstrated that a constitutively monomeric CXCL12 variant reproduced the G protein–dependent and β-arrestin–dependent responses that are associated with normal CXCR4 signaling and lead to cell migration. In addition, monomeric CXCL12 made specific contacts with CXCR4 that are not present in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of the receptor in complex with a dimeric form of CXCL12, a biased agonist that stimulates only G protein–dependent signaling. We produced an experimentally validated model of an agonist-bound chemokine receptor that merged a nuclear magnetic resonance–based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of monomeric CXCL12 bound to the amino terminus of CXCR4 with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of the transmembrane domains of CXCR4. The large CXCL12:CXCR4 protein-protein interface revealed by this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e identified previously uncharacterized functional interactions that fall outside of the classical “two-site model” for chemokine-receptor recognition. Our model suggests a mechanistic hypothesis for how interactions on the extracellular face of the receptor may stimulate the conformational changes required for chemokine receptor–mediated signal transduction.</p>

Isostructural metal-insulator transition in VO<sub>2</sub>
<p>The metal-insulator transition in correlated materials is usually coupled to a symmetry-lowering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al phase transition.

Unusual high thermal conductivity in boron arsenide bulk crystals

Reducing the stochasticity of crystal nucleation to enable subnanosecond memory writing
<p>Operation speed is a key challenge in phase-change random-access memory (PCRAM) technology, especially for achieving subnanosecond high-speed cache memory.

This ultrafast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization stems from the reduced stochasticity of nucleation through geometrically matched and robust scandium telluride (ScTe) chemical bonds that stabilize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> precursors in the amorphous state.

Structure-property relationships from universal signatures of plasticity in disordered solids

All four quantities maintained remarkable commonality in their values for disordered packings of objects ranging from atoms to grains, spanning seven orders of magnitude in diameter and 13 orders of magnitude in elastic modulus. These commonalities link the spatial correlations and strain response of softness to rearrangement size and yield strain, respectively.</p>

Structures of the CRISPR genome integration complex
<p>CRISPR-Cas systems depend on the Cas1-Cas2 integrase to capture and integrate short foreign DNA fragments into the CRISPR locus, enabling adaptation to new viruses. We present <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es of Cas1-Cas2 bound to both donor and target DNA in intermediate and product integration complexes, as well as a cryo–electron microscopy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of the full CRISPR locus integration complex, including the accessory protein IHF (integration host factor). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es show unexpectedly that indirect sequence recognition dictates integration site selection by favoring deformation of the repeat and the flanking sequences. IHF binding bends the DNA sharply, bringing an upstream recognition motif into contact with Cas1 to increase both the specificity and efficiency of integration. These results explain how the Cas1-Cas2 CRISPR integrase recognizes a sequence-dependent DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e to ensure site-selective CRISPR array expansion during the initial step of bacterial adaptive immunity.</p>

Robust epitaxial growth of two-dimensional heterostructures, multiheterostructures, and superlattices
<p>We report a general synthetic strategy for highly robust growth of diverse lateral hetero<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es, multihetero<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superlattic</span></strong>es from two-dimensional (2D) atomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s. A reverse flow during the temperature-swing stage in the sequential vapor deposition growth process allowed us to cool the existing 2D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s to prevent undesired thermal degradation and uncontrolled homogeneous nucleation, thus enabling highly robust block-by-block <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">epitaxi</span></strong>al growth. Raman and photoluminescence mapping studies showed that a wide range of 2D hetero<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es (such as WS<sub>2</sub>-WSe<sub>2</sub> and WS<sub>2</sub>-MoSe<sub>2</sub>), multihetero<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es (such as WS<sub>2</sub>-WSe<sub>2</sub>-MoS<sub>2</sub> and WS<sub>2</sub>-MoSe<sub>2</sub>-WSe<sub>2</sub>), and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superlattic</span></strong>es (such as WS<sub>2</sub>-WSe<sub>2</sub>-WS<sub>2</sub>-WSe<sub>2</sub>-WS<sub>2</sub>) were readily prepared with precisely controlled spatial modulation. Transmission electron microscope studies showed clear chemical modulation with atomically sharp interfaces. Electrical transport studies of WSe<sub>2</sub>-WS<sub>2</sub> lateral junctions showed well-defined diode characteristics with a rectification ratio up to 10<sup>5</sup>.</p>

Quantum and isotope effects in lithium metal
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of elements at zero pressure and temperature is the most fundamental information in condensed matter physics. For decades it has been believed that lithium, the simplest metallic element, has a complicated ground-state <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e. Using synchrotron x-ray diffraction in diamond anvil cells and multiscale simulations with density functional theory and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecular dynam</span></strong>ics, we show that the previously accepted martensitic ground state is metastable. The actual ground state is face-centered cubic (fcc). We find that isotopes of lithium, under similar thermal paths, exhibit a considerable difference in martensitic transition temperature. Lithium exhibits nuclear quantum mechanical effects, serving as a metallic intermediate between helium, with its quantum effect–dominated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es, and the higher-mass elements. By disentangling the quantum kinetic complexities, we prove that fcc lithium is the ground state, and we synthesize it by decompression.</p>

Mechanism of transmembrane signaling by sensor histidine kinases
<p>One of the major and essential classes of transmembrane (TM) receptors, present in all domains of life, is sensor histidine kinases, parts of two-component signaling systems (TCSs). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al mechanisms of TM signaling by these sensors are poorly understood. We present <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es of the periplasmic sensor domain, the TM domain, and the cytoplasmic HAMP domain of the <i>Escherichia coli</i> nitrate/nitrite sensor histidine kinase NarQ in the ligand-bound and mutated ligand-free states. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es reveal that the ligand binding induces rearrangements and pistonlike shifts of TM helices. The HAMP domain protomers undergo leverlike motions and convert these pistonlike motions into helical rotations. Our findings provide the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al framework for complete understanding of TM TCS signaling and for development of antimicrobial treatments targeting TCSs.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
A Family of NAI2-Interacting Proteins in the Biogenesis of the ER Body and Related Structures
<p>Plants produce different types of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived vesicles that accumulate and transport proteins, lipids, and metabolites. In the Brassicales, a distinct ER-derived <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e called the ER body is found throughout the epidermis of cotyledons, hypocotyls, and roots. NAI2 is a key factor for ER body formation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Homologs of NAI2 are found only in the Brassicales and therefore may have evolved specifically to enable ER body formation. Here, we report that three related Arabidopsis NAI2-interacting proteins (NAIP1, NAIP2, and NAIP3) play a critical role in the biogenesis of ER bodies and related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es. Analysis using GFP fusions revealed that all three NAIPs are components of the ER bodies found in the cotyledons, hypocotyls, and roots. Genetic analysis with <i>naip</i> mutants indicates that they have a critical and redundant role in ER body formation. NAIP2 and NAIP3 are also components of other vesicular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es likely derived from the ER that are formed independent of NAI2 and are present not only in the cotyledons, hypocotyls, and roots, but also in the rosettes. Thus, while NAIP1 is a specialized ER body component, NAIP2 and NAIP3 are components of different types of ER-derived <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es. Analysis of chimeric NAIP proteins revealed that their N-terminal domains play a major role in the functional specialization between NAIP1 and NAIP3. Unlike NAI2, NAIPs have homologs in all plants; therefore, NAIP-containing ER <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es, from which the ER bodies in the Brassicales may have evolved, are likely to be present widely in plants.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Biochemical and Structural Analysis of Substrate Specificity of a Phenylalanine Ammonia-Lyase
<p>Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) is the first enzyme of the general phenylpropanoid pathway catalyzing the nonoxidative elimination of ammonia from <sc>l</sc>-phenylalanine to give <i>trans</i>-cinnamate. In monocots, PAL also displays tyrosine ammonia lyase (TAL) activity, leading to the formation of <i>p</i>-coumaric acid. The catalytic mechanism and substrate specificity of a major PAL from sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>; SbPAL1), a strategic plant for bioenergy production, were deduced from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es, molecular docking, site-directed mutagenesis, and kinetic and thermodynamic analyses. This first <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of a monocotyledonous PAL displayed a unique conformation in its flexible inner loop of the 4-methylidene-imidazole-5-one (MIO) domain compared with that of dicotyledonous plants. The side chain of histidine-123 in the MIO domain dictated the distance between the catalytic MIO prosthetic group created from <sup>189</sup>Ala-Ser-Gly<sup>191</sup> residues and the bound <sc>l</sc>-phenylalanine and <sc>l</sc>-tyrosine, conferring the deamination reaction through either the Friedel-Crafts or E<sub>2</sub> reaction mechanism. Several recombinant mutant SbPAL1 enzymes were generated via <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e-guided mutagenesis, one of which, H123F-SbPAL1, has 6.2 times greater PAL activity without significant TAL activity. Additional PAL isozymes of sorghum were characterized and categorized into three groups. Taken together, this approach identified critical residues and explained substrate preferences among PAL isozymes in sorghum and other monocots, which can serve as the basis for the engineering of plants with enhanced biomass conversion properties, disease resistance, or nutritional quality.</p>

Systems Genetics Identifies a Novel Regulatory Domain of Amylose Synthesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>A deeper understanding of the regulation of starch biosynthesis in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) endosperm is crucial in tailoring digestibility without sacrificing grain quality. In this study, significant association peaks on chromosomes 6 and 7 were identified through a genomewide association study (GWAS) of debranched starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e from grains of a 320 <i>indica</i> rice diversity panel using genotyping data from the high-density rice array. A systems genetics approach that interrelates starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e data from GWAS to functional pathways from a gene regulatory network identified known genes with high correlation to the proportion of amylose and amylopectin. An SNP in the promoter region of <i>Granule Bound Starch Synthase I</i> was identified along with seven other SNPs to form haplotypes that discriminate samples into different phenotypic ranges of amylose. A GWAS peak on chromosome 7 between LOC_Os07g11020 and LOC_Os07g11520 indexed by a nonsynonymous SNP mutation on exon 5 of a bHLH transcription factor was found to elevate the proportion of amylose at the expense of reduced short-chain amylopectin. Linking starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e with starch digestibility by determining the kinetics of cooked grain amylolysis of selected haplotypes revealed strong association of starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e with estimated digestibility kinetics. Combining all results from grain quality genomics, systems genetics, and digestibility phenotyping, we propose target haplotypes for fine-tuning starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e in rice through marker-assisted breeding that can be used to alter the digestibility of rice grain, thus offering rice consumers a new diet-based intervention to mitigate the impact of nutrition-related noncommunicable diseases.</p>

Heart Failure Stages Among Older Adults in the Community
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although heart failure (HF) disproportionately affects older adults, little data exist regarding the prevalence of American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association HF stages among older individuals in the community. Additionally, the role of contemporary measures of longitudinal strain and diastolic dysfunction in defining HF stages is unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>HF stages were classified in 6118 participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study (67–91 years of age) at the fifth study visit as follows: A (asymptomatic with HF risk factors but no cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al or functional abnormalities), B (asymptomatic with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al abnormalities, defined as left ventricular hypertrophy, dilation or dysfunction, or significant valvular disease), C1 (clinical HF without prior hospitalization), and C2 (clinical HF with earlier hospitalization).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Using the traditional definitions of HF stages, only 5% of examined participants were free of HF risk factors or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al heart disease (Stage 0), 52% were categorized as Stage A, 30% Stage B, 7% Stage C1, and 6% Stage C2. Worse HF stage was associated with a greater risk of incident HF hospitalization or death at a median follow-up of 608 days. Left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction was preserved in 77% and 65% in Stages C1 and C2, respectively. Incorporation of longitudinal strain and diastolic dysfunction into the Stage B definition reclassified 14% of the sample from Stage A to B and improved the net reclassification index (<i>P</i>=0.028) and integrated discrimination index (<i>P</i>=0.016). Abnormal LV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e, systolic function (based on LV ejection fraction and longitudinal strain), and diastolic function (based on e’, E/e’, and left atrial volume index) were each independently and additively associated with risk of incident HF hospitalization or death in Stage A and B participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The majority of older adults in the community are at risk for HF (Stages A or B), appreciably more compared with previous reports in younger community-based samples. LV ejection fraction is robustly preserved in at least two-thirds of older adults with prevalent HF (Stage C), highlighting the burden of HF with preserved LV ejection fraction in the elderly. LV diastolic function and longitudinal strain provide incremental prognostic value beyond conventional measures of LV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e and LV ejection fraction in identifying persons at risk for HF hospitalization or death.</p></sec>

Genetic Determinants of Dabigatran Plasma Levels and Their Relation to Bleeding
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Fixed-dose unmonitored treatment with dabigatran etexilate is effective and has a favorable safety profile in the prevention of stroke in atrial fibrillation patients compared with warfarin. We hypothesized that genetic variants could contribute to interindividual variability in blood concentrations of the active metabolite of dabigatran etexilate and influence the safety and efficacy of dabigatran.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We successfully conducted a genome-wide association study in 2944 Randomized Evaluation of Long-term Anticoagulation Therapy (RE-LY) participants. The <i>CES1</i> single-nucleotide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymorph</span></strong>ism rs2244613 was associated with trough concentrations, and the <i>ABCB1</i> single-nucleotide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymorph</span></strong>ism rs4148738 and the <i>CES1</i> single-nucleotide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymorph</span></strong>ism rs8192935 were associated with peak concentrations at genome-wide significance (<i>P</i><9×10<sup>−8</sup>) with a gene-dose effect. Each minor allele of the <i>CES1</i> single-nucleotide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymorph</span></strong>ism rs2244613 was associated with lower trough concentrations (15% decrease per allele; 95% confidence interval, 10–19; <i>P</i>=1.2×10<sup>−8</sup>) and a lower risk of any bleeding (odds ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.55–0.82; <i>P</i>=7×10<sup>−5</sup>) in dabigatran-treated participants, with a consistent but nonsignificant lower risk of major bleeding (odds ratio, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.43–1.01). The interaction between treatment (warfarin versus all dabigatran) and carrier status was statistically significant (<i>P</i>=0.002), with carriers having less bleeding with dabigatran than warfarin (hazard ratio, 0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.46–0.76; <i>P</i>=5.2×10<sup>−</sup>5) in contrast to no difference in noncarriers (hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.81–1.14; <i>P</i>=0.65).

The R2R3-MYB Transcription Factor MYB49 Regulates Cadmium Accumulation
<p>Abscisic acid (ABA) reduces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of potentially toxic cadmium (Cd) in plants. How the ABA signal is transmitted to modulate Cd uptake remains largely unclear. Here, we report that the basic region/Leu zipper transcription factor ABSCISIC ACID-INSENSITIVE5 (ABI5), a central ABA signaling molecule, is involved in ABA-repressed Cd <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in plants by physically interacting with a previously uncharacterized R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, MYB49. Overexpression of the Cd-induced <i>MYB49</i> gene in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) resulted in a significant increase in Cd <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation, whereas <i>myb49</i> knockout plants and plants expressing chimeric repressors of <i>MYB49</i>:ERF-associated amphiphilic repression motif repression domain (<i>SRDX49</i>) exhibited reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of Cd. Further investigations revealed that MYB49 positively regulates the expression of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors <i>bHLH38</i> and <i>bHLH101</i> by directly binding to their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>ers, leading to activation of <i>IRON-REGULATED TRANSPORTER1</i>, which encodes a metal transporter involved in Cd uptake. MYB49 also binds to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>er regions of the heavy metal-associated isoprenylated plant proteins (<i>HIPP22</i>) and <i>HIPP44</i>, resulting in up-regulation of their expression and subsequent Cd <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation. On the other hand, as a feedback mechanism to control Cd uptake and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in plant cells, Cd-induced ABA up-regulates the expression of <i>ABI5</i>, whose protein product interacts with MYB49 and prevents its binding to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>ers of downstream genes, thereby reducing Cd <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation. Our results provide new insights into the molecular feedback mechanisms underlying ABA signaling-controlled Cd uptake and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in plants.</p>

Genetic Dissection of Fe-Dependent Signaling in Root Developmental Responses to Phosphate Deficiency
<p>The inhibition of primary root (PR) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> is a major developmental response of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) to phosphate (Pi) deficiency. Previous studies have independently uncovered key roles of the LOW PHOSPHATE RESPONSE1 (LPR1) ferroxidase, the tonoplast-localized ALUMINUM SENSITIVE3 (ALS3)/SENSITIVE TO ALUMINUM RHIZOTOXICITY1 (STAR1) transporter complex, and the SENSITIVE TO PROTON RHIZOTOXICITY1 (STOP1; a transcription factor)-ALUMINUM-ACTIVATED MALATE TRANSPORTER1 (ALMT1; a malate transporter) regulatory module in mediating this response by controlling iron (Fe) homeostasis in roots, but how these three components interact to regulate PR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> under Pi deficiency remains unknown. Here, we dissected genetic relationships among these three key components and found that (1) STOP1, ALMT1, and LPR1 act downstream of ALS3/STAR1 in controlling PR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> under Pi deficiency; (2) ALS3/STAR1 inhibits the STOP1-ALMT1 pathway by repressing STOP1 protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in the nucleus; and (3) STOP1-ALMT1 and LPR1 control PR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> under Pi deficiency in an interdependent manner involving the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>ion of malate-dependent Fe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in roots. Furthermore, this malate-mediated Fe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation depends on external Pi availability. We also performed a detailed analysis of the dynamic changes in the tissue-specific Fe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation patterns in the root tips of plants exposed to Pi deficiency. The results indicate that the degree of inhibition of PR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> induced by Pi deficiency is not linked to the level of Fe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ated in the root apical meristem or the elongation zone. Our work provides insights into the molecular mechanism that regulates the root developmental response to Pi deficiency.</p>

F-Actin Mediated Focusing of Vesicles at the Cell Tip Is Essential for Polarized Growth
<p>F-actin has been shown to be essential for tip <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> in an array of plant models, including <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. One hypothesis is that diffusion can transport secretory vesicles, while actin plays a regulatory role during secretion. Alternatively, it is possible that actin-based transport is necessary to overcome vesicle transport limitations to sustain secretion. Therefore, a quantitative analysis of diffusion, secretion kinetics, and cell geometry is necessary to clarify the role of actin in polarized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis, we first show that secretory vesicles move toward and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ate at the tip in an actin-dependent manner. We then depolymerized F-actin to decouple vesicle diffusion from actin-mediated transport and measured the diffusion coefficient and concentration of vesicles. Using these values, we constructed a theoretical diffusion-based model for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>, demonstrating that with fast-enough vesicle fusion kinetics, diffusion could support normal cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> rates. We further refined our model to explore how experimentally extrapolated vesicle fusion kinetics and the size of the secretion zone limit diffusion-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. This model predicts that diffusion-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> is dependent on the size of the region of exocytosis at the tip and that diffusion-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> would be significantly slower than normal cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. To further explore the size of the secretion zone, we used a cell wall degradation enzyme cocktail and determined that the secretion zone is smaller than 6 Î¼m in diameter at the tip. Taken together, our results highlight the requirement for active transport in polarized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and provide important insight into vesicle secretion during tip <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>.</p>

ABA Suppresses Root Hair Growth via the OBP4 Transcriptional Regulator
<p>Plants modify organ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and tune morphogenesis in response to various endogenous and environmental cues. At the cellular level, organ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> is often adjusted by alterations in cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this control remain poorly understood. In this study, we identify the DNA BINDING WITH ONE FINGER (DOF)-type transcription regulator OBF BINDING PROTEIN4 (OBP4) as a repressor of cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. Ectopic expression of <i>OBP4</i> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) inhibits cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>, resulting in severe dwarfism and the repression of genes involved in the regulation of water transport, root hair development, and stress responses. Among the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors known to control root hair <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>, OBP4 binds the <i>ROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE6-LIKE2</i> (<i>RSL2</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>er to repress its expression. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of OBP4 proteins is detected in expanding root epidermal cells, and its expression level is increased by the application of abscisic acid (ABA) at concentrations sufficient to inhibit root hair <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. ABA-dependent induction of <i>OBP4</i> is associated with the reduced expression of <i>RSL2</i>. Furthermore, ectopic expression of <i>OBP4</i> or loss of <i>RSL2</i> function results in ABA-insensitive root hair <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. Taken together, our results suggest that OBP4-mediated transcriptional repression of <i>RSL2</i> contributes to the ABA-dependent inhibition of root hair <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> in Arabidopsis.</p>

Correlation between genome reduction and bacterial growth
<p>Genome reduction by removing dispensable genomic sequences in bacteria is commonly used in both fundamental and applied studies to determine the minimal genetic requirements for a living system or to develop highly efficient bioreactors. Nevertheless, whether and how the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ative loss of dispensable genomic sequences disturbs bacterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> remains unclear. To investigate the relationship between genome reduction and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>, a series of <i>Escherichia coli</i> strains carrying genomes reduced in a stepwise manner were used. Intensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> analyses revealed that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of multiple genomic deletions caused decreases in the exponential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> rate and the saturated cell density in a deletion-length-dependent manner as well as gradual changes in the patterns of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> dynamics, regardless of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> media. Accordingly, a perspective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> model linking genome evolution to genome engineering was proposed. This study provides the first demonstration of a quantitative connection between genomic sequence and bacterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>, indicating that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> rate is potentially associated with dispensable genomic sequences.</p>

Control of Adventitious Root Architecture in Rice by Darkness, Light, and Gravity
<p>Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) is a semiaquatic plant that is well adapted to partial flooding. Rice stems develop adventitious root (AR) primordia at each node that slowly mature but emerge only when the plant gets flooded, leading to the formation of a whole new secondary root system upon flooding. AR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> is induced by ethylene that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ates in submerged plant tissues due to its lowered diffusion rate in water. Here, we report that the architecture of the secondary root system in flooded rice plants is controlled not only by altered gas diffusion but also by gravity and light. While ethylene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>es the emergence and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> of ARs, gravity and light determine their gravitropic setpoint angle (i.e. the deviation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> direction relative to vertical). ARs grow upward at about 120Â° in the dark and downward at 54Â° in the light. The upward <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> direction is conserved in <i>indica</i> and <i>japonica</i> rice varieties, suggestive of a conserved trait in rice. Experiments with a klinostat and with inverted stem orientation revealed that gravity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>es upward <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> by about 10Â°. Red, far-red, and blue light lead to negative phototropism in a dose-dependent manner, with blue light being most effective, indicating that phytochrome and blue light signaling control AR system architecture. The <i>cpt1</i> (<i>coleoptile phototropism1</i>) mutant, which lacks one of the phototropin-interacting CPT proteins, shows reduced sensitivity to blue light. Hence, the gravitropic setpoint angle of rice ARs is controlled by genetic and environmental factors that likely balance the need for oxygen supply (upward <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>) with avoidance of root desiccation (downward <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>).</p>

Arabidopsis Responds to <i>Alternaria alternata</i> Volatiles by Triggering Plastid Phosphoglucose Isomerase-Independent Mechanisms
<p>Volatile compounds (VCs) emitted by phylogenetically diverse microorganisms (including plant pathogens and microbes that do not normally interact mutualistically with plants) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>e photosynthesis, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>, and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of high levels of starch in leaves through cytokinin (CK)-regulated processes. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants not exposed to VCs, plastidic phosphoglucose isomerase (pPGI) acts as an important determinant of photosynthesis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>, likely as a consequence of its involvement in the synthesis of plastidic CKs in roots. Moreover, this enzyme plays an important role in connecting the Calvin-Benson cycle with the starch biosynthetic pathway in leaves. To elucidate the mechanisms involved in the responses of plants to microbial VCs and to investigate the extent of pPGI involvement, we characterized pPGI-null <i>pgi1-2</i> Arabidopsis plants cultured in the presence or absence of VCs emitted by <i>Alternaria alternata</i>. We found that volatile emissions from this fungal phytopathogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>e <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>, photosynthesis, and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of plastidic CKs in <i>pgi1-2</i> leaves. Notably, the mesophyll cells of <i>pgi1-2</i> leaves <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ated exceptionally high levels of starch following VC exposure. Proteomic analyses revealed that VCs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>e global changes in the expression of proteins involved in photosynthesis, starch metabolism, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> that can account for the observed responses in <i>pgi1-2</i> plants. The overall data show that Arabidopsis plants can respond to VCs emitted by phytopathogenic microorganisms by triggering pPGI-independent mechanisms.</p>

The joint influence of photoperiod and temperature during growth cessation and development of dormancy in white spruce (<i>Picea glauca</i>)
<p>Timely responses to environmental cues enable the synchronization of phenological life-history transitions essential for the health and survival of north-temperate and boreal tree species. While photoperiodic cues will remain persistent under climate change, temperature cues may vary, contributing to possible asynchrony in signals influencing developmental and physiological transitions essential to forest health. Understanding the relative contribution of photoperiod and temperature as determinants of the transition from active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> to dormancy is important for informing adaptive forest management decisions that consider future climates. Using a combination of photoperiod (long = 20 h or short = 8 h day lengths) and temperature (warm = 22 Â°C/16 Â°C and cool = 8 Â°C/4 Â°C day/night, respectively) treatments, we used microscopy, physiology and modeling to comprehensively examine hallmark traits of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>âdormancy transitionâincluding bud formation, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> cessation, cold hardiness and gas exchangeâwithin two provenances of white spruce [<i>Picea glauca</i> (Moench) Voss] spanning a broad latitude in Alberta, Canada. Following exposure to experimental treatments, seedlings were transferred to favorable conditions, and the depth of dormancy was assessed by determining the timing and ability of spruce seedlings to resume <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. Short photoperiods <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>ed bud development and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> cessation, whereas longer photoperiods extended the growing season through the induction of lammas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. In contrast, cool temperatures under both photoperiodic conditions delayed bud development. Photoperiod strongly predicted the development of cold hardiness, whereas temperature predicted photosynthetic rates associated with active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. White spruce was capable of attaining endodormancy, but its release was environmentally determined. Dormancy depth varied substantially across experimental treatments suggesting that environmental cues experienced within one season could affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> in the following season, which is particularly important for a determinate species such as white spruce. The joint influence of these environmental cues points toward the importance of including local constant photoperiod and shifting temperature cues into predictive models that consider how climate change may affect northern forests.</p>

Differential radial growth patterns between beech (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i> L.) and oak (<i>Quercus robur</i> L.) on periodically waterlogged soils
<p>Climate scenarios for northern Central Europe project rising temperatures and increasing frequency and intensity of droughts but also a shift in precipitation pattern with more humid winters. This in turn may result in soil waterlogging during the following spring, leading to increasing stress for trees growing on hydric sites. The influence of waterlogging on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> of common beech and pedunculate oak has been studied intensively on seedlings under experimental conditions. However, the question remains whether results of these studies can be transferred to mature trees growing under natural conditions. To test this, we investigated general <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> patterns and climateâ<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> relationships in four mature stands of beech and oak growing on hydromorphic soils (Stagnosols) in northeast Germany using dendrochronological methods. Our results confirmed the expected tolerance of oak to strong water-level fluctuations. Neither extremely wet conditions during spring nor summer droughts significantly affected its radial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. Oak <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> responded positively to warmer temperatures during previous year October and March of the current year of ring formation. Contrary to our expectations, also beech showed relatively low sensitivity to periods of high soil water saturation. Instead, summer drought turned out to be the main climatic factor influencing ring width of beech even under the specific periodically wet soil conditions of our study. This became evident from general climateâ<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> correlations over the last century as well as from discontinuous (pointer year) analysis with summer drought being significantly correlated to the occurrence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> depressions. As ring width of the two species is affected by differing climate parameters, species-specific chronologies show no coherence in high-frequency variations even for trees growing in close proximity. We assume differences in rooting depth as the main reason for the differing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> patterns and climate correlations of the two species under study. Our results indicate that under the projected future climate scenarios, beech may suffer from increasing drought stress even on hydromorphic soils. Oak might be able to maintain a sufficient hydraulic status during summer droughts by reaching water in deeper soil strata with its root system. Wet phases with waterlogged soil conditions during spring or summer appear to have only a little direct influence on radial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> of both species.</p>

<i>Arabidopsis</i> ATXR2 deposits H3K36me3 at the promoters of <i>LBD</i> genes to facilitate cellular dedifferentiation
<p>Cellular dedifferentiation, the transition of differentiated somatic cells to pluripotent stem cells, ensures developmental plasticity and contributes to wound healing in plants. Wounding induces cells to form a mass of unorganized pluripotent cells called callus at the wound site. Explanted cells can also form callus tissues in vitro. Reversible cellular differentiation-dedifferentiation processes in higher eukaryotes are controlled mainly by chromatin modifications. We demonstrate that ARABIDOPSIS TRITHORAX-RELATED 2 (ATXR2), a histone lysine methyltransferase that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>es the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of histone H3 proteins that are trimethylated on lysine 36 (H3K36me3) during callus formation, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>es early stages of cellular dedifferentiation through activation of <i>LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES DOMAIN</i> (<i>LBD</i>) genes. The <i>LBD</i> genes of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> are activated during cellular dedifferentiation to enhance the formation of callus. Leaf explants from <i>Arabidopsis atxr2</i> mutants exhibited a reduced ability to form callus and a substantial reduction in <i>LBD</i> gene expression. ATXR2 bound to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>ers of <i>LBD</i> genes and was required for the deposition of H3K36me3 at these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>ers. ATXR2 was recruited to <i>LBD</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>ers by the transcription factors AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 7 (ARF7) and ARF19. Leaf explants from <i>arf7-1arf19-2</i> double mutants were defective in callus formation and showed reduced H3K36me3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation at <i>LBD</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>ers. Genetic analysis provided further support that ARF7 and ARF19 were required for the ability of ATXR2 to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>e the expression of <i>LBD</i> genes. These observations indicate that the ATXR2-ARF-LBD axis is key for the epigenetic regulation of callus formation in <i>Arabidopsis</i>.</p>

Isoprene Acts as a Signaling Molecule in Gene Networks Important for Stress Responses and Plant Growth
<p>Isoprene synthase converts dimethylallyl diphosphate to isoprene and appears to be necessary and sufficient to allow plants to emit isoprene at significant rates. Isoprene can protect plants from abiotic stress but is not produced naturally by all plants; for example, Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) do not produce isoprene. It is typically present at very low concentrations, suggesting a role as a signaling molecule; however, its exact physiological role and mechanism of action are not fully understood. We transformed Arabidopsis with a <i>Eucalyptus globulus isoprene synthase</i>. The regulatory mechanisms of photosynthesis and isoprene emission were similar to those of native emitters, indicating that regulation of isoprene emission is not specific to isoprene-emitting species. Leaf chlorophyll and carotenoid contents were enhanced by isoprene, which also had a marked positive effect on hypocotyl, cotyledon, leaf, and inflorescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> in Arabidopsis. By contrast, leaf and stem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> was reduced in tobacco engineered to emit isoprene. Expression of genes belonging to signaling networks or associated with specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> regulators (e.g. gibberellic acid that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>es <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and jasmonic acid that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>es defense) and genes that lead to stress tolerance was altered by isoprene emission. Isoprene likely executes its effects on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and stress tolerance through direct regulation of gene expression. Enhancement of jasmonic acid-mediated defense signaling by isoprene may trigger a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>-defense tradeoff leading to variations in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> response. Our data support a role for isoprene as a signaling molecule.</p>

Auxin Efflux Carrier ZmPGP1 Mediates Root Growth Inhibition under Aluminum Stress
<p>Auxin has been shown to enhance root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> inhibition under aluminum (Al) stress in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). However, in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), auxin may play a negative role in the Al-induced inhibition of root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. In this study, we identified mutants deficient in the maize auxin efflux carrier P-glycoprotein (ZmPGP1) after ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis and used them to elucidate the contribution of ZmPGP1 to Al-induced root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> inhibition. Root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> in the <i>zmpgp1</i> mutant, which forms shortened roots and is hyposensitive to auxin, was less inhibited by Al stress than that in the inbred line B73. In the <i>zmpgp1</i> mutants, the root tips displayed higher auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation and enhanced auxin signaling under Al stress, which was also consistent with the increased expression of auxin-responsive genes. Based on the behavior of the auxin-responsive marker transgene, <i>DR5rev:RFP</i>, we concluded that Al stress reduced the level of auxin in the root tip, which contrasts with the tendency of Al stress-induced Arabidopsis plants to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ate more auxin in their root tips. In addition, Al stress induced the expression of <i>ZmPGP1</i>. Therefore, in maize, Al stress is associated with reduced auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in root tips, a process that is regulated by ZmPGP1 and thus causes inhibition of root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. This study provides further evidence about the role of auxin and auxin polar transport in Al-induced root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> regulation in maize.</p>

Rice Morphology Determinant-Mediated Actin Filament Organization Contributes to Pollen Tube Growth
<p>For successful fertilization in angiosperms, rapid tip <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> in pollen tubes delivers the male gamete into the ovules. The actin-binding protein-mediated organization of the actin cytoskeleton within the pollen tube plays a crucial role in this polarized process. However, the mechanism underlying the polarity of the actin filament (F-actin) array and behaviors in pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that an actin-organizing protein, Rice Morphology Determinant (RMD), a type II formin from rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), controls pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> by modulating the polarity and distribution of the F-actin array. The rice <i>rmd</i> mutant exhibits abnormal pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and a decreased germination rate of the pollen grain in vitro and in vivo. The <i>rmd</i> pollen tubes display a disorganized F-actin pattern with disrupted apical actin density and shank longitudinal cable direction/arrangement, indicating the novel role of RMD in F-actin polarity during tip <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. Consistent with this role, RMD localizes at the tip of the rice pollen tube, which is essential for pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and polarity as well as F-actin organization. Furthermore, the direction and characteristics of the RMD-guided F-actin array positively regulate the deposition of cell wall components and the pattern and velocity of cytoplasmic streaming during rice pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. Collectively, our results suggest that RMD is essential for the spatial regulation of pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> via modulating F-actin organization and array orientation in rice. This work provides insights into tip-focused cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and polarity.</p>

Functional-structural modeling in SimRoot indicates that, in common bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>), reduced root secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> reduces root metabolic costs, increases root length, improves phosphorus capture, and increases shoot biomass in low-phosphorus soil. Observations from the field and greenhouse confirm that, under phosphorus stress, resource allocation is shifted from secondary to primary root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>, genetic variation exists for this response, and reduced secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> improves phosphorus capture from low-phosphorus soil. Under low phosphorus in greenhouse mesocosms, genotypes with reduced secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> had 39% smaller root cross-sectional area, 60% less root respiration, 27% greater root length, 78% greater shoot phosphorus content, and 68% greater shoot mass than genotypes with advanced secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. In the field under low phosphorus, these genotypes had 43% smaller root cross-sectional area, 32% greater root length, 58% greater shoot phosphorus content, and 80% greater shoot mass than genotypes with advanced secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. Secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> eliminated arbuscular mycorrhizal associations as cortical tissue was destroyed. These results support the hypothesis that reduced root secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> is an adaptive response to low phosphorus availability and merits investigation as a potential breeding target.</p>

Protoplast Swelling and Hypocotyl Growth Depend on Different Auxin Signaling Pathways
<p>Members of the TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE1/AUXIN SIGNALING F-BOX PROTEIN (TIR1/AFB) family are known auxin receptors. To analyze the possible receptor function of AUXIN BINDING PROTEIN1 (ABP1), an auxin receptor currently under debate, we performed different approaches. We performed a pharmacological approach using Î±-(2,4-dimethylphenylethyl-2-oxo)-indole-3-acetic acid (auxinole), Î±-(phenylethyl-2-oxo)-indole-3-acetic acid (PEO-IAA), and 5-fluoroindole-3-acetic acid (5-F-IAA) to discriminate between ABP1- and TIR1/AFB-mediated processes in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We used a peptide of the carboxyl-terminal region of AtABP1 as a tool. We performed mutant analysis with the null alleles of <i>ABP1</i>, <i>abp1-c1</i> and <i>abp1-TD1</i>, and the TILLING mutant <i>abp1-5</i>. We employed Coimbra, an accession that exhibits an amino acid exchange in the auxin-binding domain of ABP1. We measured either volume changes of single hypocotyl protoplasts or hypocotyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>, both at high temporal resolution. 5-F-IAA selectively activated the TIR1/AFB pathway but did not induce protoplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">swell</span></strong>ing; instead, it showed auxin activity in the hypocotyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> test. In contrast, PEO-IAA induced an auxin-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">swell</span></strong>ing response but no hypocotyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. The carboxyl-terminal peptide of AtABP1 induced an auxin-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">swell</span></strong>ing response. In the <i>ABP1</i>-related mutants and Coimbra, no auxin-induced protoplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">swell</span></strong>ing occurred. ABP1 seems to be involved in mediating rapid auxin-induced protoplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">swell</span></strong>ing, but it is not involved in the control of rapid auxin-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>.</p>

Transcription Factor AREB2 Is Involved in Soluble Sugar Accumulation by Activating Sugar Transporter and Amylase Genes
<p>Sugars play important roles in plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and development, crop yield and quality, as well as responses to abiotic stresses. Abscisic acid (ABA) is a multifunctional hormone. However, the exact mechanism by which ABA regulates sugar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation is largely unknown in plants. Here, we tested the expression profile of several sugar transporter and amylase genes in response to ABA treatment. <i>MdSUT2</i> and <i>MdAREB2</i> were isolated and genetically transformed into apple (<i>Malus domestica</i>) to investigate their roles in ABA-induced sugar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation. The MdAREB2 transcription factor was found to bind to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>ers of the sugar transporter and amylase genes and activate their expression. Both MdAREB2 and MdSUT2 transgenic plants produced more soluble sugars than controls. Furthermore, MdAREB2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>ed the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of sucrose and soluble sugars in an <i>MdSUT2</i>-dependent manner. Our results demonstrate that the ABA-responsive transcription factor MdAREB2 directly activates the expression of amylase and sugar transporter genes to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>e soluble sugar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation, suggesting a mechanism by which ABA regulates sugar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in plants.</p>

Identification and Metabolite Profiling of Chemical Activators of Lipid Accumulation in Green Algae
<p>Microalgae are proposed as feedstock organisms useful for producing biofuels and coproducts. However, several limitations must be overcome before algae-based production is economically feasible. Among these is the ability to induce lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation and storage without affecting biomass yield. To overcome this barrier, a chemical genetics approach was employed in which 43,783 compounds were screened against <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, and 243 compounds were identified that increase triacylglyceride (TAG) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation without terminating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. Identified compounds were classified by structural similarity, and 15 were selected for secondary analyses addressing impacts on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> fitness, photosynthetic pigments, and total cellular protein and starch concentrations. TAG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation was verified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry quantification of total fatty acids, and targeted TAG and galactolipid measurements were performed using liquid chromatography-multiple reaction monitoring/mass spectrometry. These results demonstrated that TAG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation does not necessarily proceed at the expense of galactolipid. Untargeted metabolite profiling provided important insights into pathway shifts due to five different compound treatments and verified the anabolic state of the cells with regard to the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, Calvin cycle, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and amino acid biosynthetic pathways. Metabolite patterns were distinct from nitrogen starvation and other abiotic stresses commonly used to induce oil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in algae. The efficacy of these compounds also was demonstrated in three other algal species. These lipid-inducing compounds offer a valuable set of tools for delving into the biochemical mechanisms of lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in algae and a direct means to improve algal oil content independent of the severe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> limitations associated with nutrient deprivation.</p>

Constitutive Expression of Arabidopsis <i>SMALL AUXIN UP RNA19</i> (<i>SAUR19</i>) in Tomato Confers Auxin-Independent Hypocotyl Elongation<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The plant hormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA or auxin) mediates the elongation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> of shoot tissues by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>ing cell expansion. According to the acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> theory proposed in the 1970s, auxin activates plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases (PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases) to facilitate cell expansion by both loosening the cell wall through acidification and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>ing solute uptake. Mechanistically, however, this process is poorly understood. Recent findings in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) have demonstrated that auxin-induced <i>SMALL AUXIN UP RNA</i> (<i>SAUR</i>) genes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>e elongation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and play a key role in PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activation by inhibiting PP2C.D family protein phosphatases. Here, we extend these findings by demonstrating that SAUR proteins also inhibit tomato PP2C.D family phosphatases and that AtSAUR19 overexpression in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) confers the same suite of phenotypes as previously reported for Arabidopsis. Furthermore, we employ a custom image-based method for measuring hypocotyl segment elongation with high resolution and a method for measuring cell wall mechanical properties, to add mechanistic details to the emerging description of auxin-mediated cell expansion. We find that constitutive expression of GFP-AtSAUR19 bypasses the normal requirement of auxin for elongation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> by increasing the mechanical extensibility of excised hypocotyl segments. In contrast, hypocotyl segments overexpressing a PP2C.D phosphatase are specifically impaired in auxin-mediated elongation. The time courses of auxin-induced <i>SAUR</i> expression and auxin-dependent elongation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> were closely correlated. These findings indicate that induction of <i>SAUR</i> expression is sufficient to elicit auxin-mediated expansion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> by activating PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases to facilitate apoplast acidification and mechanical wall loosening.</p>

Effects of dormancy progression and low-temperature response on changes in the sorbitol concentration in xylem sap of Japanese pear during winter season
<p>In order to elucidate which physiological event(s) are involved in the seasonal changes of carbohydrate dynamics during winter, we examined the effects of different low temperatures on the carbohydrate concentrations of Japanese pear (<i>Pyrus pyrifolia</i> (Burm.) Nakai). For four winter seasons, large increases in the sorbitol concentration of shoot xylem sap occurred during mid- to late December, possibly due to the endodormancy completion and low-temperature responses. When trees were kept at 15âÂ°C from 3 November to 3 December in order to postpone the initiation and completion of chilling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation that would break endodormancy, sorbitol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in xylem sap was always higher from trees with sufficient chilling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation than from trees that received insufficient chilling. However, an additional increase in xylem sap sorbitol occurred around late December in trees regardless of whether their chilling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation naturally progressed or was postponed. To examine different temperature effects more closely, we compared the carbohydrate concentrations of trees subjected to either 6 or 0âÂ°C treatment. The sorbitol concentration in xylem sap tremendously increased at 0âÂ°C treatment compared with 6âÂ°C treatment. However, an additional increase in xylem sap sorbitol occurred at both the temperatures when sufficient chilling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ated with a peak coinciding with the peak expression in shoots of the sorbitol transporter gene (<i>PpSOT2</i>). Interestingly, the total carbohydrate concentration of shoots tremendously increased with exposure to 0âÂ°C compared with exposure to 6âÂ°C, but was not affected by the amount of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ated chilling. Instead, as chilling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ated the ratio of sorbitol to total soluble sugars in shoots increased. We presumed that carbohydrates in the shoot tissues may be converted to sorbitol and loaded into the xylem sap so that the sorbitol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation patterns were synchronized with the progression of dormancy, whereas the total carbohydrate transported into shoots from other storage organs may be related to freezing tolerance acquisition independent of dormancy progression. We thus propose that there are different effects of dormancy progression and low-temperature responses on carbohydrate dynamics in Japanese pear.</p>

Lgl reduces endosomal vesicle acidification and Notch signaling by promoting the interaction between Vap33 and the V-ATPase complex
<p>Epithelial cell polarity is linked to the control of tissue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and tumorigenesis. The tumor suppressor and cell polarity protein lethal-2-giant larvae (Lgl) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>es Hippo signaling and inhibits Notch signaling to restrict tissue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Notch signaling is greater in <i>lgl</i> mutant tissue than in wild-type tissue because of increased acidification of endosomal vesicles, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>es the proteolytic processing and activation of Notch by Î³-secretase. We showed that the increased Notch signaling and tissue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> defects of <i>lgl</i> mutant tissue depended on endosomal vesicle acidification mediated by the vacuolar adenosine triphosphatase (V-ATPase). Lgl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>ed the activity of the V-ATPase by interacting with Vap33 (VAMP-associated protein of 33 kDa). Vap33 physically and genetically interacted with Lgl and V-ATPase subunits and repressed V-ATPaseâmediated endosomal vesicle acidification and Notch signaling. Vap33 overexpression reduced the abundance of the V-ATPase component Vha44, whereas Lgl knockdown reduced the binding of Vap33 to the V-ATPase component Vha68-3. Our data indicate that Lgl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>es the binding of Vap33 to the V-ATPase, thus inhibiting V-ATPaseâmediated endosomal vesicle acidification and thereby reducing Î³-secretase activity, Notch signaling, and tissue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. Our findings implicate the deregulation of Vap33 and V-ATPase activity in polarity-impaired epithelial cancers.</p>

A Novel Mechanism, Linked to Cell Density, Largely Controls Cell Division in <i>Synechocystis</i>
<p>Many studies have investigated the various genetic and environmental factors regulating cyanobacterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. Here, we investigated the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and metabolism of <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 under different nitrogen sources, light intensities, and CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. Cells grown on urea showed the highest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> rates. However, for all conditions tested, the daily <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> rates in batch cultures decreased steadily over time, and stationary phase was obtained with similar cell densities. Unexpectedly, metabolic and physiological analyses showed that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> rates during log phase were not controlled primarily by the availability of photoassimilates. Further physiological investigations indicated that nutrient limitation, quorum sensing, light quality, and light intensity (self-shading) were not the main factors responsible for the decrease in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> rate and the onset of the stationary phase. Moreover, cell division rates in fed-batch cultures were positively correlated with the dilution rates. Hence, not only light, CO<sub>2</sub>, and nutrients can affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> but also a cell-cell interaction. Accordingly, we propose that cell-cell interaction may be a factor responsible for the gradual decrease of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> rates in batch cultures during log phase, culminating with the onset of stationary phase.</p>

UV-B Inhibits Leaf Growth through Changes in Growth Regulating Factors and Gibberellin Levels
<p>Ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation affects leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> in a wide range of species.

We conducted kinematic analyses of cell division and expansion to understand the impact of UV-B radiation on these cellular processes. Our results demonstrate that the decrease in leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> in UV-B-irradiated leaves is a consequence of a reduction in cell production and a shortened <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> zone (GZ).

Jasmonic Acid Enhances Al-Induced Root Growth Inhibition<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>Phytohormones such as ethylene and auxin are involved in the regulation of the aluminum (Al)-induced root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> inhibition. Although jasmonate (JA) has been reported to play a crucial role in the regulation of root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and development in response to environmental stresses through interplay with ethylene and auxin, its role in the regulation of root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> response to Al stress is not yet known. In an attempt to elucidate the role of JA, we found that exogenous application of JA enhanced the Al-induced root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> inhibition. Furthermore, phenotype analysis with mutants defective in either JA biosynthesis or signaling suggests that JA is involved in the regulation of Al-induced root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> inhibition. The expression of the JA receptor CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 (COI1) and the key JA signaling regulator MYC2 was up-regulated in response to Al stress in the root tips. This process together with COI1-mediated Al-induced root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> inhibition under Al stress was controlled by ethylene but not auxin. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that many responsive genes under Al stress were regulated by JA signaling. The differential responsive of microtubule organization-related genes between the wild-type and <i>coi1-2</i> mutant is consistent with the changed depolymerization of cortical microtubules in <i>coi1</i> under Al stress. In addition, ALMT-mediated malate exudation and thus Al exclusion from roots in response to Al stress was also regulated by COI1-mediated JA signaling. Together, this study suggests that root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> inhibition is regulated by COI1-mediated JA signaling independent from auxin signaling and provides novel insights into the phytohormone-mediated root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> inhibition in response to Al stress.</p>

The Transcription Factor ATHB5 Affects GA-Mediated Plasticity in Hypocotyl Cell Growth during Seed Germination
<p>Gibberellic acid (GA)-mediated cell expansion initiates the seed-to-seedling transition in plants and is repressed by DELLA proteins. Using digital single-cell analysis, we identified a cellular subdomain within the midhypocotyl, whose expansion drives the final step of this developmental transition under optimal conditions. Using network inference, the transcription factor ATHB5 was identified as a genetic factor whose localized expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>es GA-mediated expansion specifically within these cells. Both this protein and its putative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>ing target <i>EXPANSIN3</i> are repressed by DELLA, and coregulated at single-cell resolution during seed germination. The cellular domains of hormone sensitivity were explored within the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) embryo by putting seeds under GA-limiting conditions and quantifying cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> responses. The middle and upper hypocotyl have a greater requirement for GA to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>e cell expansion than the lower embryo axis. Under these conditions, germination was still completed following enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> within the radicle and lower axis. Under GA-limiting conditions, the <i>athb5</i> mutant did not show a phenotype at the level of seed germination, but it did at a cellular level with reduced cell expansion in the hypocotyl relative to the wild type. These data reveal that the spatiotemporal cell expansion events driving this transition are not determinate, and the conditional use of GA-ATHB5-mediated hypocotyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> under optimal conditions may be used to optionally support rapid seedling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. This study demonstrates that multiple genetic and spatiotemporal cell expansion mechanisms underlie the seed to seedling transition in Arabidopsis.</p>

Photoperiod and temperature responses of bud swelling and bud burst in four temperate forest tree species
<p>Spring phenology of temperate forest trees is optimized to maximize the length of the growing season while minimizing the risk of freezing damage. The release from winter dormancy is environmentally mediated by species-specific responses to temperature and photoperiod. We investigated the response of early spring phenology to temperature and photoperiod at different stages of dormancy release in cuttings from four temperate tree species in controlled environments. By tracking bud development, we were able to identify the onset of bud <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">swell</span></strong>ing and bud <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> in <i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i> L., <i>Fagus sylvatica</i> L., <i>Quercus petraea</i> (Mattuschka) Liebl. and <i>Picea abies</i> (L.) H. Karst. At a given early stage of dormancy release, the onset and duration of the bud <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">swell</span></strong>ing prior to bud burst are driven by concurrent temperature and photoperiod, while the maximum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> rate is temperature dependent only, except for <i>Fagus</i>, where long photoperiods also increased bud <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> rates. Similarly, the later bud burst was controlled by temperature and photoperiod (in the photoperiod sensitive species <i>Fagus, Quercus</i> and <i>Picea</i>). We conclude that photoperiod is involved in the release of dormancy during the ecodormancy phase and may influence bud burst in trees that have experienced sufficient chilling. This study explored and documented the early bud <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">swell</span></strong>ing period that precedes and defines later phenological stages such as canopy greening in conventional phenological works. It is the early bud <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> resumption that needs to be understood in order to arrive at a causal interpretation and modelling of tree phenology at a large scale. Classic spring phenology events mark visible endpoints of a cascade of processes as evidenced here.</p>

The neuropilin 2 isoform NRP2b uniquely supports TGFÎ²-mediated progression in lung cancer
<p>Neuropilins (NRP1 and NRP2) are co-receptors for heparin-binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> factors and class 3 semaphorins. Different isoforms of NRP1 and NRP2 are produced by alternative splicing. We found that in nonâsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines, transforming <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> factorâÎ² (TGFÎ²) signaling preferentially increased the abundance of NRP2b. NRP2b and NRP2a differ only in their carboxyl-terminal regions. Although the presence of NRP2b inhibited cultured cell proliferation and primary tumor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>, NRP2b enhanced cellular migration, invasion into Matrigel, and tumorsphere formation in cultured cells in response to TGFÎ² signaling and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>ed metastasis in xenograft mouse models. These effects of overexpressed NRP2b contrast with the effects of overexpressed NRP2a. Hepatocyte <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> factor (HGF)âinduced phosphorylation of the kinase AKT was specifically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>ed by NRP2b, whereas inhibiting the HGF receptor MET attenuated NRP2b-dependent cell migration. Unlike NRP2a, NRP2b did not bind the PDZ domain scaffolding protein GAIP carboxyl terminusâinteracting protein (GIPC1) and only weakly recruited phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), potentially explaining the difference between NRP2b-mediated and NRP2a-mediated effects. Analysis of NSCLC patient tumors showed that NRP2b abundance correlated with that of the immune cell checkpoint receptor ligand PD-L1 as well as with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotypes in the tumors, acquired resistance to epidermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors, disease progression, and poor survival in patients. NRP2b knockdown attenuated the acquisition of resistance to the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib in cultured NSCLC cells. Thus, in NSCLC, NRP2b contributed to the oncogenic response to TGFÎ² and correlated with tumor progression in patients.</p>

Photoperiodic control of seasonal growth is mediated by ABA acting on cell-cell communication
<p>In temperate and boreal ecosystems, seasonal cycles of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and dormancy allow perennial plants to adapt to winter conditions. We show, in hybrid aspen trees, that photoperiodic regulation of dormancy is mechanistically distinct from autumnal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> cessation. Dormancy sets in when symplastic intercellular communication through plasmodesmata is blocked by a process dependent on the phytohormone abscisic acid. The communication blockage prevents <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>ing signals from accessing the meristem. Thus, precocious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> is disallowed during dormancy. The dormant period, which supports robust survival of the aspen tree in winter, is due to loss of access to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>ing signals.</p>

Non-Enzymatic Synthesis of Bioactive Isoprostanoids in the Diatom <i>Phaeodactylum</i> following Oxidative Stress
<p>The ecological success of diatoms requires a remarkable ability to survive many types of stress, including variations in temperature, light, salinity, and nutrient availability. On exposure to these stresses, diatoms exhibit common responses, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> arrest, impairment of photosynthesis, production of reactive oxygen species, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of triacylglycerol (TAG). We studied the production of cyclopentane oxylipins derived from fatty acids in the diatom <i>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</i> in response to oxidative stress. <i>P. tricornutum</i> lacks the enzymatic pathway for producing cyclopentane-oxylipins, such as jasmonate, prostaglandins, or thromboxanes. In cells subjected to increasing doses of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), we detected nonenzymatic production of isoprostanoids, including six phytoprostanes, three F<sub>2t</sub>-isoprostanes, two F<sub>3t</sub>-isoprostanes, and three F<sub>4t</sub>-neuroprostanes, by radical peroxidation of Î±-linolenic, arachidonic, eicosapentaenoic, and docosahexanoic acids, respectively. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> also triggered photosynthesis impairment and TAG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation. F<sub>1t</sub>-phytoprostanes constitute the major class detected (300 pmol per 1 million cells; intracellular concentration, â¼4 Âµ<sc>m</sc>). Only two glycerolipids, phosphatidylcholine and diacylglycerylhydroxymethyl-trimethyl-alanine, could provide all substrates for these isoprostanoids. Treatment of <i>P. tricornutum</i> with nine synthetic isoprostanoids produced an effect in the micromolar range, marked by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of TAG and reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>, without affecting photosynthesis. Therefore, the emission of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and free radicals upon exposure to stresses can lead to glycerolipid peroxidation and nonenzymatic synthesis of isoprostanoids, inhibiting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and contributing to the induction of TAG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation via unknown processes. This characterization of nonenzymatic oxylipins in <i>P. tricornutum</i> opens a field of research on the study of processes controlled by isoprostanoid signaling in various physiological and environmental contexts in diatoms.</p>

RAPTOR Controls Developmental Growth Transitions by Altering the Hormonal and Metabolic Balance
<p>Vegetative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> requires the systemic coordination of numerous cellular processes, which are controlled by regulatory proteins that monitor extracellular and intracellular cues and translate them into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> decisions. In eukaryotes, one of the central factors regulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> is the serine/threonine protein kinase Target of Rapamycin (TOR), which forms complexes with regulatory proteins. To understand the function of one such regulatory protein, Regulatory-Associated Protein of TOR 1B (RAPTOR1B), in plants, we analyzed the effect of <i>raptor1b</i> mutations on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and physiology in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) by detailed phenotyping, metabolomic, lipidomic, and proteomic analyses. Mutation of <i>RAPTOR1B</i> resulted in a strong reduction of TOR kinase activity, leading to massive changes in central carbon and nitrogen metabolism, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of excess starch, and induction of autophagy. These shifts led to a significant reduction of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> that occurred nonlinearly during developmental stage transitions. This phenotype was accompanied by changes in cell morphology and tissue anatomy. In contrast to previous studies in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), we found that the Arabidopsis <i>raptor1b</i> mutation did not affect chloroplast development or photosynthetic electron transport efficiency; however, it resulted in decreased CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate and increased stomatal conductance. The <i>raptor1b</i> mutants also had reduced abscisic acid levels. Surprisingly, abscisic acid feeding experiments resulted in partial complementation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> phenotypes, indicating the tight interaction between TOR function and hormone synthesis and signaling in plants.</p>

The ADAPTOR PROTEIN-3 Complex Mediates Pollen Tube Growth by Coordinating Vacuolar Targeting and Organization
<p>Pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> is an essential step for successful plant reproduction. Vacuolar trafficking and dynamic organization are important for pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>; however, the key proteins involved in these processes are not well understood. Here, we report that the ADAPTOR PROTEIN-3 (AP-3) complex and its tonoplast cargo PROTEIN S-ACYL TRANSFERASE10 (PAT10) are critical for pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). AP-3 is a heterotetrameric protein complex consisting of four subunits, Î´, Î², Âµ, and Ï. AP-3 regulates tonoplast targeting of several cargoes, such as PAT10. We show that functional loss of any of the four AP-3 subunits reduces plant fertility. In <i>ap-3</i> mutants, pollen development was normal but pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> was compromised, leading to reduced male transmission. Functional loss of <i>PAT10</i> caused a similar reduction in pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>, suggesting that the tonoplast association of PAT10 mediated by AP-3 is crucial for this process. Indeed, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> gradient during pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> was reduced significantly due to <i>AP-3</i> loss of function, consistent with the abnormal targeting of CALCINUERIN B-LIKE2 (CBL2) and CBL3, whose tonoplast association depends on PAT10. Furthermore, we show that the pollen tubes of <i>ap-3</i> mutants have vacuoles with simplified tubules and bulbous structures, indicating that AP-3 affects vacuolar organization. Our results demonstrate a role for AP-3 in plant reproduction and provide insights into the role of vacuoles in polarized cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>.</p>

SIAMESE-RELATED1 Is Regulated Posttranslationally and Participates in Repression of Leaf Growth under Moderate Drought
<p>The plant cell cycle is tightly regulated by factors that integrate endogenous cues and environmental signals to adapt plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> to changing conditions. Under drought, cell division in young leaves is blocked by an active mechanism, reducing the evaporative surface and conserving energy resources. The molecular function of cyclin-dependent kinase-inhibitory proteins (CKIs) in regulating the cell cycle has already been well studied, but little is known about their involvement in cell cycle regulation under adverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> conditions. In this study, we show that the transcript of the CKI gene <i>SIAMESE-RELATED1</i> (<i>SMR1</i>) is quickly induced under moderate drought in young Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves. Functional characterization further revealed that SMR1 inhibits cell division and affects meristem activity, thereby restricting the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> of leaves and roots. Moreover, we demonstrate that SMR1 is a short-lived protein that is degraded by the 26S proteasome after being ubiquitinated by a Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase. Consequently, overexpression of a more stable variant of the SMR1 protein leads to a much stronger phenotype than overexpression of the native SMR1. Under moderate drought, both the <i>SMR1</i> transcript and SMR1 protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ate. Despite this induction, <i>smr1</i> mutants do not show overall tolerance to drought stress but do show less <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> inhibition of young leaves under drought. Surprisingly, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>-repressive hormone ethylene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>es <i>SMR1</i> induction, but the classical drought hormone abscisic acid does not.</p>

Root Cell-Specific Regulators of Phosphate-Dependent Growth
<p>Cellular specialization in abiotic stress responses is an important regulatory feature driving plant acclimation. Our in silico approach of iterative coexpression, interaction, and enrichment analyses predicted root cell-specific regulators of phosphate starvation response networks in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). This included three uncharacterized genes termed Phosphate starvation-induced gene interacting Root Cell Enriched (<i>PRCE1</i>, <i>PRCE2</i>, and <i>PRCE3</i>). Root cell-specific enrichment of 12 candidates was confirmed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>er-GFP lines. T-DNA insertion lines of 11 genes showed changes in phosphate status and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> responses to phosphate availability compared with the wild type. Some mutants (<i>cbl1</i>, <i>cipk2</i>, <i>prce3</i>, and <i>wdd1</i>) displayed strong biomass gain irrespective of phosphate supply, while others (<i>cipk14</i>, <i>mfs1</i>, <i>prce1</i>, <i>prce2</i>, and <i>s6k2</i>) were able to sustain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> under low phosphate supply better than the wild type. Notably, root or shoot phosphate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation did not strictly correlate with organ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. Mutant response patterns markedly differed from those of master regulators of phosphate homeostasis, <i>PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE1</i> (<i>PHR1</i>) and <i>PHOSPHATE2</i> (<i>PHO2</i>), demonstrating that negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> responses in the latter can be overcome when cell-specific regulators are targeted. RNA sequencing analysis highlighted the transcriptomic plasticity in these mutants and revealed PHR1-dependent and -independent regulatory circuits with gene coexpression profiles that were highly correlated to the quantified physiological traits. The results demonstrate how in silico prediction of cell-specific, stress-responsive genes uncovers key regulators and how their manipulation can have positive impacts on plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> under abiotic stress.</p>

EXO70C2 Is a Key Regulatory Factor for Optimal Tip Growth of Pollen
<p>The exocyst, a eukaryotic tethering complex, coregulates targeted exocytosis as an effector of small GTPases in polarized cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. In land plants, several exocyst subunits are encoded by double or triple paralogs, culminating in tens of EXO70 paralogs. Out of 23 <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> EXO70 isoforms, we analyzed seven isoforms expressed in pollen. Genetic and microscopic analyses of single mutants in <i>EXO70A2</i>, <i>EXO70C1</i>, <i>EXO70C2</i>, <i>EXO70F1</i>, <i>EXO70H3</i>, <i>EXO70H5</i>, and <i>EXO70H6</i> genes revealed that only a loss-of-function <i>EXO70C2</i> allele resulted in a significant male-specific transmission defect (segregation 40%:51%:9%) due to aberrant pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. Mutant pollen tubes grown in vitro exhibited an enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> rate and a decreased thickness of the tip cell wall, causing tip bursts. However, <i>exo70C2</i> pollen tubes could frequently recover and restart their speedy elongation, resulting in a repetitive stop-and-go <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> dynamics. A pollen-specific depletion of the closest paralog, <i>EXO70C1</i>, using artificial microRNA in the <i>exo70C2</i> mutant background, resulted in a complete pollen-specific transmission defect, suggesting redundant functions of EXO70C1 and EXO70C2. Both EXO70C1 and EXO70C2, GFP tagged and expressed under the control of their native <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>ers, localized in the cytoplasm of pollen grains, pollen tubes, and also root trichoblast cells. The expression of EXO70C2-GFP complemented the aberrant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> of <i>exo70C2</i> pollen tubes. The absent EXO70C2 interactions with core exocyst subunits in the yeast two-hybrid assay, cytoplasmic localization, and genetic effect suggest an unconventional EXO70 function possibly as a regulator of exocytosis outside the exocyst complex. In conclusion, EXO70C2 is a novel factor contributing to the regulation of optimal tip <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> of Arabidopsis pollen tubes.</p>

The Microtubule-Associated Protein MAP18 Affects ROP2 GTPase Activity during Root Hair Growth
<p>Establishment and maintenance of the polar site are important for root hair tip <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. We previously reported that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN18 (MAP18) functions in controlling the direction of pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and root hair elongation. Additionally, the Rop GTPase ROP2 was reported as a positive regulator of both root hair initiation and tip <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> in Arabidopsis. Both loss of function of <i>ROP2</i> and knockdown of <i>MAP18</i> lead to a decrease in root hair length, whereas overexpression of either <i>MAP18</i> or <i>ROP2</i> causes multiple tips or a branching hair phenotype. However, it is unclear whether MAP18 and ROP2 coordinately regulate root hair <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. In this study, we demonstrate that MAP18 and ROP2 interact genetically and functionally. MAP18 interacts physically with ROP2 in vitro and in vivo and preferentially binds to the inactive form of the ROP2 protein. MAP18 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>es ROP2 activity during root hair tip <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. Further investigation revealed that MAP18 competes with RhoGTPase GDP DISSOCIATION INHIBITOR1/SUPERCENTIPEDE1 for binding to ROP2, in turn affecting the localization of active ROP2 in the plasma membrane of the root hair tip. These results reveal a novel function of MAP18 in the regulation of ROP2 activation during root hair <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>.</p>

MYB89 Transcription Factor Represses Seed Oil Accumulation
<p>In many higher plants, seed oil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation is precisely controlled by intricate multilevel regulatory networks, among which transcriptional regulation mainly influences oil biosynthesis. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the master positive transcription factors, <i>WRINKLED1</i> (<i>WRI1</i>) and <i>LEAFY COTYLEDON1-LIKE</i> (<i>L1L</i>), are important for seed oil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation. We found that an R2R3-MYB transcription factor, MYB89, was expressed predominantly in developing seeds during maturation. Oil and major fatty acid biosynthesis in seeds was significantly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>ed by <i>myb89-1</i> mutation and <i>MYB89</i> knockdown; thus, MYB89 was an important repressor during seed oil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation. RNA sequencing revealed remarkable up-regulation of numerous genes involved in seed oil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in <i>myb89</i> seeds at 12 d after pollination. Posttranslational activation of a MYB89-glucocorticoid receptor fusion protein and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that MYB89 inhibited seed oil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation by directly repressing <i>WRI1</i> and five key genes and by indirectly suppressing <i>L1L</i> and 11 key genes involved in oil biosynthesis during seed maturation.

High-CO<sub>2</sub>/Hypoxia-Responsive Transcription Factors DkERF24 and DkWRKY1 Interact and Activate <i>DkPDC2</i> Promoter
<p>Identification and functional characterization of hypoxia-responsive transcription factors is important for understanding plant responses to natural anaerobic environments and during storage and transport of fresh horticultural products. In this study, yeast one-hybrid library screening using the persimmon (<i>Diospyros kaki</i>) pyruvate decarboxylase (<i>DkPDC2</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>er identified three ethylene response factor (ERF) genes (<i>DkERF23</i>/<i>DkERF24</i>/<i>DkERF25</i>) and four WRKY transcription factor genes (<i>DkWRKY/DdkWRKY5</i>/<i>DkWRKY6</i>/<i>DkWRKY7</i>) that were differentially expressed in response to high CO<sub>2</sub> (95%, with 4% N<sub>2</sub> and 1% oxygen) and high N<sub>2</sub> (99% N<sub>2</sub> and 1% oxygen). Yeast one-hybrid assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that DkERF23, DkERF24, DkERF25, DkWRKY6, and DkWRKY7 could directly bind to the <i>DkPDC2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>er. Dual-luciferase assays confirmed that these transcription factors were capable of transactivating the <i>DkPDC2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>er. DkERF24 and DkWRKY1 in combination synergistically transactivated the <i>DkPDC2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>er, and yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays confirmed proteinâprotein interaction between DkERF24 and DkWRKY1. Transient overexpression of <i>DkERF24</i> and <i>DkWRKY1</i> separately and in combination in persimmon fruit discs was effective in maintaining insolubilization of tannins, concomitantly with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of DkPDC2 transcripts. Studies with Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) homologs <i>AtERF1</i> and <i>AtWRKY53</i> indicated that similar proteinâprotein interactions and synergistic regulatory effects also occur with the <i>DkPDC2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>er.

Ascorbic Acid Integrates the Antagonistic Modulation of Ethylene and Abscisic Acid in the Accumulation of Reactive Oxygen Species
<p>During plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and development, ethylene and abscisic acid (ABA) play important roles and exert synergistic or antagonistic effects on various biological processes, but the detailed mechanism underlying the interaction of the two phytohormones, especially in the regulation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), is largely unclear. Here, we report that ethylene inhibits but ABA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>es the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of ROS in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings. Furthermore, changes in the biosynthesis of ascorbic acid (AsA) act as a key factor in integrating the interaction of ethylene and ABA in the regulation of ROS levels. We found that ethylene and ABA antagonistically regulate AsA biosynthesis via ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3) and ABA INSENSITIVE4 (ABI4), which are key factors in the ethylene and ABA signaling pathways, respectively. In addition, <i>ABI4</i> is transcriptionally repressed by EIN3 in ethylene-regulated AsA biosynthesis. Via transcriptome analysis and molecular and genetic experiments, we identified <i>VITAMIN C DEFECTIVE2</i>as the direct target of ABI4 in the regulation of AsA biosynthesis and ROS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation. Thus, the EIN3-ABI4- <i>VITAMIN C DEFECTIVE2</i> transcriptional cascade involves a mechanism by which ethylene and ABA antagonistically regulate AsA biosynthesis and ROS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in response to complex environmental stimuli.</p>

The Î<i>hda-2</i> strain was impaired in its ability to colonize Arabidopsis roots, thus affecting the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>ion of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and modulation of plant defenses against foliar pathogens <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> and <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i>, which normally result from interaction with <i>T. atroviride</i>. Furthermore, Î<i>hda-2</i> VOCs were incapable of triggering plant defenses to counterattack foliar pathogens. The Î<i>hda-2</i> overproduced the VOC 6-pentyl-2H-pyran-2-one (6-PP), which resulted in enhanced root branching and differentially regulated phytohormone-related genes. Analysis of ten VOCs (including 6-PP) revealed that three of them positively regulated plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>, whereas six had the opposite effect. Assessment of secondary metabolites, detoxification, and communication with plant-related genes showed a dual role for HDA-2 in <i>T. atroviride</i> gene expression regulation during its interaction with plants. Chromatin immunoprecipitation of acetylated histone H3 on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>ers of plant-responsive genes in Î<i>hda-2</i> showed, in the presence of Arabidopsis, low levels of <i>epl-1</i> and <i>abc-2</i> compared with that in the wild type; whereas <i>ctf-1</i> presented high constitutive levels, supporting a dual role of HDA-2 in gene regulation. This work highlights the importance of HDA-2 as a global regulator in <i>Trichoderma</i> to modulate multiple responses in Arabidopsis.</p>

SlHY5 Integrates Temperature, Light, and Hormone Signaling to Balance Plant Growth and Cold Tolerance
<p>During the transition from warm to cool seasons, plants experience decreased temperatures, shortened days, and decreased red/far-red (R/FR) ratios of light. The mechanism by which plants integrate these environmental cues to maintain plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and adaptation remains poorly understood. Here, we report that low temperature induced the transcription of <i>PHYTOCHROME A</i> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of LONG HYPOCOTYL5 (SlHY5, a basic Leu zipper transcription factor) in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) plants, especially under short day conditions with low R/FR light ratios. Reverse genetic approaches and physiological analyses revealed that silencing of <i>SlHY5</i> increased cold susceptibility in tomato plants, whereas overexpression of <i>SlHY5</i> enhanced cold tolerance. SlHY5 directly bound to and activated the transcription of genes encoding a gibberellin-inactivation enzyme, namely <i>GIBBERELLIN2-OXIDASE4</i>, and an abscisic acid biosynthetic enzyme, namely <i>9-CIS-EPOXYCAROTENOID DIOXYGENASE6</i> (<i>SlNCED6</i>). Thus, phytochrome A-dependent SlHY5 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation resulted in an increased abscisic acid/gibberellin ratio, which was accompanied by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> cessation and induction of cold response. Furthermore, silencing of <i>SlNCED6</i> compromises short day- and low R/FR-induced tomato resistance to cold stress. These findings provide insight into the molecular genetic mechanisms by which plants integrate environmental stimuli with hormones to coordinate their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> with impending cold temperatures. Moreover, this work reveals a molecular mechanism that plants have evolved for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and survival in response to seasonal changes.</p>

EPFL Signals in the Boundary Region of the SAM Restrict Its Size and Promote Leaf Initiation
<p>The shoot apical meristem (SAM) enables the formation of new organs throughout the life of a plant. ERECTA family (ERf) receptors restrict SAM size and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>e initiation of leaves while simultaneously supporting establishment of correct phyllotaxy. In the epidermis and during organ elongation ERf activity is regulated by a family of Epidermal Patterning Factor-Like (EPFL) secreted Cys-rich small proteins. Here we show that ERfs play a critical role in communication between the SAM leaf boundary and the central zone in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Ectopic expression of <i>ERECTA</i> in the central zone using the <i>CLAVATA3</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>er is sufficient to restrict meristem size and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>e leaf initiation. Genetic analysis demonstrated that four putative ligands: EPFL1, EPFL2, EPFL4, and EPFL6 function redundantly in the SAM. These genes are expressed at the SAM-leaf boundary and in the peripheral zone. Previously EPFL4 and EPFL6 have been linked with elongation of aboveground organs. Here we demonstrate that EPFL1 and EPFL2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>e organ elongation as well. In addition, we show that expression of <i>ERECTA</i> in the central zone of the SAM has a strong impact on elongation of internodes and pedicels and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> of leaves. These results suggest that ERfs can stimulate organ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> cell nonautonomously.</p>

Singlet Oxygen Plays an Essential Role in the Rootâs Response to Osmotic Stress
<p>The high osmotic potentials in plants subjected to drought stress can be mimicked by the application of high molecular weight polyethylene glycol. Here, we quantified the effects of exposure to polyethylene glycol on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> of the main and lateral roots of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings. The effects on root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> were highly correlated with the appearance of singlet oxygen, as visualized using the singlet oxygen-specific probe singlet oxygen sensor green. The production of singlet oxygen was followed by cell death, as indicated by the intracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of propidium iodide due to the loss of membrane integrity. Cell death began in the epidermal region of the root tip and spread in a dynamic manner to meristematic sections. In parallel, gene expression changes specific to the presence of singlet oxygen were observed. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of other reactive oxygen species, namely hydrogen, peroxide, nitric oxide, and superoxide, did not correlate with cell death. In addition, both the singlet oxygen scavenger His and the lipoxygenase inhibitor salicylhydroxamic acid specifically inhibited singlet oxygen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation and cell death. These results suggest a light-independent, type-I source of singlet oxygen production. Serpin-protease interactions were used as a model to assess the possibility of vacuolar-type cell death. Osmotic stress induced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of complexes between the cytoplasmic serpin AtSERPIN1 and its cognate vacuolar proteases, indicating that vacuolar integrity was compromised. These findings imply that singlet oxygen plays an essential role in conveying the root response to osmotic stress.</p>

<i>Medicago</i> Plants Control Nodulation by Regulating Proteolysis of the Receptor-Like Kinase DMI2
<p>Plants use receptor-like kinases to monitor environmental changes and transduce signals into plant cells. The <i>Medicago truncatula</i> (hereafter <i>M</i>. <i>truncatula</i>) DOES NOT MAKE INFECTIONS2 (DMI2) protein functions as a coreceptor of rhizobial signals to initiate nodule development and rhizobial infection during nitrogen-fixing symbiosis, but the mechanisms regulating DMI2 protein level and folding are still unknown. Here, we report that DMI2 protein abundance changes during nitrogen-fixing symbiosis. DMI2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ates in the nodules and is induced by rhizobia treatment through a posttranscriptional process. However, DMI2 induction is independent of the perception of Nod factor, a group of lipochitooligosaccharides secreted by rhizobia. The stability of the DMI2 protein is controlled by the proteasome pathway: in rhizobia-free environments, DMI2 is degraded by the proteasome, but during rhizobial infection, DMI2 is protected from the proteasome, resulting in protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation. Furthermore, proteasome inhibitor-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>ed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of DMI2 protein in <i>Medicago</i> roots induces the expression of two early nodulation marker genes, supporting the hypothesis that DMI2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation activates downstream symbiosis signaling. The extracellular region of DMI2 contains two malectin-like domains (MLDs) and a leucine-rich repeat. When conserved amino acids in the MLDs are mutated, DMI2 fails to restore nodule development in <i>dmi2</i> mutants, and point-mutated MLD proteins are degraded constitutively, suggesting that the MLD may be vital for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of DMI2. Our findings suggest that legumes control nodule development through modulating the protein level of DMI2, revealing a layer of regulation in the interaction between plants and rhizobia in nitrogen-fixing symbiosis.</p>

Plant Temperature Acclimation and Growth Rely on Cytosolic Ribosome Biogenesis Factor Homologs
<p>Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) REI1-LIKE (REIL) proteins, REIL1 and REIL2, are homologs of a yeast ribosome biogenesis factor that participates in late cytoplasmic 60S ribosomal subunit maturation. Here, we report that the inhibited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> of the <i>reil1-1 reil2-1</i> mutant at 10Â°C can be rescued by the expression of amino-terminal FLUORESCENT PROTEIN (FP)-REIL fusions driven by the <i>UBIQUITIN10</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>er, allowing the analysis of REIL function in planta. Arabidopsis REIL1 appears to be functionally conserved, based on the cytosolic localization of FP-REIL1 and the interaction of native REIL1 with the 60S subunit in wild-type plants. In contrast to its yeast homologs, REIL1 also was present in translating ribosome fractions. Systems analysis revealed that wild-type Arabidopsis remodels the cytosolic translation machinery when grown at 10Â°C by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ating cytosolic ribosome subunits and inducing the expression of cytosolic ribosomal RNA, ribosomal genes, ribosome biogenesis factors, and translation initiation or elongation factors. In the <i>reil1-1 reil2-1</i> mutant, all processes associated with inhibited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> were delayed, although the plants maintained cellular integrity or acquired freezing tolerance. REIL proteins also were implicated in plant-specific processes: nonacclimated <i>reil1-1 reil2-1</i> exhibited cold-acclimation responses, including activation of the DREB/CBF regulon. In addition, acclimated <i>reil1-1 reil2-1</i> plants failed to activate <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T</i> expression in mature leaves. Therefore, in the wild type, REIL function may contribute to temperature perception by suppressing premature cold responses during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> at nonstressful temperatures. In conclusion, we suggest that Arabidopsis REIL proteins influence cold-induced plant ribosome remodeling and enhance the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of cytosolic ribosome subunits after cold shift either by de novo synthesis or by recycling them from the translating ribosome fraction.</p>

A Tonoplast Sugar Transporter Underlies a Sugar Accumulation QTL in Watermelon
<p>How sugar transporters regulate sugar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in fruits is poorly understood and particularly so for species storing high-concentration Suc. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of soluble sugars in watermelon (<i>Citrullus lanatus</i>) fruit, a major quality trait, had been selected during domestication. Still, the molecular mechanisms controlling this quantitative trait are unknown. We resequenced 96 recombinant inbred lines, derived from crossing sweet and unsweet accessions, to narrow down the size of a previously described sugar content quantitative trait locus, which contains a putative <i>Tonoplast Sugar Transporter</i> gene (<i>ClTST2</i>). Molecular and biochemical analyses indicated that <i>ClTST2</i> encodes a vacuolar membrane protein, whose expression is associated with tonoplast uptake and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of sugars in watermelon fruit flesh cells. We measured fruit sugar content and resequenced the genomic region surrounding <i>ClTST2</i> in 400 watermelon accessions and associated the most sugar-related significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to the <i>ClTST2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>er. Large-scale population analyses strongly suggest increased expression of <i>ClTST2</i> as a major molecular event in watermelon domestication associated with a selection sweep around the <i>ClTST2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>er. Further molecular analyses explored the binding of a sugar-induced transcription factor (<i>SUSIWM1</i>) to a sugar-responsive cisâelement within the <i>ClTST2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>er, which contains the quantitative trait locus (QTL) causal SNP. The functional characterization of <i>ClTST2</i> and its expression regulation by <i>SUSIWM1</i> provide novel tools to increase sugar sink potency in watermelon and possibly in other vegetable and fruit crops.</p>

Proline Accumulation Is Regulated by Transcription Factors Associated with Phosphate Starvation
<p>Pro <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in plants is a well-documented physiological response to osmotic stress caused by drought or salinity. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the stress and ABA-induced Î1-PYRROLINE-5-CARBOXYLATE SYNTHETASE1 (<i>P5CS1</i>) gene was previously shown to control Pro biosynthesis in such adverse conditions. To identify regulatory factors that control the transcription of <i>P5CS1</i>, Y1H screens were performed with a genomic fragment of <i>P5CS1</i>, containing 1.2-kB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>er and 0.8-kb transcribed regions. The myeloblastosis (MYB)-type transcription factors PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE1 (PHR1) and PHR1-LIKE1 (PHL1) were identified to bind to <i>P5CS1</i> regulatory sequences in the first intron, which carries a conserved PHR1-binding site (P1BS) motif. Binding of PHR1 and PHL1 factors to P1BS was confirmed by Y1H, electrophoretic mobility assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation. Phosphate starvation led to gradual increase in Pro content in wild-type Arabidopsis plants as well as transcriptional activation of <i>P5CS1</i> and PRO DEHYDROGENASE2 genes. Induction of <i>P5CS1</i> transcription and Pro <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation during phosphate deficiency was considerably reduced by <i>phr1</i> and <i>phl1</i> mutations and was impaired in the ABA-deficient <i>aba2-3</i> and ABA-insensitive <i>abi4-1</i> mutants. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and viability of <i>phr1phl1</i> double mutant was significantly reduced in phosphate-depleted medium, while <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> was only marginally affected in the <i>aba2-3</i> mutants, suggesting that ABA is implicated in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> retardation in such nutritional stress. Our results reveal a previously unknown link between Pro metabolism and phosphate nutrition and show that Pro biosynthesis is target of cross talk between ABA signaling and regulation of phosphate homeostasis through PHR1- and PHL1-mediated transcriptional activation of the <i>P5CS1</i> gene.</p>

Circadian, Carbon, and Light Control of Expansion Growth and Leaf Movement
<p>We used Phytotyping<sup>4D</sup> to investigate the contribution of clock and light signaling to the diurnal regulation of rosette expansion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and leaf movement in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Wild-type plants and clock mutants with a short (<i>lhycca1</i>) and long (<i>prr7prr9</i>) period were analyzed in a T24 cycle and in T-cycles that were closer to the mutantsâ period. Wild types also were analyzed in various photoperiods and after transfer to free-running light or darkness. Rosette expansion and leaf movement exhibited a circadian oscillation, with superimposed transients after dawn and dusk. Diurnal responses were modified in clock mutants. <i>lhycca1</i> exhibited an inhibition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> at the end of night and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> rose earlier after dawn, whereas <i>prr7prr9</i> showed decreased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> for the first part of the light period. Some features were partly rescued by a matching T-cycle, like the inhibition in <i>lhycca1</i> at the end of the night, indicating that it is due to premature exhaustion of starch. Other features were not rescued, revealing that the clock also regulates expansion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> more directly. Expansion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> was faster at night than in the daytime, whereas published work has shown that the synthesis of cellular components is faster in the day than at nighttime. This temporal uncoupling became larger in short photoperiods and may reflect the differing dependence of expansion and biosynthesis on energy, carbon, and water. While it has been proposed that leaf expansion and movement are causally linked, we did not observe a consistent temporal relationship between expansion and leaf movement.</p>

The REVEILLE Clock Genes Inhibit Growth of Juvenile and Adult Plants by Control of Cell Size
<p>The circadian clock is a complex regulatory network that enhances plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and fitness in a constantly changing environment. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the clock is composed of numerous regulatory feedback loops in which <i>REVEILLE8</i> (<i>RVE8</i>) and its homologs <i>RVE4</i> and <i>RVE6</i> act in a partially redundant manner to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promot</span></strong>e clock pace. Here, we report that the remaining members of the <i>RVE8</i> clade, <i>RVE3</i> and <i>RVE5</i>, play only minor roles in the regulation of clock function. However, we find that RVE8 clade proteins have unexpected functions in the modulation of light input to the clock and the control of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> at multiple stages of development. In seedlings, these proteins repress hypocotyl elongation in a daylength- and sucrose-dependent manner. Strikingly, adult <i>rve4 6 8</i> and <i>rve3 4 5 6 8</i> mutants are much larger than wild-type plants, with both increased leaf area and biomass. This size phenotype is associated with a faster <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> rate and larger cell size and is not simply due to a delay in the transition to flowering. Gene expression and epistasis analysis reveal that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> phenotypes of <i>rve</i> mutants are due to the misregulation of <i>PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR4</i> (<i>PIF4</i>) and <i>PIF5</i> expression. Our results show that even small changes in <i>PIF</i> gene expression caused by the perturbation of clock gene function can have large effects on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> of adult plants.</p>

Coherent single-atom superradiance
<p>Superradiance is a quantum phenomenon emerging in macroscopic systems whereby correlated single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s cooperatively emit photons. Demonstration of controlled collective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>-field interactions has resulted from the ability to directly imprint correlations with an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic ensemble. Here we report cavity-mediated coherent single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> superradiance: Single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s with predefined correlation traverse a high–quality factor cavity one by one, emitting photons cooperatively with the <i>N</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s that have already gone through the cavity (<i>N</i> represents the number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s). Enhanced collective photoemission of <i>N</i>-squared dependence was observed even when the intracavity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> number was less than unity. The correlation among single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s was achieved by nanometer-precision position control and phase-aligned state manipulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s by using a nanohole-array aperture. Our results demonstrate a platform for phase-controlled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>-field interactions.</p>

Observation of magnetically tunable Feshbach resonances in ultracold <sup>23</sup>Na<sup>40</sup>K + <sup>40</sup>K collisions
<p>Resonances in ultracold collisions involving heavy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es are difficult to simulate theoretically and have proven challenging to detect. Here we report the observation of magnetically tunable Feshbach resonances in ultracold collisions between potassium-40 (<sup>40</sup>K) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s and sodium-23–potassium-40 (<sup>23</sup>Na<sup>40</sup>K) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es in the rovibrational ground state. We prepare the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es in various hyperfine levels of their ground states and observe the loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es as a function of the magnetic field. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e Feshbach resonances are identified by observing an enhancement of the loss. We have observed 11 resonances in the magnetic field range of 43 to 120 gauss. The observed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e Feshbach resonances at ultralow temperatures probe the three-body potential energy surface with exceptional resolution and will help to improve understanding of ultracold collisions.</p>

Hyperfine interaction of individual atoms on a surface
<p>Taking advantage of nuclear spins for electronic structure analysis, magnetic resonance imaging, and quantum devices hinges on knowledge and control of the surrounding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic-scale environment. We measured and manipulated the hyperfine interaction of individual iron and titanium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s placed on a magnesium oxide surface by using spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy in combination with single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> electron spin resonance. Using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> manipulation to move single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s, we found that the hyperfine interaction strongly depended on the binding configuration of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>. We could extract <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>- and position-dependent information about the electronic ground state, the state mixing with neighboring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s, and properties of the nuclear spin. Thus, the hyperfine spectrum becomes a powerful probe of the chemical environment of individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s and nanostructures.</p>

CD301b/MGL2<sup>+</sup> Mononuclear Phagocytes Orchestrate Autoimmune Cardiac Valve Inflammation and Fibrosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Valvular heart disease is common and affects the mitral valve (MV) most frequently. Despite the pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valenc</span></strong>e of MV disease (MVD), the cellular and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>ar pathways that initiate and perpetuate it are not well understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>K/B.g7 T-cell receptor transgenic mice spontaneously develop systemic autoantibody-associated autoimmunity, leading to fully penetrant fibroinflammatory MVD and arthritis. We used multiparameter flow cytometry, intracellular cytokine staining, and immunofluorescent staining to characterize the cells in inflamed K/B.g7 MVs. We used genetic approaches to study the contribution of mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) to MVD in this model. Specifically, we generated K/B.g7 mice in which either CX3CR1 or CD301b/macrophage galactose <i>N</i>-acetylgalactosamine–specific lectin 2 (MGL2)–expressing MNPs were ablated. Using K/B.g7 mice expressing <i>Cx3Cr1</i>-Cre, we conditionally deleted critical inflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es from MNPs, including the Fc-receptor signal-transducing tyrosine kinase Syk and the cell adhesion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e very late antigen–4. We performed complementary studies using monoclonal antibodies to block key inflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es. We generated bone marrow chimeric mice to define the origin of the inflammatory cells present in the MV and to determine which valve cells respond to the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Finally, we examined specimens from patients with rheumatic heart disease to correlate our findings to human pathology.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>MNPs comprised the vast majority of MV-infiltrating cells; these MNPs expressed CX3CR1 and CD301b/MGL2. Analogous cells were present in human rheumatic heart disease valves. K/B.g7 mice lacking CX3CR1 or in which CD301b/MGL2-expressing MNPs were ablated were protected from MVD. The valve-infiltrating CD301b/MGL2<sup>+</sup> MNPs expressed tissue-reparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es including arginase-1 and resistin-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e α. These MNPs also expressed the proinflammatory cytokines TNF and interleukin-6, and antibody blockade of these cytokines prevented MVD. Deleting Syk from CX3CR1-expressing MNPs reduced their TNF and interleukin-6 production and also prevented MVD. TNF acted through TNF receptor–1 expressed on valve-resident cells to increase the expression of vascular cell adhesion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e–1. Conditionally deleting the vascular cell adhesion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e-1 ligand very late antigen–4 from CX3CR1-expressing MNPs prevented MVD.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>CD301b/MGL2<sup>+</sup> MNPs are key drivers of autoimmune MVD in K/B.g7 mice and are also present in human rheumatic heart disease. We define key inflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es that drive MVD in this model, including Syk, TNF, interleukin-6, very late antigen–4, and vascular cell adhesion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e–1.</p></sec>

Probing and imaging spin interactions with a magnetic single-molecule sensor
<p>Magnetic single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es are receiving intensifying research focus because of their potential as the smallest possible memory, spintronic, and qubit elements. Scanning probe microscopes used to study these systems have benefited greatly from new techniques that use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e-functionalized tips to enhance spatial and spectroscopic resolutions and enable new sensing capabilities. We demonstrate a microscopy technique that uses a magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e, Ni(cyclopentadienyl)<sub>2</sub>, adsorbed at the apex of a scanning probe tip, to sense exchange interactions with another <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e adsorbed on a Ag(110) surface in a continuously tunable fashion in all three spatial directions. We further used the probe to image contours of exchange interaction strength, revealing angstrom-scale regions where the quantum states of two magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es strongly mix. Our results pave the way for new nanoscale imaging capabilities based on magnetic single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e sensors.</p>

Entanglement between two spatially separated atomic modes
<p>Modern quantum technologies in the fields of quantum computing, quantum simulation, and quantum metrology require the creation and control of large ensembles of entangled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es. In ultracold ensembles of neutral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s, nonclassical states have been generated with mutual entanglement among thousands of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es. The entanglement generation relies on the fundamental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e-exchange symmetry in ensembles of identical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es, which lacks the standard notion of entanglement between clearly definable subsystems. Here, we present the generation of entanglement between two spatially separated clouds by splitting an ensemble of ultracold identical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es prepared in a twin Fock state. Because the clouds can be addressed individually, our experiments open a path to exploit the available entangled states of indistinguishable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es for quantum information applications.</p>

Creation of a Bose-condensed gas of <sup>87</sup>Rb by laser cooling
<p>Protocols for attaining quantum degeneracy in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic gases almost exclusively rely on evaporative cooling, a time-consuming final step associated with substantial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> loss. We demonstrate direct laser cooling of a gas of rubidium-87 (<sup>87</sup>Rb) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s to quantum degeneracy. The method is fast and induces little <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> loss. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s are trapped in a two-dimensional optical lattice that enables cycles of compression to increase the density, followed by Raman sideband cooling to decrease the temperature. From a starting number of 2000 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s, 1400 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s reach quantum degeneracy in 300 milliseconds, as confirmed by a bimodal velocity distribution. The method should be broadly applicable to many bosonic and fermionic species and to systems where evaporative cooling is not possible.</p>

Large-amplitude transfer motion of hydrated excess protons mapped by ultrafast 2D IR spectroscopy
<p>Solvation and transport of excess <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>s in aqueous systems play a fundamental role in acid-base chemistry and biochemical processes. We mapped ultrafast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> excursions along the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> transfer coordinate by means of two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy, both in bulk water and in a Zundel cation (H<sub>5</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)<sup>+</sup> motif selectively prepared in acetonitrile. Electric fields from the environment and stochastic hydrogen bond motions induce fluctuations of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> double-minimum potential. Within the lifetime of a particular hydration geometry, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> explores a multitude of positions on a sub-100-femtosecond time scale. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> transfer vibration is strongly damped by its 20- to 40-femtosecond population decay. Our results suggest a central role of Zundel-like geometries in aqueous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> solvation and transport.</p>

Atom-by-atom assembly of defect-free one-dimensional cold atom arrays
<p>The realization of large-scale fully controllable quantum systems is an exciting frontier in modern physical science. We use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>-by-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> assembly to implement a platform for the deterministic preparation of regular one-dimensional arrays of individually controlled cold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s. In our approach, a measurement and feedback procedure eliminates the entropy associated with probabilistic trap occupation and results in defect-free arrays of more than 50 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s in less than 400 milliseconds. The technique is based on fast, real-time control of 100 optical tweezers, which we use to arrange <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s in desired geometric patterns and to maintain these configurations by replacing lost <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s with surplus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s from a reservoir.

Real-space imaging of molecular structure and chemical bonding by single-molecule inelastic tunneling probe
<p>The arrangement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s and bonds in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e influences its physical and chemical properties. The scanning tunneling microscope can provide electronic and vibrational signatures of single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es. However, these signatures do not relate simply to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>ar structure and bonding. We constructed an inelastic tunneling probe based on the scanning tunneling microscope to sense the local potential energy landscape of an adsorbed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e with a carbon monoxide (CO)–terminated tip. The skeletal structure and bonding of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e are revealed from imaging the spatial variations of a CO vibration as the CO-terminated tip probes the core of the interactions between adjacent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s.

Building one molecule from a reservoir of two atoms
<p>Chemical reactions typically proceed via stochastic encounters between reactants.

The experimental apparatus traps two individual laser-cooled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s [one sodium (Na) and one cesium (Cs)] in separate optical tweezers and then merges them into one optical dipole trap. Subsequently, photoassociation forms an excited-state NaCs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e.

Synthesis of FeH<sub>5</sub>: A layered structure with atomic hydrogen slabs
<p>High pressure promotes the formation of polyhydrides with unusually high hydrogen-to-metal ratios. These polyhydrides have complex hydrogenic sublattices.

Cholesterol Efflux Capacity, High-Density Lipoprotein Particle Number, and Incident Cardiovascular Events

In total, 314 cases of incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) (myocardial infarction, unstable angina, arterial revascularization, stroke, or cardiovascular death) were compared to age- and gender-matched controls.

Single-molecule diffusion-based estimation of ligand effects on G protein–coupled receptors
<p>G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) are major drug targets. Developing a method to measure the activities of GPCRs is essential for pharmacology and drug screening. However, it is difficult to measure the effects of a drug by monitoring the receptor on the cell surface; thus, changes in the concentrations of downstream signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es, which depend on the signaling pathway selectivity of the receptor, are often used as an index of receptor activity. We show that single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e imaging analysis provides an alternative method for assessing the effects of ligands on GPCRs. Using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM), we monitored the dynamics of the diffusion of metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 (mGluR3), a class C GPCR, under various ligand conditions. Our single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e tracking analysis demonstrated that increases and decreases in the average diffusion coefficient of mGluR3 quantitatively reflected the ligand-dependent inactivation and activation of receptors, respectively. Through experiments with inhibitors and dual-color single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e imaging analysis, we found that the diffusion of receptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es was altered by common physiological events associated with GPCRs, including G protein binding, and receptor accumulation in clathrin-coated pits. We also confirmed that agonist also decreased the average diffusion coefficient for class A and B GPCRs, demonstrating that this parameter is a good index for estimating ligand effects on many GPCRs regardless of their phylogenetic groups, the chemical properties of the ligands, or G protein–coupling selectivity.</p>

Direct measurements of two-way wave-particle energy transfer in a collisionless space plasma
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e acceleration by plasma waves and spontaneous wave generation are fundamental energy and momentum exchange processes in collisionless plasmas. Such wave-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e interactions occur ubiquitously in space. We present ultrafast measurements in Earth’s magnetosphere by the Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft that enabled quantitative evaluation of energy transfer in interactions associated with electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves. The observed ion distributions are not symmetric around the magnetic field direction but are in phase with the plasma wave fields. The wave-ion phase relations demonstrate that a cyclotron resonance transferred energy from hot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>s to waves, which in turn nonresonantly accelerated cold He<sup>+</sup> to energies up to ~2 kilo–electron volts. These observations provide direct quantitative evidence for collisionless energy transfer in plasmas between distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e populations via wave-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e interactions.</p>

Atmospheric new particle formation from sulfuric acid and amines in a Chinese megacity
<p>Atmospheric new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e formation (NPF) is an important global phenomenon that is nevertheless sensitive to ambient conditions. According to both observation and theoretical arguments, NPF usually requires a relatively high sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) concentration to promote the formation of new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es and a low preexisting aerosol loading to minimize the sink of new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es. We investigated NPF in Shanghai and were able to observe both precursor vapors (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) and initial clusters at a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>ar level in a megacity. High NPF rates were observed to coincide with several familiar markers suggestive of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>–dimethylamine (DMA)–water (H<sub>2</sub>O) nucleation, including sulfuric acid dimers and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>-DMA clusters. In a cluster kinetics simulation, the observed concentration of sulfuric acid was high enough to explain the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e growth to ~3 nanometers under the very high condensation sink, whereas the subsequent higher growth rate beyond this size is believed to result from the added contribution of condensing organic species. These findings will help in understanding urban NPF and its air quality and climate effects, as well as in formulating policies to mitigate secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e formation in China.</p>

<p>Ion channels form the basis for cellular electrical signaling. Despite the scores of genetically identified ion channels selective for other mon<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic ions, only one type of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>-selective ion channel has been found in eukaryotic cells. By comparative transcriptome analysis of mouse taste receptor cells, we identified Otopetrin1 (OTOP1), a protein required for development of gravity-sensing otoconia in the vestibular system, as forming a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>-selective ion channel. We found that murine OTOP1 is enriched in acid-detecting taste receptor cells and is required for their zinc-sensitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> conductance. Two related murine genes, <i>Otop2</i> and <i>Otop3</i>, and a <i>Drosophila</i> ortholog also encode <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> channels. Evolutionary conservation of the gene family and its widespread tissue distribution suggest a broad role for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> channels in physiology and pathophysiology.</p>

Atomic structure of sensitive battery materials and interfaces revealed by cryo–electron microscopy

These growth directions can change at kinks with no observable crystallographic defect.

The Rydberg constant and proton size from atomic hydrogen
<p>At the core of the “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> radius puzzle” is a four–standard deviation discrepancy between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> root-mean-square charge radii (<i>r</i><sub>p</sub>) determined from the regular hydrogen (H) and the muonic hydrogen (µp) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s. Using a cryogenic beam of H <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s, we measured the 2S-4P transition frequency in H, yielding the values of the Rydberg constant <i>R</i><sub>∞</sub> = 10973731.568076(96) per meter<sup></sup>and <i>r</i><sub>p</sub> = 0.8335(95) femtometer. Our <i>r</i><sub>p</sub> value is 3.3 combined standard deviations smaller than the previous H world data, but in good agreement with the µp value. We motivate an asymmetric fit function, which eliminates line shifts from quantum interference of neighboring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic resonances.</p>

Quantized thermal transport in single-atom junctions
<p>Thermal transport in individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic junctions and chains is of great fundamental interest because of the distinctive quantum effects expected to arise in them. By using novel, custom-fabricated, picowatt-resolution calorimetric scanning probes, we measured the thermal conductance of gold and platinum metallic wires down to single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> junctions. Our work reveals that the thermal conductance of gold single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> junctions is quantized at room temperature and shows that the Wiedemann-Franz law relating thermal and electrical conductance is satisfied even in single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> contacts. Furthermore, we quantitatively explain our experimental results within the Landauer framework for quantum thermal transport. The experimental techniques reported here will enable thermal transport studies in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>ar chains, which will be key to investigating numerous fundamental issues that thus far have remained experimentally inaccessible.</p>

Spectroscopic snapshots of the proton-transfer mechanism in water
<p>The Grotthuss mechanism explains the anomalously high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> mobility in water as a sequence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> transfers along a hydrogen-bonded (H-bonded) network. However, the vibrational spectroscopic signatures of this process are masked by the diffuse nature of the key bands in bulk water. Here we report how the much simpler vibrational spectra of cold, composition-selected heavy water clusters, D<sup>+</sup>(D<sub>2</sub>O)<i><sub>n</sub></i>, can be exploited to capture clear markers that encode the collective reaction coordinate along the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>-transfer event.

An atom-by-atom assembler of defect-free arbitrary two-dimensional atomic arrays
<p>Large arrays of individually controlled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s trapped in optical tweezers are a very promising platform for quantum engineering applications. However, deterministic loading of the traps is experimentally challenging. We demonstrate the preparation of fully loaded two-dimensional arrays of up to ~50 microtraps, each containing a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> and arranged in arbitrary geometries. Starting from initially larger, half-filled matrices of randomly loaded traps, we obtain user-defined target arrays at unit filling. This is achieved with a real-time control system and a moving optical tweezers, which together enable a sequence of rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> moves depending on the initial distribution of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s in the arrays.

Single-molecule optomechanics in “picocavities”
<p>Trapping light with noble metal nanostructures overcomes the diffraction limit and can confine light to volumes typically on the order of 30 cubic nanometers. We found that individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic features inside the gap of a plasmonic nanoassembly can localize light to volumes well below 1 cubic nanometer (“picocavities”), enabling optical experiments on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic scale. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic features are dynamically formed and disassembled by laser irradiation. Although unstable at room temperature, picocavities can be stabilized at cryogenic temperatures, allowing single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic cavities to be probed for many minutes. Unlike traditional optomechanical resonators, such extreme optical confinement yields a factor of 10<sup>6</sup> enhancement of optomechanical coupling between the picocavity field and vibrations of individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>ar bonds. This work sets the basis for developing nanoscale nonlinear quantum optics on the single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e level.</p>

Plant Chemical Genetics: From Phenotype-Based Screens to Synthetic Biology
<p>The treatment of a biological system with small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es to specifically perturb cellular functions is commonly referred to as chemical biology. Small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es are used commercially as drugs, herbicides, and fungicides in different systems, but in recent years they are increasingly exploited as tools for basic research. For instance, chemical genetics involves the discovery of small-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e effectors of various cellular functions through screens of compound libraries. Whereas the drug discovery field has largely been driven by target-based screening approaches followed by drug optimization, chemical genetics in plant systems tends to be fueled by more general phenotype-based screens, opening the possibility to identify a wide range of small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es that are not necessarily directly linked to the process of interest. Here, we provide an overview of the current progress in chemical genetics in plants, with a focus on the discoveries regarding small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es identified in screens designed with a basic biology perspective. We reflect on the possibilities that lie ahead and discuss some of the potential pitfalls that might be encountered upon adopting a given chemical genetics approach.</p>

Educated natural killer cells show dynamic movement of the activating receptor NKp46 and confinement of the inhibitory receptor Ly49A
<p>Educated natural killer (NK) cells have inhibitory receptors specific for self major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es and kill cancer cells more efficiently than do NK cells that do not have such receptors (hyporesponsive NK cells). The mechanism behind this functional empowerment through education has so far not been fully described. In addition, distinctive phenotypic markers of educated NK cells at the single-cell level are lacking. We developed a refined version of the image mean square displacement (iMSD) method (called iMSD carpet analysis) and used it in combination with single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e tracking to characterize the dynamics of the activating receptor NKp46 and the inhibitory receptor Ly49A on resting educated versus hyporesponsive murine NK cells. Most of the NKp46 and Ly49A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es were restricted to microdomains; however, individual NKp46 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es resided in these domains for shorter periods and diffused faster on the surface of educated, compared to hyporesponsive, NK cells. In contrast, the movement of Ly49A was more constrained in educated NK cells compared to hyporesponsive NK cells. Either disrupting the actin cytoskeleton or adding cholesterol to the cells prohibited activating signaling, suggesting that the dynamics of receptor movements within the cell membrane are critical for the proper activation of NK cells. The faster and more dynamic movement of NKp46 in educated NK cells may facilitate a swifter response to interactions with target cells.</p>

A radiation belt of energetic protons located between Saturn and its rings

Resonance-stabilized hydrocarbon-radical chain reactions may explain soot inception and growth

Although polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are known precursors to high-temperature carbonaceous-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e formation, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>ar pathways that initiate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e formation are unknown.

These radicals react with other hydrocarbon species to form covalently bound complexes that promote further growth and clustering by regenerating resonance-stabilized radicals through low-barrier hydrogen-abstraction and hydrogen-ejection reactions. Such radical–chain reaction pathways may lead to covalently bound clusters of PAHs and other hydrocarbons that would otherwise be too small to condense at high temperatures, thus providing the key mechanistic steps for rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e formation and surface growth by hydrocarbon chemisorption.</p>

Orientation-dependent stereo Wigner time delay and electron localization in a small molecule

Measurement of the neutron lifetime using a magneto-gravitational trap and in situ detection

As a result of this approach and the use of an in situ neutron detector, the lifetime reported here [877.7 ± 0.7 (stat) +0.4/–0.2 (sys) seconds] does not require corrections larger than the quoted uncertainties.</p>

Atomic model for the dimeric F<sub>O</sub> region of mitochondrial ATP synthase

Angular momentum–induced delays in solid-state photoemission enhanced by intra-atomic interactions
<p>Attosecond time-resolved photoemission spectroscopy reveals that photoemission from solids is not yet fully understood. The relative emission delays between four photoemission channels measured for the van der Waals crystal tungsten diselenide (WSe<sub>2</sub>) can only be explained by accounting for both propagation and intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic delays. The intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic delay depends on the angular momentum of the initial localized state and is determined by intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic interactions. For the studied case of WSe<sub>2</sub>, the photoemission events are time ordered with rising initial-state angular momentum. Including intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic electron-electron interaction and angular momentum of the initial localized state yields excellent agreement between theory and experiment. This has required a revision of existing models for solid-state photoemission, and thus, attosecond time-resolved photoemission from solids provides important benchmarks for improved future photoemission models.</p>

Femtosecond x-ray spectroscopy of an electrocyclic ring-opening reaction
<p>The ultrafast light-activated electrocyclic ring-opening reaction of 1,3-cyclohexadiene is a fundamental prototype of photochemical pericyclic reactions. Generally, these reactions are thought to proceed through an intermediate excited-state minimum (the so-called pericyclic minimum), which leads to isomerization via nonadiabatic relaxation to the ground state of the photoproduct. Here, we used femtosecond (fs) soft x-ray spectroscopy near the carbon K-edge (~284 electron volts) on a table-top apparatus to directly reveal the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valenc</span></strong>e electronic structure of this transient intermediate state.

Observation of the Wigner-Huntington transition to metallic hydrogen
<p>Producing metallic hydrogen has been a great challenge in condensed matter physics. Metallic hydrogen may be a room-temperature superconductor and metastable when the pressure is released and could have an important impact on energy and rocketry. We have studied solid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>ar hydrogen under pressure at low temperatures. At a pressure of 495 gigapascals, hydrogen becomes metallic, with reflectivity as high as 0.91. We fit the reflectance using a Drude free-electron model to determine the plasma frequency of 32.5 ± 2.1 electron volts at a temperature of 5.5 kelvin, with a corresponding electron carrier density of 7.7 ± 1.1 × 10<sup>23</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es per cubic centimeter, which is consistent with theoretical estimates of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic density. The properties are those of an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic metal. We have produced the Wigner-Huntington dissociative transition to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic metallic hydrogen in the laboratory.</p>

Hydrogen positions in single nanocrystals revealed by electron diffraction
<p>The localization of hydrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s is an essential part of crystal structure analysis, but it is difficult because of their small scattering power. We report the direct localization of hydrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s in nanocrystalline materials, achieved using the recently developed approach of dynamical refinement of precession electron diffraction tomography data. We used this method to locate hydrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s in both an organic (paracetamol) and an inorganic (framework cobalt aluminophosphate) material. The results demonstrate that the technique can reliably reveal fine structural details, including the positions of hydrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s in single crystals with micro- to nanosized dimensions.</p>

In Situ Imaging of Silicalite-1 Surface Growth Reveals the Mechanism of Crystallization
<sec><title>Crystal Growth</title><p>Two main routes for the growth of crystalline species are either via <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e-by-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e attachment to existing nuclei or via the addition of preformed metastable precursors, but do these mechanisms need to be mutually exclusive? <bold>Lupulescu and Rimer</bold> (p. 729; see the Perspective by <bold>Dandekar and Doherty</bold>) developed an in situ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic force microscopy (AFM) technique to study the crystallization of materials under extreme conditions of temperature (25° to 300°C) and alkalinity (up to a pH of 13). The growth of the zeolite silicalite-1 involved both the attachment of metastable precursors and of individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es.</p></sec>

Edge Nonlinear Optics on a MoS<sub>2</sub> Atomic Monolayer
<sec><title>Optics On the Edge</title><p>The ability to isolate stable materials just one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> thick has provided the impetus for a new generation of thin films technologies. Often, the materials are conceptually imaged in the form of an artist's impression as single continuous layers—a single crystal sheet of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s. Scanning probe and transmission electron microscopies reveal the reality, however, where the material resembles a patchwork quilt with polycrystals of different orientation and size separated by grain boundaries forming a mosaic. These structures play an influential role in determining the transport and optical properties of the membrane. <bold>Yin <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 488; see the Perspective by <bold>Neshev and Kivshar</bold>) demonstrate a simple microscopy technique based on the nonlinear optical response of the materials to probe and characterize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ically thin layers of MoS<sub>2</sub>. The technique should prove useful during the characterization and optimization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ically thin membranes.</p></sec>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Endogenous Bioactive Jasmonate Is Composed of a Set of (+)-7-<i>iso-</i>JA-Amino Acid Conjugates<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Jasmonates (JAs) regulate a wide range of plant defense and development processes. The bioactive JA is perceived by its receptor COI1 to trigger the degradation of JASMONATE ZIM-DOMAIN (JAZ) proteins and subsequently derepress the JAZ-repressed transcription factors for activation of expression of JA-responsive genes. So far, (+)-7-<i>iso</i>-JA-<sc>l</sc>-Ile has been the only identified endogenous bioactive JA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e. Here, we designed coronafacic acid (CFA) conjugates with all the amino acids (CFA-AA) to mimic the JA amino acid conjugates, and revealed that (+)-7-<i>iso</i>-JA-Leu, (+)-7-<i>iso</i>-JA-Val, (+)-7-<i>iso</i>-JA-Met, and (+)-7-<i>iso</i>-JA-Ala are new endogenous bioactive JA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es. Furthermore, our studies uncover the general characteristics for all the bioactive JA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es, and provide a new strategy to synthetically generate novel active JA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es.</p>

Worsening Renal Function in Patients With Acute Heart Failure Undergoing Aggressive Diuresis Is Not Associated With Tubular Injury
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Worsening renal function (WRF) in the setting of aggressive diuresis for acute heart failure treatment may reflect renal tubular injury or simply indicate a hemodynamic or functional change in glomerular filtration. Well-validated tubular injury biomarkers, <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, and kidney injury <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e 1, are now available that can quantify the degree of renal tubular injury. The ROSE-AHF trial (Renal Optimization Strategies Evaluation–Acute Heart Failure) provides an experimental platform for the study of mechanisms of WRF during aggressive diuresis for acute heart failure because the ROSE-AHF protocol dictated high-dose loop diuretic therapy in all patients. We sought to determine whether tubular injury biomarkers are associated with WRF in the setting of aggressive diuresis and its association with prognosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients in the multicenter ROSE-AHF trial with baseline and 72-hour urine tubular injury biomarkers were analyzed (n=283). WRF was defined as a ≥20% decrease in glomerular filtration rate estimated with cystatin C.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Consistent with protocol-driven aggressive dosing of loop diuretics, participants received a median 560 mg IV furosemide equivalents (interquartile range, 300–815 mg), which induced a urine output of 8425 mL (interquartile range, 6341–10 528 mL) over the 72-hour intervention period. Levels of <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase and kidney injury <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e 1 did not change with aggressive diuresis (both <i>P</i>>0.59), whereas levels of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin decreased slightly (−8.7 ng/mg; interquartile range, −169 to 35 ng/mg; <i>P</i><0.001). WRF occurred in 21.2% of the population and was not associated with an increase in any marker of renal tubular injury: neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (<i>P</i>=0.21), <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase (<i>P</i>=0.46), or kidney injury <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e 1 (<i>P</i>=0.22). Increases in neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase, and kidney injury <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e 1 were paradoxically associated with improved survival (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.80 per 10 percentile increase; 95% confidence interval, 0.69–0.91; <i>P</i>=0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Kidney tubular injury does not appear to have an association with WRF in the context of aggressive diuresis of patients with acute heart failure. These findings reinforce the notion that the small to moderate deteriorations in renal function commonly encountered with aggressive diuresis are dissimilar from traditional causes of acute kidney injury.</p></sec>

Second-scale nuclear spin coherence time of ultracold <sup>23</sup>Na<sup>40</sup>K molecules
<p>Coherence, the stability of the relative phase between quantum states, is central to quantum mechanics and its applications. For ultracold dipolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es at sub-microkelvin temperatures, internal states with robust coherence are predicted to offer rich prospects for quantum many-body physics and quantum information processing. We report the observation of stable coherence between nuclear spin states of ultracold fermionic sodium-potassium (NaK) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es in the singlet rovibrational ground state. Ramsey spectroscopy reveals coherence times on the scale of 1 second; this enables high-resolution spectroscopy of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>ar gas. Collisional shifts are shown to be absent down to the 100-millihertz level. This work opens the door to the use of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es as a versatile quantum memory and for precision measurements on dipolar quantum matter.</p>

Jupiter’s magnetosphere and aurorae observed by the Juno spacecraft during its first polar orbits
<p>The Juno spacecraft acquired direct observations of the jovian magnetosphere and auroral emissions from a vantage point above the poles. Juno’s capture orbit spanned the jovian magnetosphere from bow shock to the planet, providing magnetic field, charged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e, and wave phenomena context for Juno’s passage over the poles and traverse of Jupiter’s hazardous inner radiation belts. Juno’s energetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e and plasma detectors measured electrons precipitating in the polar regions, exciting intense aurorae, observed simultaneously by the ultraviolet and infrared imaging spectrographs. Juno transited beneath the most intense parts of the radiation belts, passed about 4000 kilometers above the cloud tops at closest approach, well inside the jovian rings, and recorded the electrical signatures of high-velocity impacts with small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es as it traversed the equator.</p>

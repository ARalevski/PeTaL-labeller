Arc-continent collisions in the tropics set Earth’s climate state
<p>On multimillion-year time scales, Earth has experienced warm ice-free and cold glacial climates, but it is unknown whether transitions between these background climate states were the result of changes in carbon dioxide sources or sinks. Low-latitude arc-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contin</span></strong>ent collisions are hypothesized to drive cooling by exhuming and eroding mafic and ultramafic rocks in the warm, wet tropics, thereby increasing Earth’s potential to sequester carbon through chemical weathering. To better constrain global weatherability through time, the paleogeographic position of all major Phanerozoic arc-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contin</span></strong>ent collisions was reconstructed and compared to the latitudinal distribution of ice sheets. This analysis reveals a strong correlation between the extent of glaciation and arc-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contin</span></strong>ent collisions in the tropics. Earth’s climate state is set primarily by global weatherability, which changes with the latitudinal distribution of arc-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contin</span></strong>ent collisions.</p>

The influence of human disturbance on wildlife nocturnality
<p>Rapid expansion of human activity has driven well-documented shifts in the spatial distribution of wildlife, but the cumulative effect of human disturbance on the temporal dynamics of animals has not been quantified. We examined anthropogenic effects on mammal diel activity patterns, conducting a meta-analysis of 76 studies of 62 species from six <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contin</span></strong>ents. Our global study revealed a strong effect of humans on daily patterns of wildlife activity. Animals increased their nocturnality by an average factor of 1.36 in response to human disturbance. This finding was consistent across <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contin</span></strong>ents, habitats, taxa, and human activities. As the global human footprint expands, temporal avoidance of humans may facilitate human-wildlife coexistence. However, such responses can result in marked shifts away from natural patterns of activity, with consequences for fitness, population persistence, community interactions, and evolution.</p>

Body size downgrading of mammals over the late Quaternary
<p>Since the late Pleistocene, large-bodied mammals have been extirpated from much of Earth. Although all habitable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contin</span></strong>ents once harbored giant mammals, the few remaining species are largely confined to Africa. This decline is coincident with the global expansion of hominins over the late Quaternary. Here, we quantify mammalian extinction selectivity, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contin</span></strong>ental body size distributions, and taxonomic diversity over five time periods spanning the past 125,000 years and stretching approximately 200 years into the future. We demonstrate that size-selective extinction was already under way in the oldest interval and occurred on all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contin</span></strong>ents, within all trophic modes, and across all time intervals. Moreover, the degree of selectivity was unprecedented in 65 million years of mammalian evolution. The distinctive selectivity signature implicates hominin activity as a primary driver of taxonomic losses and ecosystem homogenization. Because megafauna have a disproportionate influence on ecosystem structure and function, past and present body size downgrading is reshaping Earth’s biosphere.</p>

A unified continental thickness from seismology and diamonds suggests a melt-defined plate
<p>Thick, rigid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contin</span></strong>ents move over the weaker underlying mantle, although <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geophys</span></strong>ical and geochemical constraints on the exact thickness and defining mechanism of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contin</span></strong>ental plates are widely discrepant. Xenoliths suggest a chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contin</span></strong>ental lithosphere ~175 kilometers thick, whereas seismic tomography supports a much thicker root (>250 kilometers) and a gradual lithosphere-asthenosphere transition, consistent with a thermal definition. We modeled <i>SS</i> precursor waveforms from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contin</span></strong>ental interiors and found a 7 to 9% velocity drop at depths of 130 to 190 kilometers. The dis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contin</span></strong>uity depth is well correlated with the origin depths of diamond-bearing xenoliths and corresponds to the transition from coarse to deformed xenoliths. At this depth, the xenolith-derived geotherm also intersects the carbonate-silicate solidus, suggesting that partial melt defines the plate boundaries beneath the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contin</span></strong>ental interior.</p>

The strength of long-range ties in population-scale social networks
<p>Long-range connections that span large social networks are widely assumed to be weak, composed of sporadic and emotionally distant relationships. However, researchers historically have lacked the population-scale network data needed to verify the predicted weakness. Using data from 11 culturally diverse population-scale networks on four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contin</span></strong>ents—encompassing 56 million Twitter users and 58 million mobile phone subscribers—we find that long-range ties are nearly as strong as social ties embedded within a small circle of friends.

Atmospheric <sup>14</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C changes during the last glacial period from Hulu Cave
<p>Paired measurements of <sup>14</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C and <sup>230</sup>Th ages from two Hulu Cave stalagmites complete a precise record of atmospheric <sup>14</sup>C covering the full range of the <sup>14</sup>C dating method (~54,000 years). Over the last glacial period, atmospheric <sup>14</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C ranges from values similar to modern values to values 1.70 times higher (42,000 to 39,000 years ago). The latter correspond to <sup>14</sup>C ages 5200 years less than calibrated ages and correlate with the Laschamp <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geomagnet</span></strong>ic excursion followed by Heinrich Stadial 4. Millennial-scale variations are largely attributable to Earth’s magnetic field changes and in part to climate-related changes in the oceanic carbon cycle. A progressive shift to lower <sup>14</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C values between 25,000 and 11,000 years ago is likely related, in part, to progressively increasing ocean ventilation rates.</p>

A tetrapod fauna from within the Devonian Antarctic Circle
<p>Until now, all known fossils of tetrapods (limbed vertebrates with digits) and near-tetrapods (such as <i>Elpistostege</i>,<i> Tiktaalik</i>, and <i>Panderichthys</i>) from the Devonian period have come from localities in tropical to subtropical paleolatitudes.

Nigeria hit by unprecedented Lassa fever outbreak
<p>In the first 2 months of this year, Nigeria has had more confirmed cases of Lassa fever, a hemorrhagic disease that kills 20% to 30% of those it sickens, than in any previous year. As of 11 March, the toll from this rodent-borne virus stood at 365 confirmed cases, 16 of those among vulnerable health care workers, and 114 deaths. And those figures are widely considered an underestimate. As the government and its international partners scramble to set up isolation wards and deliver protective gear to health workers, researchers on three <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contin</span></strong>ents are racing to figure out what is driving the unprecedented outbreak and what it portends for the future. Is it simply better disease surveillance in the wake of Ebola, the similar but more deadly disease that began its rampage across West Africa in 2014? Has the virus changed in some way? Are there more of the rats that carry it, or are more rats infected with it? Or is another rat capable of spreading the virus as well? Considering how lethal Lassa fever is, shockingly little is known about it, experts say.</p>

A global atlas of the dominant bacteria found in soil
<p>The immense diversity of soil bacterial communities has stymied efforts to characterize individual taxa and document their global distributions. We analyzed soils from 237 locations across six <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contin</span></strong>ents and found that only 2% of bacterial phylotypes (~500 phylotypes) consistently accounted for almost half of the soil bacterial communities worldwide. Despite the overwhelming diversity of bacterial communities, relatively few bacterial taxa are abundant in soils globally. We clustered these dominant taxa into ecological groups to build the first global atlas of soil bacterial taxa. Our study narrows down the immense number of bacterial taxa to a “most wanted” list that will be fruitful targets for genomic and cultivation-based efforts aimed at improving our understanding of soil microbes and their contributions to ecosystem functioning.</p>

Topological origin of equatorial waves
<p>Topology sheds new light on the emergence of unidirectional edge waves in a variety of physical systems, from condensed matter to artificial lattices. Waves observed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geophys</span></strong>ical flows are also robust to perturbations, which suggests a role for topology. We show a topological origin for two well-known equatorially trapped waves, the Kelvin and Yanai modes, owing to the breaking of time-reversal symmetry by Earth’s rotation. The nontrivial structure of the bulk PoincaréÉééé wave modes encoded through the first Chern number of value 2 guarantees the existence of these waves. This invariant demonstrates that ocean and atmospheric waves share fundamental properties with topological insulators and that topology plays an unexpected role in Earth’s climate system.</p>

Contrasting carbon cycle responses of the tropical continents to the 2015–2016 El Niño
<p>The 2015–2016 El Niñño led to historically high temperatures and low precipitation over the tropics, while the growth rate of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) was the largest on record. Here we quantify the response of tropical net biosphere exchange, gross primary production, biomass burning, and respiration to these climate anomalies by assimilating column CO<sub>2</sub>, solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence, and carbon monoxide observations from multiple satellites. Relative to the 2011 La Niññña, the pantropical biosphere released 2.5 ± 0.34 gigatons more carbon into the atmosphere in 2015, consisting of approximately even contributions from three tropical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contin</span></strong>ents but dominated by diverse carbon exchange processes. The heterogeneity of the carbon-exchange processes indicated here challenges previous studies that suggested that a single dominant process determines carbon cycle interannual variability.</p>

Titanium isotopic evidence for felsic crust and plate tectonics 3.5 billion years ago
<p>Earth exhibits a dichotomy in elevation and chemical composition between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contin</span></strong>ents and ocean floor. Reconstructing when this dichotomy arose is important for understanding when plate tectonics started and how the supply of nutrients to the oceans changed through time. We measured the titanium isotopic composition of shales to constrain the chemical composition of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contin</span></strong>ental crust exposed to weathering and found that shales of all ages have a uniform isotopic composition. This can only be explained if the emerged crust was predominantly felsic (silica-rich) since 3.5 billion years ago, requiring an early initiation of plate tectonics. We also observed a change in the abundance of biologically important nutrients phosphorus and nickel across the Archean-Proterozoic boundary, which might have helped trigger the rise in atmospheric oxygen.</p>

The turbulent cascade in five dimensions
<p>To the naked eye, turbulent flows exhibit whirls of many different sizes. To each size, or scale, corresponds a fraction of the total energy resulting from a cascade in five dimensions: scale, time, and three-dimensional space. Understanding this process is critical to strategies for modeling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geophys</span></strong>ical and industrial flows. By tracking the flow regions containing energy in different scales, we have detected the statistical predominance of a cross-scale link whereby fluid lumps of energy at scale Δ appear within lumps of scale 2Δ and die within those of scale Δ/2. Our approach uncovers the energy cascade in a simple water-like fluid, offering insights for turbulence models while paving the way for similar analyses in conducting fluids, quantum fluids, and plasmas.</p>

Massive blow-out craters formed by hydrate-controlled methane expulsion from the Arctic seafloor
<p>Widespread methane release from thawing Arctic gas hydrates is a major concern, yet the processes, sources, and fluxes involved remain unconstrained. We present <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geophys</span></strong>ical data documenting a cluster of kilometer-wide craters and mounds from the Barents Sea floor associated with large-scale methane expulsion. Combined with ice sheet/gas hydrate modeling, our results indicate that during glaciation, natural gas migrated from underlying hydrocarbon reservoirs and was sequestered extensively as subglacial gas hydrates. Upon ice sheet retreat, methane from this hydrate reservoir concentrated in massive mounds before being abruptly released to form craters. We propose that these processes were likely widespread across past glaciated petroleum provinces and that they also provide an analog for the potential future destabilization of subglacial gas hydrate reservoirs beneath contemporary ice sheets.</p>

Higher predation risk for insect prey at low latitudes and elevations
<p>Biotic interactions underlie ecosystem structure and function, but predicting interaction outcomes is difficult. We tested the hypothesis that biotic interaction strength increases toward the equator, using a global experiment with model caterpillars to measure predation risk. Across an 11,660-kilometer latitudinal gradient spanning six <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contin</span></strong>ents, we found increasing predation toward the equator, with a parallel pattern of increasing predation toward lower elevations. Patterns across both latitude and elevation were driven by arthropod predators, with no systematic trend in attack rates by birds or mammals. These matching gradients at global and regional scales suggest consistent drivers of biotic interaction strength, a finding that needs to be integrated into general theories of herbivory, community organization, and life-history evolution.</p>

Experimental constraints on the damp peridotite solidus and oceanic mantle potential temperature
<p>Decompression of hot mantle rock upwelling beneath oceanic spreading centers causes it to exceed the melting point (solidus), producing magmas that ascend to form basaltic crust ~6 to 7 kilometers thick. The oceanic upper mantle contains ~50 to 200 micrograms per gram of water (H<sub>2</sub>O) dissolved in nominally anhydrous minerals, which—relative to its low concentration—has a disproportionate effect on the solidus that has not been quantified experimentally. Here, we present results from an experimental determination of the peridotite solidus containing known amounts of dissolved hydrogen. Our data reveal that the H<sub>2</sub>O-undersaturated peridotite solidus is hotter than previously thought. Reconciling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geophys</span></strong>ical observations of the melting regime beneath the East Pacific Rise with our experimental results requires that existing estimates for the oceanic upper mantle potential temperature be adjusted upward by about 60°C.</p>

Lifetime of the solar nebula constrained by meteorite paleomagnetism
<p>A key stage in planet formation is the evolution of a gaseous and magnetized solar nebula. However, the lifetime of the nebular magnetic field and nebula are poorly constrained. We present <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">paleomagnet</span></strong>ic analyses of volcanic angrites demonstrating that they formed in a near-zero magnetic field (<0.6 microtesla) at 4563.5 ± 0.1 million years ago, ~3.8 million years after solar system formation. This indicates that the solar nebula field, and likely the nebular gas, had dispersed by this time. This sets the time scale for formation of the gas giants and planet migration. Furthermore, it supports formation of chondrules after 4563.5 million years ago by non-nebular processes like planetesimal collisions. The core dynamo on the angrite parent body did not initiate until about 4 to 11 million years after solar system formation.</p>

Volcanic tremor and plume height hysteresis from Pavlof Volcano, Alaska
<p>The March 2016 eruption of Pavlof Volcano, Alaska, produced an ash plume that caused the cancellation of more than 100 flights in North America. The eruption generated strong tremor that was recorded by seismic and remote low-frequency acoustic (infrasound) stations, including the EarthScope Transportable Array. The relationship between the tremor amplitudes and plume height changes considerably between the waxing and waning portions of the eruption. Similar hysteresis has been observed between seismic river noise and discharge during storms, suggesting that flow and erosional processes in both rivers and volcanoes can produce irreversible structural changes that are detectable in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geophys</span></strong>ical data. We propose that the time-varying relationship at Pavlof arose from changes in the tremor source related to volcanic vent erosion. This relationship may improve estimates of volcanic emissions and characterization of eruption size and intensity.</p>

Study suggests hidden epidemic in CF patients

But an analysis of hundreds of bacterial genomes from patients around the world, published in this week's issue of <i>Science</i>, suggests that the bacterium has adapted to humans and that several dangerous strains are spreading from one CF treatment center to the next, from country to country, and even between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contin</span></strong>ents in a silent global epidemic.</p>

Disproportionation of (Mg,Fe)SiO<sub>3</sub> perovskite in Earth’s deep lower mantle
<p>The mineralogical constitution of the Earth’s mantle dictates the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geophys</span></strong>ical and geochemical properties of this region. Previous models of a perovskite-dominant lower mantle have been built on the assumption that the entire lower mantle down to the top of the D″ layer contains ferromagnesian silicate [(Mg,Fe)SiO<sub>3</sub>] with nominally 10 mole percent Fe. On the basis of experiments in laser-heated diamond anvil cells, at pressures of 95 to 101 gigapascals and temperatures of 2200 to 2400 kelvin, we found that such perovskite is unstable; it loses its Fe and disproportionates to a nearly Fe-free MgSiO<sub>3</sub> perovskite phase and an Fe-rich phase with a hexagonal structure. This observation has implications for enigmatic seismic features beyond ~2000 kilometers depth and suggests that the lower mantle may contain previously unidentified major phases.</p>

Brown and Polar Bear Y Chromosomes Reveal Extensive Male-Biased Gene Flow within Brother Lineages
<p>Brown and polar bears have become prominent examples in phylogeography, but previous phylogeographic studies relied largely on maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or were geographically restricted. The male-specific Y chromosome, a natural counterpart to mtDNA, has remained underexplored. Although this paternally inherited chromosome is indispensable for comprehensive analyses of phylogeographic patterns, technical difficulties and low variability have hampered its application in most mammals. We developed 13 novel Y-chromosomal sequence and microsatellite markers from the polar bear genome and screened these in a broad geographic sample of 130 brown and polar bears. We also analyzed a 390-kb-long Y-chromosomal scaffold using sequencing data from published male ursine genomes. Y chromosome evidence support the emerging understanding that brown and polar bears started to diverge no later than the Middle Pleistocene. Contrary to mtDNA patterns, we found 1) brown and polar bears to be reciprocally monophyletic sister (or rather brother) lineages, without signals of introgression, 2) male-biased gene flow across <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contin</span></strong>ents and on phylogeographic time scales, and 3) male dispersal that links the Alaskan ABC islands population to mainland brown bears. Due to female philopatry, mtDNA provides a highly structured estimate of population differentiation, while male-biased gene flow is a homogenizing force for nuclear genetic variation. Our findings highlight the importance of analyzing both maternally and paternally inherited loci for a comprehensive view of phylogeographic history, and that mtDNA-based phylogeographic studies of many mammals should be reevaluated. Recent advances in sequencing technology render the analysis of Y-chromosomal variation feasible, even in nonmodel organisms.</p>

Immigration order threatens overseas talent
<p>Last week, President Donald Trump issued an executive order barring the entry of any citizen from seven mostly Muslim nations for 90 days while procedures for more-rigorous vetting of visa applicants are put in place. The order sparked chaos at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">airport</span></strong>s in the United States and abroad, as dozens of academics and others with valid U.S. entry documents were not allowed to board U.S.-bound flights or were turned back after arriving. It provoked angst in scientists and students from the target countries—Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Sudan, and Yemen—who had secured a visa to come to the United States, and in those already living there. And it raised broader questions about whether the country can continue to benefit from the flow of scientific and engineering talent from overseas.</p>

Beyond Porosity: 3D Leaf Intercellular Airspace Traits That Impact Mesophyll Conductance
<p>The leaf intercellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">airspac</span></strong>e (IAS) is generally considered to have high conductance to CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion relative to the liquid phase. While previous studies accounted for leaf-level variation in porosity and mesophyll thickness, they omitted 3D IAS traits that potentially influence IAS conductance (g<sub>IAS</sub>). Here, we reevaluated the standard equation for g<sub>IAS</sub> by incorporating tortuosity, lateral path lengthening, and IAS connectivity. We measured and spatially mapped these geometric IAS traits for 19 Bromeliaceae species with Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) or C3 photosynthetic pathways using x-ray microcomputed tomography imaging and a novel computational approach. We found substantial variation in porosity (0.04–0.73 m<sup>3</sup> m<sup>−3</sup>), tortuosity (1.09–3.33 m<sup>2</sup> m<sup>−2</sup>), lateral path lengthening (1.12–3.19 m m<sup>−1</sup>), and IAS connectivity (0.81–0.97 m<sup>2</sup> m<sup>−2</sup>) across all bromeliad leaves. The revised g<sub>IAS</sub> model predicted significantly lower g<sub>IAS</sub> in CAM (0.01–0.19 mol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> bar<sup>−1</sup>) than in C3 (0.41–2.38 mol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> bar<sup>−1</sup>) plants due to a coordinated decline in these IAS traits. Our reevaluated equation also generally predicted lower g<sub>IAS</sub> values than the former one. Moreover, we observed high spatial heterogeneity in these IAS geometric traits throughout the mesophyll, especially within CAM leaves. Our data show that IAS traits that better capture the 3D complexity of leaves strongly influence g<sub>IAS</sub> and that the impact of the IAS on mesophyll conductance should be carefully considered with respect to leaf anatomy. We provide a simple function to estimate tortuosity and lateral path lengthening in the absence of access to imaging tools such as x-ray microcomputed tomography or other novel 3D image-processing techniques.</p>

Excess Diffuse Light Absorption in Upper Mesophyll Limits CO<sub>2</sub> Drawdown and Depresses Photosynthesis
<p>In agricultural and natural systems, diffuse light can enhance plant primary productivity due to deeper penetration into and greater irradiance of the entire canopy. However, for individual sun-grown leaves from three species, photosynthesis is actually less efficient under diffuse compared with direct light. Despite its potential impact on canopy-level productivity, the mechanism for this leaf-level diffuse light photosynthetic depression effect is unknown. Here, we investigate if the spatial distribution of light absorption relative to electron transport capacity in sun- and shade-grown sunflower (<i>Helianthus annuus</i>) leaves underlies its previously observed diffuse light photosynthetic depression. Using a new one-dimensional porous medium finite element gas-exchange model parameterized with light absorption profiles, we found that weaker penetration of diffuse versus direct light into the mesophyll of sun-grown sunflower leaves led to a more heterogenous saturation of electron transport capacity and lowered its CO<sub>2</sub> concentration drawdown capacity in the intercellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">airspac</span></strong>e and chloroplast stroma. This decoupling of light availability from photosynthetic capacity under diffuse light is sufficient to generate an 11% decline in photosynthesis in sun-grown but not shade-grown leaves, primarily because thin shade-grown leaves similarly distribute diffuse and direct light throughout the mesophyll. Finally, we illustrate how diffuse light photosynthetic depression could overcome enhancement in canopies with low light extinction coefficients and/or leaf area, pointing toward a novel direction for future research.</p>

The role of the olfactory recess in olfactory airflow
<p>The olfactory recess – a blind pocket at the back of the nasal airway – is thought to play an important role in mammalian olfaction by sequestering air outside of the main airstream, thus giving odorants time to re-circulate. Several studies have shown that species with large olfactory recesses tend to have a well-developed sense of smell. However, no study has investigated how the size of the olfactory recess relates to air circulation near the olfactory epithelium. Here we used a computer model of the nasal cavity from a bat (<i>Carollia perspicillata</i>) to test the hypothesis that a larger olfactory recess improves olfactory airflow. We predicted that during inhalation, models with an enlarged olfactory recess would have slower rates of flow through the olfactory region (i.e. the olfactory recess plus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">airspac</span></strong>e around the olfactory epithelium), while during exhalation these models would have little to no flow through the olfactory recess. To test these predictions, we experimentally modified the size of the olfactory recess while holding the rest of the morphology constant. During inhalation, we found that an enlarged olfactory recess resulted in lower rates of flow in the olfactory region. Upon exhalation, air flowed through the olfactory recess at a lower rate in the model with an enlarged olfactory recess. Taken together, these results indicate that an enlarged olfactory recess improves olfactory airflow during both inhalation and exhalation. These findings add to our growing understanding of how the morphology of the nasal cavity may relate to function in this understudied region of the skull.</p>

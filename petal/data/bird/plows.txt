Aphid-borne Viral Spread Is Enhanced by Virus-induced Accumulation of Plant Reactive Oxygen Species
<p>Most known <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> viruses are spread from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> by insect vectors. There is strong evidence that nonpersistently transmitted viruses manipulate the release of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> volatiles to attract insect vectors, thereby promoting virus spread. The mechanisms whereby aphid settling and feeding is altered on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s infected with these viruses, however, are unclear. Here we employed loss-of-function mutations in cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) and one of its host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>), to elucidate such mechanisms. We show that, relative to a CMVΔ2b strain with a deletion of the viral suppressor of RNAi 2b protein in CMV, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s infected with wild-type CMV produce higher concentrations of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> tissues. Aphids on wild-type CMV-infected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s engage in shorter probes, less phloem feeding, and exhibit other changes, as detected by electrical penetration graphing technology, relative to CMVΔ2b-infected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Therefore, the frequency of virus acquisition and the virus load per aphid were greater on CMV-infected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s than on CMVΔ2b-infected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Aphids also moved away from initial feeding sites more frequently on wild-type CMV infected versus CMVΔ2b-infected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. The role of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in eliciting these effects on aphids was corroborated using healthy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s infused with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Finally, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels were not elevated, and aphid behavior was unchanged, on CMV-infected RbohD-silenced tobacco <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, which are deficient in the induction of ROS production. These results suggest that CMV uses its viral suppressor of RNAi protein to increase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> ROS levels, thereby enhancing its acquisition and transmission by vector insects.</p>

Gall induction may benefit host plant: a case of a gall wasp and eucalyptus tree
<p>Gall-inducing insects display intimate interactions with their host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, usually described as parasitic relationships; the galls seem to favor the galler alone. We report on a case in which the presence of the galls induced by <i>Leptocybe invasa</i> Fisher & LaSalle (Hymenoptera; Eulophidae) benefit its host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>, the river red gum <i>Eucalyptus camaldulensis</i> Dehnh. Field observations showed that <i>E. camaldulensis</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s infected by this gall wasp were less susceptible to cold injury than neighboring conspecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s without galls. In the laboratory, frost resistance was compared between galled and non-galled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s which were both divided into two subgroups: cold-acclimated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s that were non-acclimated. Galled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s displayed higher frost resistance than the non-galled ones, and the differences were higher in non-acclimated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s compared with acclimated ones. Physiological changes in host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> were determined by chemical analyses of chlorophylls, proteins, soluble sugars and anthocyanin contents. The results showed higher values of all physiological parameters in the galled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, supporting the hypothesis that the presence of the gall wasp induces physiological changes on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> foliage, which may in turn increase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> defense mechanisms against cold. Therefore, the toll of galling by the herbivore may pay off by the host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> acquiring increased frost resistance. This work provides evidence for physiological changes induced by a herbivore which might have a positive indirect effect on the host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>, promoting frost resistance such as cold acclimation.</p>

Plant-soil feedback and the maintenance of diversity in Mediterranean-climate shrublands
<p>Soil biota influence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> performance through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>-soil feedback, but it is unclear whether the strength of such feedback depends on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> traits and whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>-soil feedback drives local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> diversity. We grew 16 co-occurring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> species with contrasting nutrient-acquisition strategies from hyperdiverse Australian shrublands and exposed them to soil biota from under their own or other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> species. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> responses to soil biota varied according to their nutrient-acquisition strategy, including positive feedback for ectomycorrhizal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s and negative feedback for nitrogen-fixing and nonmycorrhizal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Simulations revealed that such strategy-dependent feedback is sufficient to maintain the high taxonomic and functional diversity characterizing these Mediterranean-climate shrublands. Our study identifies nutrient-acquisition strategy as a key trait explaining how different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> responses to soil biota promote local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> diversity.</p>

Importance of Fluctuations in Light on Plant Photosynthetic Acclimation
<p>The acclimation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s to light has been studied extensively, yet little is known about the effect of dynamic fluctuations in light on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> phenotype and acclimatory responses. We mimicked natural fluctuations in light over a diurnal period to examine the effect on the photosynthetic processes and growth of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). High and low light intensities, delivered via a realistic dynamic fluctuating or square wave pattern, were used to grow and assess <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s subjected to square wave light had thicker leaves and greater photosynthetic capacity compared with fluctuating light-grown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. This, together with elevated levels of proteins associated with electron transport, indicates greater investment in leaf structural components and photosynthetic processes. In contrast, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s grown under fluctuating light had thinner leaves, lower leaf light absorption, but maintained similar photosynthetic rates per unit leaf area to square wave-grown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Despite high light use efficiency, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s grown under fluctuating light had a slow growth rate early in development, likely due to the fact that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s grown under fluctuating conditions were not able to fully utilize the light energy absorbed for carbon fixation. Diurnal leaf-level measurements revealed a negative feedback control of photosynthesis, resulting in a decrease in total diurnal carbon assimilated of at least 20%. These findings highlight that growing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s under square wave growth conditions ultimately fails to predict <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> performance under realistic light regimes and stress the importance of considering fluctuations in incident light in future experiments that aim to infer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> productivity under natural conditions in the field.</p>

Isoscapes resolve species-specific spatial patterns in plant–plant interactions in an invaded Mediterranean dune ecosystem
<p>Environmental heterogeneity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> interactions are key factors shaping <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> communities. However, the spatial dimension of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> interactions has seldom been addressed in field studies. This is at least partially rooted in a lack of methods that can accurately resolve functional processes in a spatially explicit manner. Isoscapes, that is, spatially explicit representations of stable isotope data, provide a versatile means to trace functional changes on spatial scales, for example, related to N-cycling (foliar δ<sup>15</sup>N) and water use efficiency (WUE<sub>i</sub>, foliar δ<sup>13</sup>C). In a case study in a nutrient-depleted Mediterranean dune ecosystem, we analysed the spatial impact of the invasive N<sub>2</sub>-fixing <i>Acacia longifolia</i> on three native species of different functional types using δ<sup>15</sup>N and δ<sup>13</sup>C isoscapes and spatial autocorrelation analyses. Isoscapes revealed strong spatial patterns in δ<sup>15</sup>N and δ<sup>13</sup>C with pronounced species-specific differences, demonstrating distinct spatial ranges of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> interactions. A coniferous tree and an ericaceous dwarf shrub showed significant enrichment in δ<sup>15</sup>N within a range of 5–8 m surrounding the canopy of <i>A. longifolia</i>, indicating input of N originating from symbiotic N<sub>2</sub>-fixation by the invader. In the dwarf shrub, which was most responsive to invader influence, enrichment in δ<sup>13</sup>C additionally demonstrated spatially explicit changes to WUE<sub>i</sub>, while a native N<sub>2</sub>-fixer was unresponsive to the presence of the invader. Furthermore, δ<sup>15</sup>N and δ<sup>13</sup>C isoscapes yielded different patterns, indicating that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> interactions can have distinct spatial distributions and ranges based on the process measured. Additionally, the magnitude of the effect differed between field situations with high and low invasion pressure. This study highlights that the spatial scale must be accounted for when assessing the effects and outcome of species interactions. Functional tracers such as stable isotopes enable us to quantify spatial ranges of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> interactions, providing empirical data that can help to better understand and predict complex species interactions in multifaceted natural environments.</p>

<i>Trichoderma</i> Histone Deacetylase HDA-2 Modulates Multiple Responses in Arabidopsis
<p><i>Trichoderma</i> spp. are a rich source of secondary metabolites and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which may induce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> defenses and modulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth. In filamentous fungi, chromatin modifications regulate secondary metabolism. In this study we investigated how the absence of histone deacetylase HDA-2 in the <i>Trichoderma atroviride</i> strain Δ<i>hda-2</i> impacts its effect on a host, Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The production of VOCs and their impact on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth and development were assessed as well. The Δ<i>hda-2</i> strain was impaired in its ability to colonize Arabidopsis roots, thus affecting the promotion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth and modulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> defenses against foliar pathogens <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> and <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i>, which normally result from interaction with <i>T. atroviride</i>. Furthermore, Δ<i>hda-2</i> VOCs were incapable of triggering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> defenses to counterattack foliar pathogens. The Δ<i>hda-2</i> overproduced the VOC 6-pentyl-2H-pyran-2-one (6-PP), which resulted in enhanced root branching and differentially regulated phytohormone-related genes. Analysis of ten VOCs (including 6-PP) revealed that three of them positively regulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth, whereas six had the opposite effect. Assessment of secondary metabolites, detoxification, and communication with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>-related genes showed a dual role for HDA-2 in <i>T. atroviride</i> gene expression regulation during its interaction with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Chromatin immunoprecipitation of acetylated histone H3 on the promoters of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>-responsive genes in Δ<i>hda-2</i> showed, in the presence of Arabidopsis, low levels of <i>epl-1</i> and <i>abc-2</i> compared with that in the wild type; whereas <i>ctf-1</i> presented high constitutive levels, supporting a dual role of HDA-2 in gene regulation. This work highlights the importance of HDA-2 as a global regulator in <i>Trichoderma</i> to modulate multiple responses in Arabidopsis.</p>

Plant Phenotyping: An Active Vision Cell for Three-Dimensional Plant Shoot Reconstruction
<p>Three-dimensional (3D) computer-generated models of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s are urgently needed to support both phenotyping and simulation-based studies such as photosynthesis modeling. However, the construction of accurate 3D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> models is challenging, as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s are complex objects with an intricate leaf structure, often consisting of thin and highly reflective surfaces that vary in shape and size, forming dense, complex, crowded scenes. We address these issues within an image-based method by taking an active vision approach, one that investigates the scene to intelligently capture images, to image acquisition. Rather than use the same camera positions for all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, our technique is to acquire the images needed to reconstruct the target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>, tuning camera placement to match the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>’s individual structure. Our method also combines volumetric- and surface-based reconstruction methods and determines the necessary images based on the analysis of voxel clusters. We describe a fully automatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> modeling/phenotyping cell (or module) comprising a six-axis robot and a high-precision turntable. By using a standard color camera, we overcome the difficulties associated with laser-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> reconstruction methods. The 3D models produced are compared with those obtained from fixed cameras and evaluated by comparison with data obtained by x-ray microcomputed tomography across different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> structures. Our results show that our method is successful in improving the accuracy and quality of data obtained from a variety of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> types.</p>

Identification of a Hexenal Reductase That Modulates the Composition of Green Leaf Volatiles
<p>Green leaf volatiles (GLVs), including six-carbon (C6) aldehydes, alcohols, and esters, are formed when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> tissues are damaged. GLVs play roles in direct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> defense at wound sites, indirect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> defense via the attraction of herbivore predators, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> communication. GLV components provoke distinctive responses in their target recipients; therefore, the control of GLV composition is important for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s to appropriately manage stress responses. The reduction of C6-aldehydes into C6-alcohols is a key step in the control of GLV composition and also is important to avoid a toxic buildup of C6-aldehydes. However, the molecular mechanisms behind C6-aldehyde reduction remain poorly understood. In this study, we purified an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) NADPH-dependent cinnamaldehyde and hexenal reductase encoded by At4g37980, named here CINNAMALDEHYDE AND HEXENAL REDUCTASE (CHR). <i>CHR</i> T-DNA knockout mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s displayed a normal growth phenotype; however, we observed significant suppression of C6-alcohol production following partial mechanical wounding or herbivore infestation. Our data also showed that the parasitic wasp <i>Cotesia vestalis</i> was more attracted to GLVs emitted from herbivore-infested wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s compared with GLVs emitted from <i>chr</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, which corresponded with reduced C6-alcohol levels in the mutant. Moreover, <i>chr</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s were more susceptible to exogenous high-dose exposure to (<i>Z</i>)-3-hexenal, as indicated by their markedly lowered photosystem II activity. Our study shows that reductases play significant roles in changing GLV composition and, thus, are important in avoiding toxicity from volatile carbonyls and in the attraction of herbivore predators.</p>

Improving Plant Nitrogen Use Efficiency through Alteration of Amino Acid Transport Processes
<p>Improving the efficiency of nitrogen (N) uptake and utilization in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s could potentially increase crop yields while reducing N fertilization and, subsequently, environmental pollution. Within most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, N is transported primarily as amino acids. In this study, pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s overexpressing <i>AMINO ACID PERMEASE1</i> (<i>AAP1</i>) were used to determine if and how genetic manipulation of amino acid transport from source to sink affects <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> N use efficiency. The modified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s were grown under low, moderate, or high N fertilization regimes. The results showed that, independent of the N nutrition, the engineered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s allocate more N via the vasculature to the shoot and seeds and produce more biomass and higher seed yields than wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Dependent on the amount of N supplied, the <i>AAP1</i>-overexpressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s displayed improved N uptake or utilization efficiency, or a combination of the two. They also showed significantly increased N use efficiency in N-deficient as well as in N-rich soils and, impressively, required half the amount of N to produce as many fruits and seeds as control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Together, these data support that engineering N allocation from source to sink presents an effective strategy to produce crop <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s with improved productivity as well as N use efficiency in a range of N environments.</p>

A Group D MAPK Protects Plants from Autotoxicity by Suppressing Herbivore-Induced Defense Signaling
<p>The mechanisms by which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s activate and enhance defense responses have been well studied; however, the regulatory mechanisms that allow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s to avoid excessive defense responses are poorly understood. Here, we identified a group D mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) gene from rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), <i>OsMAPK20-5</i>, whose expression was rapidly induced by infestation of gravid female adults of a destructive rice pest, brown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>hopper (BPH, <i>Nilaparvata lugens</i>), but not by BPH nymphs. Expression silencing of <i>OsMAPK20-5</i> (irMAPK) increased the accumulation of ethylene and nitric oxide (NO) after gravid female BPH infestation, and thereby increased rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> resistance to BPH adults and oviposited eggs. However, when exposed to high densities of gravid BPH females, irMAPK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s wilted earlier than wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, which could be attributed to the hyperaccumulation of ethylene and NO in irMAPK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Interestingly, when released into the field, irMAPK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s displayed broad resistance to BPH and white-backed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>hopper (<i>Sogatella furcifera</i>), the two most destructive pests of rice, and produced higher yield. Taken together, our study shows that although OsMAPK20-5 can reduce the resistance of rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>hoppers, it also enables rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s to control excessive defense responses and thereby prevents defense-response–related autotoxicity.</p>

Massive Tandem Proliferation of ELIPs Supports Convergent Evolution of Desiccation Tolerance across Land Plants
<p>Desiccation tolerance was a critical adaptation for the colonization of land by early nonvascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Resurrection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s have maintained or rewired these ancestral protective mechanisms, and desiccation-tolerant species are dispersed across the land <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> phylogeny. Although common physiological, biochemical, and molecular signatures are observed across resurrection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> lineages, features underlying the recurrent evolution of desiccation tolerance are unknown. Here we used a comparative approach to identify patterns of genome evolution and gene duplication associated with desiccation tolerance. We identified a single gene family with dramatic expansion in all sequenced resurrection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> genomes and no expansion in desiccation-sensitive species. This gene family of early light-induced proteins (ELIPs) expanded in resurrection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s convergent through repeated tandem gene duplication. ELIPs are universally highly expressed during desiccation in all surveyed resurrection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s and may play a role in protecting against photooxidative damage of the photosynthetic apparatus during prolonged dehydration. Photosynthesis is particularly sensitive to dehydration, and the increased abundance of ELIPs may help facilitate the rapid recovery observed for most resurrection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Together, these observations support convergent evolution of desiccation tolerance in land <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s through tandem gene duplication.</p>

BZR1 Mediates Brassinosteroid-Induced Autophagy and Nitrogen Starvation in Tomato
<p>Autophagy, an innate cellular destructive mechanism, plays crucial roles in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> development and responses to stress. Autophagy is known to be stimulated or suppressed by multiple molecular processes, but the role of phytohormone signaling in autophagy is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the transcripts of autophagy-related genes (<i>ATGs</i>) and the formation of autophagosomes are triggered by enhanced levels of brassinosteroid (BR). Furthermore, the BR-activated transcription factor brassinazole-resistant1 (BZR1), a positive regulator of the BR signaling pathway, is involved in BR-induced autophagy. Treatment with BR enhanced the formation of autophagosomes and the transcripts of <i>ATGs</i> in <i>BZR1</i>-overexpressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, while the effects of BR were compromised in <i>BZR1</i>-silenced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Yeast one-hybrid analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with quantitative polymerase chain reaction revealed that BZR1 bound to the promoters of <i>ATG2</i> and <i>ATG6</i>. The BR-induced formation of autophagosomes decreased in <i>ATG2</i>- and <i>ATG6</i>-silenced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Moreover, exogenous application of BR enhanced chlorophyll content and autophagosome formation and decreased the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins under nitrogen starvation. Leaf chlorosis and chlorophyll degradation were exacerbated in <i>BZR1</i>-silenced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s and the BR biosynthetic mutant <i>d<sup>^im</sup></i> but were alleviated in <i>BZR1</i>- and <i>BZR1-1D</i>-overexpressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s under nitrogen starvation. Meanwhile, nitrogen starvation-induced expression of <i>ATGs</i> and autophagosome formation were compromised in both <i>BZR1</i>-silenced and <i>d<sup>^im</sup></i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s but were increased in <i>BZR1</i>- and <i>BZR1-1D</i>-overexpressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Taken together, our results suggest that BZR1-dependent BR signaling up-regulates the expression of <i>ATGs</i> and autophagosome formation, which plays a critical role in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> response to nitrogen starvation in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>).</p>

Leaf Amino Acid Supply Affects Photosynthetic and Plant Nitrogen Use Efficiency under Nitrogen Stress
<p>The coordinated distribution of nitrogen to source leaves and sinks is essential for supporting leaf metabolism while also supplying sufficient nitrogen to seeds for development. This study aimed to understand how regulated amino acid allocation to leaves affects photosynthesis and overall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> nitrogen use efficiency in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and how soil nitrogen availability influences these processes. Arabidopsis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s with a knockout of <i>AAP2</i>, encoding an amino acid permease involved in xylem-to-phloem transfer of root-derived amino acids, were grown in low-, moderate-, and high-nitrogen environments. We analyzed nitrogen allocation to shoot tissues, photosynthesis, and photosynthetic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> nitrogen use efficiency in these knockout <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Our results demonstrate that, independent of nitrogen conditions, <i>aap2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s allocate more nitrogen to leaves than wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Increased leaf nitrogen supply positively affected chlorophyll and Rubisco levels, photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency, and carbon assimilation and transport to sinks. The <i>aap2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s outperformed wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s with respect to growth, seed yield and carbon storage pools, and nitrogen use efficiency in both high and deficient nitrogen environments. Overall, this study demonstrates that increasing nitrogen allocation to leaves represents an effective strategy for improving carbon fixation and photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency. The results indicate that an optimized coordination of nitrogen and carbon partitioning processes is critical for high oilseed production in Arabidopsis, including in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s exposed to limiting nitrogen conditions.</p>

MicroRNA166 Modulates Cadmium Tolerance and Accumulation in Rice

In this study, we analyzed the role of miR166 in Cd accumulation and tolerance in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). The expression levels of miR166 in both root and leaf tissues were significantly higher in the reproductive stage than in the seedling stage in rice. The expression of miR166 in the roots of rice seedlings was reduced after Cd treatment. Overexpression of miR166 in rice improved Cd tolerance, a result associated with the reduction of Cd-induced oxidative stress in transgenic rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Furthermore, overexpression of miR166 reduced both Cd translocation from roots to shoots and Cd accumulation in the grains. miR166 targets genes encoding the class-III homeodomain-Leu zipper (HD-Zip) family proteins in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. In rice, <i>HOMEODOMAIN CONTAINING PROTEIN4</i> (<i>OsHB4</i>) gene (Os03g43930), which encodes an HD-Zip protein, was up-regulated by Cd treatment but down-regulated by overexpression of miR166 in transgenic rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Overexpression of <i>OsHB4</i> increased Cd sensitivity and Cd accumulation in the leaves and grains of transgenic rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. By contrast, silencing <i>OsHB4</i> by RNA interference enhanced Cd tolerance in transgenic rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. These results indicate a critical role for miR166 in Cd accumulation and tolerance through regulation of its target gene, <i>OsHB4</i>, in rice.</p>

The Genetic Basis of Plant Architecture in 10 Maize Recombinant Inbred Line Populations
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> architecture is a key factor affecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>ing density and grain yield in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). However, the genetic mechanisms underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> architecture in diverse genetic backgrounds have not been fully addressed. Here, we performed a large-scale phenotyping of 10 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> architecture-related traits and dissected the genetic loci controlling these traits in 10 recombinant inbred line populations derived from 14 diverse genetic backgrounds. Nearly 800 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with major and minor effects were identified as contributing to the phenotypic variation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> architecture-related traits. Ninety-two percent of these QTLs were detected in only one population, confirming the diverse genetic backgrounds of the mapping populations and the prevalence of rare alleles in maize. The numbers and effects of QTLs are positively associated with the phenotypic variation in the population, which, in turn, correlates positively with parental phenotypic and genetic variations. A large proportion (38.5%) of QTLs was associated with at least two traits, suggestive of the frequent occurrence of pleiotropic loci or closely linked loci. Key developmental genes, which previously were shown to affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> architecture in mutant studies, were found to colocalize with many QTLs. Five QTLs were further validated using the segregating populations developed from residual heterozygous lines present in the recombinant inbred line populations. Additionally, one new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> height QTL, <i>qPH3</i>, has been fine-mapped to a 600-kb genomic region where three candidate genes are located. These results provide insights into the genetic mechanisms controlling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> architecture and will benefit the selection of ideal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> architecture in maize breeding.</p>

Gcorn Plant: A Database for Retrieving Functional and Evolutionary Traits of Plant Genes
<p>Gene homology helps us understand gene function and speciation. The number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> genes and species registered in public databanks is continuously increasing. It is useful to associate homologous genes of various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s to better understand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> speciation. We designed the Gcorn <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> database for the retrieval of information on homology and evolution of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> gene of interest. Amino acid sequences of 73 species (62 land <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s and 11 green algae), containing 2,682,261 sequences, were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Reference Sequence database. Based on NCBI BLAST searches between these sequences, homologous genes were grouped at various thresholds of homology indices devised by the authors. To show functional and evolutionary traits of a gene of interest, a phylogenetic tree, connecting genes with high homology indices, and line charts of the numbers of genes with various homology indices, are depicted. In addition, such indices are projected on a network graph in which species studied are connected based on the ratios of homologous genes, and on a phylogenetic tree for species based on NCBI Taxonomy. Gcorn <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> provides information on homologous genes at various virtual time points along with speciation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s.</p>

Mesophyll Abscisic Acid Restrains Early Growth and Flowering But Does Not Directly Suppress Photosynthesis
<p>Abscisic acid (ABA) levels increase significantly in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s under stress conditions, and ABA is thought to serve as a key stress-response regulator. However, the direct effect of ABA on photosynthesis and the effect of mesophyll ABA on yield under both well-watered and drought conditions are still the subject of debate. Here, we examined this issue using transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s carrying a dominant ABA-signaling inhibitor under the control of a mesophyll-specific promoter (<i>FBPase::abi1-1</i>, abbreviated to <i>fa</i>). Under normal conditions, <i>fa</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s displayed slightly higher stomatal conductance and carbon assimilation than wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s; however, these parameters were comparable following ABA treatment. These observations suggest that ABA does not directly inhibit photosynthesis in the short term. The <i>fa</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s also exhibited a variety of altered phenotypes under optimal conditions, including more vigorous initial growth, earlier flowering, smaller flowers, and delayed chlorophyll degradation. Furthermore, under optimal conditions, <i>fa</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> seed production was less than a third of that observed for the wild type. However, under drought conditions, wild-type and <i>fa</i> seed yields were similar due to a significant reduction in wild-type seed and no reduction in <i>fa</i> seed. These findings suggest that endogenous basal ABA inhibits a stress-escape response under nonstressed conditions, allowing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s to accumulate biomass and maximize yield. The lack of a correlation between flowering time and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> biomass combined with delayed chlorophyll degradation suggests that this stress-escape behavior is regulated independently and upstream of other ABA-induced effects such as rapid growth and flowering.</p>

The Potassium Transporter SlHAK10 Is Involved in Mycorrhizal Potassium Uptake
<p>Most terrestrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s form a root symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, which receive fixed carbon from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> and enhance the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>’s uptake of mineral nutrients. AM symbiosis improves the phosphorous and nitrogen nutrition of host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s; however, little is known about the role of AM symbiosis in potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) nutrition. Here, we report that inoculation with the AM fungus <i>Rhizophagus irregularis</i> improved tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth and K<sup>+</sup> acquisition and that K<sup>+</sup> deficiency has a negative effect on root growth and AM colonization. Based on its homology to a <i>Lotus japonicus</i> AM-induced K<sup>+</sup> transporter, we identified a mycorrhiza-specific tomato K<sup>+</sup> transporter, SlHAK10 (<i>Solanum lycopersicum High-affinity Potassium Transporter10</i>), that was exclusively expressed in arbuscule-containing cells. <i>SlHAK10</i> could restore a yeast K<sup>+</sup> uptake-defective mutant in the low-affinity concentration range. Loss of function of <i>SlHAK10</i> led to a significant decrease in mycorrhizal K<sup>+</sup> uptake and AM colonization rate under low-K<sup>+</sup> conditions but did not affect arbuscule development. Overexpressing <i>SlHAK10</i> from the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter or the AM-specific <i>Solanum melongena Phosphate Transporter4</i> not only improved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth and K<sup>+</sup> uptake but also increased AM colonization efficiency and soluble sugar content in roots supplied with low K<sup>+</sup>. Our results indicate that tomato <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s have a SlHAK10<i>-</i>mediated mycorrhizal K<sup>+</sup> uptake pathway and that improved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> K<sup>+</sup> nutrition could increase carbohydrate accumulation in roots, which facilitates AM fungal colonization.</p>

Components of Water Use Efficiency Have Unique Genetic Signatures in the Model C<sub>4</sub> Grass <i>Setaria</i>
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth and water use are interrelated processes influenced by genetically controlled morphological and biochemical characteristics. Improving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> water use efficiency (WUE) to sustain growth in different environments is an important breeding objective that can improve crop yields and enhance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">agricultur</span></strong>al sustainability. However, genetic improvement of WUE using traditional methods has proven difficult due to the low throughput and environmental heterogeneity of field settings. To overcome these limitations, this study utilizes a high-throughput phenotyping platform to quantify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> size and water use of an interspecific <i>Setaria italica</i> × <i>Setaria viridis</i> recombinant inbred line population at daily intervals in both well-watered and water-limited conditions. Our findings indicate that measurements of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> size and water use are correlated strongly in this system; therefore, a linear modeling approach was used to partition this relationship into predicted values of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> size given water use and deviations from this relationship at the genotype level. The resulting traits describing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> size, water use, and WUE all were heritable and responsive to soil water availability, allowing for a genetic dissection of the components of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> WUE under different watering treatments. Linkage mapping identified major loci underlying two different pleiotropic components of WUE. This study indicates that alleles controlling WUE derived from both wild and domesticated accessions can be utilized to predictably modulate trait values given a specified precipitation regime in the model C<sub>4</sub> genus <i>Setaria</i>.</p>

The Tomato Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase SlMPK1 Is as a Negative Regulator of the High-Temperature Stress Response
<p>High-temperature (HT) stress is a major environmental stress that limits <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth and development. MAPK cascades play key roles in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth and stress signaling, but their involvement in the HT stress response is poorly understood. Here, we describe a 47-kD MBP-phosphorylated protein (p47-MBPK) activated in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) leaves under HT and identify it as SlMPK1 by tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Silencing of <i>SlMPK1</i> in transgenic tomato <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s resulted in enhanced tolerance to HT, while overexpression resulted in reduced tolerance. Proteomic analysis identified a set of proteins involved in antioxidant defense that are significantly more abundant in RNA interference-<i>SlMPK1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s than nontransgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s under HT stress. RNA interference-<i>SlMPK1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s also showed changes in membrane lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzyme activities. Furthermore, using yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified a serine-proline-rich protein homolog, SlSPRH1, which interacts with SlMPK1 in yeast, in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> cells, and in vitro. We demonstrate that SlMPK1 can directly phosphorylate SlSPRH1. Furthermore, the serine residue serine-44 of SlSPRH1 is a crucial phosphorylation site in the SlMPK1-mediated antioxidant defense mechanism activated during HT stress. We also demonstrate that heterologous expression of <i>SlSPRH1</i> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) led to a decrease in thermotolerance and lower antioxidant capacity. Taken together, our results suggest that SlMPK1 is a negative regulator of thermotolerance in tomato <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. SlMPK1 acts by regulating antioxidant defense, and its substrate SlSPRH1 is involved in this pathway.</p>

Out of Water: The Origin and Early Diversification of Plant <i>R</i>-Genes

NBS-LRR proteins represent a major class of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> disease resistance genes (<i>R</i>-genes). Whereas <i>R</i>-genes have been well characterized in angiosperms, little is known about their origin and early diversification. Here, we perform comprehensive evolutionary analyses of <i>R</i>-genes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s and report the identification of <i>R</i>-genes in basal-branching streptophytes, including charophytes, liverworts, and mosses. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> <i>R</i>-genes originated in charophytes and R-proteins diversified into TIR-NBS-LRR proteins and non-TIR-NBS-LRR proteins in charophytes. Moreover, we show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> R-proteins evolved in a modular fashion through frequent gain or loss of protein domains. Most of the <i>R</i>-genes in basal-branching streptophytes underwent adaptive evolution, indicating an ancient involvement of <i>R</i>-genes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>-pathogen interactions. Our findings provide novel insights into the origin and evolution of <i>R</i>-genes and the mechanisms underlying colonization of terrestrial environments by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s.</p>

The MtDMI2-MtPUB2 Negative Feedback Loop Plays a Role in Nodulation Homeostasis
<p>DOES NOT MAKE INFECTION 2 (MtDMI2) is a Leu rich repeat-type receptor kinase required for signal transduction in the <i>Medicago truncatula/Sinorhizobium meliloti</i> symbiosis pathway. However, the mechanisms through which MtDMI2 participates in nodulation homeostasis are poorly understood. In this study, we identified MtPUB2—a novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> U-box (PUB)–type E3 ligase—and showed that it interacts with MtDMI2. MtDMI2 and MtPUB2 accumulation were shown to be similar in various tissues. Roots of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s in which <i>MtPUB2</i> was silenced by RNAi (<i>MtPUB2-</i>RNAi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s) exhibited impaired infection threads, fewer nodules, and shorter primary root lengths compared to those of control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s transformed with empty vector. Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, we showed that MtDMI2 phosphorylates MtPUB2 at Ser-316, Ser-421, and Thr-488 residues. When <i>MtPUB2</i>-RNAi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s were transformed with <i>MtPUB2<sup>S421D</sup></i>, which mimics the phosphorylated state, MtDMI2 was persistently ubiquitinated and degraded by MtPUB2<sup>S421D</sup>, resulting in fewer nodules than observed in <i>MtPUB2</i>/<i>MtPUB2</i>-RNAi-complemented <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. However, <i>MtPUB2<sup>S421A</sup></i>/<i>MtPUB2</i>-RNAi-complemented <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s showed no MtPUB2 ubiquitination activity, and their nodulation phenotype was similar to that of <i>MtPUB2</i>-RNAi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s transformed with empty vector. Further studies demonstrated that these proteins form a negative feedback loop of the prey (MtDMI2)-predator (MtPUB2) type. Our results suggest that the MtDMI2-MtPUB2 negative feedback loop, which displays crosstalk with the long-distance autoregulation of nodulation via MtNIN, plays an important role in nodulation homeostasis.</p>

Giberellic Acid-Stimulated Transcript Proteins Evolved through Successive Conjugation of Novel Motifs and Their Subfunctionalization
<p><i>Gibberellic Acid Stimulated Transcript</i> (<i>GAST</i>)-like genes encode small polypeptides, some of which have been implicated in diverse biological processes regulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth and development. However, the occurrence of GASTs among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, their protein structures, and the mechanisms by which they evolved remain elusive. Here, using a customized workflow, we report genes encoding GAST proteins, identify novel motifs and evolutionary patterns contributing to the subfunctionalization of GAST domains, and explore functional conservation across diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> groups. We show that <i>GAST</i>-like sequences evolved initially in the vascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> <i>Selaginella moellendorffii</i>, after the divergence from bryophytes, and later emerged in gymnosperms and angiosperms. GASTs in angiosperms are characterized by four conserved novel motifs; however, relatively fewer conserved motifs exist in pteridophytes and gymnosperms. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the GAST-Cysteine Rich1 motif evolved early in the <i>S. moellendorffii</i> GAST, which further acquired subfunctionalization through successive conjugation of other motifs and remained conserved across <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, as supported by their collinearity. Functional characterization of two orthologs from the dicot Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>; <i>Gibberellic Acid-Stimulated Arabidopsis 10</i>) and the monocot rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>; <i>Gibberellic Acid Stimulated Transcript-Related 9</i>) suggests hormonal regulation, novel roles in seed germination, and functional conservation among diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> groups. Computational modeling predicts that these <i>GAST</i> genes are regulated by several factors, including the phytohormones gibberellin and abscisic acid, through conserved cis-motifs present in their promoters, and that they might act as signaling molecules in a complex feedback loop. Thus, our study identifies <i>GAST</i>s and their encoded proteins, uncovers their structure, novel motifs, and evolutionary pattern among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, and suggests their functional conservation.</p>

The R2R3-MYB Transcription Factor MYB49 Regulates Cadmium Accumulation
<p>Abscisic acid (ABA) reduces accumulation of potentially toxic cadmium (Cd) in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. How the ABA signal is transmitted to modulate Cd uptake remains largely unclear. Here, we report that the basic region/Leu zipper transcription factor ABSCISIC ACID-INSENSITIVE5 (ABI5), a central ABA signaling molecule, is involved in ABA-repressed Cd accumulation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s by physically interacting with a previously uncharacterized R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, MYB49. Overexpression of the Cd-induced <i>MYB49</i> gene in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) resulted in a significant increase in Cd accumulation, whereas <i>myb49</i> knockout <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s expressing chimeric repressors of <i>MYB49</i>:ERF-associated amphiphilic repression motif repression domain (<i>SRDX49</i>) exhibited reduced accumulation of Cd. Further investigations revealed that MYB49 positively regulates the expression of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors <i>bHLH38</i> and <i>bHLH101</i> by directly binding to their promoters, leading to activation of <i>IRON-REGULATED TRANSPORTER1</i>, which encodes a metal transporter involved in Cd uptake. MYB49 also binds to the promoter regions of the heavy metal-associated isoprenylated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> proteins (<i>HIPP22</i>) and <i>HIPP44</i>, resulting in up-regulation of their expression and subsequent Cd accumulation. On the other hand, as a feedback mechanism to control Cd uptake and accumulation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> cells, Cd-induced ABA up-regulates the expression of <i>ABI5</i>, whose protein product interacts with MYB49 and prevents its binding to the promoters of downstream genes, thereby reducing Cd accumulation. Our results provide new insights into the molecular feedback mechanisms underlying ABA signaling-controlled Cd uptake and accumulation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s.</p>

12-Oxo-Phytodienoic Acid Acts as a Regulator of Maize Defense against Corn Leaf Aphid
<p>The corn leaf aphid (CLA; <i>Rhopalosiphum maidis</i>) is a phloem sap-sucking insect that attacks many cereal crops, including maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). We previously showed that the maize inbred line Mp708, which was developed by classical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> breeding, provides enhanced resistance to CLA. Here, using electrophysiological monitoring of aphid feeding behavior, we demonstrate that Mp708 provides phloem-mediated resistance to CLA. Furthermore, feeding by CLA on Mp708 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s enhanced callose deposition, a potential defense mechanism utilized by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s to limit aphid feeding and subsequent colonization. In maize, benzoxazinoids (BX) or BX-derived metabolites contribute to enhanced callose deposition by providing heightened resistance to CLA. However, BX and BX-derived metabolites were not significantly altered in CLA-infested Mp708 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, indicating BX-independent defense against CLA. Evidence presented here suggests that the constitutively higher levels of 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA) in Mp708 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s contributed to enhanced callose accumulation and heightened CLA resistance. OPDA enhanced the expression of ethylene biosynthesis and receptor genes, and the synergistic interactions of OPDA and CLA feeding significantly induced the expression of the transcripts encoding Maize insect resistance1-Cysteine Protease, a key defensive protein against insect pests, in Mp708 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Furthermore, exogenous application of OPDA on maize jasmonic acid-deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s caused enhanced callose accumulation and heightened resistance to CLA, suggesting that the OPDA-mediated resistance to CLA is independent of the jasmonic acid pathway. We further demonstrate that the signaling function of OPDA, rather than a direct toxic effect, contributes to enhanced CLA resistance in Mp708.</p>

The Role of Gβ Protein in Controlling Cell Expansion via Potential Interaction with Lipid Metabolic Pathways
<p>Heterotrimeric G-proteins influence almost all aspects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth, development, and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, likely via their interaction with specific effectors. However, the identity of such effectors and their mechanism of action are mostly unknown. While investigating the roles of different G-protein subunits in modulating the oil content in Camelina (<i>Camelina sativa</i>), an oil seed crop, we uncovered a role of Gβ proteins in controlling anisotropic cell expansion. Knockdown of <i>Gβ</i> genes causes reduced longitudinal and enhanced transverse expansion, resulting in altered cell, tissue, and organ shapes in transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s during vegetative and reproductive development. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s also exhibited substantial changes in their fatty acid and phospholipid profiles, which possibly leads to the increased oil content of the transgenic seeds. This increase is potentially caused by the direct interaction of Gβ proteins with a specific patatin-like phospholipase, pPLAIIIδ. Camelina <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s with suppressed <i>Gβ</i> expression exhibit higher lipase activity, and show phenotypes similar to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s overexpressing <i>pPLAIIIδ</i>, suggesting that the Gβ proteins are negative regulators of pPLAIIIδ. These results reveal interactions between the G-protein–mediated and lipid signaling/metabolic pathways, where specific phospholipases may act as effectors that control key developmental and environmental responses of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s.</p>

SlHY5 Integrates Temperature, Light, and Hormone Signaling to Balance Plant Growth and Cold Tolerance
<p>During the transition from warm to cool seasons, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s experience decreased temperatures, shortened days, and decreased red/far-red (R/FR) ratios of light. The mechanism by which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s integrate these environmental cues to maintain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth and adaptation remains poorly understood. Here, we report that low temperature induced the transcription of <i>PHYTOCHROME A</i> and accumulation of LONG HYPOCOTYL5 (SlHY5, a basic Leu zipper transcription factor) in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, especially under short day conditions with low R/FR light ratios. Reverse genetic approaches and physiological analyses revealed that silencing of <i>SlHY5</i> increased cold susceptibility in tomato <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, whereas overexpression of <i>SlHY5</i> enhanced cold tolerance. SlHY5 directly bound to and activated the transcription of genes encoding a gibberellin-inactivation enzyme, namely <i>GIBBERELLIN2-OXIDASE4</i>, and an abscisic acid biosynthetic enzyme, namely <i>9-CIS-EPOXYCAROTENOID DIOXYGENASE6</i> (<i>SlNCED6</i>). Thus, phytochrome A-dependent SlHY5 accumulation resulted in an increased abscisic acid/gibberellin ratio, which was accompanied by growth cessation and induction of cold response. Furthermore, silencing of <i>SlNCED6</i> compromises short day- and low R/FR-induced tomato resistance to cold stress. These findings provide insight into the molecular genetic mechanisms by which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s integrate environmental stimuli with hormones to coordinate their growth with impending cold temperatures. Moreover, this work reveals a molecular mechanism that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s have evolved for growth and survival in response to seasonal changes.</p>

<p>MicroRNAs are 19- to 22-nucleotide small noncoding RNAs that have been implicated in abiotic stress responses. In this study, we found that knockdown of microRNA166, using the Short Tandem Target Mimic (STTM) system, resulted in morphological changes that confer drought resistance in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). From a large-scale screen for miRNA knockdown lines in rice, we identified miR166 knockdown lines (STTM166); these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s exhibit a rolled-leaf phenotype, which is normally displayed by rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s under drought stress. The leaves of STTM166 rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s had smaller bulliform cells and abnormal sclerenchymatous cells, likely causing the rolled-leaf phenotype. The STTM166 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s had reduced stomatal conductance and showed decreased transpiration rates. The STTM166 lines also exhibited altered stem xylem and decreased hydraulic conductivity, likely due to the reduced diameter of the xylem vessels. Molecular analyses identified rice <i>HOMEODOMAIN CONTAINING PROTEIN4</i> (<i>OsHB4</i>), a member of HD-Zip III gene family, as a major target of miR166; moreover, rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s overexpressing a miR166-resistant form of <i>OsHB4</i> resembled the STTM166 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, including leaf rolling and higher drought resistance. The genes downstream of miR166-<i>OsHB4</i> consisted of polysaccharide synthesis-related genes that may contribute to cell wall formation and vascular development. Our results suggest that drought resistance in rice can be increased by manipulating miRNAs, which leads to developmental changes, such as leaf rolling and reduced diameter of the xylem, that mimic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s’ natural responses to water-deficit stress.</p>

A Mucin-Like Protein of Planthopper Is Required for Feeding and Induces Immunity Response in Plants
<p>The brown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>hopper, <i>Nilaparvata lugens</i>, is a pest that threatens rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) production worldwide. While feeding on rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>hoppers secrete saliva, which plays crucial roles in nutrient ingestion and modulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> defense responses, although the specific functions of salivary proteins remain largely unknown. We identified an <i>N. lugens</i>-secreted mucin-like protein (NlMLP) by transcriptome and proteome analyses and characterized its function, both in brown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>hopper and in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. <i>NlMLP</i> is highly expressed in salivary glands and is secreted into rice during feeding. Inhibition of <i>NlMLP</i> expression in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>hoppers disturbs the formation of salivary sheaths, thereby reducing their performance. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, NlMLP induces cell death, the expression of defense-related genes, and callose deposition. These defense responses are related to Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization and the MEK2 MAP kinase and jasmonic acid signaling pathways. The active region of NlMLP that elicits <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> responses is located in its carboxyl terminus. Our work provides a detailed characterization of a salivary protein from a piercing-sucking insect other than aphids. Our finding that the protein functions in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> immune responses offers new insights into the mechanism underlying interactions between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s and herbivorous insects.</p>

The Distinct Roles of Class I and II RPD3-Like Histone Deacetylases in Salinity Stress Response
<p>Histone acetylation is an essential process in the epigenetic regulation of diverse biological processes, including environmental stress responses in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Previously, our research group identified a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor (HDI) that confers salt tolerance in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). In this study, we demonstrate that class I HDAC (HDA19) and class II HDACs (HDA5/14/15/18) control responses to salt stress through different pathways. The screening of 12 different selective HDIs indicated that seven newly reported HDIs enhance salt tolerance. Genetic analysis, based on a pharmacological study, identified which HDACs function in salinity stress tolerance. In the wild-type Columbia-0 background, <i>hda19</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s exhibit tolerance to high-salinity stress, while <i>hda5/14/15/18</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s exhibit hypersensitivity to salt stress. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the effect of <i>HDA19</i> deficiency on the response to salinity stress is distinct from that of <i>HDA5/14/15/18</i> deficiencies. In <i>hda19</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, the expression levels of stress tolerance-related genes, late embryogenesis abundant proteins that prevent protein aggregation and positive regulators such as ABI5 and NAC019 in abscisic acid signaling, were induced strongly relative to the wild type. Neither of these elements was up-regulated in the <i>hda5/14/15/18</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. The mutagenesis of HDA19 by genome editing in the <i>hda5/14/15/18</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s enhanced salt tolerance, suggesting that suppression of HDA19 masks the phenotype caused by the suppression of class II HDACs in the salinity stress response. Collectively, our results demonstrate that HDIs that inhibit class I HDACs allow the rescue of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s from salinity stress regardless of their selectivity, and they provide insight into the hierarchal regulation of environmental stress responses through HDAC isoforms.</p>

Identification of Novel Growth Regulators in Plant Populations Expressing Random Peptides
<p>The use of chemical genomics approaches allows the identification of small molecules that integrate into biological systems, thereby changing discrete processes that influence growth, development, or metabolism. Libraries of chemicals are applied to living systems, and changes in phenotype are observed, potentially leading to the identification of new growth regulators. This work describes an approach that is the nexus of chemical genomics and synthetic biology. Here, each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> in an extensive population synthesizes a unique small peptide arising from a transgene composed of a randomized nucleic acid sequence core flanked by translational start, stop, and cysteine-encoding (for disulfide cyclization) sequences. Ten and 16 amino acid sequences, bearing a core of six and 12 random amino acids, have been synthesized in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Populations were screened for phenotypes from the seedling stage through senescence. Dozens of phenotypes were observed in over 2,000 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s analyzed. Ten conspicuous phenotypes were verified through separate transformation and analysis of multiple independent lines. The results indicate that these populations contain sequences that often influence discrete aspects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> biology. Novel peptides that affect photosynthesis, flowering, and red light response are described. The challenge now is to identify the mechanistic integrations of these peptides into biochemical processes. These populations serve as a new tool to identify small molecules that modulate discrete <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> functions that could be produced later in transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s or potentially applied exogenously to impart their effects. These findings could usher in a new generation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">agricultur</span></strong>al growth regulators, herbicides, or defense compounds.</p>

Root Cortical Senescence Improves Growth under Suboptimal Availability of N, P, and K
<p>Root cortical senescence (RCS) in Triticeae reduces nutrient uptake, nutrient content, respiration, and radial hydraulic conductance of root tissue. We used the functional-structural model <i>SimRoot</i> to evaluate the functional implications of RCS in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) under suboptimal nitrate, phosphorus, and potassium availability. The utility of RCS was evaluated using sensitivity analyses in contrasting nutrient regimes. At flowering (80 d), RCS increased simulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth by up to 52%, 73%, and 41% in nitrate-, phosphorus-, and potassium-limiting conditions, respectively. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s with RCS had reduced nutrient requirement of root tissue for optimal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth, reduced total cumulative cortical respiration, and increased total carbon reserves. Nutrient reallocation during RCS had a greater effect on simulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth than reduced respiration or nutrient uptake. Under low nutrient availability, RCS had greater benefit in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s with fewer tillers. RCS had greater benefit in phenotypes with fewer lateral roots at low nitrate availability, but the opposite was true in low phosphorus or potassium availability. Additionally, RCS was quantified in field-grown barley in different nitrogen regimes. Field and virtual soil coring simulation results demonstrated that living cortical volume per root length (an indicator of RCS) decreased with depth in younger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, while roots of older <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s had very little living cortical volume per root length. RCS may be an adaptive trait for nutrient acquisition by reallocating nutrients from senescing tissue and secondarily by reducing root respiration. These simulated results suggest that RCS merits investigation as a breeding target for enhanced soil resource acquisition and edaphic stress tolerance.</p>

A Novel N-Methyltransferase in Arabidopsis Appears to Feed a Conserved Pathway for Nicotinate Detoxification among Land Plants and Is Associated with Lignin Biosynthesis
<p>The Preiss-Handler pathway, which salvages nicotinate (NA) for NAD synthesis, is an indispensable biochemical pathway in land <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Various NA conjugations (mainly methylation and glycosylation) have been detected and have long been proposed for NA detoxification in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Previously, we demonstrated that NA <i>O</i>-glucosylation functions as a mobilizable storage form for NAD biosynthesis in the Brassicaceae. However, little is known about the functions of other NA conjugations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. In this study, we first found that <i>N</i>-methylnicotinate is a ubiquitous NA conjugation in land <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Furthermore, we functionally identified a novel methyltransferase (At3g53140; NA<i>N</i>MT), which is mainly responsible for <i>N</i>-methylnicotinate formation, from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We also established that trigonelline is a detoxification form of endogenous NA in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Combined phylogenetic analysis and enzymatic assays revealed that NA <i>N</i>-methylation activity was likely derived from the duplication and subfunctionalization of an ancestral caffeic acid <i>O</i>-methyltransferase (<i>COMT</i>) gene in the course of land <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> evolution. COMT enzymes, which function in <i>S</i>-lignin biosynthesis, also have weak NA<i>N</i>MT activity. Our data suggest that NA detoxification conferred by NA<i>N</i>MT and COMT might have facilitated the retention of the Preiss-Handler pathway in land <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s.</p>

Fern Stomatal Responses to ABA and CO<sub>2</sub> Depend on Species and Growth Conditions
<p>Changing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels, climate, and air humidity affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> gas exchange that is controlled by stomata, small pores on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> leaves and stems formed by guard cells. Evolution has shaped the morphology and regulatory mechanisms governing stomatal movements to correspond to the needs of various land <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> groups over the past 400 million years. Stomata close in response to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> hormone abscisic acid (ABA), elevated CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, and reduced air humidity. Whether the active regulatory mechanisms that control stomatal closure in response to these stimuli are present already in mosses, the oldest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> group with stomata, or were acquired more recently in angiosperms remains controversial. It has been suggested that the stomata of the basal vascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, such as ferns and lycophytes, close solely hydropassively. On the other hand, active stomatal closure in response to ABA and CO<sub>2</sub> was found in several moss, lycophyte, and fern species. Here, we show that the stomata of two temperate fern species respond to ABA and CO<sub>2</sub> and that an active mechanism of stomatal regulation in response to reduced air humidity is present in some ferns. Importantly, fern stomatal responses depend on growth conditions. The data indicate that the stomatal behavior of ferns is more complex than anticipated before, and active stomatal regulation is present in some ferns and has possibly been lost in others. Further analysis that takes into account fern species, life history, evolutionary age, and growth conditions is required to gain insight into the evolution of land <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> stomatal responses.</p>

A Salivary Endo-β-1,4-Glucanase Acts as an Effector That Enables the Brown Planthopper to Feed on Rice
<p>The brown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>hopper (BPH) <i>Nilaparvata lugens</i> is one of the most destructive insect pests on rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) in Asia. After landing on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, BPH rapidly accesses <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> phloem and sucks the phloem sap through unknown mechanisms. We discovered a salivary endo-β-1,4-glucanase (NlEG1) that has endoglucanase activity with a maximal activity at pH 6 at 37°C and is secreted into rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s by BPH. <i>NlEG1</i> is highly expressed in the salivary glands and midgut. Silencing <i>NlEG1</i> decreases the capacity of BPH to reach the phloem and reduces its food intake, mass, survival, and fecundity on rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. By contrast, <i>NlEG1</i> silencing had only a small effect on the survival rate of BPH raised on artificial diet. Moreover, NlEG1 secreted by BPH did not elicit the production of the defense-related signal molecules salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and jasmonoyl-isoleucine in rice, although wounding plus the application of the recombination protein NlEG1 did slightly enhance the levels of jasmonic acid and jasmonoyl-isoleucine in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s compared with the corresponding controls. These data suggest that NlEG1 enables the BPH’s stylet to reach the phloem by degrading celluloses in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> cell walls, thereby functioning as an effector that overcomes the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> cell wall defense in rice.</p>

Substituted Phthalimide AC94377 Is a Selective Agonist of the Gibberellin Receptor GID1
<p>Gibberellin (GA) is a major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> hormone that regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth and development and is widely used as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth regulator in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">agricultur</span></strong>al production. There is an increasing demand for function-limited GA mimics due to the limitations on the agronomical application of GA to crops, including GA’s high cost of producing and its leading to the crops’ lodging. AC94377, a substituted phthalimide, is a chemical that mimics the growth-regulating activity of GAs in various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, despite its structural difference. Although AC94377 is widely studied in many weeds and crops, its mode of action as a GA mimic is largely unknown. In this study, we confirmed that AC94377 displays GA-like activities in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and demonstrated that AC94377 binds to the Arabidopsis GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF1 (GID1) receptor (AtGID1), forms the AtGID1-AC94377-DELLA complex, and induces the degradation of DELLA protein. Our results also indicated that AC94377 is selective for a specific subtype among three AtGID1s and that the selectivity of AC94377 is attributable to a single residue at the entrance to the hydrophobic pocket of GID1. We conclude that AC94377 is a GID1 agonist with selectivity for a specific subtype of GID1, which could be further developed and used as a function-limited regulator of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth in both basic study and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">agricultur</span></strong>e.</p>

Arabidopsis Responds to <i>Alternaria alternata</i> Volatiles by Triggering Plastid Phosphoglucose Isomerase-Independent Mechanisms
<p>Volatile compounds (VCs) emitted by phylogenetically diverse microorganisms (including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> pathogens and microbes that do not normally interact mutualistically with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s) promote photosynthesis, growth, and the accumulation of high levels of starch in leaves through cytokinin (CK)-regulated processes. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s not exposed to VCs, plastidic phosphoglucose isomerase (pPGI) acts as an important determinant of photosynthesis and growth, likely as a consequence of its involvement in the synthesis of plastidic CKs in roots. Moreover, this enzyme plays an important role in connecting the Calvin-Benson cycle with the starch biosynthetic pathway in leaves. To elucidate the mechanisms involved in the responses of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s to microbial VCs and to investigate the extent of pPGI involvement, we characterized pPGI-null <i>pgi1-2</i> Arabidopsis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s cultured in the presence or absence of VCs emitted by <i>Alternaria alternata</i>. We found that volatile emissions from this fungal phytopathogen promote growth, photosynthesis, and the accumulation of plastidic CKs in <i>pgi1-2</i> leaves. Notably, the mesophyll cells of <i>pgi1-2</i> leaves accumulated exceptionally high levels of starch following VC exposure. Proteomic analyses revealed that VCs promote global changes in the expression of proteins involved in photosynthesis, starch metabolism, and growth that can account for the observed responses in <i>pgi1-2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. The overall data show that Arabidopsis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s can respond to VCs emitted by phytopathogenic microorganisms by triggering pPGI-independent mechanisms.</p>

An Efficient System for <i>Ds</i> Transposon Tagging in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>
<p>Transposon tagging is a powerful tool that has been widely applied in several species for insertional mutagenesis in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Several efforts have aimed to create transfer-DNA (T-DNA) insertional mutant populations in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>, a monocot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> used as a model system to study temperate cereals, but there has been a lack of research aimed at using transposon strategies. Here, we describe the application of a maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) <i>Dissociation</i> (<i>Ds</i>) transposon tagging system in <i>B</i>. <i>distachyon</i>. The <i>35S</i>::<i>AcTPase</i> cassette and <i>Ds</i> element were constructed within the same T-DNA and transformed into <i>B</i>. <i>distachyon</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. The <i>Ds</i> element was readily transposed to other chromosomes or to the same chromosome under the function of <i>Activator</i> (<i>Ac</i>) transposase. Through homologous chromosome synapsis, recombination, and segregation, the <i>Ds</i> element separated from the <i>Ac</i> element. We selected stable <i>Ds</i>-only <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s using G418 and GFP assays and analyzed 241 T<sub>0</sub> lines, some of which were highly efficient at producing <i>Ds</i>-only progeny. Through thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR, we isolated 710 independent <i>Ds</i> flanking sequences from <i>Ds</i>-only <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Furthermore, we identified a large collection of mutants with visible developmental phenotypes via this transposon tagging system. The system is relatively simple and rapid in comparison to traditional T-DNA insertion strategies, because once efficiency lines are obtained they can be reused to generate more lines from nontransposed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s without the use of time-consuming tissue culture steps.</p>

Digital Imaging Combined with Genome-Wide Association Mapping Links Loci to Plant-Pathogen Interaction Traits
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> resistance to generalist pathogens with broad host ranges, such as <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> (<i>Botrytis</i>), is typically quantitative and highly polygenic. Recent studies have begun to elucidate the molecular genetic basis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>-pathogen interactions using commonly measured traits, including lesion size and/or pathogen biomass. However, with the advent of digital imaging and high-throughput phenomics, there are a large number of additional traits available to study quantitative resistance. In this study, we used high-throughput digital imaging analysis to investigate previously poorly characterized visual traits of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>-pathogen interactions related to disease resistance using the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>)/<i>Botrytis</i> pathosystem. From a large collection of visual lesion trait measurements, we focused on color, shape, and size to test how these aspects of the Arabidopsis/<i>Botrytis</i> interaction are genetically related. Through genome-wide association mapping in Arabidopsis, we show that lesion color and shape are genetically separable traits associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> disease resistance. Moreover, by employing defined mutants in 23 candidate genes identified from the genome-wide association mapping, we demonstrate links between loci and each of the different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>-pathogen interaction traits. These results expand our understanding of the functional mechanisms driving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> disease resistance.</p>

Long-Day Photoperiod Enhances Jasmonic Acid-Related Plant Defense
<p>Agricultural crops are exposed to a range of daylengths, which act as important environmental cues for the control of developmental processes such as flowering. To explore the additional effects of daylength on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> function, we investigated the transcriptome of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s grown under short days (SD) and transferred to long days (LD). Compared with that under SD, the LD transcriptome was enriched in genes involved in jasmonic acid-dependent systemic resistance. Many of these genes exhibited impaired expression induction under LD in the <i>phytochrome A</i> (<i>phyA</i>), <i>cryptochrome 1</i> (<i>cry1</i>), and <i>cry2</i> triple photoreceptor mutant. Compared with that under SD, LD enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> resistance to the necrotrophic fungus <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>. This response was reduced in the <i>phyA cry1 cry2</i> triple mutant, in the <i>constitutive photomorphogenic1</i> (<i>cop1</i>) mutant, in the <i>myc2</i> mutant, and in mutants impaired in DELLA function. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s grown under SD had an increased nuclear abundance of COP1 and decreased DELLA abundance, the latter of which was dependent on COP1. We conclude that growth under LD enhances <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> defense by reducing COP1 activity and enhancing DELLA abundance and <i>MYC2</i> expression.</p>

STRESS INDUCED FACTOR 2, a Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase Regulates Basal Plant Pathogen Defense
<p>Protein kinases play fundamental roles in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> development and environmental stress responses. Here, we identified the <i>STRESS INDUCED FACTOR</i> (<i>SIF</i>) gene family, which encodes four leucine-rich repeat receptor-like protein kinases in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The four genes, <i>SIF1</i> to <i>SIF4</i>, are clustered in the genome and highly conserved, but they have temporally and spatially distinct expression patterns. We employed Arabidopsis <i>SIF</i> knockout mutants and overexpression transgenics to examine SIF involvement during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> pathogen defense. <i>SIF</i> genes are rapidly induced by biotic or abiotic stresses, and SIF proteins localize to the plasma membrane. Simultaneous knockout of <i>SIF1</i> and <i>SIF2</i> led to improved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> salt tolerance, whereas <i>SIF2</i> overexpression enhanced PAMP-triggered immunity and prompted basal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> defenses, significantly improving pathogen resistance. Furthermore, <i>SIF2</i> overexpression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s exhibited up-regulated expression of the defense-related genes <i>WRKY53</i> and <i>flg22-INDUCED RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE1</i> as well as enhanced MPK3/MPK6 phosphorylation upon pathogen and elicitor treatments. The expression of the calcium signaling-related gene <i>PHOSPHATE-INDUCED1</i> also was enhanced in the <i>SIF2</i>-overexpressing lines upon pathogen inoculation but repressed in the <i>sif2</i> mutants. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation demonstrates that the BRI1-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR KINASE1 protein is a coreceptor of the SIF2 kinase in the signal transduction pathway during pathogen invasion. These findings characterize a stress-responsive protein kinase family and illustrate how SIF2 modulates signal transduction for effective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> pathogenic defense.</p>

Different Modes of Negative Regulation of Plant Immunity by Calmodulin-Related Genes
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> immune responses activated through the perception of microbe-associated molecular patterns, leading to pattern-triggered immunity, are tightly regulated. This results in low immune responses in the absence of pathogens and a rapid return to the resting state following an activation event. Here, we show that two <i>CALMODULIN-LIKE</i> genes, <i>CML46</i> and <i>CML47</i>, negatively regulate salicylic acid accumulation and immunity in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The double mutant <i>cml46 cml47</i> is highly resistant to the pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>maculicola</i> (<i>Pma</i>). The effects of <i>cml46 cml47</i> on <i>Pma</i> growth are genetically additive to that of <i>cbp60a</i>, a known negative regulator in the <i>CALMODULIN-BINDING PROTEIN60</i> (<i>CBP60</i>) family. Transcriptome profiling revealed the effects of <i>cbp60a</i> and <i>cml46 cml47</i> on both common and separate sets of genes, with the majorities of these differentially expressed genes being <i>Pma</i> responsive. <i>CBP60g</i>, a positive regulator of immunity in the <i>CBP60</i> family, was found to be transcriptionally regulated by <i>CBP60a</i>, <i>CML46</i>, and <i>CML47</i>. Analysis of the flg22-induced mRNA levels of <i>CBP60g</i> in <i>cbp60a</i> and <i>cml46 cml47</i> revealed that <i>cml46 cml47</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s have higher induced expression while <i>cbp60a</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s retain elevated levels longer than wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Assays for the effect of flg22 treatment on <i>Pma</i> growth showed that the effect is stronger in <i>cml46 cml47</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s and lasts longer in <i>cbp60a</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Thus, the expression pattern of <i>CBP60g</i> is reflected in flg22-induced resistance to <i>Pma</i>.</p>

Fine-Tuning of Photosynthesis Requires CURVATURE THYLAKOID1-Mediated Thylakoid Plasticity
<p>The thylakoid membrane system of higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> chloroplasts consists of interconnected subdomains of appressed and nonappressed membrane bilayers, known as grana and stroma lamellae, respectively. CURVATURE THYLAKOID1 (CURT1) protein complexes mediate the shape of grana stacks in a dosage-dependent manner and facilitate membrane curvature at the grana margins, the interface between grana and stroma lamellae. Although grana stacks are highly conserved among land <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, the functional relevance of grana stacking remains unclear. Here, we show that inhibiting CURT1-mediated alteration of thylakoid ultrastructure in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) reduces photosynthetic efficiency and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> fitness under adverse, controlled, and natural light conditions. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s that lack CURT1 show less adjustment of grana diameter, which compromises regulatory mechanisms like the photosystem II repair cycle and state transitions. Interestingly, CURT1A suffices to induce thylakoid membrane curvature in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>a and thylakoid hyperbending in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s overexpressing CURT1A. We suggest that CURT1 oligomerization is regulated at the posttranslational level in a light-dependent fashion and that CURT1-mediated thylakoid plasticity plays an important role in fine-tuning photosynthesis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> fitness during challenging growth conditions.</p>

Signal Dynamics and Interactions during Flooding Stress
<p>Flooding is detrimental for nearly all higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, including crops. The compound stress elicited by slow gas exchange and low light levels under water is responsible for both a carbon and an energy crisis ultimately leading to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> death. The endogenous concentrations of four gaseous compounds, oxygen, carbon dioxide, ethylene, and nitric oxide, change during the submergence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> organs in water. These gases play a pivotal role in signal transduction cascades, leading to adaptive processes such as metabolic adjustments and anatomical features. Of these gases, ethylene is seen as the most consistent, pervasive, and reliable signal of early flooding stress, most likely in tight interaction with the other gases. The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> cells during flooding and directly after subsidence, during which the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> is confronted with high light and oxygen levels, is characteristic for this abiotic stress. Low, well-controlled levels of ROS are essential for adaptive signaling pathways, in interaction with the other gaseous flooding signals. On the other hand, excessive uncontrolled bursts of ROS can be highly damaging for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Therefore, a fine-tuned balance is important, with a major role for ROS production and scavenging. Our understanding of the temporal dynamics of the four gases and ROS is basal, whereas it is likely that they form a signature readout of prevailing flooding conditions and subsequent adaptive responses.</p>

Extracellular ATP Acts on Jasmonate Signaling to Reinforce Plant Defense
<p>Damaged cells send various signals to stimulate defense responses. Recent identification and genetic studies of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> purinoceptor, P2K1 (also known as DORN1), have demonstrated that extracellular ATP is a signal involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> stress responses, including wounding, perhaps to evoke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> defense. However, it remains largely unknown how extracellular ATP induces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> defense responses. Here, we demonstrate that extracellular ATP induces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> defense mediated through activation of the intracellular signaling of jasmonate (JA), a well-characterized defense hormone. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves, ATP pretreatment induced resistance against the necrotrophic fungus, <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>. The induced resistance was enhanced in the P2K1 receptor overexpression line, but reduced in the receptor mutant, <i>dorn1</i>-<i>3</i>. Mining the transcriptome data revealed that ATP induces a set of JA-induced genes. In addition, the P2K1-associated coexpression network contains defense-related genes, including those encoding jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins, which play key roles as repressors of JA signaling. We examined whether extracellular ATP impacts the stability of JAZ1 in Arabidopsis. The results showed that the JAZ1 stability decreased in response to ATP addition in a proteasome-dependent manner. This reduction required intracellular signaling via second messengers—cytosolic calcium, reactive oxygen species, and nitric oxide. Interestingly, the ATP-induced JAZ1 degradation was attenuated in the JA receptor mutant, <i>coi1</i>, but not in the JA biosynthesis mutant, <i>aos</i>, or upon addition of JA biosynthesis inhibitors. Immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that ATP increases the interaction between COI1 and JAZ1, suggesting direct cross talk between extracellular ATP and JA in intracellular signaling events. Taken together, these results suggest that extracellular ATP signaling directly impacts the JA signaling pathway to maximize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> defense responses.</p>

<i>CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1</i> (<i>CCA1</i>) and the Circadian Control of Stomatal Aperture
<p>The endogenous circadian (∼24 h) system allows <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s to anticipate and adapt to daily environmental changes. Stomatal aperture is one of the many processes under circadian control; stomatal opening and closing occurs under constant conditions, even in the absence of environmental cues. To understand the significance of circadian-mediated anticipation in stomatal opening, we have generated <i>SGC</i> (specifically guard cell) Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s in which the oscillator gene <i>CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1</i> (<i>CCA1</i>) was overexpressed under the control of the guard-cell-specific promoter, <i>GC1.</i> The <i>SGC</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s showed a loss of ability to open stomata in anticipation of daily dark-to-light changes and of circadian-mediated stomatal opening in constant light. We observed that under fully watered and mild drought conditions, <i>SGC</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s outperform wild type with larger leaf area and biomass. To investigate the molecular basis for circadian control of guard cell aperture, we used large-scale qRT-PCR to compare circadian oscillator gene expression in guard cells compared with the “average” whole-leaf oscillator and examined gene expression and stomatal aperture in several lines of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s with misexpressed <i>CCA1</i>. Our results show that the guard cell oscillator is different from the average <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> oscillator. Moreover, the differences in guard cell oscillator function may be important for the correct regulation of photoperiod pathway genes that have previously been reported to control stomatal aperture. We conclude by showing that CONSTANS and FLOWERING LOCUS T, components of the photoperiod pathway that regulate flowering time, also control stomatal aperture in a daylength-dependent manner.</p>

A Nucleus-Localized Long Non-Coding RNA Enhances Drought and Salt Stress Tolerance
<p>Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) affect gene expression through a wide range of mechanisms and are considered as important regulators in many essential biological processes. A large number of lncRNA transcripts have been predicted or identified in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s in recent years. However, the biological functions for most of them are still unknown. In this study, we identified an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) lncRNA, <i>DROUGHT INDUCED lncRNA</i> (<i>DRIR</i>), as a novel positive regulator of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> response to drought and salt stress. <i>DRIR</i> was expressed at a low level under nonstress conditions but can be significantly activated by drought and salt stress as well as by abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. We identified a T-DNA insertion mutant, <i>drir<sup>D</sup></i>, which had higher expression of the <i>DRIR</i> gene than the wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. The <i>drir<sup>D</sup></i> mutant exhibits increased tolerance to drought and salt stress. Overexpressing <i>DRIR</i> in Arabidopsis also increased tolerance to drought and salt stress of the transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. The <i>drir<sup>D</sup></i> mutant and the overexpressing seedlings are more sensitive to ABA than the wild type in stomata closure and seedling growth. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis demonstrated that the expression of a large number of genes was altered in <i>drir<sup>D</sup></i> and the overexpressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. These include genes involved in ABA signaling, water transport, and other stress-relief processes. Our study reveals a mechanism whereby <i>DRIR</i> regulates the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> response to abiotic stress by modulating the expression of a series of genes involved in the stress response.</p>

Phospholipase C2 Affects MAMP-Triggered Immunity by Modulating ROS Production
<p>The activation of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) is one of the earliest responses triggered by the recognition of several microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) PI-PLC gene family is composed of nine members. Previous studies suggested a role for PLC2 in MAMP-triggered immunity, as it is rapidly phosphorylated in vivo upon treatment with the bacterial MAMP flg22. Here, we analyzed the role of PLC2 in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> immunity using an artificial microRNA to silence <i>PLC2</i> expression in Arabidopsis. We found that <i>PLC2</i>-silenced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s are more susceptible to the type III secretion system-deficient bacterial strain <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>tomato</i> (<i>Pst</i>) DC3000 <i>hrcC<sup>−</sup></i> and to the nonadapted pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) powdery mildew <i>Erysiphe pisi</i>. However, <i>PLC2</i>-silenced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s display normal susceptibility to virulent (<i>Pst</i> DC3000) and avirulent (<i>Pst</i> DC3000 AvrRPM1) <i>P. syringae</i> strains, conserving typical hypersensitive response features. In response to flg22, <i>PLC2</i>-silenced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s maintain wild-type mitogen-activated protein kinase activation and <i>PHI1</i>, <i>WRKY33</i>, and <i>FRK1</i> immune marker gene expression but have reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent responses such as callose deposition and stomatal closure. Accordingly, the generation of ROS upon flg22 treatment is compromised in the <i>PLC2</i>-defficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, suggesting an effect of PLC2 in a branch of MAMP-triggered immunity and nonhost resistance that involves early ROS-regulated processes. Consistently, PLC2 associates with the NADPH oxidase RBOHD, suggesting its potential regulation by PLC2.</p>

Enhanced Secondary- and Hormone Metabolism in Leaves of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal <i>Medicago truncatula</i>
<p>Arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM) are the most common symbiotic associations between a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>’s root compartment and fungi. They provide nutritional benefit (mostly inorganic phosphate [P<sub>i</sub>]), leading to improved growth, and nonnutritional benefits, including defense responses to environmental cues throughout the host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>, which, in return, delivers carbohydrates to the symbiont. However, how transcriptional and metabolic changes occurring in leaves of AM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s differ from those induced by P<sub>i</sub> fertilization is poorly understood. We investigated systemic changes in the leaves of mycorrhized <i>Medicago truncatula</i> in conditions with no improved P<sub>i</sub> status and compared them with those induced by high-P<sub>i</sub> treatment in nonmycorrhized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Microarray-based genome-wide profiling indicated up-regulation by mycorrhization of genes involved in flavonoid, terpenoid, jasmonic acid (JA), and abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis as well as enhanced expression of <i>MYC2</i>, the master regulator of JA-dependent responses. Accordingly, total anthocyanins and flavonoids increased, and most flavonoid species were enriched in AM leaves. Both the AM and P<sub>i</sub> treatments corepressed iron homeostasis genes, resulting in lower levels of available iron in leaves. In addition, higher levels of cytokinins were found in leaves of AM- and P<sub>i</sub>-treated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, whereas the level of ABA was increased specifically in AM leaves. Foliar treatment of nonmycorrhized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s with either ABA or JA induced the up-regulation of <i>MYC2</i>, but only JA also induced the up-regulation of flavonoid and terpenoid biosynthetic genes. Based on these results, we propose that mycorrhization and P<sub>i</sub> fertilization share cytokinin-mediated improved shoot growth, whereas enhanced ABA biosynthesis and JA-regulated flavonoid and terpenoid biosynthesis in leaves are specific to mycorrhization.</p>

A High-Throughput, Field-Based Phenotyping Technology for Tall Biomass Crops
<p>Recent advances in omics technologies have not been accompanied by equally efficient, cost-effective, and accurate phenotyping methods required to dissect the genetic architecture of complex traits. Even though high-throughput phenotyping platforms have been developed for controlled environments, field-based aerial and ground technologies have only been designed and deployed for short-stature crops. Therefore, we developed and tested Phenobot 1.0, an auto-steered and self-propelled field-based high-throughput phenotyping platform for tall dense canopy crops, such as sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>). Phenobot 1.0 was equipped with laterally positioned and vertically stacked stereo RGB cameras. Images collected from 307 diverse sorghum lines were reconstructed in 3D for feature extraction. User interfaces were developed, and multiple algorithms were evaluated for their accuracy in estimating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> height and stem diameter. Tested feature extraction methods included the following: (1) User-interactive Individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> Height Extraction (UsIn-PHe) based on dense stereo three-dimensional reconstruction; (2) Automatic Hedge-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> Height Extraction (Auto-PHe) based on dense stereo 3D reconstruction; (3) User-interactive Dense Stereo Matching Stem Diameter Extraction; and (4) User-interactive Image Patch Stereo Matching Stem Diameter Extraction (IPaS-Di). Comparative genome-wide association analysis and ground-truth validation demonstrated that both UsIn-PHe and Auto-PHe were accurate methods to estimate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> height, while Auto-PHe had the additional advantage of being a completely automated process. For stem diameter, IPaS-Di generated the most accurate estimates of this biomass-related architectural trait. In summary, our technology was proven robust to obtain ground-based high-throughput <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> architecture parameters of sorghum, a tall and densely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>ed crop species.</p>

Reproduction-related variation in carbon allocation to woody tissues in <i>Fagus crenata</i> using a natural <sup>13</sup>C approach
<p>The contribution of new photo-assimilates and stored carbon (C) to plant growth remains poorly understood, especially during reproduction. In order to elucidate how mast seeding affects C allocation to both reproductive and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative tissues, we measured biomass increase in each tissue, branch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">starch</span></strong> concent<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ration</span></strong> and stable C isotope composition (δ<sup>13</sup>C) in bulk leaves, current-year shoots, 3-year branches and tree rings in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong>ing and non-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong>ing trees for 2 years, as well as in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong>s. We isolated the effect of reproduction on C allocation to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative growth by comparing <sup>13</sup>C enrichment in woody tissues in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong>ing and non-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong>ing specimens. Compared with 2‰ <sup>13</sup>C enrichment in shoots relative to leaves from non-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong>ing trees, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong>ing reduced the enrichment to 1‰ and this reduction disappeared in the following year with no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong>ing, indicating that new photo-assimilates are preferentially used for woody tissues even with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong>ing burden. In contrast, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong>s had up to 2.5‰ <sup>13</sup>C enrichment at mid-summer, which dropped thereafter, indicating that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> production relies on C storage early in the growing season then shifts to current photo-assimilates. At this tipping point, growth of shoots and cupules had almost finished and nuts had a second rapid growth period thereafter. Together with shorter shoots but higher biomass increment per length in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong>ing trees than non-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong>ing trees, these results indicate that the C limitation due to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> burden is minimized by fine-tuning of allocation of old C stores and new photo-assimilates, along with the growth pattern in various tissues. Furthermore, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong>ing had no significant effect on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">starch</span></strong> concent<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ration</span></strong> in 3-year-old branches, which became fully depleted during leaf and flower flushing but were quickly replenished. These results indicate that reproduction affects C allocation to branches but not its source or storage. These reproduction-related variations in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fat</span></strong>e of C have implications for evaluating forest ecosystem C cycles during climate change.</p>

A Tonoplast Sugar Transporter Underlies a Sugar Accumulation QTL in Watermelon
<p>How <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> transporters regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> accumulation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong>s is poorly understood and particularly so for species storing high-concent<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ration</span></strong> Suc. Accumulation of soluble <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong>s in watermelon (<i>Citrullus lanatus</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong>, a major quality trait, had been selected during domestication. Still, the molecular mechanisms controlling this quantitative trait are unknown. We resequenced 96 recombinant inbred lines, derived from crossing sweet and unsweet accessions, to narrow down the size of a previously described <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> content quantitative trait locus, which contains a putative <i>Tonoplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> Transporter</i> gene (<i>ClTST2</i>). Molecular and biochemical analyses indicated that <i>ClTST2</i> encodes a vacuolar membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>, whose expression is associated with tonoplast uptake and accumulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong>s in watermelon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> flesh cells. We measured <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> content and resequenced the genomic region surrounding <i>ClTST2</i> in 400 watermelon accessions and associated the most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong>-related significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to the <i>ClTST2</i> promoter. Large-scale population analyses strongly suggest increased expression of <i>ClTST2</i> as a major molecular event in watermelon domestication associated with a selection sweep around the <i>ClTST2</i> promoter. Further molecular analyses explored the binding of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong>-induced transcription factor (<i>SUSIWM1</i>) to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong>-responsive cis‐element within the <i>ClTST2</i> promoter, which contains the quantitative trait locus (QTL) causal SNP. The functional characterization of <i>ClTST2</i> and its expression regulation by <i>SUSIWM1</i> provide novel tools to increase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> sink potency in watermelon and possibly in other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>able and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> crops.</p>

Effect of Distinct Lifestyle Interventions on Mobilization of Fat Storage Pools
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>We aimed to assess whether distinct lifestyle strategies can differentially affect specific body adipose depots.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed an 18-month randomized controlled trial among 278 sedentary adults with abdominal obesity (75%) or dyslipidemia in an isolated workplace with a monitored provided lunch.

The <i>RIN-MC</i> Fusion of MADS-Box Transcription Factors Has Transcriptional Activity and Modulates Expression of Many Ripening Genes
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> development and ripening is regulated by genetic and environmental factors and is of critical importance for seed dispersal, reproduction, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> quality. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) <i>ripening inhibitor</i> (<i>rin</i>) mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> have a classic ripening-inhibited phenotype, which is attributed to a genomic DNA deletion resulting in the fusion of two truncated transcription factors, <i>RIN</i> and <i>MC</i>. In wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong>, RIN, a MADS-box transcription factor, is a key regulator of the ripening gene expression network, with hundreds of gene targets controlling changes in color, flavor, texture, and taste during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> ripening; <i>MC</i>, on the other hand, has low expression in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong>, and the potential functions of the <i>RIN-MC</i> fusion gene in ripening remain unclear. Here, overexpression of <i>RIN-MC</i> in transgenic wild-type cv Ailsa Craig <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong>s impaired several ripening processes, and down-regulating <i>RIN-MC</i> expression in the <i>rin</i> mutant was found to stimulate the normal yellow mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> to produce a weak red color, suggesting a distinct negative role for <i>RIN-MC</i> in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> ripening. By comparative transcriptome analysis of <i>rin</i> and <i>rin 35S</i>::<i>RIN-MC</i> RNA interference <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong>s, a total of 1,168 and 1,234 genes were identified as potential targets of RIN-MC activation and inhibition. Furthermore, the <i>RIN-MC</i> fusion gene was shown to be translated into a chimeric transcription factor that was localized to the nucleus and was capable of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> interactions with other MADS-box factors. These results indicated that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> RIN-MC fusion plays a negative role in ripening and encodes a chimeric transcription factor that modulates the expression of many ripening genes, thereby contributing to the <i>rin</i> mutant phenotype.</p>

Systems Genetics Identifies a Novel Regulatory Domain of Amylose Synthesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>A deeper understanding of the regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">starch</span></strong> biosynthesis in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) endosperm is crucial in tailoring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">digest</span></strong>ibility without sacrificing grain quality. In this study, significant association peaks on chromosomes 6 and 7 were identified through a genomewide association study (GWAS) of debranched <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">starch</span></strong> structure from grains of a 320 <i>indica</i> rice diversity panel using genotyping data from the high-density rice array. A systems genetics approach that interrelates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">starch</span></strong> structure data from GWAS to functional pathways from a gene regulatory network identified known genes with high correlation to the proportion of amylose and amylopectin. An SNP in the promoter region of <i>Granule Bound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">starch</span></strong> Synthase I</i> was identified along with seven other SNPs to form haplotypes that discriminate samples into different phenotypic ranges of amylose. A GWAS peak on chromosome 7 between LOC_Os07g11020 and LOC_Os07g11520 indexed by a nonsynonymous SNP mutation on exon 5 of a bHLH transcription factor was found to elevate the proportion of amylose at the expense of reduced short-chain amylopectin. Linking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">starch</span></strong> structure with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">starch</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">digest</span></strong>ibility by determining the kinetics of cooked grain amylolysis of selected haplotypes revealed strong association of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">starch</span></strong> structure with estimated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">digest</span></strong>ibility kinetics. Combining all results from grain quality genomics, systems genetics, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">digest</span></strong>ibility phenotyping, we propose target haplotypes for fine-tuning <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">starch</span></strong> structure in rice through marker-assisted breeding that can be used to alter the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">digest</span></strong>ibility of rice grain, thus offering rice consumers a new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diet</span></strong>-based intervention to mitigate the impact of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrit</span></strong>ion-related noncommunicable diseases.</p>

Generation of specific inhibitors of SUMO-1– and SUMO-2/3–mediated protein-protein interactions using Affimer (Adhiron) technology
<p>Because <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> interactions underpin most biological processes, developing tools that target them to understand their function or to inform the development of therapeutics is an important task. SUMOylation is the posttranslational covalent attachment of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s in the SUMO family (SUMO-1, SUMO-2, or SUMO-3), and it regulates numerous cellular pathways. SUMOylated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are recognized by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s with SUMO-interaction motifs (SIMs) that facilitate noncovalent interactions with SUMO. We describe the use of the Affimer system of peptide display for the rapid isolation of synthetic binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that inhibit SUMO-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> interactions mediated by SIMs both in vitro and in cells. Crucially, these synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s did not prevent SUMO conjugation either in vitro or in cell-based systems, enabling the specific analysis of SUMO-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> interactions. Furthermore, through structural analysis and molecular modeling, we explored the molecular mechanisms that may underlie their specificity in interfering with either SUMO-1–mediated interactions or interactions mediated by either SUMO-2 or SUMO-3. Not only will these reagents enable investigation of the biological roles of SUMOylation, but the Affimer technology used to generate these synthetic binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s could also be exploited to design or validate reagents or therapeutics that target other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> interactions.</p>

Genomics and evolution of protein phosphatases
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatases are the essential opposite to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> kinases; together, these enzymes regulate all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphorylation and most cellular processes. To better understand the global roles of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphorylation, we cataloged the human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatome, composed of 189 known and predicted human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatase genes. We also identified 79 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatase pseudogenes or retrogenes, some of which may have residual function. We traced the origin and diversity of phosphatases by building <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatomes for eight other eukaryotes, from the protist <i>Dictyostelium</i> to the sea urchin. We classified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatases from all nine species into a hierarchy of 10 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> folds, 21 families, and 178 subfamilies. We found that >80% of the 101 human subfamilies were conserved across the animal kingdom, but show substantial differences in evolution, including losses and expansions of individual subfamilies and changes in accessory domains. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatases show similar evolutionary dynamics to those of kinases, with substantial losses in major model organisms. Sequence analysis predicts that 26 human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatase domains are catalytically disabled and that this disability is mostly conserved across orthologs. This genomic and evolutionary perspective on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatases provides a framework for global analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphorylation throughout the animal kingdom.</p>

Gradually Decreasing Starch Branching Enzyme Expression Is Responsible for the Formation of Heterogeneous Starch Granules
<p>Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) endosperm is mainly occupied by homogeneous polygonal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">starch</span></strong> from inside to outside. However, morphologically different (heterogeneous) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">starch</span></strong>es have been identified in some rice mutants. How these heterogeneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">starch</span></strong>es form remains unknown. A high-amylose rice line (TRS) generated through the antisense inhibition of <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">starch</span></strong> branching synthase I</i> (<i>SBEI</i>) and <i>SBEIIb</i> contains four heterogeneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">starch</span></strong>es: polygonal, aggregate, elongated, and hollow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">starch</span></strong>; these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">starch</span></strong>es are regionally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ed in the endosperm from inside to outside. Here, we investigated the relationship between SBE dosage and the morphological architecture of heterogeneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">starch</span></strong>es in TRS endosperm from the view of the molecular structure of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">starch</span></strong>. The results indicated that their molecular structures underwent regular changes, including gradually increasing true amylose content but decreasing amylopectin content and gradually increasing the ratio of amylopectin long chain but decreasing the ratio of amylopectin short chain. Granule-bound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">starch</span></strong> synthase I (GBSSI) amounts in the four heterogeneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">starch</span></strong>es were not significantly different from each other, but SBEI, SBEIIa, and SBEIIb showed a gradually decreasing trend. Further immunostaining analysis revealed that the gradually decreasing SBEs acting on the formation of the four heterogeneous granules were mainly due to the spatial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion of the three SBEs in the endosperm. It was suggested that the decreased amylopectin in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">starch</span></strong> might remove steric hindrance and provide extra space for abundant amylose accumulation when the GBSSI amount was not elevated. Furthermore, extra amylose coupled with altered amylopectin structure possibly led to morphological changes in heterogeneous granules.</p>

The G Protein <i>β</i>-Subunit, AGB1, Interacts with FERONIA in RALF1-Regulated Stomatal Movement
<p>Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding (G) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are composed of Gα, G<i>β</i>, and Gγ subunits and function as molecular switches in signal transduction. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), there are one canonical Gα (GPA1), three extra-large Gα (XLG1, XLG2, and XLG3), one G<i>β</i> (AGB1), and three Gγ (AGG1, AGG2, and AGG3) subunits. To elucidate AGB1 molecular signaling, we performed immunoprecipitation using plasma membrane-enriched <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s followed by mass spectrometry to identify the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> interactors of AGB1. After eliminating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s present in the control immunoprecipitation, commonly identified contaminants, and organellar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, a total of 103 candidate AGB1-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s were confidently identified. We identified all of the G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> subunits except XLG1, receptor-like kinases, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling-related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, and 14-3-3-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, all of which may couple with or modulate G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> signaling. We confirmed physical interaction between AGB1 and the receptor-like kinase FERONIA (FER) using bimolecular fluorescence complementation. The Rapid Alkalinization Factor (RALF) family of polypeptides have been shown to be ligands of FER. In this study, we demonstrate that RALF1 regulates stomatal apertures and does so in a G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-dependent manner, inhibiting stomatal opening and promoting stomatal closure in Columbia but not in <i>agb1</i> mutants. We further show that AGGs and XLGs, but not GPA1, participate in RALF1-mediated stomatal signaling. Our results suggest that FER acts as a G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-coupled receptor for plant heterotrimeric G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s.</p>

Identification and Characterization of Arabidopsis Seed Coat Mucilage Proteins
<p>Plant cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are important regulators of cell wall architecture and function. However, because cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are difficult to extract and analyze, they are generally poorly understood. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s integral to the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed c<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oat</span></strong> mucilage, a specialized layer of the extracellular matrix composed of plant cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbohydr</span></strong>ates that is used as a model for cell wall research. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s identified in mucilage include those previously identified by genetic analysis, and several mucilage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are reduced in mucilage-deficient mutant seeds, suggesting that these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are genuinely associated with the mucilage. Arabidopsis mucilage has both nonadherent and adherent layers. Both layers have similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> profiles except for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s involved in lipid metabolism, which are present exclusively in the adherent mucilage. The most abundant mucilage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s include a family of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s named TESTA ABUNDANT1 (TBA1) to TBA3; a less abundant fourth homolog was named TBA-LIKE (TBAL). <i>TBA</i> and <i>TBAL</i> transcripts and promoter activities were detected in developing seed c<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oat</span></strong>s, and their expression requires seed c<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oat</span></strong> differentiation regulators. TBA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are secreted to the mucilage pocket during differentiation. Although reverse genetics failed to identify a function for TBAs/TBAL, the <i>TBA</i> promoters are highly expressed and cell type specific and so should be very useful tools for targeting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s to the seed c<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oat</span></strong> epidermis. Altogether, these results highlight the mucilage proteome as a model for cell walls in general, as it shares similarities with other cell wall proteomes while also containing mucilage-specific f<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eat</span></strong>ures.</p>

A Tomato Vacuolar Invertase Inhibitor Mediates Sucrose Metabolism and Influences Fruit Ripening
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> ripening is a complex process that involves a series of physiological and biochemical changes that ultimately influence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> quality traits, such as color and flavor. Sugar metabolism is an important factor in ripening, and there is evidence that it influences various aspects of ripening, although the associated mechanism is not well understood. In this study, we identified and analyzed the expression of 36 genes involved in Suc metabolism in ripening <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong>. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and gel mobility shift assays indicated that <i>SlVIF</i>, which encodes a vacuolar invertase inhibitor, and <i>SlVI</i>, encoding a vacuolar invertase, are directly regulated by the global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> ripening regulator RIPENING INHIBITOR (RIN). Moreover, we showed that SlVIF physically interacts with SlVI to control Suc metabolism. Repression of <i>SlVIF</i> by RNA interference delayed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> ripening, while overexpression of <i>SlVIF</i> accelerated ripening, with concomitant changes in lycopene production and ethylene biosynthesis.

Gut microbiota dictates the metabolic response of <i>Drosophila</i> to diet
<p>Animal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrit</span></strong>ion is profoundly influenced by the gut microbiota, but knowledge of the scope and core mechanisms of the underlying animal–microbiota interactions is fragmentary. To investigate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrit</span></strong>ional traits shaped by the gut microbiota of <i>Drosophila</i>, we determined the microbiota-dependent response of multiple metabolic and performance indices to systematically varied <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diet</span></strong> composition. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diet</span></strong>-dependent differences between <i>Drosophila</i> bearing its unmanipulated microbiota (conventional flies) and experimentally deprived of its microbiota (axenic flies) revealed evidence for: microbial sparing of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diet</span></strong>ary B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vitamin</span></strong>s, especially riboflavin, on low-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diet</span></strong>s; microbial promotion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrit</span></strong>ion, particularly in females; and microbiota-mediated suppression of lipid/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbohydr</span></strong>ate storage, especially on high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diet</span></strong>s. The microbiota also sets the relationship between energy storage and body mass, indicative of microbial modulation of the host signaling networks that coordinate metabolism with body size. This analysis identifies the multiple impacts of the microbiota on the metabolism of <i>Drosophila</i>, and demonstrates that the significance of these different interactions varies with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diet</span></strong> composition and host sex.</p>

Is gastrointestinal plasticity in king quail (<i>Coturnix chinensis</i>) elicited by diet-fibre or diet-energy dilution?
<p>Phenotypic plasticity of organ size allows some animals to manage fluctuations of resource quality or availability. Here, we examined the phenotypic plasticity of the gastrointestinal tract of king quail (<i>Coturnix chinensis</i>) in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diet</span></strong>-fibre manipulation study. Quail were offered either a control low-fibre (high-quality) food (8.5% neutral-detergent fibre; NDF), or one of two experimental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diet</span></strong>s of higher fibre contents of 16% NDF (i.e. low-quality food). To examine whether phenotypic plasticity of organ size was associated with the fibre content per se, or as a consequence of diluting the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diet</span></strong> energy contents by adding fibre, one of the high-fibre feeds was ‘balanced’ with additional energy to match that of the low-fibre control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diet</span></strong>. Total empty dry mass of the gastrointestinal tract was significantly heavier among birds offered the unbalanced high-fibre <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diet</span></strong> as compared with those offered the control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diet</span></strong>, with birds offered the fibrous but energy-balanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diet</span></strong> having guts of intermediate size. The heavier entire-gut mass (dry) of quail offered the unbalanced high-fibre <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diet</span></strong> was associated mainly with these birds having significantly heavier gizzards. Notably, the larger gizzard in the birds offered the unbalanced high-fibre <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diet</span></strong> was associated with marked increases in their metabolisability (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">digest</span></strong>ion) of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diet</span></strong> fibre. Our findings suggest that the available energy in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diet</span></strong> may be more important for eliciting phenotypic changes in the gut of these herbivorous birds rather than simple physical effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diet</span></strong> fibre on feed intakes or on muscular compensation to fibrous ingesta.</p>

Tandem Fluorescent Protein Timers for Noninvasive Relative Protein Lifetime Measurement in Plants
<p>Targeted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> degradation is an important and pervasive regulatory mechanism in plants, required for perception and response to the environment as well as developmental signaling. Despite the significance of this process, relatively few studies have assessed plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> turnover in a quantitative fashion. Tandem fluorescent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> timers (tFTs) offer a powerful approach for the assessment of in vivo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> turnover in distinct subcellular compartments of single or multiple cells. A tFT is a fusion of two different fluorescent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s with distinct fluorophore matu<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ration</span></strong> kinetics, which enable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> age to be estimated from the ratio of fluorescence intensities of the two fluorescent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s. Here, we used short-lived auxin signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s and model N-end rule (N-recognin) pathway reporters to demonstrate the utility of tFTs for studying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> turnover in living plant cells of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. We present transient expression of tFTs as an efficient screen for relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> lifetime, useful for testing the effects of mutations and different genetic backgrounds on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> stability. This work demonstrates the potential for using stably expressed tFTs to study native <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> dynamics with high temporal resolution in response to exogenous or endogenous stimuli.</p>

Protein Carbonylation and Glycation in Legume Nodules
<p>Nitrogen fixation is an agronomically and environmentally important process catalyzed by bacterial nitrogenase within legume root nodules. These unique symbiotic organs have high metabolic rates and produce large amounts of reactive oxygen species that may modify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s irreversibly. Here, we examined two types of oxidative posttranslational modifications of nodule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s: carbonylation, which occurs by direct oxidation of certain amino acids or by interaction with reactive aldehydes arising from cell membrane lipid peroxides; and glycation, which results from the reaction of lysine and arginine residues with reducing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong>s or their autooxidation products. We used a strategy based on the enrichment of carbonylated peptides by affinity chromatography followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify 369 oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s in bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>) nodules. Of these, 238 corresponded to plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s and 131 to bacterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s. Lipid peroxidation products induced most carbonylation sites. This study also revealed that carbonylation has major effects on two key nodule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s. Metal-catalyzed oxidation caused the inactivation of malate dehydrogenase and the aggregation of leghemoglobin. In addition, numerous glycated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s were identified in vivo, including three key nodule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s: sucrose synthase, glutamine synthetase, and glutamate synthase. Label-free quantification identified 10 plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s and 18 bacterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s as age-specifically glycated. Overall, our results suggest that the selective carbonylation or glycation of crucial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s involved in nitrogen metabolism, transcriptional regulation, and signaling may constitute a mechanism to control cell metabolism and nodule senescence.</p>

The RNA Editing Factor SlORRM4 Is Required for Normal Fruit Ripening in Tomato
<p>RNA editing plays a key posttranscriptional role in gene expression. Existing studies on cytidine-to-uridine RNA editing in plants have focused on maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), and Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). However, the importance and regulation of RNA editing in several critical agronomic processes are not well understood, a notable example of which is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> ripening. Here, we analyzed the expression profile of 33 RNA editing factors and identified 11 putative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> ripening-related factors. A rapid virus-induced gene silencing assay indicated that the organelle RNA recognition motif-containing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> SlORRM4 affected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> ripening. Knocking out SlORRM4 expression using a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic rep<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eat</span></strong>s (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> 9 genome editing strategy delayed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> ripening by lowering respiratory rate and ethylene production. Additionally, the expression of numerous genes associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> ripening and mitochondrial functions changed significantly when <i>SlORRM4</i> was knocked out. Moreover, the loss of <i>SlORRM4</i> function significantly reduced RNA editing of many mitochondrial transcripts, leading to low-level expression of some core subunits that are critical for mitochondrial complex assembly (i.e. Nad3, Cytc1, and COX II). Taken together, these results indicate that SlORRM4 is involved in RNA editing of transcripts in ripening <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> that influence mitochondrial function and key aspects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> ripening.</p>

Saltational evolution of the heterotrimeric G protein signaling mechanisms in the plant kingdom
<p>Signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s evolved diverse interactions to provide specificity for distinct stimuli. Signaling complexity in the G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> (heterotrimeric guanosine triphosphate–binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>) network was achieved in animals through subunit duplication and incremental evolution. By combining comprehensive and quantitative phenotypic profiles of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> evolution informatics, we found that plant heterotrimeric G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> machinery evolved by a saltational (jumping) process. Sequence similarity scores mapped onto tertiary structures, and biochemical validation showed that the extra-large Gα (XLG) subunit evolved extensively in the charophycean algae (an aquatic green plant) by gene duplication and gene fusion. In terrestrial plants, further evolution uncoupled XLG from its negative regulator, regulator of G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> signaling, but <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">preserv</span></strong>ed an α-helix region that enables interaction with its partner Gβγ. The ancestral gene evolved slowly due to the molecular constraints imposed by the need for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> to maintain interactions with various partners, whereas the genes encoding XLG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s evolved rapidly to produce three highly divergent members. Analysis of <i>A. thaliana</i> mutants indicated that these Gα and XLG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s all function with Gβγ and evolved to operate both independently and cooperatively. The XLG-Gβγ machinery specialized in environmental stress responses, whereas the canonical Gα-Gβγ retained developmental roles. Some developmental processes, such as shoot development, involve both Gα and XLG acting cooperatively or antagonistically. These extensive and rapid evolutionary changes in XLG structure compared to those of the canonical Gα subunit contrast with the accepted notion of how pathway diversification occurs through gene duplication with subsequent incremental coevolution of residues among interacting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s.</p>

Random heteropolymers preserve protein function in foreign environments
<p>The successful incorpo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ration</span></strong> of active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s into synthetic polymers could lead to a new class of materials with functions found only in living systems. However, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s rarely function under the conditions suitable for polymer processing. On the basis of an analysis of trends in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> sequences and characteristic chemical patterns on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> surfaces, we designed four-monomer random heteropolymers to mimic intrinsically disordered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> solubilization and stabilization in non-native environments.

Enhancer-Promoter Interaction of <i>SELF PRUNING 5G</i> Shapes Photoperiod Adaptation
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) is a major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>able <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> grown and consumed worldwide. Modern cultivated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong>es are derived from their wild relative, <i>Solanum pimpinellifolium</i>, a short-day plant that originated from the Andean region of South America. The molecular underpinnings of the regional adaptation and expansion of domesticated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> remain largely unclear. In this study, we examined flowering time in wild and cultivated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong>es under both long-day and short-day conditions. Using quantitative trait locus mapping in a recombinant inbred line population, we identified <i>SELF PRUNING 5G</i> (<i>SP5G</i>) as a major locus influencing daylength adaptation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong>. Genetic diversity analysis revealed that the genomic region harboring <i>SP5G</i> shows signatures of a domestication sweep. We found that a 52-bp sequence within the 3′ untranslated region of <i>SP5G</i> is essential for the enhanced expression of this gene, leading to delayed flowering time in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong>es through a promoter-enhancer interaction that occurs only under long-day conditions. We further demonstrate that the absence of the 52-bp sequence attenuates the promoter-enhancer interaction and reduces <i>SP5G</i> expression in cultivated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong>es, making their flowering time insensitive to daylength. Our findings demonstrate that cis-regulatory variation at the enhancer region of the <i>SP5G</i> 3′ untranslated region confers reduced photoperiodic response in cultivated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong>es, uncovering a regulatory mechanism that could potentially be used to manipulate flowering time in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> through novel biotechnological approaches.</p>

ANN1 and ANN2 Function in Post-Phloem Sugar Transport in Root Tips to Affect Primary Root Growth
<p>Annexins are a multigene family of calcium-dependent membrane-binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that play important roles in plant cell signaling. Annexins are multifunctional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, and their function in plants is not comprehensively understood. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) annexins ANN1 and ANN2 are 64% identical in their primary structure, and both are highly expressed in seedlings. Here, we showed that <i>ann-mutant</i> seedlings grown in the absence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> show decreased primary root growth and altered columella cells in root caps; however, these mutant defects are rescued by Suc, Glc, or Fru. In seedlings grown without <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong>, significant up-regulation of photosynthetic gene expression and chlorophyll accumulation was found in <i>ann-mutant</i> cotyledons compared to that in wild type, which indicates potential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> starvation in the roots of <i>ann-mutant</i> seedlings. Unexpectedly, the overall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> content of <i>ann-mutant</i> primary roots was significantly higher than that of wild-type roots when grown without <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong>. To examine the diffusion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> along the entire root to the root tip, we examined the unloading pattern of carboxyfluorescein dye and found that post-phloem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> transport was impaired in <i>ann-mutant</i> root tips compared to that in wild type. Increased levels of ROS and callose were detected in the root tips of <i>ann-mutant</i> seedlings grown without Suc, the latter of which would restrict plasmodesmal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> transport to root tips. Our results indicate that ANN1 and ANN2 play an important role in post-phloem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> transport to the root tip, which in turn indirectly influences photosynthetic rates in cotyledons. This study expands our understanding of the function of annexins in plants.</p>

A Dioxygenase Catalyzes Steroid 16α-Hydroxylation in Steroidal Glycoalkaloid Biosynthesis
<p>Steroidal glycoalkaloids (SGAs) are toxic specialized metabolites that are found in the Solanaceae. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potato</span></strong> (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>) contains the SGAs α-solanine and α-chaconine, while <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) contains α-tomatine, all of which are biosynthesized from cholesterol. However, although two cytochrome P450 monooxygenases that catalyze the 22- and 26-hydroxylation of cholesterol have been identified, the 16-hydroxylase remains unknown. Feeding with deuterium-labeled cholesterol indicated that the 16α- and 16β-hydrogen atoms of cholesterol were eliminated to form α-solanine and α-chaconine in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potato</span></strong>, while only the 16α-hydrogen atom was eliminated in α-tomatine biosynthesis, suggesting that a single oxidation at C-16 takes place during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> SGA biosynthesis while a two-step oxidation occurs in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potato</span></strong>. Here, we show that a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase, designated as 16DOX, is involved in SGA biosynthesis. We found that the transcript of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potato</span></strong> <i>16DOX</i> (<i>St16DOX</i>) was expressed at high levels in the tuber sprouts, where large amounts of SGAs are accumulated. Biochemical analysis of the recombinant St16DOX <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> revealed that St16DOX catalyzes the 16α-hydroxylation of hydroxycholesterols and that (22<i>S</i>)-22,26-dihydroxycholesterol was the best substrate among the nine compounds tested. <i>St16DOX</i>-silenced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potato</span></strong> plants contained significantly lower levels of SGAs, and a detailed metabolite analysis revealed that they accumulated the glycosides of (22<i>S</i>)-22,26-dihydroxycholesterol. Analysis of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> <i>16DOX</i> (<i>Sl16DOX</i>) gene gave essentially the same results. These findings clearly indicate that 16DOX is a steroid 16α-hydroxylase that functions in the SGA biosynthetic pathway. Furthermore, <i>St16DOX</i> silencing did not affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potato</span></strong> tuber yield, indicating that <i>16DOX</i> may be a suitable target for controlling toxic SGA levels in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potato</span></strong>.</p>

Multisite phosphorylation by MAPK
<p>Reversible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphorylation plays a fundamental role in signal transduction networks. Phosphorylation alters <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> function by regulating enzymatic activity, stability, cellular localization, or binding partners. Over three-quarters of human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s may be phosphorylated, with many targeted at multiple sites. Such multisite phosphorylation substantially increases the scope for modulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> function—a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> with <i>n</i> phosphorylation sites has the potential to exist in 2<sup><i>n</i></sup> distinct phosphorylation states, each of which could, in theory, display modified functionality. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s can be substrates for several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> kinases, thereby integrating distinct signals to provide a coherent biological response. However, they can also be phosphorylated at multiple sites by a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> kinase to promote a specific functional output that can be reversed by dephosphorylation by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatases. On page 233 of this issue, Mylona <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) reveal an unexpected role for multisite phosphorylation, whereby a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> kinase progressively phosphorylates sites on a transcription factor to promote and then subsequently limit its activity independently of dephosphorylation.</p>

The Wheat <i>Lr67</i> Gene from the Sugar Transport Protein 13 Family Confers Multipathogen Resistance in Barley
<p>Fungal pathogens are a major constraint to global crop production; hence, plant genes encoding pathogen resistance are important tools for combating disease. A few resistance genes identified to date provide partial, durable resistance to multiple pathogens and the wh<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eat</span></strong> (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) Lr67 hexose transporter variant (Lr67res) fits into this category. Two amino acids differ between the wild-type and resistant alleles – G144R and V387L. Exome sequence data from 267 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) landraces and wild accessions was screened and neither of the Lr67res mutations was detected. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> ortholog of Lr67, HvSTP13, was functionally characterized in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> as a high affinity hexose transporter. The G144R mutation was introduced into HvSTP13 and abolished Glc uptake, whereas the V387L mutation reduced Glc uptake by ∼ 50%. Glc transport by HvSTP13 heterologously expressed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> was reduced when coexpressed with <i>Lr67res</i>. Stable transgenic <i>Lr67res</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> lines exhibited seedling resistance to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong>-specific pathogens <i>Puccinia hordei</i> and <i>Blumeria graminis</i> f. sp. <i>hordei</i>, which cause leaf rust and powdery mildew, respectively. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> plants expressing <i>Lr67res</i> exhibited early senescence and higher pathogenesis-related (<i>PR</i>) gene expression. Unlike previous observations implicating flavonoids in the resistance of transgenic sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>) expressing <i>Lr34res</i>, another wh<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eat</span></strong> multipathogen resistance gene, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> flavonoids are unlikely to have a role in Lr67res-mediated resistance. Similar to observations made in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong>, Lr67res reduced Glc uptake <i>in planta</i>. These results confirm that the pathway by which <i>Lr67res</i> confers resistance to fungal pathogens is conserved between wh<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eat</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong>.</p>

Characterization of CRISPR Mutants Targeting Genes Modulating Pectin Degradation in Ripening Tomato
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) is a globally important crop with an economic value in the tens of billions of dollars, and a significant supplier of essential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vitamin</span></strong>s, minerals, and phytochemicals in the human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diet</span></strong>. Shelf life is a key quality trait related to alte<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ration</span></strong>s in cuticle properties and remodeling of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> cell walls. Studies with transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> plants undertaken over the last 20 years have indicated that a range of pectin-degrading enzymes are involved in cell wall remodeling. These studies usually involved silencing of only a single gene and it has proved difficult to compare the effects of silencing these genes across the different experimental systems. Here we report the gene<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ration</span></strong> of CRISPR-based mutants in the ripening-related genes encoding the pectin-degrading enzymes pectate lyase (PL), polygalacturonase 2a (PG2a), and β-galactanase (TBG4). Comparison of the physiochemical properties of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong>s from a range of <i>PL</i>, <i>PG2a</i>, and <i>TBG4</i> CRISPR lines demonstrated that only mutations in <i>PL</i> resulted in firmer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong>s, although mutations in <i>PG2a</i> and <i>TBG4</i> influenced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> color and weight. Pectin localization, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion, and solubility in the pericarp cells of the CRISPR mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong>s were investigated using the monoclonal antibody probes LM19 to deesterified homogalacturonan, INRA-RU1 to rhamnogalacturonan I, LM5 to β-1,4-galactan, and LM6 to arabinan epitopes, respectively. The data indicate that PL, PG2a, and TBG4 act on separate cell wall domains and the importance of cellulose microfibril-associated pectin is reflected in its increased occurrence in the different mutant lines.</p>

The NAC Transcription Factor SlNAP2 Regulates Leaf Senescence and Fruit Yield in Tomato
<p>Leaf senescence is an essential physiological process in plants that supports the recycling of nitrogen and other nutrients to support the growth of developing organs, including young leaves, seeds, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong>s. Thus, the regulation of senescence is crucial for evolutionary success in wild populations and for increasing yield in crops. Here, we describe the influence of a NAC transcription factor, SlNAP2 (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i> NAC-like, activated by Apetala3/Pistillata), that controls both leaf senescence and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> yield in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> (<i>S. lycopersicum</i>). <i>SlNAP2</i> expression increases during age-dependent and dark-induced leaf senescence. We demonstrate that SlNAP2 activates <i>SlSAG113</i> (<i>S. lycopersicum SENESCENCE-ASSOCIATED GENE113</i>), a homolog of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>SAG113</i>, chlorophyll degradation genes such as <i>SlSGR1</i> (<i>S. lycopersicum</i> senescence-inducible chloroplast stay-green <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> 1) and <i>SlPAO</i> (<i>S. lycopersicum</i> pheide <i>a</i> oxygenase), and other downstream targets by directly binding to their promoters, thereby promoting leaf senescence. Furthermore, SlNAP2 directly controls the expression of genes important for abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis, <i>S. lycopersicum</i> 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase 1 (<i>SlNCED1</i>); transport, <i>S. lycopersicum</i> ABC transporter G family member 40 (<i>SlABCG40</i>); and degradation, <i>S. lycopersicum</i> ABA 8′-hydroxylase (<i>SlCYP707A2</i>), indicating that SlNAP2 has a complex role in establishing ABA homeostasis during leaf senescence. Inhibiting <i>SlNAP2</i> expression in transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> plants impedes leaf senescence but enhances <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> yield and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> content likely due to prolonged leaf photosynthesis in aging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> plants. Our data indicate that SlNAP2 has a central role in controlling leaf senescence and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> yield in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong>.</p>

Stable Accumulation of Photosystem II Requires ONE-HELIX PROTEIN1 (OHP1) of the Light Harvesting-Like Family
<p>The cellular functions of two Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) one-helix <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, OHP1 and OHP2 (also named LIGHT-HARVESTING-LIKE2 [LIL2] and LIL6, respectively, because they have sequence similarity to light-harvesting chlorophyll <i>a</i>/<i>b</i>-binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s), remain unclear. Tagged null mutants of <i>OHP1</i> and <i>OHP2</i> (<i>ohp1</i> and <i>ohp2</i>) showed stunted growth with pale-green leaves on agar plates, and these mutants were unable to grow on soil. Leaf chlorophyll fluorescence and the composition of thylakoid membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s revealed that <i>ohp1</i> deletion substantially affected photosystem II (PSII) core <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> function and led to reduced levels of photosystem I core <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s; however, it did not affect LHC accumulation. Transgenic <i>ohp1</i> plants rescued with OHP1-HA or OHP1-Myc <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s developed a normal phenotype. Using these tagged OHP1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s in transgenic plants, we localized OHP1 to thylakoid membranes, where it formed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> complexes with both OHP2 and High Chlorophyll Fluorescence244 (HCF244). We also found PSII core <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s D1/D2, HCF136, and HCF173 and a few other plant-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s associated with the OHP1/OHP2-HCF244 complex, suggesting that these complexes are early intermediates in PSII assembly. OHP1 interacted directly with HCF244 in the complex. Therefore, OHP1 and HCF244 play important roles in the stable accumulation of PSII.</p>

The Long Intergenic Noncoding RNA (LincRNA) Landscape of the Soybean Genome
<p>Long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) are emerging as important regulators of diverse biological processes. However, our understanding of lincRNA abundance and function remains very limited especially for agriculturally important plants. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soybean</span></strong> (<i>Glycine max</i>) is a major legume crop plant providing over a half of global oilseed production. Moreover, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soybean</span></strong> can form symbiotic relationships with <i>Rhizobium</i> bacteria to fix atmospheric nitrogen. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soybean</span></strong> has a complex paleopolyploid genome and exhibits many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative and floral development complexities. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soybean</span></strong> cultivars have photoperiod requirements restricting its use and productivity. Molecular regulators of these legume-specific developmental processes remain enigmatic. Long noncoding RNAs may play important regulatory roles in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soybean</span></strong> growth and development. In this study, over one billion RNA-seq read pairs from 37 samples representing nine tissues were used to discover 6,018 lincRNA loci. The lincRNAs were shorter than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-coding transcripts and had lower expression levels and more sample specific expression. Few of the loci were found to be conserved in two other legume species (chickpea [<i>Cicer arietinum</i>] and <i>Medicago truncatula</i>), but almost 200 homeologous lincRNAs in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soybean</span></strong> genome were detected. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-coding gene-lincRNA coexpression analysis suggested an involvement of lincRNAs in stress response, signal transduction, and developmental processes. Positional analysis of lincRNA loci implicated involvement in transcriptional regulation. lincRNA expression from centromeric regions was observed especially in actively dividing tissues, suggesting possible roles in cell division. Integ<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ration</span></strong> of publicly available genome-wide association data with the lincRNA map of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soybean</span></strong> genome uncovered 23 lincRNAs potentially associated with agronomic traits.</p>

Sugar Transporter STP7 Specificity for <sc>l</sc>-Arabinose and <sc>d</sc>-Xylose Contrasts with the Typical Hexose Transporters STP8 and STP12
<p>The controlled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong>s between assimilate-exporting source tissues and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong>-consuming sink tissues is a key element for plant growth and development. Monosaccharide transporters of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> TRANSPORT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> (STP) family contribute to the uptake of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong>s into sink cells. Here, we report on the characterization of STP7, STP8, and STP12, three previously uncharacterized members of this family in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Heterologous expression in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) revealed that STP8 and STP12 catalyze the high-affinity proton-dependent uptake of glucose and also accept galactose and mannose. STP12 additionally transports xylose. <i>STP8</i> and <i>STP12</i> are highly expressed in reproductive organs, where their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> products might contribute to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> uptake into the pollen tube and the embryo sac. <i>stp8.1</i> and <i>stp12.1</i> T-DNA insertion lines developed normally, which may point toward functional redundancy with other STPs. In contrast to all other STPs, STP7 does not transport hexoses but is specific for the pentoses <sc>l</sc>-arabinose and <sc>d</sc>-xylose. <i>STP7-</i>promoter-reporter gene plants showed an expression of <i>STP7</i> especially in tissues with high cell wall turnover, indicating that STP7 might contribute to the uptake and recycling of cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong>s. Uptake analyses with radioactive <sc>l</sc>-arabinose revealed that 11 other STPs are able to transport <sc>l</sc>-arabinose with high affinity. Hence, functional redundancy might explain the missing-mutant phenotype of two <i>stp7</i> T-DNA insertion lines. Together, these data complete the characterization of the STP family and present the STPs as new <sc>l</sc>-arabinose transporters for potential biotechnological applications.</p>

Prolines in Transit Peptides Are Crucial for Efficient Preprotein Translocation into Chloroplasts
<p>Chloroplasts import many pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that can be classified based on their physicochemical properties. The cleavable N-terminal transit peptide (TP) of chloroplast pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s contains all the information required for import into chloroplasts through Toc/Tic translocons. The question of whether and how the physicochemical properties of pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s affect TP-mediated import into chloroplasts has not been elucidated. Here, we present evidence that Pro residues in TP mediate efficient translocation through the chloroplast envelope membranes for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s containing transmembrane domains (TMDs) or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s prone to aggregation. By contrast, the translocation of soluble <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s through the chloroplast envelope membranes is less dependent on TP prolines. Proless TPs failed to mediate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> translocation into chloroplasts; instead, these mutant TPs led to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> mistargeting to the chloroplast envelope membranes or nonspecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> aggregation during import into chloroplasts. The mistargeting of TMD-containing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s caused by Pro-less TPs in wild-type protoplasts was mimicked by wild-type TPs in <i>hsp93-V</i> protoplasts, in which pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> translocation is compromised. We propose that the physicochemical properties of chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> translocation through the chloroplast envelope, and prolines in TP have a crucial role in the efficient translocation of TMD-containing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s.</p>

Transcription Factor AREB2 Is Involved in Soluble Sugar Accumulation by Activating Sugar Transporter and Amylase Genes
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong>s play important roles in plant growth and development, crop yield and quality, as well as responses to abiotic stresses. Abscisic acid (ABA) is a multifunctional hormone. However, the exact mechanism by which ABA regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> accumulation is largely unknown in plants. Here, we tested the expression profile of several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> transporter and amylase genes in response to ABA tr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eat</span></strong>ment. <i>MdSUT2</i> and <i>MdAREB2</i> were isolated and genetically transformed into apple (<i>Malus domestica</i>) to investigate their roles in ABA-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> accumulation. The MdAREB2 transcription factor was found to bind to the promoters of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> transporter and amylase genes and activate their expression. Both MdAREB2 and MdSUT2 transgenic plants produced more soluble <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong>s than controls. Furthermore, MdAREB2 promoted the accumulation of sucrose and soluble <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong>s in an <i>MdSUT2</i>-dependent manner. Our results demonstrate that the ABA-responsive transcription factor MdAREB2 directly activates the expression of amylase and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> transporter genes to promote soluble <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> accumulation, suggesting a mechanism by which ABA regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> accumulation in plants.</p>

LIL3, a Light-Harvesting Complex Protein, Links Terpenoid and Tetrapyrrole Biosynthesis in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>The LIL3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) belongs to the light-harvesting complex (LHC) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> family, which also includes the light-harvesting chlorophyll-binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s of photosystems I and II, the early-light-inducible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, PsbS involved in nonphotochemical quenching, and the one-helix <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s and their cyanobacterial homologs designated high-light-inducible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s. Each member of this family is characterized by one or two LHC transmembrane domains (referred to as the LHC motif) to which potential functions such as chlorophyll binding, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> interaction, and integ<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ration</span></strong> of interacting partners into the plastid membranes have been attributed. Initially, LIL3 was shown to interact with geranylgeranyl reductase (CHLP), an enzyme of terpene biosynthesis that supplies the hydrocarbon chain for chlorophyll and tocopherol. Here, we show another function of LIL3 for the stability of protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR). Multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> interaction analyses suggest the direct physical interaction of LIL3 with POR but not with chlorophyll synthase. Consistently, LIL3-deficient plants exhibit substantial loss of POR as well as CHLP, which is not due to defective transcription of the POR and CHLP genes but to the posttranslational modification of their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> products. Interestingly, in vitro biochemical analyses provide novel evidence that LIL3 shows high binding affinity to protochlorophyllide, the substrate of POR. Taken together, this study suggests a critical role for LIL3 in the organization of later steps in chlorophyll biosynthesis. We suggest that LIL3 associates with POR and CHLP and thus contributes to the supply of the two metabolites, chlorophyllide and phytyl pyrophosphate, required for the final step in chlorophyll <i>a</i> synthesis.</p>

Starch Synthase 4 and Plastidal Phosphorylase Differentially Affect Starch Granule Number and Morphology

Besides <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">starch</span></strong> SYNTHASE4 (SS4), the PLASTIDIAL PHOSPHORYLASE (PHS1) also seems to be involved, since <i>dpe2-1/phs1a</i> double mutants lacking both PHS1 and the cytosolic DISPROPORTIONATING ENZYME2 (DPE2) displayed only one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">starch</span></strong> granule per chloroplast under normal growth conditions. For further studies, a <i>dpe2-1/phs1a/ss4</i> triple mutant and various combinations of double mutants were generated and metabolically analyzed with a focus on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">starch</span></strong> metabolism. The <i>dpe2-1/phs1a/ss4</i> mutant revealed a massive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">starch</span></strong> excess phenotype. Furthermore, these plants grown under 12 h of light/12 h of dark harbored a single large and spherical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">starch</span></strong> granule per plastid. The number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">starch</span></strong> granules was constant when the light/dark regime was altered, but this was not observed in the parental lines. With regard to growth, photosynthetic parameters, and metabolic analyses, the triple mutant additionally displayed alte<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ration</span></strong>s in comparison with <i>ss4</i> and <i>dpe2-1/phs1a</i>. The results clearly illustrate that PHS1 and SS4 are differently involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">starch</span></strong> granule formation and do not act in series. However, SS4 appears to exert a stronger influence. In connection with the characterized double mutants, we discuss the gene<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ration</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">starch</span></strong> granules and the observed formation of spherical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">starch</span></strong> granules.</p>

Functional Analysis of Cellulose Synthase (CESA) Protein Class Specificity
<p>The cellulose synthase complex (CSC) exhibits a 6-fold symmetry and is known as a “rosette.” Each CSC is believed to contain between 18 and 24 CESA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that each synthesize an individual glucan chain. These chains form the microfibrils that confer the remarkable structural properties of cellulose. At least three different classes of CESA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are essential to form the CSC. However, while organization of the CSC determines microfibril structure, how individual CESA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are organized within the CSC remains unclear. Parts of the plant CESA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s map sufficiently well onto the bacterial CESA (BcsA) structure, indicating that they are likely to share a common catalytic mechanism. However, plant CESA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are much larger than the bacterial BcsA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>, prompting the suggestion that these plant-specific regions are important for interactions between CESA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s and for conferring CESA class specificity. In this study, we have undertaken a comprehensive analysis of well-defined regions of secondary cell wall CESA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, with the aim of defining what distinguishes different CESA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s and hence what determines the specificity of each CESA class. Our results demonstrate that CESA class specificity extends throughout the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> and not just in the highly variable regions. Furthermore, we find that different CESA isoforms vary gr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eat</span></strong>ly in their levels of site specificity and this is likely to be determined by the constraints imposed by their position within the CSC rather than their primary structure.</p>

Starch Turnover and Metabolism during Flower and Early Embryo Development
<p>The accumulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">starch</span></strong> within photosynthetic tissues and within dedicated storage organs has been characterized extensively in many species, and a function in buffering carbon availability or in fueling later growth phases, respectively, has been proposed. However, developmentally regulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">starch</span></strong> turnover within heterotrophic tissues other than dedicated storage organs is poorly characterized, and its function is not well understood. Here, we report on the characterization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">starch</span></strong> turnover during flower, early embryo, and silique development in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) using a combined clearing-staining technique on whole-mount tissue. Besides the two previously documented waves of transient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">starch</span></strong> accumulation in the stamen envelope, occurring during meiosis and pollen mitosis I, we identified a novel, third wave of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">starch</span></strong> amylogenesis/amylolysis during the last stages of stamen development. To gain insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms, we analyzed publicly available microarray data, which revealed a developmentally coordinated expression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbohydr</span></strong>ate transport and metabolism genes during these waves of transient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">starch</span></strong> accumulation. Based on this analysis, we characterized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">starch</span></strong> dynamics in mutants affecting hexose phosphate metabolism and translocation, and identified the Glc-6-phosphate/phosphate antiporter GPT1 as the putative translocator of Glc-6-phosphate for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">starch</span></strong> biosynthesis in reproductive tissues. Based on these results, we propose a model of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">starch</span></strong> synthesis within the pollen grain and discuss the nutrient transport route feeding the embryo within the developing seed.</p>

Differential effects of vitamins E and C and carotenoids on growth, resistance to oxidative stress, fledging success and plumage colouration in wild great tits
<p>Oxidative stress is the imbalance between the production of reactive species and antioxidants, which causes damage to lipids, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s and DNA. Antioxidants, like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vitamin</span></strong>s and carotenoids, can limit oxidative damage and can therefore regulate the trade-off between growth, which is a period of high reactive species production, and self-maintenance. However, the role of carotenoids as antioxidants <i>in vivo</i> has been debated, and it has been suggested that carotenoid-based signals indicate the availability of non-pigmentary antioxidants (e.g. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vitamin</span></strong>s) that protect carotenoids from oxidation, known as the ‘protection hypothesis’. To evaluate the importance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vitamin</span></strong>s versus carotenoids as antioxidants during growth and to test the protection hypothesis, we supplemented nestling gr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eat</span></strong> tits, <i>Parus major</i>, 3, 5 and 7 days after hatching with a single dose of carotenoids and/or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vitamin</span></strong>s in a 2×2 full-factorial design. We subsequently measured body condition, antioxidant capacity, oxidative damage, fledging success and plumage reflectance. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vitamin</span></strong>s enhanced antioxidant capacity, but did not affect oxidative damage. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vitamin</span></strong>-tr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eat</span></strong>ed nestlings had higher growth rates and higher probability of fledging. In contrast, carotenoids did not affect any of these traits. Furthermore, carotenoid-based colou<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ration</span></strong> increased over the breeding season in nestlings that received <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vitamin</span></strong>s only. This study shows that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vitamin</span></strong>s are limiting for growth rate and fledging success, and suggests that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vitamin</span></strong>s could regulate the trade-off between growth and self-maintenance in favour of the former. Moreover, our results are consistent with the idea that carotenoids are minor antioxidants in birds, but they do not support the protection hypothesis.</p>

An acquired distaste: sugar discrimination by the larval parasitoid <i>Microplitis croceipes</i> (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) is affected by prior sugar exposure
<p>We examined gustatory responses of the larval parasitoid <i>Microplitis croceipes</i> to determine whether the adults discriminate among common <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong>s, including fructose, glucose, maltose and sucrose, found in plants. When given single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> solutions of sucrose, glucose, fructose and maltose at concent<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ration</span></strong>s of 0.008–2.0 mol l<sup>−1</sup>, the estimated concent<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ration</span></strong>s at which 50% of wasps initiated feeding ranged between 0.054 and 0.085 mol l<sup>−1</sup> for sucrose, glucose and fructose, which was significantly lower than for maltose. Wasps showed a strong decrease in feeding time for maltose or fructose following a brief exposure to other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong>s, suggesting that wasps can distinguish maltose and fructose from the other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong>s tested. The higher acceptance threshold and short feeding time in the case of maltose appears adaptive in light of the relatively poor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrit</span></strong>ional quality of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> in the longevity trial. The pronounced feeding inhibition seen for fructose following exposure to other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong>s is not linked with lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrit</span></strong>ional performance. This feeding inhibition was even seen in wasps that had fed on glucose at the lowest acceptance threshold (0.031 mol l<sup>−1</sup>) and persisted for 24 h. This study is the first to show feeding inhibition of otherwise phagostimulant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong>s such as maltose and fructose after gustatory stimulation on other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong>s.</p>

Genome-Wide Development and Use of Microsatellite Markers for Large-Scale Genotyping Applications in Foxtail Millet [<i>Setaria italica</i> (L.)]
<p>The availability of well-validated informative co-dominant microsatellite markers and saturated genetic linkage map has been limited in foxtail <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">millet</span></strong> (<i>Setaria italica</i> L.). In view of this, we conducted a genome-wide analysis and identified 28 342 microsatellite rep<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eat</span></strong>-motifs spanning 405.3 Mb of foxtail <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">millet</span></strong> genome. The trinucleotide rep<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eat</span></strong>s (∼48%) was prevalent when compared with dinucleotide rep<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eat</span></strong>s (∼46%). Of the 28 342 microsatellites, 21 294 (∼75%) primer pairs were successfully designed, and a total of 15 573 markers were physically mapped on 9 chromosomes of foxtail <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">millet</span></strong>. About 159 markers were validated successfully in 8 accessions of <i>Setaria</i> sp. with ∼67% polymorphic potential. The high percentage (89.3%) of cross-genera transferability across <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">millet</span></strong> and non-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">millet</span></strong> species with higher transferability percentage in bioenergy grasses (∼79%, Switchgrass and ∼93%, Pearl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">millet</span></strong>) signifies their importance in studying the bioenergy grasses. <i>In silico</i> comparative mapping of 15 573 foxtail <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">millet</span></strong> microsatellite markers against the mapping data of sorghum (16.9%), maize (14.5%) and rice (6.4%) indicated syntenic relationships among the chromosomes of foxtail <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">millet</span></strong> and target species. The results, thus, demonstrate the immense applicability of developed microsatellite markers in germplasm characterization, phylogenetics, construction of genetic linkage map for gene/quantitative trait loci discovery, comparative mapping in foxtail <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">millet</span></strong>, including other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">millet</span></strong>s and bioenergy grass species.</p>

Improving Assessment of Drug Safety Through Proteomics
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Early detection of adverse effects of novel therapies and understanding of their mechanisms could improve the safety and efficiency of drug development. We have retrospectively applied large-scale proteomics to blood samples from ILLUMINATE (Investigation of Lipid Level Management to Understand its Impact in Atherosclerotic Events), a trial of torcetrapib (a cholesterol ester transfer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> inhibitor), that involved 15 067 participants at high cardiovascular risk. ILLUMINATE was terminated at a median of 550 days because of significant absolute increases of 1.2% in cardiovascular events and 0.4% in mortality with torcetrapib. The aims of our analysis were to determine whether a proteomic analysis might reveal biological mechanisms responsible for these harmful effects and whether harmful effects of torcetrapib could have been detected early in the ILLUMINATE trial with proteomics.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A nested case-control analysis of paired plasma samples at baseline and at 3 months was performed in 249 participants assigned to torcetrapib plus atorvastatin and 223 participants assigned to atorvastatin only. Within each tr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eat</span></strong>ment arm, cases with events were matched to controls 1:1. Main outcomes were a survey of 1129 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s for discovery of biological pathways altered by torcetrapib and a 9-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> risk score validated to predict myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, or d<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eat</span></strong>h.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Plasma concent<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ration</span></strong>s of 200 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s changed significantly with torcetrapib.

At baseline, 9-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> risk scores were similar in the 2 tr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eat</span></strong>ment arms and higher in participants with subsequent events. At 3 months, the absolute 9-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> derived risk increased in the torcetrapib plus atorvastatin arm compared with the atorvastatin-only arm by 1.08% (<i>P</i>=0.0004).

High-CO<sub>2</sub>/Hypoxia-Responsive Transcription Factors DkERF24 and DkWRKY1 Interact and Activate <i>DkPDC2</i> Promoter
<p>Identification and functional characterization of hypoxia-responsive transcription factors is important for understanding plant responses to natural anaerobic environments and during storage and transport of fresh horticultural products. In this study, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> one-hybrid library screening using the persimmon (<i>Diospyros kaki</i>) pyruvate decarboxylase (<i>DkPDC2</i>) promoter identified three ethylene response factor (ERF) genes (<i>DkERF23</i>/<i>DkERF24</i>/<i>DkERF25</i>) and four WRKY transcription factor genes (<i>DkWRKY/DdkWRKY5</i>/<i>DkWRKY6</i>/<i>DkWRKY7</i>) that were differentially expressed in response to high CO<sub>2</sub> (95%, with 4% N<sub>2</sub> and 1% oxygen) and high N<sub>2</sub> (99% N<sub>2</sub> and 1% oxygen). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> one-hybrid assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that DkERF23, DkERF24, DkERF25, DkWRKY6, and DkWRKY7 could directly bind to the <i>DkPDC2</i> promoter. Dual-luciferase assays confirmed that these transcription factors were capable of transactivating the <i>DkPDC2</i> promoter. DkERF24 and DkWRKY1 in combination synergistically transactivated the <i>DkPDC2</i> promoter, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays confirmed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> interaction between DkERF24 and DkWRKY1. Transient overexpression of <i>DkERF24</i> and <i>DkWRKY1</i> separately and in combination in persimmon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> discs was effective in maintaining insolubilization of tannins, concomitantly with the accumulation of DkPDC2 transcripts. Studies with Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) homologs <i>AtERF1</i> and <i>AtWRKY53</i> indicated that similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> interactions and synergistic regulatory effects also occur with the <i>DkPDC2</i> promoter. We propose that an ERF and WRKY transcription factor complex contributes to responses to hypoxia in both persimmon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> and Arabidopsis, and the possibility that this is a general plant response requires further investigation.</p>

The Potassium Transporter SlHAK10 Is Involved in Mycorrhizal Potassium Uptake
<p>Most terrestrial plants form a root symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, which receive fixed carbon from the plant and enhance the plant’s uptake of mineral nutrients. AM symbiosis improves the phosphorous and nitrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrit</span></strong>ion of host plants; however, little is known about the role of AM symbiosis in potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrit</span></strong>ion. Here, we report that inoculation with the AM fungus <i>Rhizophagus irregularis</i> improved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) plant growth and K<sup>+</sup> acquisition and that K<sup>+</sup> deficiency has a negative effect on root growth and AM colonization. Based on its homology to a <i>Lotus japonicus</i> AM-induced K<sup>+</sup> transporter, we identified a mycorrhiza-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> K<sup>+</sup> transporter, SlHAK10 (<i>Solanum lycopersicum High-affinity Potassium Transporter10</i>), that was exclusively expressed in arbuscule-containing cells. <i>SlHAK10</i> could restore a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> K<sup>+</sup> uptake-defective mutant in the low-affinity concent<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ration</span></strong> range. Loss of function of <i>SlHAK10</i> led to a significant decrease in mycorrhizal K<sup>+</sup> uptake and AM colonization rate under low-K<sup>+</sup> conditions but did not affect arbuscule development. Overexpressing <i>SlHAK10</i> from the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter or the AM-specific <i>Solanum melongena Phosphate Transporter4</i> not only improved plant growth and K<sup>+</sup> uptake but also increased AM colonization efficiency and soluble <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sugar</span></strong> content in roots supplied with low K<sup>+</sup>. Our results indicate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> plants have a SlHAK10<i>-</i>mediated mycorrhizal K<sup>+</sup> uptake pathway and that improved plant K<sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrit</span></strong>ion could increase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbohydr</span></strong>ate accumulation in roots, which facilitates AM fungal colonization.</p>

HCN Regulates Cellular Processes through Posttranslational Modification of Proteins by <i>S-</i>cyanylation
<p>Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) is coproduced with ethylene in plant cells and is primarily enzymatically detoxified by the mitochondrial β-CYANOALANINE SYNTHASE (CAS-C1). Permanent or transient depletion of CAS-C1 activity in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) results in physiological alte<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ration</span></strong>s in the plant that suggest that HCN acts as a gasotransmitter molecule. Label-free quantitative proteomic analysis of mitochondrially enriched samples isolated from the wild type and <i>cas-c1</i> mutant revealed significant changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> content, identifying 451 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that are absent or less abundant in <i>cas-c1</i> and 353 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that are only present or more abundant in <i>cas-c1</i>. Gene ontology classification of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s identified proteomic changes that explain the root hairless phenotype and the altered immune response observed in the <i>cas-c1</i> mutant. The mechanism of action of cyanide as a signaling molecule was addressed using two proteomic approaches aimed at identifying the <i>S-</i>cyanylation of Cys as a posttranslational modification of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s. Both the 2-imino-thiazolidine chemical method and the direct untargeted analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry identified a set of 163 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s susceptible to <i>S-</i>cyanylation that included SEDOHEPTULOSE 1,7-BISPHOSPHATASE (SBPase), the PEPTIDYL-PROLYL CIS-TRANS ISOMERASE 20-3 (CYP20-3), and ENOLASE2 (ENO2). In vitro analysis of these enzymes showed that <i>S-</i>cyanylation of SBPase Cys<sup>74</sup>, CYP20-3 Cys<sup>259</sup>, and ENO2 Cys<sup>346</sup> residues affected their enzymatic activity. Gene Ontology classification and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> interaction cluster analysis showed that <i>S-</i>cyanylation is involved in the regulation of primary metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis, and the Calvin and <i>S</i>-adenosyl-Met cycles.</p>

CHLOROPLAST RIBOSOME ASSOCIATED Supports Translation under Stress and Interacts with the Ribosomal 30S Subunit
<p>Chloroplast ribosomes, which originated from cyanobacteria, comprise a large subunit (50S) and a small subunit (30S) containing ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and various ribosomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s. Genes for many chloroplast ribosomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, as well as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s with auxiliary roles in ribosome biogenesis or functioning, reside in the nucleus. Here, we identified Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) CHLOROPLAST RIBOSOME ASSOCIATED (CRASS), a member of the latter class of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, based on the tight coexpression of its mRNA with transcripts for nucleus-encoded chloroplast ribosomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s. CRASS was acquired during the evolution of embryophytes and is localized to the chloroplast stroma. Loss of CRASS results in minor defects in development, photosynthetic efficiency, and chloroplast translation activity under controlled growth conditions, but these phenotypes are gr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eat</span></strong>ly exacerbated under stress conditions induced by the translational inhibitors lincomycin and chloramphenicol or by cold tr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eat</span></strong>ment. The CRASS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> comigrates with chloroplast ribosomal particles and coimmunoprecipitates with the 16S rRNA and several chloroplast ribosomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, particularly the plastid ribosomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s of the 30S subunit (PRPS1 and PRPS5). The association of CRASS with PRPS1 and PRPS5 is independent of rRNA and is not detectable in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> two-hybrid experiments, implying that either CRASS interacts indirectly with PRPS1 and PRPS5 via another component of the small ribosomal subunit or that it recognizes structural f<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eat</span></strong>ures of the multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>/rRNA particle. CRASS plays a role in the biogenesis and/or stability of the chloroplast ribosome that becomes critical under certain stressful conditions when ribosomal activity is compromised.</p>

Editing of an Alpha-Kafirin Gene Family Increases, Digestibility and Protein Quality in Sorghum
<p>Kafirins are the major storage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s in sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>) grains and form <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> bodies with poor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">digest</span></strong>ibility. Since kafirins are devoid of the essential amino acid lysine, they also impart poor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> quality to the kernel. The α-kafirins, which make up most of the total kafirins, are largely encoded by the <i>k1C</i> family of highly similar genes. We used a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic rep<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eat</span></strong>s (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> 9 (Cas9) gene editing approach to target the <i>k1C</i> genes to cr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eat</span></strong>e variants with reduced kafirin levels and improved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> quality and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">digest</span></strong>ibility. A single guide RNA was designed to introduce mutations in a conserved region encoding the endoplasmic reticulum signal peptide of α-kafirins. Sequencing of kafirin PCR products revealed extensive edits in 25 of 26 events in one or multiple <i>k1C</i> family members. T1 and T2 seeds showed reduced α-kafirin levels, and selected T2 events showed significantly increased grain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">digest</span></strong>ibility and lysine content. Thus, a single consensus single guide RNA carrying target sequence mismatches is sufficient for extensive editing of all <i>k1C</i> genes.

Preferential Distribution of Boron to Developing Tissues Is Mediated by the Intrinsic Protein OsNIP3
<p>Boron is especially required for the growth of meristem and reproductive organs, but the molecular mechanisms underlying the preferential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion of B to these developing tissues are poorly understood. Here, we show evidence that a member of nodulin 26-like intrinsic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> (NIP), OsNIP3;1, is involved in this preferential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). <i>OsNIP3</i>;<i>1</i> was highly expressed in the nodes and its expression was up-regulated by B deficiency, but down-regulated by high B. OsNIP3;1 was polarly localized at the xylem parenchyma cells of enlarged vascular bundles of nodes facing toward the xylem vessels. Furthermore, this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> was rapidly degraded within a few hours in response to high B. Knockout of this gene hardly affected the uptake and root-to-shoot translocation of B, but altered B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion in different organs in the above-ground parts, decreased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion of B to the new leaves, and increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion to the old leaves. These results indicate that OsNIP3;1 located in the nodes is involved in the preferential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong>ion of B to the developing tissues by unloading B from the xylem in rice and that it is regulated at both transcriptional and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> level in response to external B level.</p>

Leaf Starch Turnover Occurs in Long Days and in Falling Light at the End of the Day
<p>We investigated whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">starch</span></strong> degradation occurs at the same time as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">starch</span></strong> synthesis in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves in the light. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">starch</span></strong> accumulated in a linear fashion for about 12 h after dawn, then accumulation slowed and content plateaued. Following decreases in light intensity, the rate of accumulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">starch</span></strong> declined in proportion to the decline in photosynthesis if the decrease occurred <10 h after dawn, but accumulation ceased or loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">starch</span></strong> occurred if the same decrease in light intensity was imposed more than 10 h after dawn. These changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">starch</span></strong> accumulation patterns after prolonged periods in the light occurred at both high and low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">starch</span></strong> contents and were not related to time-dependent changes in either the rate of photosynthesis or the partitioning of assimilate between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">starch</span></strong> and Suc, as assessed from metabolite measurements and <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> pulse experiments. Instead, measurements of incorpo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ration</span></strong> of <sup>13</sup>C from <sup>13</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">starch</span></strong> and of levels of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">starch</span></strong> degradation product maltose showed that substantial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">starch</span></strong> degradation occurred simultaneously with synthesis at time points >14 h after dawn and in response to decreases in light intensity that occurred >10 h after dawn. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">starch</span></strong> measurements in circadian clock mutants suggested that the clock influences the timing of onset of degradation. We conclude that the propensity for leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">starch</span></strong> to be degraded increases with time after dawn. The importance of this phenomenon for efficient use of carbon for growth in long days and for prevention of starvation during twilight is discussed.</p>

Through molecular characterization of a <i>small kernel2</i> (<i>smk2</i>) mutant in maize, we reveal that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vitamin</span></strong> B<sub>6</sub> has differential effects on embryogenesis and endosperm development in maize. The B<sub>6</sub> vitamer pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) is drastically reduced in both the <i>smk2</i> embryo and the endosperm. However, whereas embryogenesis of the <i>smk2</i> mutant is arrested at the transition stage, endosperm formation is nearly normal. Cloning reveals that <i>Smk2</i> encodes the glutaminase subunit of the PLP synthase complex involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vitamin</span></strong> B<sub>6</sub> biosynthesis de novo. <i>Smk2</i> partially complements the Arabidopsis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vitamin</span></strong> B<sub>6</sub>-deficient mutant <i>pdx2.1</i> and <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> pyridoxine auxotrophic mutant MML21. <i>Smk2</i> is constitutively expressed in the maize plant, including developing embryos. Analysis of B<sub>6</sub> vitamers indicates that the endosperm accumulates a large amount of pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate (PMP). These results indicate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vitamin</span></strong> B<sub>6</sub> is essential to embryogenesis but has a reduced role in endosperm development in maize. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vitamin</span></strong> B<sub>6</sub> required for seed development is synthesized in the seed, and the endosperm accumulates PMP probably as a storage form of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vitamin</span></strong> B<sub>6</sub>.</p>

The Pepper RING-Type E3 Ligase CaAIRF1 Regulates ABA and Drought Signaling via CaADIP1 Protein Phosphatase Degradation
<p>Ubiquitin-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> modification occurs at multiple steps of abscisic acid (ABA) signaling. Here, we sought <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s responsible for degradation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pepper</span></strong> (<i>Capsicum annuum</i>) type 2C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatase CaADIP1 via the 26S proteasome system. We showed that the RING-type E3 ligase CaAIRF1 (<i>Capsicum annuum</i> ADIP1 Interacting RING Finger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> 1) interacts with and ubiquitinates CaADIP1. CaADIP1 degradation was slower in crude <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s from <i>CaAIRF1</i>-silenced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pepper</span></strong>s than in those from control plants. <i>CaAIRF1</i>-silenced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pepper</span></strong> plants displayed reduced ABA sensitivity and decreased drought tolerance characterized by delayed stomatal closure and suppressed induction of ABA- and drought-responsive marker genes. In contrast, <i>CaAIRF1</i>-overexpressing Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants exhibited ABA-hypersensitive and drought-tolerant phenotypes. Moreover, in these plants, CaADIP1-induced ABA hyposensitivity was strongly suppressed by <i>CaAIRF1</i> overexpression. Our findings highlight a potential new route for fine-tune regulation of ABA signaling in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pepper</span></strong> via CaAIRF1 and CaADIP1.</p>

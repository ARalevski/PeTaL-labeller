Easier cure for resistant TB
<p>A new treatment strategy has had astonishing success against extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR TB), which kills more than 70% of patients. XDR and other drug-resistant forms of TB are burgeoning among people with HIV, and current treatments are so prolonged and toxic that many patients fail to adhere to them. But a small study now shows that a simpler, safer regimen can cure the disease.Â Called Nix-TB, the trial has had 34 people in South Africa with XDR on three antibiotics that have never been combined before to treat TB. After 6 months, the TB bacillus could not be cultured from anyone's sputum, a sign that they had cleared the infection. More impressive, 20 people stopped taking the drugs at that point and none relapsed.</p>

Developmental Decline in Neuronal Regeneration by the Progressive Change of Two Intrinsic Timers
<sec><title>Turn Off Youth</title><p>Our neurons regenerate better when we are young than when we are more mature. Studying the mechanosensory anterior ventral microtubule (AVM) neuron of the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, <bold>Zou <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 372; see the Perspective by <bold>Nix and Bastiani</bold>) found that worms lacking microRNA machinery had unusually robust axon regeneration and youthful-looking growth cones. Under- and overexpression of <i>let-7</i> microRNA confirmed its involvement in depressing axon regeneration.</p></sec>

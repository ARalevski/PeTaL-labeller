Scalable and safe synthetic organic electroreduction inspired by Li-ion battery chemistry
<p>Reductive electrosynthesis has faced long-standing challenges in applications to complex organic substrates at scale. Here, we show how decades of research in lithium-ion battery materials, electrolytes, and additives can serve as an inspiration for achieving practically scalable reductive electrosynthetic conditions for the Birch reduction. Specifically, we demonstrate that using a sacrificial anode material (magnesium or aluminum), combined with a cheap, nontoxic, and water-soluble proton source (dimethylurea), and an overcharge protectant inspired by battery technology [tris(pyrrolidino)phosphoramide] can allow for multigram-scale synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant building blocks. We show how these conditions have a very high level of functional-group tolerance relative to classical electrochemical and chemical dissolving-metal reductions. Finally, we demonstrate that the same electrochemical conditions can be applied to other dissolving metal–type reductive transformations, including McMurry couplings, reductive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">keton</span></strong>e deoxygenations, and epoxide openings.</p>

Interrupted carbonyl-olefin metathesis via oxygen atom transfer
<p>Some of the simplest and most powerful carbon-carbon bond forming strategies take advantage of readily accessible ubiquitous motifs: carbonyls and olefins. Here we report a fundamentally distinct mode of reactivity between carbonyls and olefins that differs from established acid-catalyzed carbonyl-ene, Prins, and carbonyl-olefin metathesis reaction paths. A range of epsilon, zeta-unsaturated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">keton</span></strong>es undergo Brønsted acid–catalyzed intramolecular cyclization to provide tetrahydrofluorene products via the formation of two new carbon-carbon bonds. Theoretical calculations and accompanying mechanistic studies suggest that this carbocyclization reaction proceeds through the intermediacy of a transient oxetane formed by oxygen atom transfer. The complex polycyclic frameworks in this product class appear as common substructures in organic materials, bioactive natural products, and recently developed pharmaceuticals.</p>

Asymmetric phosphoric acid–catalyzed four-component Ugi reaction
<p>The Ugi reaction constructs α-acylaminoamide compounds by combining an aldehyde or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">keton</span></strong>e, an amine, a carboxylic acid, and an isocyanide in a single flask. Its appealing features include inherent atom and step economy together with the potential to generate products of broad structural diversity. However, control of the stereochemistry in this reaction has proven to be a formidable challenge. We describe an efficient enantioselective four-component Ugi reaction catalyzed by a chiral phosphoric acid derivative that delivers more than 80 α-acylaminoamides in good to excellent enantiomeric excess. Experimental and computational studies establish the reaction mechanism and origins of stereoselectivity.</p>

Teaching an old carbocation new tricks: Intermolecular C–H insertion reactions of vinyl cations
<p>Vinyl carbocations have been the subject of extensive experimental and theoretical studies over the past five decades. Despite this long history in chemistry, the utility of vinyl cations in chemical synthesis has been limited, with most reactivity studies focusing on solvolysis reactions or intramolecular processes. Here we report synthetic and mechanistic studies of vinyl cations generated through silylium–weakly coordinating anion catalysis. We find that these reactive intermediates undergo mild intermolecular carbon-carbon bond–forming reactions, including carbon-hydrogen (C–H) insertion into unactivated sp<sup>3</sup> C–H bonds and reductive Friedel-Crafts reactions with arenes. Moreover, we conducted computational studies of these alkane C–H functionalization reactions and discovered that they proceed through nonclassical, ambimodal transition structures. This reaction manifold provides a framework for the catalytic functionalization of hydrocarbons using simple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">keton</span></strong>e derivatives.</p>

MOF-derived cobalt nanoparticles catalyze a general synthesis of amines
<p>The development of base metal catalysts for the synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant compounds remains an important goal of chemical research. Here, we report that cobalt nanoparticles encapsulated by a graphitic shell are broadly effective reductive amination catalysts. Their convenient and practical preparation entailed template assembly of cobalt-diamine-dicarboxylic acid metal organic frameworks on carbon and subsequent pyrolysis under inert atmosphere. The resulting stable and reusable catalysts were active for synthesis of primary, secondary, tertiary, and <i>N</i>-methylamines (more than 140 examples). The reaction couples easily accessible carbonyl compounds (aldehydes and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">keton</span></strong>es) with ammonia, amines, or nitro compounds, and molecular hydrogen under industrially viable and scalable conditions, offering cost-effective access to numerous amines, amino acid derivatives, and more complex drug targets.</p>

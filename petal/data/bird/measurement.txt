Measuring the ratio of CO<sub>2</sub> efflux to O<sub>2</sub> influx in tree stem respiration
<p>In recent studies, the ratio of tree stem CO<sub>2</sub> efflux to O<sub>2</sub> influx has been defined as the apparent respiratory quotient (ARQ). The metabolism of carbohydrates, the putative respiratory substrate in trees, is expected to yield an ARQ of 1.0. However, previous studies have reported ARQ values ranging between 0.23 and 0.90. These interesting results may indicate internal transport of respired CO<sub>2</sub> within stems; yet no simple field applicable methods for ARQ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ement have been available. Here, we report on the assembly of a closed circulating system called ‘<i>Hampadah</i>’, which uses CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> analyzers to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>e air samples from stem chambers. We tested the performance of the <i>Hampadah</i> with samples from 36 trees (<i>Tetragastris panamensis</i> (Engl.) Kuntze). Additionally, we showed the feasibility of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ing ARQ directly from stem chambers, using portable CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> sensors, in both discrete and continuous modes of operation. The <i>Hampadah</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ement <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prove</span></strong>d to be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">consist</span></strong>ent with CO<sub>2</sub> gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>s (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.999) and with O<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>ed by O<sub>2</sub>/Ar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ements with a mass spectrometer (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.998). The <i>Hampadah</i> gave highly reproducible results for ARQ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>ation of field samples (±0.01 for duplicates). The portable sensors <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ement showed good correlation with the <i>Hampadah</i> in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ing CO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub> and ARQ (<i>n</i> = 5, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.97, 0.98 and 0.91, respectively). We have demonstrated here that the <i>Hampadah</i> and the sensors’ methods enable accurate ARQ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ements for both laboratory and field research.</p>

An analysis of the best method for evaluating anteversion of the acetabular component after total hip replacement on plain radiographs
<p>Several radiological methods of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ing anteversion   of the acetabular component after total hip replacement (THR) have   been described. These studies used different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">definit</span></strong>ions and reference   planes to compare methods, allowing for misinterpretation of the   results.

Fasting Versus Nonfasting and Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Accuracy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Recent recommendations favoring nonfasting lipid assessment may affect low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ation. The novel method of LDL-C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ation (LDL-C<sub>N</sub>) uses a flexible approach to derive patient-specific ratios of triglycerides to very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. This adaptability may confer an accuracy advantage in nonfasting patients over the fixed approach of the classic Friedewald method (LDL-C<sub>F</sub>).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used a US cross-sectional sample of 1 545  634 patients (959 153 fasting ≥10–12 hours; 586 481 nonfasting) from the second harvest of the Very Large Database of Lipids study to assess for the first time the impact of fasting status on novel LDL-C accuracy. Rapid ultracentrifugation was used to directly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>e LDL-C content (LDL-C<sub>D</sub>). Accuracy was defined as the percentage of LDL-C<sub>D</sub> falling within an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated LDL-C (LDL-C<sub>N</sub> or LDL-C<sub>F</sub>) category by clinical cut points. For low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated LDL-C (<70 mg/dL), we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated accuracy by triglyceride levels. The magnitude of absolute and percent differences between LDL-C<sub>D</sub> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated LDL-C (LDL-C<sub>N</sub> or LDL-C<sub>F</sub>) was stratified by LDL-C and triglyceride categories.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In both fasting and nonfasting samples, accuracy was higher with the novel method across all clinical LDL-C categories (range, 87%–94%) compared with the Friedewald <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ation (range, 71%–93%; <i>P</i>≤0.001). With LDL-C <70 mg/dL, nonfasting LDL-C<sub>N</sub> accuracy (92%) was superior to LDL-C<sub>F</sub> accuracy (71%; <i>P</i><0.001). In this LDL-C range, 19% of fasting and 30% of nonfasting patients had differences ≥10 mg/dL between LDL-C<sub>F</sub> and LDL-C<sub>D</sub>, whereas only 2% and 3% of patients, respectively, had similar differences with novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ation. Accuracy of LDL-C <70 mg/dL further decreased as triglycerides increased, particularly for Friedewald <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ation (range, 37%–96%) versus the novel method (range, 82%–94%). With triglycerides of 200 to 399 mg/dL in nonfasting patients, LDL-C<sub>N</sub> <70 mg/dL accuracy (82%) was superior to LDL-C<sub>F</sub> (37%; <i>P</i><0.001).

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Measurement of Gross Photosynthesis, Respiration in the Light, and Mesophyll Conductance Using H<sub>2</sub><sup>18</sup>O Labeling
<p>A fundamental challenge in plant physiology is independently <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>ing the rates of gross O<sub>2</sub> production by photosynthesis and O<sub>2</sub> consumption by respiration, photorespiration, and other processes. Previous studies on isolated chloroplasts or leaves have separately constrained net and gross O<sub>2</sub> production (NOP and GOP, respectively) by labeling ambient O<sub>2</sub> with <sup>18</sup>O while leaf water was unlabeled. Here, we describe a method to accurately <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>e GOP and NOP of whole detached leaves in a cuvette as a routine gas-exchange <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ement. The petiole is immersed in water enriched to a δ<sup>18</sup>O of ∼9,000‰, and leaf water is labeled through the transpiration stream. Photosynthesis transfers <sup>18</sup>O from H<sub>2</sub>O to O<sub>2</sub>. GOP is calculated from the increase in δ<sup>18</sup>O of O<sub>2</sub> as air passes through the cuvette. NOP is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>ed from the increase in O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>. Both terms are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ed by isotope ratio mass spectrometry. CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation and other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> gas-exchange parameters also were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ed. Reproducible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ements are made on a single leaf for more than 15 h. We used this method to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>e the light response curve of NOP and GOP in French bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>) at 21% and 2% O<sub>2</sub>. We then used these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">examin</span></strong>e the O<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> ratio of net photosynthesis, the light response curve of mesophyll conductance, and the apparent inhibition of respiration in the light (Kok effect) at both oxygen levels. The results are discussed in the context of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ating the technique as a tool to study and understand leaf physiological traits.</p>

The limits of applicability of the sound exposure level (SEL) metric to temporal threshold shifts (TTS) in beluga whales, <i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>
<p>The influence of fatiguing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong> level and duration on post-exposure temporary threshold shift (TTS) was investigated in two beluga whales (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>). The fatiguing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong> was half-octave noise with a center frequency of 22.5 kHz. TTS was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ed at a test frequency of 32 kHz. Thresholds were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ed by recording rhythmic evoked potentials (the envelope following response) to a test series of short (eight cycles) tone pips with a pip rate of 1000 s<sup>−1</sup>. TTS increased approximately proportionally to the dB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>e of both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong> pressure (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong> pressure level, SPL) and duration of the fatiguing noise, as a product of these two variables. In particular, when the noise parameters varied in a manner that maintained the product of squared <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong> pressure and time (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong> exposure level, SEL, which is equivalent to the overall noise energy) at a constant level, TTS was not constant. Keeping SEL constant, the highest TTS appeared at an intermediate ratio of SPL to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong> duration and decreased at both higher and lower ratios. Multiplication (SPL multiplied by log duration) better described the experimental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> than an equal-energy (equal SEL) model. The use of SEL as a sole universal metric may result in an implausible assessment of the impact of a fatiguing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong> on hearing thresholds in odontocetes, including under-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ation of potential risks.</p>

Dynamic Edematous Response of the Human Heart to Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Clinical protocols aimed to characterize the post–myocardial infarction (MI) heart by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) need to be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>ized to take ac<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">count</span></strong> of dynamic biological phenomena evolving early after the index ischemic event. Here, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated the time course of edema reaction in patients with ST-segment–elevation MI by CMR and assessed its implications for myocardium-at-risk (MaR) quantification both in patients and in a large-animal model.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A total of 16 patients with anterior ST-segment–elevation MI successfully treated by primary angioplasty and 16 matched controls were prospectively recruited. In total, 94 clinical CMR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">examin</span></strong>ations were performed: patients with ST-segment–elevation MI were serially scanned (within the first 3 hours after reperfusion and at 1, 4, 7, and 40 days), and controls were scanned only once. T2 relaxation time in the myocardium (T2 mapping) and the extent of edema on T2-weighted short-tau triple inversion-recovery (ie, CMR-MaR) were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated at all time points. In the experimental study, 20 pigs underwent 40-minute ischemia/reperfusion followed by serial CMR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">examin</span></strong>ations at 120 minutes and 1, 4, and 7 days after reperfusion.

Consequently, edema extent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ed by T2-weighted short-tau triple inversion-recovery (CMR-MaR) varied with the timing of the CMR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">examin</span></strong>ation. These findings were confirmed in the experimental model by showing that only CMR-MaR values for day 4 and day 7 postreperfusion, coinciding with the deferred edema wave, were similar to values <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ed by reference contrast-multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>or computed tomography.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Post-MI edema in patients follows a bimodal pattern that affects CMR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ates of MaR.

Measurement of a superconducting qubit with a microwave photon counter
<p>Fast, high-fidelity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ement is a key ingredient for quantum error correction. Conventional approaches to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ement of superconducting qubits, involving linear amplification of a microwave probe tone followed by heterodyne <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ion at room temperature, do not scale well to large system sizes. We introduce an approach to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ement based on a microwave photon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">count</span></strong>er demonstrating raw single-shot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ement fidelity of 92%. Moreover, the intrinsic damping of the photon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">count</span></strong>er is used to extract the energy released by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ement process, allowing repeated high-fidelity quantum nondemolition <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ements. Our scheme provides access to the classical outcome of projective quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ement at the millikelvin stage and could form the basis for a scalable quantum-to-classical interface.</p>

The metabolic cost of communicative sound production in bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>)
<p>Bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>) produce various communicative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong>s that are important for social behavior, maintaining group cohesion and coordinating foraging. For example, whistle production increases during disturbances, such as separations of mother–calf pairs and vessel approaches. It is clear that acoustic communication is important to the survival of these marine mammals, yet the metabolic cost of producing whistles and other socials <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong>s and the energetic consequences of modifying these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong>s in response to both natural and anthropogenic disturbance are unknown. We used flow-through respirometry to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>e whether the metabolic cost of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong> production could be quantified in two captive dolphins producing social <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong>s (whistles and squawks). On average, we found that metabolic rates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ed during 2 min periods of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong> production were 1.2 times resting values. Up to 7 min were required for metabolism to return to resting values following vocal periods. The total metabolic cost (over resting values) of the 2 min vocal period plus the required recovery period (163.3 to 2995.9 ml O<sub>2</sub> or 3279.6 to 60,166.7 J) varied by individual as well as by mean duration of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong>s produced within the vocal period. Observed variation in received cumulative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong> energy levels of vocalizations was not related to total metabolic costs. Furthermore, our empirical findings did not agree with previous theoretical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ates of the metabolic cost of whistles. This study provides the first empirical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> on the metabolic cost of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong> production in dolphins, which can be used to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ate metabolic costs of vocal responses to environmental perturbations in wild dolphins.</p>

Prevalence and Predictors of Cholesterol Screening, Awareness, and Statin Treatment Among US Adults With Familial Hypercholesterolemia or Other Forms of Severe Dyslipidemia (1999–2014)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and other extreme elevations in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol significantly increase the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; however, recent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> suggest that prescription rates for statins remain low in these patients. National rates of screening, awareness, and treatment with statins among individuals with FH or severe dyslipidemia are unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> from the 1999 to 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were used to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ate prevalence rates of self-reported screening, awareness, and statin therapy among US adults (n=42 471 weighted to represent 212 million US adults) with FH (defined using the Dutch Lipid Clinic criteria) and with severe dyslipidemia (defined as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels ≥190 mg/dL). Logistic regression was used to identify sociodemographic and clinical correlates of hypercholesterolemia awareness and statin therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated US prevalence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">definit</span></strong>e/probable FH was 0.47% (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> error, 0.03%) and of severe dyslipidemia was 6.6% (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> error, 0.2%). The frequency of cholesterol screening and awareness was high (>80%) among adults with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">definit</span></strong>e/probable FH or severe dyslipidemia; however, statin use was uniformly low (52.3% [<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> error, 8.2%] of adults with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">definit</span></strong>e/probable FH and 37.6% [<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> error, 1.2%] of adults with severe dyslipidemia). Only 30.3% of patients with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">definit</span></strong>e/probable FH on statins were taking a high-intensity statin. The prevalence of statin use in adults with severe dyslipidemia increased over time (from 29.4% to 47.7%) but not faster than trends in the general population (from 5.7% to 17.6%). Older age, health insurance status, having a usual source of care, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and having a personal history of early atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease were associated with higher statin use.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Despite the high prevalence of cholesterol screening and awareness, only ≈50% of adults with FH are on statin therapy, with even fewer prescribed a high-intensity statin; young and uninsured patients are at the highest risk for lack of screening and for undertreatment. This study highlights an imperative to im<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prove</span></strong> the frequency of cholesterol screening and statin prescription rates to better identify and treat this high-risk population. Additional studies are needed to better understand how to close these gaps in screening and treatment.</p></sec>

Use of a Single Baseline Versus Multiyear 24-Hour Urine Collection for Estimation of Long-Term Sodium Intake and Associated Cardiovascular and Renal Risk
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>A decrease in sodium intake has been shown to lower blood pressure, but <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> from cohort studies on the association with cardiovascular and renal outcomes are in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">consist</span></strong>ent. In these studies, sodium intake was often <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated with a single baseline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ement, which may be inaccurate considering day-to-day changes in sodium intake and sodium excretion. We compared the effects of single versus repetitive follow-up 24-hour urine samples on the relation between sodium intake and long-term cardiorenal outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We selected adult subjects with an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated glomerular filtration rate >60 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>, an outpatient 24-hour urine sample between 1998 and 1999, and at least 1 collection during a 17-year follow-up.

We used Cox regression analysis and the landmark approach to investigate the relation between sodium intake and cardiovascular (cardiovascular events or mortality) and renal (end-stage renal disease: dialysis, transplantation, and/or >60% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated glomerular filtration rate decline, or mortality) outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We included 574 subjects with 9776 twenty-four–hour urine samples.

Phylogenetic Signal Variation in the Genomes of <i>Medicago</i> (Fabaceae)
<p>Genome-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> offer the opportunity to clarify phylogenetic relationships that are difficult to resolve with few loci, but they can also identify genomic regions with evolutionary history distinct from that of the species history. We collected whole-genome sequence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> from 29 taxa in the legume genus <i>Medicago</i>, then aligned these sequences to the <i>Medicago truncatula</i> reference genome to confidently identify 87 596 variable homologous sites. We used this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> set to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ate phylogenetic relationships among <i>Medicago</i> species, to investigate the number of sites needed to provide robust phylogenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ates and to identify specific genomic regions supporting topologies in conflict with the genome-wide phylogeny. Our full genomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> set resolves relationships within the genus that were previously intractable. Subsampling the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> reveals considerable variation in phylogenetic signal and power in smaller subsets of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong>. Even when sampling 5000 sites, no random sample of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> supports a topology identical to that of the genome-wide phylogeny. Phylogenetic relationships <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated from 500-site sliding windows revealed genome regions supporting several alternative species relationships among recently diverged taxa, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">consist</span></strong>ent with the expected effects of deep coalescence or introgression in the recent history of <i>Medicago</i>.

High-Throughput Phenotyping of Maize Leaf Physiological and Biochemical Traits Using Hyperspectral Reflectance
<p>High-throughput, noninvasive field phenotyping has revealed genetic variation in crop morphological, developmental, and agronomic traits, but rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ements of the underlying physiological and biochemical traits are needed to fully understand genetic variation in plant-environment interactions. This study tested the application of leaf hyperspectral reflectance (λ = 500–2,400 nm) as a high-throughput phenotyping approach for rapid and accurate assessment of leaf photosynthetic and biochemical traits in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). Leaf traits were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ed with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> wet-laboratory and gas-exchange approaches alongside <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ements of leaf reflectance. Partial least-squares regression was used to develop a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>e of leaf chlorophyll content, nitrogen content, sucrose content, specific leaf area, maximum rate of phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate carboxylation, [CO<sub>2</sub>]-saturated rate of photosynthesis, and leaf oxygen radical absorbance capacity from leaf reflectance spectra. Partial least-squares regression models accurately predicted five out of seven traits and were more accurate than previously used simple spectral indices for leaf chlorophyll, nitrogen content, and specific leaf area. Correlations among leaf traits and statistical inferences about differences among genotypes and treatments were similar for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ed and modeled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong>. The hyperspectral reflectance approach to phenotyping was dramatically faster than traditional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ements, enabling over 1,000 rows to be phenotyped during midday hours over just 2 to 4 d, and offers a nondestructive method to accurately assess physiological and biochemical trait responses to environmental stress.</p>

Discovering relationships between nuclear receptor signaling pathways, genes, and tissues in Transcriptomine
<p>We previously developed a web tool, Transcriptomine, to explore expression profiling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> sets involving small-molecule or genetic manipulations of nuclear receptor signaling pathways. We describe advances in biocuration, query interface design, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> visualization that enhance the discovery of uncharacterized biology in these pathways using this tool. Transcriptomine currently contains about 45 million <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> points encompassing more than 2000 experiments in a reference library of nearly 550 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> sets retrieved from public archives and systematically curated. To make the underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> points more accessible to bench biologists, we classified experimental small molecules and gene manipulations into signaling pathways and experimental tissues and cell lines into physiological systems and organs. Incorporation of these mappings into Transcriptomine enables the user to readily <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ate tissue-specific regulation of gene expression by nuclear receptor signaling pathways. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> points from animal and cell model experiments and from clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> sets elucidate the roles of nuclear receptor pathways in gene expression events accompanying various normal and pathological cellular processes. In addition, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> sets targeting non-nuclear receptor signaling pathways highlight transcriptional cross-talk between nuclear receptors and other signaling pathways. We demonstrate with specific examples how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> points that exist in isolation in individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> sets validate each other when connected and made accessible to the user in a single interface. In summary, Transcriptomine allows bench biologists to routinely develop research hypotheses, validate experimental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong>, or model relationships between signaling pathways, genes, and tissues.</p>

Light Sheet Microscopy Imaging of Light Absorption and Photosynthesis Distribution in Plant Tissue
<p>In vivo variable chlorophyll fluorescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ements of photosystem II (PSII) quantum yields in optically dense systems are complicated by steep tissue light gradients due to scattering and absorption. Consequently, externally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ed effective PSII quantum yields may be composed of signals derived from cells differentially exposed to actinic light, where cells located deeper inside tissues receive lower irradiance than cells closer to the surface and can display distinct photophysiological status. We demonstrate how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ed distributions of PSII quantum yields in plant tissue change under natural tissue light gradients as compared with conventionally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ed quantum yields with even exposure to actinic light. This was achieved by applying actinic irradiance perpendicular to one side of thallus cross sections of the aquatic macrophyte <i>Fucus vesiculosus</i> with laser light sheets of defined spectral composition, while imaging variable chlorophyll fluorescence from cross sections with a microscope-mounted pulse amplitude-modulated imaging system. We show that quantum yields are highly affected by light gradients and that traditional surface-based variable chlorophyll fluorescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ements result in substantial under<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ations and/or over<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ations, depending on incident actinic irradiance. We present a method for using chlorophyll fluorescence profiles in combination with integrating sphere <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ements of reflectance and transmittance to calculate depth-resolved photon absorption profiles, which can be used to correct apparent PSII electron transport rates to photons absorbed by PSII. Absorption profiles of the investigated aquatic macrophyte were different in shape from what is typically observed in terrestrial leaves, and based on this finding, we discuss strategies for optimizing photon absorption via modulation of the structural organization of phytoelements according to in situ light environments.</p>

<i>pheno</i>Seeder - A Robot System for Automated Handling and Phenotyping of Individual Seeds
<p>The enormous diversity of seed traits is an intriguing feature and critical for the overwhelming success of higher plants. In particular, seed mass is generally regarded to be key for seedling development but is mostly approximated by using scanning methods delivering only two-dimensional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong>, often termed seed size. However, three-dimensional traits, such as the volume or mass of single seeds, are very rarely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>ed in routine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ements. Here, we introduce a device named <i>pheno</i>Seeder, which enables the handling and phenotyping of individual seeds of very different sizes. The system <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">consist</span></strong>s of a pick-and-place robot and a modular setup of sensors that can be versatilely extended. Basic biometric traits <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ed for individual seeds are two-dimensional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> from projections, three-dimensional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> from volumetric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>es, and mass, from which seed density is also calculated. Each seed is tracked by an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>er and, after phenotyping, can be planted, sorted, or individually stored for further <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ation or processing (e.g. in routine seed-to-plant tracking pipelines). By investigating seeds of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), rapeseed (<i>Brassica napus</i>), and barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), we observed that, even for apparently round-shaped seeds of rapeseed, correlations between the projected area and the mass of seeds were much weaker than between volume and mass. This indicates that simple projections may not deliver good proxies for seed mass. Although throughput is limited, we expect that automated seed phenotyping on a single-seed basis can contribute valuable information for applications in a wide range of wild or crop species, including seed classification, seed sorting, and assessment of seed quality.</p>

TCS: A New Multiple Sequence Alignment Reliability Measure to Estimate Alignment Accuracy and Improve Phylogenetic Tree Reconstruction
<p>Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is a key modeling procedure when analyzing biological sequences. Homology and evolutionary modeling are the most common applications of MSAs. Both are known to be sensitive to the underlying MSA accuracy. In this work, we show how this problem can be partly overcome using the transitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">consist</span></strong>ency score (TCS), an extended version of the T-Coffee scoring scheme. Using this local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ation function, we show that one can identify the most reliable portions of an MSA, as judged from BAliBASE and PREFAB structure-based reference alignments. We also show how this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>e can be used to im<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prove</span></strong> phylogenetic tree reconstruction using both an established simulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> set and a novel empirical yeast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> set. For this purpose, we describe a novel lossless alternative to site filtering that involves overweighting the trustworthy columns. Our approach relies on the T-Coffee framework; it uses libraries of pairwise alignments to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ate any third party MSA. Pairwise projections can be produced using fast or slow methods, thus allowing a trade-off between speed and accuracy. We compared TCS with Heads-or-Tails, GUIDANCE, Gblocks, and trimAl and found it to lead to significantly better <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ates of structural accuracy and more accurate phylogenetic trees. The software is available from <ext-link>www.tcoffee.org/Projects/tcs</ext-link>.</p>

Vocal production complexity correlates with neural instructions in the oyster toadfish (<i>Opsanus tau</i>)
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong> communication is fundamental to many social interactions and essential to courtship and agonistic behaviours in many vertebrates. The swimbladder and associated muscles in batrachoidid fishes (midshipman and toadfish) is a unique vertebrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong> production system, wherein fundamental frequencies are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>ed directly by the firing rate of a vocal-acoustic neural network that drives the contraction frequency of superfast swimbladder muscles. The oyster toadfish boatwhistle call starts with an irregular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong> waveform that could be an emergent property of the peripheral nonlinear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong>-producing system or reflect complex encoding in the central nervous system. Here, we demonstrate that the start of the boatwhistle is indicative of a chaotic strange attractor, and tested whether its origin lies in the peripheral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong>-producing system or in the vocal motor network. We recorded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong> and swimbladder muscle activity in awake, freely behaving toadfish during motor nerve stimulation, and recorded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong>, motor nerve and muscle activity during spontaneous grunts. The results show that rhythmic motor volleys do not cause complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong> signals. However, arrhythmic recruitment of swimbladder muscle during spontaneous grunts correlates with complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong>s. This supports the hypothesis that the irregular start of the boatwhistle is encoded in the vocal pre-motor neural network, and not caused by peripheral interactions with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong>-producing system. We suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong> production system demands across vocal tetrapods have selected for muscles and motorneurons adapted for speed, which can execute complex neural instructions into equivalently complex vocalisations.</p>

Spatial entanglement patterns and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering in Bose-Einstein condensates
<p>Many-particle entanglement is a fundamental concept of quantum physics that still presents conceptual challenges.

Here, we use high-resolution imaging to directly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>e the spin correlations between spatially separated parts of a spin-squeezed Bose-Einstein condensate. We observe entanglement that is strong enough for Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering: We can predict <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ement outcomes for noncommuting observables in one spatial region on the basis of corresponding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ements in another region with an inferred uncertainty product below the Heisenberg uncertainty bound. This method could be exploited for entanglement-enhanced imaging of electromagnetic field distributions and quantum information tasks.</p>

Quantum correlations from a room-temperature optomechanical cavity
<p>The act of position <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ement alters the motion of an object being <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ed. This quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ement backaction is typically much smaller than the thermal motion of a room-temperature object and thus difficult to observe. By shining laser light through a nanomechanical beam, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>e the beam’s thermally driven vibrations and perturb its motion with optical force fluctuations at a level dictated by the Heisenberg <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ement-disturbance uncertainty relation. We demonstrate a cross-correlation technique to distinguish optically driven motion from thermally driven motion, observing this quantum backaction signature up to room temperature. We use the scale of the quantum correlations, which is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>ed by fundamental constants, to gauge the size of thermal motion, demonstrating a path toward absolute thermometry with quantum mechanically calibrated ticks.</p>

Baseline hearing abilities and variability in wild beluga whales (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>)
<p>While hearing is the primary sensory modality for odontocetes, there are few <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> addressing variation within a natural population. This work describes the hearing ranges (4–150 kHz) and sensitivities of seven apparently healthy, wild beluga whales (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>) during a population health assessment project that captured and released belugas in Bristol Bay, Alaska. The baseline hearing abilities and subsequent variations were addressed. Hearing was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ed using auditory evoked potentials (AEPs). All audiograms showed a typical cetacean U-shape; substantial variation (>30 dB) was found between most and least sensitive thresholds. All animals heard well, up to at least 128 kHz. Two heard up to 150 kHz. Lowest auditory thresholds (35–45 dB) were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed in the range 45–80 kHz. Greatest differences in hearing abilities occurred at both the high end of the auditory range and at frequencies of maximum sensitivity. In general, wild beluga hearing was quite sensitive. Hearing abilities were similar to those of belugas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ed in zoological settings, reinforcing the comparative importance of both settings. The relative degree of variability across the wild belugas suggests that audiograms from multiple individuals are needed to properly describe the maximum sensitivity and population variance for odontocetes. Hearing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>es were easily incorporated into field-based settings. This detailed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">examin</span></strong>ation of hearing abilities in wild Bristol Bay belugas provides a basis for a better understanding of the potential impact of anthropogenic noise on a noise-sensitive species. Such information may help design noise-limiting mitigation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>es that could be applied to areas heavily influenced and inhabited by endangered belugas.</p>

<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to assess the reproducibility and validity   of cross table radiographs for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ing the anteversion of the   acetabular component after total hip arthroplasty (THA) and to compare   it with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ements using CT scans.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 29 patients who underwent THA between June 2010 and   January 2016 were included. There were 17 men and 12 women. Their   mean age was 43 years (26 to 65). Seven patients underwent a bilateral   procedure. Thus, 36 THAs were included in the study. Lateral radiographs   and CT scans were obtained post-operatively and radiographs repeated   three weeks later. The anteversion of the acetabular component was   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ed using the method described by Woo and Morrey and the ischiolateral   method described by Pulos et al and these were compared with the   results obtained from CT scans.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean anteversion was 18.35° (3° to 38°) using Woo and Morrey’s   method, 51.45° (30° to 85°) using the ischiolateral method and 21.22°   (2° to 48°) using CT scans. The Pearson correlation coefficient   was 0.754 for Woo and Morrey’s method and 0.925 for the ischiolateral   method. There was a linear correlation between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ements   using the ischiolateral method and those using CT scans. We derived   a simple linear equation between the value of the CT scan and that   of ischiolateral method to deduce the CT scan value from that of ischiolateral   method and <i>vice versa</i>. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The anteversion of the acetabular component <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ed using both   plain radiographic methods was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">consist</span></strong>ently valid with good interobserver   reproducibility, but the ischiolateral method which is independent   of pelvic tilt was more accurate. As CT is costly, associated with   a high dose of radiation and not readily available, the ischiolateral method   can be used for assessing the anteversion of the acetabular component.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1006–11.</p></sec>

Cardiac Implantable Electronic Device Interrogation at Forensic Autopsy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Postmortem interrogations of cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs), recommended at autopsy in suspected cases of sudden cardiac death, are rarely performed, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> on systematic postmortem CIED analysis in the forensic pathology are missing. The aim of the study was to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>e whether nonselective postmortem CIED interrogations and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> analysis are useful to the forensic pathologist to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>e the cause, mechanism, and time of death and to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong> potential CIED-related safety issues.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>From February 2012 to April 2017, all autopsy subjects in the department of forensic medicine at the University Hospital Charité who had a CIED underwent device removal and interrogation. Over the study period, 5368 autopsies were performed. One hundred fifty subjects had in total 151 CIEDs, including 109 pacemakers, 35 defibrillators, and 7 implantable loop recorders.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In 40 cases (26.7%) time of death and in 51 cases (34.0%) cause of death could not be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>ed by forensic autopsy. Of these, CIED interrogation facilitated the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>ation of time of death in 70.0% of the cases and clarified the cause of death in 60.8%. Device concerns were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed in 9 cases (6.0%), including 3 hardware, 4 programming, and 2 algorithm issues. One CIED was submitted to the manufacturer for a detailed technical analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> demonstrate the necessity of systematic postmortem CIED interrogation in forensic medicine to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>e the cause and timing of death more accurately.

Prospective Countywide Surveillance and Autopsy Characterization of Sudden Cardiac Death
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Studies of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death (SCD) use emergency medical services records, death certificates, or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">definit</span></strong>ions that infer cause of death; thus, the true incidence of SCD is unknown. Over 90% of SCDs occur out-of-hospital; nonforensic autopsies are rarely performed, and therefore causes of death are presumed. We conducted a medical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">examin</span></strong>er–based investigation to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>e the precise incidence and autopsy-defined causes of all SCDs in an entire metropolitan area. We hypothesized that postmortem investigation would identify actual sudden arrhythmic deaths among presumed SCDs.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Between February 1, 2011, and March 1, 2014, we prospectively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed all incident deaths attributed to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (emergency medical services primary impression, cardiac arrest) between 18 to 90 years of age in San Francisco <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">count</span></strong>y for autopsy, toxicology, and histology via medical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">examin</span></strong>er surveillance of consecutive out-of-hospital deaths, all reported by law. We obtained comprehensive records to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>e whether out-of-hospital cardiac arrest deaths met World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for SCD. We reviewed death certificates filed quarterly for missed SCDs. Autopsy-defined sudden arrhythmic deaths had no extracardiac cause of death or acute heart failure. A multidisciplinary committee adjudicated final cause.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>All 20 440 deaths were reviewed; 12 671 were unattended and reported to the medical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">examin</span></strong>er. From these, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed 912 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest deaths; 541 (59%) met WHO SCD criteria (mean 62.8 years, 69% male) and 525 (97%) were autopsied. Eighty-nine additional WHO-defined SCDs occurred within 3 weeks of active medical care with the death certificate signed by the attending physician, ineligible for autopsy but included in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">count</span></strong>ywide WHO-defined SCD incidence of 29.6/100 000 person-years, highest in black men (<i>P</i><0.0001). Of 525 WHO-defined SCDs, 301 (57%) had no cardiac history. Leading causes of death were coronary disease (32%), occult overdose (13.5%), cardiomyopathy (10%), cardiac hypertrophy (8%), and neurological (5.5%). Autopsy-defined sudden arrhythmic deaths were 55.8% (293/525) of overall, 65% (78/120) of witnessed, and 53% (215/405) of unwitnessed WHO-defined SCDs (<i>P</i>=0.024); 286 of 293 (98%) had structural cardiac disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Forty percent of deaths attributed to stated cardiac arrest were not sudden or unexpected, and nearly half of presumed SCDs were not arrhythmic. These findings have implications for the accuracy of SCDs as defined by WHO criteria or emergency medical services records in aggregate mortality <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong>, clinical trials, and cohort studies.</p></sec>

Association Between Hospital Volume, Processes of Care, and Outcomes in Patients Admitted With Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Hospital volume is frequently used as a structural metric for assessing quality of care, but its utility in patients admitted with acute heart failure (HF) is not well characterized. Accordingly, we sought to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>e the relationship between admission volume, process-of-care metrics, and short- and long-term outcomes in patients admitted with acute HF.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients enrolled in the Get With The Guidelines-HF registry with linked Medicare inpatient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> at 342 hospitals were assessed. Volume was assessed both as a continuous variable, and quartiles based on the admitting hospital annual HF case volume, as well: 5 to 38 (quartile 1), 39 to 77 (quartile 2), 78 to 122 (quartile 3), 123 to 457 (quartile 4). The main outcome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>es were (1) process <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>es at discharge (achievement of HF achievement, quality, reporting, and composite metrics); (2) 30-day mortality and hospital readmission; and (3) 6-month mortality and hospital readmission. Adjusted logistic and Cox proportional hazards models were used to study these associations with hospital volume.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 125 595 patients with HF were included. Patients admitted to high-volume hospitals had a higher burden of comorbidities. On multivariable modeling, lower-volume hospitals were significantly less likely to be adherent to HF process <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>es than higher-volume hospitals. Higher hospital volume was not associated with a difference in in-hospital (odds ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.94–1.05; <i>P</i>=0.78) or 30-day mortality (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.97–1.01; <i>P</i>=0.26), or 30-day readmissions (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.97–1.00; <i>P</i>=0.10). There was a weak association of higher volumes with lower 6-month mortality (hazard ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97–0.99; <i>P</i>=0.001) and lower 6-month all-cause readmissions (hazard ratio, 0.98; 95%, CI 0.97–1.00; <i>P</i>=0.025).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our analysis of a large contemporary prospective national quality im<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prove</span></strong>ment registry of older patients with HF indicates that hospital volume as a structural metric correlates with process <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>es, but not with 30-day outcomes, and only marginally with outcomes up to 6 months of follow-up.

Role of Diastolic Stress Testing in the Evaluation for Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is challenging and relies largely on demonstration of elevated cardiac filling pressures (pulmonary capillary wedge pressure).

Analyses were restricted to 1016 participants who completed ambulatory BP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monitor</span></strong>ing at baseline in 2000 to 2004. Mean SBP and DBP levels were calculated for daytime (10:00 am–8:00 pm), 24-hour (all available readings), and nighttime (midnight–6:00 am) periods, separately. Daytime, 24-hour, and nighttime BP thresholds for ambulatory hypertension were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed using regression- and outcome-derived approaches. The composite of a cardiovascular disease or an all-cause mortality event was used in the outcome-derived approach.

The general-use patients had an area under the curve of −32.8 mm Hg-day at the 1-month time mark, −156.2 mm Hg-day at the 3-month time mark, and −434.0 mm Hg-day after 6 months of hemodynamic guided care, which was significantly lower than the treatment group in the CHAMPION trial.

Ranking Businesses and Municipal Locations by Spatiotemporal Cardiac Arrest Risk to Guide Public Defibrillator Placement
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Efforts to guide automated external defibrillator placement for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) treatment have focused on identifying broadly defined location categories without considering hours of operation. Broad location categories may be composed of many businesses with varying accessibility. Identifying specific locations for automated external defibrillator deployment incorporating operating hours and time of OHCA occurrence may im<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prove</span></strong> automated external defibrillator accessibility. We aim to identify specific businesses and municipal locations that maximize OHCA coverage on the basis of spatiotemporal assessment of OHCA risk in the immediate vicinity of franchise locations.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This study was a retrospective population-based cohort study using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> from the Toronto Regional RescuNET Epistry cardiac arrest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong>base. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed all nontraumatic public OHCAs occurring in Toronto, ON, Canada, from January 2007 through December 2015. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed 41 unique businesses and municipal location types with ≥20 locations in Toronto from the YellowPages, Canadian Franchise Association, and the City of Toronto Open <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> Portal. We obtained their geographic coordinates and hours of operation from Web sites, by phone, or in person. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>ed the number of OHCAs that occurred within 100 m of each location when it was open (spatiotemporal coverage) for Toronto overall and downtown. The businesses and municipal locations were then ranked by spatiotemporal OHCA coverage. To <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ate temporal stability of the rankings, we calculated intraclass correlation of the annual coverage values.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>There were 2654 nontraumatic public OHCAs. Tim Hortons ranked first in Toronto, covering 286 OHCAs. Starbucks ranked first in downtown, covering 110 OHCAs. Coffee shops and bank machines from the 5 largest Canadian banks occupied 8 of the top 10 spots in both Toronto and downtown. The rankings exhibited high temporal stability with intraclass correlation values of 0.88 (95% confidence interval, 0.83–0.93) in Toronto and 0.79 (95% confidence interval, 0.71–0.86) in downtown.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed and ranked businesses and municipal locations by spatiotemporal OHCA risk in their immediate vicinity.

Echocardiographic Screening for Rheumatic Heart Disease in High and Low Risk Australian Children
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Echocardiographic screening for rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is becoming more widespread, but screening studies to date have used different echocardiographic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">definit</span></strong>ions. The World Heart Federation has recently published new criteria for the echocardiographic diagnosis of RHD. We aimed to establish the prevalence of RHD in high-risk Indigenous Australian children using these criteria and to compare the findings with a group of Australian children at low risk for RHD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Portable echocardiography was performed on high-risk Indigenous children aged 5 to15 years living in remote communities of northern Australia. A comparison group of low-risk, non-Indigenous children living in urban centers was also screened. Echocardiograms were reported in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>ized, blinded fashion. Of 3946 high-risk children, 34 met World Heart Federation criteria for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">definit</span></strong>e RHD (prevalence, 8.6 per 1000 [95% confidence interval, 6.0–12.0]) and 66 for borderline RHD (prevalence, 16.7 per 1000 [95% confidence interval, 13.0–21.2]). Of 1053 low-risk children, none met the criteria for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">definit</span></strong>e RHD, and 5 met the criteria for borderline RHD. High-risk children were more likely to have <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">definit</span></strong>e or borderline RHD than low-risk children (adjusted odds ratio, 5.7 [95% confidence interval, 2.3–14.1]; <i>P</i><0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>The prevalence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">definit</span></strong>e RHD in high-risk Indigenous Australian children approximates what we expected in our population, and no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">definit</span></strong>e RHD was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed in the low-risk group.

Integrated in vivo multiomics analysis identifies p21-activated kinase signaling as a driver of colitis
<p>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic disorder of the gastrointestinal tract that has limited treatment options. To gain insight into the pathogenesis of chronic colonic inflammation (colitis), we performed a multiomics analysis that integrated RNA microarray, total protein mass spectrometry (MS), and phosphoprotein MS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ements from a mouse model of the disease. Because we collected all three types of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> from individual samples, we tracked information flow from RNA to protein to phosphoprotein and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed signaling molecules that were coordinately or discordantly regulated and pathways that had complex regulation in vivo. For example, the genes encoding acute-phase proteins were expressed in the liver, but the proteins were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ed by MS in the colon during inflammation. We also ascertained the types of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> that best described particular facets of chronic inflammation. Using gene set enrichment analysis and trans-omics coexpression network analysis, we found that each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> set provided a distinct viewpoint on the molecular pathogenesis of colitis. Combining human transcriptomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> with the mouse multiomics <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> implicated increased p21-activated kinase (Pak) signaling as a driver of colitis. Chemical inhibition of Pak1 and Pak2 with FRAX597 suppressed active colitis in mice. These studies provide translational insights into the mechanisms contributing to colitis and identify Pak as a potential therapeutic target in IBD.</p>

Using multiphoton interactions (Bragg diffraction and Bloch oscillations), we demonstrate the largest phase (12 million radians) of any Ramsey-Bordé interferometer and control systematic effects at a level of 0.12 part per billion. Comparison with Penning trap <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ements of the electron gyromagnetic anomaly <i>g<sub>e</sub></i> − 2 via the Standard Model of particle physics is now limited by the uncertainty in <i>g<sub>e</sub></i> − 2; a 2.5σ tension rejects dark photons as the reason for the unexplained part of the muon’s magnetic moment at a 99% confidence level. Implications for dark-sector candidates and electron substructure may be a sign of physics beyond the Standard Model that warrants further investigation.</p>

Measuring gill paracellular permeability with polyethylene glycol-4000 in freely swimming trout: proof of principle
<p>The influence of swimming activity on gill paracellular permeability has not been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ed previously in fishes. We critically assessed the use of tritium-labeled polyethylene glycol ([<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000) for this purpose, a substance that is also a classic marker for extracellular fluid volume, glomerular filtration rate and drinking rate. Tests (8 h) on resting freshwater trout showed that when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ing [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance from the plasma in the efflux direction, correction for a large excretion via glomerular filtration was essential, necessitating urinary catheterization. When <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ing [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance from the water in the influx direction, correction for a significant uptake by drinking was essential, necessitating terminal gut removal, whereas glomerular filtration losses were minimal. After correction for these alternate routes of loss and uptake, [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance rates by efflux from the plasma and by influx from the water were identical, showing that gill paracellular permeability is not rectified, and can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ed in either direction. The influx technique with terminal gut removal was used to assess gill paracellular permeability in trout without urinary catheters freely swimming at 1.2 body lengths s<sup>−1</sup> for 8 h. Branchial [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance rate (by influx from the water) increased significantly by ~80% in accord with a similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ed increase in O<sub>2</sub> consumption rate. Thus in trout, gill paracellular permeability does increase during exercise, in accord with the traditional concept of the osmorespiratory compromise.</p>

Mid-term changes in blood metal ion levels after Articular Surface Replacement arthroplasty of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Our first aim was to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>e whether there are significant   changes in the level of metal ions in the blood at mid-term follow-up,   in patients with an Articular Surface Replacement (ASR) arthroplasty.   Secondly, we sought to identify risk factors for any increases.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The study involved 435 patients who underwent unilateral, metal-on-metal   (MoM) hip resurfacing (HRA) or total hip arthroplasty (THA). These   patients all had one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ement of the level of metal ions in the   blood before seven years had passed post-operatively (early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ation)   and one after seven years had passed post-operatively (mid-term <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ation).

In a multivariable model considering MoM HRAs, the   change in the levels of metal ions was influenced by female gender   (Co: Odds Ratio (OR) 1.42; p = 0.002 and Cr: OR 1.08; p = 0.006).   The change was found to be irrespective of the initial level for   the MoM HRAs, whereas there was a negative relationship between   the initial level and the change in the level for those with a MoM   THA (Co: OR -0.43; p < 0.001 and Cr: OR -0.14; p = 0.033).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The levels of metal ions in the blood increase significantly   over the period until mid-term follow-up in patients with both a   MoM HRA and those with a MoM THA.

Impact of Lipid Measurements in Youth in Addition to Conventional Clinic-Based Risk Factors on Predicting Preclinical Atherosclerosis in Adulthood
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Data suggest that the prediction of adult cardiovascular disease using a model comprised entirely of adult nonlaboratory-based risk factors is equivalent to an approach that additionally incorporates adult lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>es. We assessed and compared the utility of a risk model based solely on nonlaboratory risk factors in adolescence versus a lipid model based on nonlaboratory risk factors plus lipids for predicting high-risk carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) in adulthood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The study comprised 2893 participants 12 to 18 years of age from 4 longitudinal cohort studies from the United States (Bogalusa Heart Study and the Insulin Study), Australia (Childhood Determinants of Adult Health Study), and Finland (The Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study) and followed into adulthood when cIMT was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong></span></strong>ed (mean follow-up, 23.4 years). Overweight status was defined according to the Cole classification. Hypertension was defined according to the Fourth Report on High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents from the National High Blood Pressure Education Program. High-risk plasma lipid levels were defined according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Cholesterol Levels in Children. High cIMT was defined as a study-specific value ≥90th percentile. Age and sex were included in each model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In univariate models, all risk factors except for borderline high and high triglycerides in adolescence were associated with high cIMT in adulthood. In multivariable models (relative risk [95% confidence interval]), male sex (2.7 [2.0–2.6]), prehypertension (1.4 [1.0–1.9]), hypertension (1.9 [1.3–2.9]), overweight (2.0 [1.4–2.9]), obesity (3.7 [2.0–7.0]), borderline high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (1.6 [1.2–2.2]), high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (1.6 [1.1–2.1]), and borderline low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (1.4 [1.0–1.8]) remained significant predictors of high cIMT (<i>P</i><0.05).

Latent Rheumatic Heart Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Screening echocardiography has emerged as a potentially powerful tool for early diagnosis of rheumatic heart disease (RHD). The utility of screening echocardiography hinges on the rate of RHD progression and the ability of penicillin prophylaxis to im<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prove</span></strong> outcome. We report the longitudinal outcomes of a cohort of children with latent RHD and identify risk factors for unfavorable outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This was a prospective natural history study conducted under the Ugandan RHD registry. Children with latent RHD and ≥1 year of follow-up were included. All echocardiograms were re-reviewed by experts (2012 World Heart Federation criteria) for inclusion and evidence of change. Bi- and multivariable logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and Cox proportional hazards models, as well, were developed to search for risk factors for unfavorable outcome and compare progression-free survival between those treated and not treated with penicillin. Propensity and other matching methods with sensitivity analysis were implemented for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ation of the penicillin effect.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Blinded review confirmed 227 cases of latent RHD: 164 borderline and 63 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">definit</span></strong>e (42 mild, 21 moderate/severe). Median age at diagnosis was 12 years and median follow-up was 2.3 years (interquartile range, 2.0–2.9). Penicillin prophylaxis was prescribed in 49.3% with overall adherence of 84.7%. Of children with moderate-to-severe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">definit</span></strong>e RHD, 47.6% had echocardiographic progression (including 2 deaths), and 9.5% had echocardiographic regression. Children with mild <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">definit</span></strong>e and borderline RHD showed 26% and 9.8% echocardiographic progression and 45.2% and 46.3% echocardiographic im<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prove</span></strong>ment, respectively. Of those with mild <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">definit</span></strong>e RHD or borderline RHD, more advanced disease category, younger age, and morphological mitral valve features were risk factors for an unfavorable outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Latent RHD is a heterogeneous diagnosis with variable disease outcomes. Children with moderate to severe latent RHD have poor outcomes. Children with both borderline and mild <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">definit</span></strong>e RHD are at substantial risk of progression. Although long-term outcome remains unclear, the initial change in latent RHD may be evident during the first 1 to 2 years following diagnosis.

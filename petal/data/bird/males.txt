Female Mice With an XY Sex Chromosome Complement Develop Severe Angiotensin II–Induced Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are a deadly pathology with strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual dimorphism. Similar to humans, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e mice exhibit far lower incidences of angiotensin II–induced AAAs than males. In addition to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> hormones, the X and Y <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosomes, and their unique complements of genes, may contribute to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ually dimorphic AAA pathology. Here, we defined the effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e (XX) versus male (XY) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosome complement on angiotensin II–induced AAA formation and rupture in phenotypically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e low-density lipoprotein receptor (<i>Ldlr</i>) deficient mice with an XX or XY <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosome complement were infused with angiotensin II for 28 days to induce AAAs. Abdominal aortic lumen diameters were quantified by ultrasound, whereas AAA diameters were quantified at study end point. DNA microarrays were performed on abdominal aortas. To mimic males, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e mice were administered a single dose of testosterone as neonates or as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong>s before angiotensin II infusions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e <i>Ldlr</i><sup>–/–</sup> deficient mice with an XX and XY <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosome complement had similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> organ weights and low serum testosterone concentrations. Abdominal aortas from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e XY mice selectively expressed Y chromosome genes, whereas genes known to escape X inactivation were higher in XX <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es. The majority of aortic gene differences in XY versus XX <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es fell within inflammatory pathways. AAA incidences doubled and aneurysms ruptured in XY <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es. AAAs from XY <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es exhibited inflammation, and plasma interleukin-1β concentrations were increased in XY <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es. Moreover, aortas from XY <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es had augmented matrix metalloproteinase activity and increased oxidative stress. Last, testosterone exposure applied chronically, or as a single bolus at postnatal day 1, markedly worsened AAA outcomes in XY in comparison with XX <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>An XY <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosome complement in phenotypic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es profoundly influenced aortic gene expression profiles and promoted AAA severity. When XY <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es were exposed to testosterone, aneurysm rupture rates were striking. Mechanisms for augmented AAA severity in XY <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es include increased inflammation, augmented matrix metalloproteineases, and oxidative stress. Our results demonstrate that genes on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosomes regulate aortic vascular biology and contribute to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual dimorphism of AAAs. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosome genes may serve as novel targets for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>-specific AAA therapeutics.</p></sec>

Males exhibit competitive advantages over females of <i>Populus deltoides</i> under salinity stress
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual competition among dioecious plants affects <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> ratios and the spatial distribution of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>es in different environments. At present, little is known about <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual dimorphisms induced by different competition patterns under salinity stress. We employed <i>Populus deltoides</i> as a model to investigate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>-related growth as well as physiological and biochemical responses to salinity stress under conditions of intra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual and inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual competition. Potted seedlings (two seedlings per pot; two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es, two males, or one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e and one male) were exposed to two salt levels (0 and 50 mM NaCl) and salinity- and competition-driven differences in growth, assimilation rate, water use, contents of leaf pigments and osmotica, hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), and antioxidant enzyme and nitrate reductase activity were examined. In the absence of salinity, no significant differences in competitive ability between males and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es subjected to intra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual competition were observed, although the growth of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es was moderately greater under inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual competition. The salinity treatment significantly increased the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> differences in competitive ability, especially under inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual competition. Under salinity stress, males showed decreased height, but displayed greater capacity for osmotic adjustment, enhancement of long-term water-use efficiency and increase in antioxidant enzyme activities. The absolute values of these traits were greater in salt-stressed males than in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es under inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual competition. In addition, salt-stressed males accumulated less Cl<sup>−</sup> and had lower H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> contents than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es. These data collectively demonstrate that the competitive advantage of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es in non-stressed conditions is lost under salinity. Greater salinity resistance of males growing intermixed with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es under salt stress can importantly affect the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> ratio of <i>P. deltoides</i> populations.</p>

Molecular Characterization and Evolution of a Gene Family Encoding Both Female- and Male-Specific Reproductive Proteins in <i>Drosophila</i>
<p>Gene duplication is an important mechanism for the evolution of new reproductive proteins. However, in most cases, each resulting paralog continues to function within the same <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>. To investigate the possibility that seminal fluid proteins arise through duplicates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e reproductive genes that become “co-opted” by males, we screened <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e reproductive genes in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> for cases of duplication in which one of the resulting paralogs produces a protein in males that is transferred to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es during mating. We identified a set of three tandemly duplicated genes that encode secreted serine-type endopeptidase homologs, two of which are expressed primarily in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e reproductive tract (RT), whereas the third is expressed specifically in the male RT and encodes a seminal fluid protein. Evolutionary and gene expression analyses across <i>Drosophila</i> species suggest that this family arose from a single-copy gene that was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e-specific; after duplication, one paralog evolved male-specific expression. Functional tests of knockdowns of each gene in <i>D. melanogaster</i> show that one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e-expressed gene is essential for full fecundity, and both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e-expressed genes contribute singly or in combination to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e’s propensity to remate. In contrast, knockdown of the male-expressed paralog had no significant effect on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e fecundity or remating. These data are consistent with a model in which members of this gene family exert effects on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es by acting on a common, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e-expressed target. After duplication and male co-option of one paralog, the evolution of the interacting proteins could have resulted in differential strengths or effects of each paralog.</p>

Pheromones exert top-down effects on visual recognition in the jumping spider <i>Lyssomanes viridis</i>
<p>In diverse and productive habitats, predaceous arthropods are expected to frequently encounter dangerous conspecifics and heterospecifics. This should make quick and accurate discriminations between species and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>es adaptive. By simultaneously sampling both visual cues and pheromones, and by utilizing stringent species- and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>-specific visual recognition templates, an individual should be able to increase both its speed and accuracy in making such discriminations. We tested for the use and stringency of visual recognition templates in the jumping spider <i>Lyssomanes viridis</i> by presenting males with animated images of conspecifics, heterospecifics and composite images that combined the facial coloration and morphology of one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> or species with the leg coloration of another. Males' courtship <i>versus</i> threat displays indicated whether a stimulus was perceived as a potential mate or a threat. By comparing males' visual inspection times of, and display types towards, the various images in the presence <i>versus</i> absence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e pheromones, we were able to deduce whether males tend to inspect a subset of the color pattern and morphological features that make up their conspecific recognition templates (i.e. those on just the face or just the legs), or all features, and whether this changes in the presence of pheromones. We found that the male recognition template for conspecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e was surprisingly coarse, whereas the recognition template for conspecific male, and especially the male face, was more specific. Pheromones hastened the recognition of images with coloration and morphology closely matching those of conspecifics, presumably by activating conspecific visual recognition templates. When males were presented with an image that was, overall, a poor match to a conspecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e, but that contained a subset of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e-like features, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e pheromones usually did not hasten recognition, but did increase the likelihood that the image would be identified as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e. Taken together, our data suggest that males examined features on both the face and the legs in both the presence and absence of pheromones, and that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e pheromones tipped the balance in favor of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e identification when a male was unsure how to categorize an incongruous set of visual features.</p>

Old but Not (So) Degenerated—Slow Evolution of Largely Homomorphic Sex Chromosomes in Ratites
<p>Degeneration of the nonrecombining chromosome is a common feature of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosome evolution, readily evident by the presence of a pair of largely heteromorphic chromosomes, like in eutherian mammals and birds. However, in ratites (order Palaeognathae, including, e.g., ostrich), the Z and W chromosomes are similar in size and largely undifferentiated, despite avian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosome evolution was initiated > 130 Ma. To better understand what may limit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosome evolution, we performed ostrich transcriptome sequencing and studied genes from the nonrecombining region of the W chromosome. Fourteen gametologous gene pairs present on the W chromosome and Z chromosome were identified, with synonymous sequence divergence of 0.027–0.177. The location of these genes on the Z chromosome was consistent with a sequential increase in divergence, starting 110–157 and ending 24–30 Ma. On the basis of the occurrence of Z-linked genes hemizygous in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es, we estimate that about one-third of the Z chromosome does not recombine with the W chromosome in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e meiosis. Pairwise <i>d</i><sub>N</sub><i>/d</i><sub>S</sub> between gametologs decreased with age, suggesting strong evolutionary constraint in old gametologs. Lineage-specific <i>d</i><sub>N</sub><i>/d</i><sub>S</sub> was consistently higher in W-linked genes, in accordance with the lower efficacy of selection expected in nonrecombining chromosomes. A higher ratio of GC > AT:AT > GC substitutions in W-linked genes supports a role for GC-biased gene conversion in differentially driving base composition on the two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosomes. A male-to-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e (M:F) expression ratio of close to one for recombining genes and close to two for Z-linked genes lacking a W copy show that dosage compensation is essentially absent. Some gametologous genes have retained active expression of the W copy in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es (giving a M:F ratio of 1 for the gametologous gene pair), whereas for others W expression has become severely reduced resulting in a M:F ratio of close to 2. These observations resemble the patterns of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosome evolution seen in other avian and mammalian lineages, suggesting similar underlying evolutionary processes, although the rate of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosome differentiation has been atypically low. Lack of dosage compensation may be a factor hindering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosome evolution in this lineage.</p>

Female Sex Is a Risk Modifier Rather Than a Risk Factor for Stroke in Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Stroke risk in atrial fibrillation is assessed by using the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> category (Sc, ie, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>) confers 1 point on CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc. We hypothesized that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> is a stroke risk modifier, rather than an overall risk factor, when added to a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>-independent thromboembolism risk) score scale.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using 3 nationwide registries, we identified patients with incident nonvalvular atrial fibrillation from January 1, 1997, through December 31, 2015.

CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA scores were calculated for men and women, and were followed for up to 1 year in the Danish National Patient Registry. The primary outcome was a primary hospital code for ischemic stroke or systemic embolism (thromboembolism). We calculated crude event rates for risk strata as events per 100 person-years. For quantifying absolute risk of stroke, we calculated risks based on the pseudovalue method. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> as a prognostic factor was investigated by inclusion as an interaction term on the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA score to calculate the thromboembolic risk ratio for different score points.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 239 671 patients with atrial fibrillation (48.7% women) contributed to the analyses. The mean ages for women and men were 76.6 years and 70.3 years, respectively; the mean CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA scores were 2.7 for women and 2.3 for men. The overall 1-year thromboembolic rate per 100 person-years for women was 7.3 and 5.7 for men.

Progressive Recombination Suppression and Differentiation in Recently Evolved Neo-sex Chromosomes
<p>Recombination suppression leads to the structural and functional differentiation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosomes and is thus a crucial step in the process of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosome evolution. Despite extensive theoretical work, the exact processes and mechanisms of recombination suppression and differentiation are not well understood. In threespine sticklebacks (<i>Gasterosteus aculeatus</i>), a different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosome system has recently evolved by a fusion between the Y chromosome and an autosome in the Japan Sea lineage, which diverged from the ancestor of other lineages approximately 2 Ma. We investigated the evolutionary dynamics and differentiation processes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosomes based on comparative analyses of these divergent lineages using 63 microsatellite loci. Both chromosome-wide differentiation patterns and phylogenetic inferences with X and Y alleles indicated that the ancestral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosomes were extensively differentiated before the divergence of these lineages. In contrast, genetic differentiation appeared to have proceeded only in a small region of the neo-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosomes. The recombination maps constructed for the Japan Sea lineage indicated that recombination has been suppressed or reduced over a large region spanning the ancestral and neo-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosomes. Chromosomal regions exhibiting genetic differentiation and suppressed or reduced recombination were detected continuously and sequentially in the neo-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosomes, suggesting that differentiation has gradually spread from the fusion point following the extension of recombination suppression. Our study illustrates an ongoing process of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosome differentiation, providing empirical support for the theoretical model postulating that recombination suppression and differentiation proceed in a gradual manner in the very early stage of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> chromosome evolution.</p>

Effect of Rosuvastatin on Carotid Intima-Media Thickness in Children With Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia

Carotid IMT was assessed by ultrasonography at baseline and 12 and 24 months in all patients and in age-matched unaffected siblings. Carotid IMT was measured at 3 locations (common carotid artery, carotid bulb, internal carotid artery) in both the left and right carotid arteries. A linear mixed-effects model was used to evaluate differences in carotid IMT between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> with HeFH and the unaffected siblings. <i>P</i> values were adjusted for age, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>, carotid artery site, and family relations.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>At baseline, mean±SD carotid IMT was significantly greater for the 197 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> with HeFH compared with the 65 unaffected siblings (0.397±0.049 and 0.377±0.045 mm, respectively; <i>P</i>=0.001).

Production of all female progeny: evidence for the presence of the male sex determination factor on the Y chromosome
<p>The red flour beetle, <i>Tribolium castaneum</i>, follows an XX (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e) and XY (male) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> determination system. Maternal supply of the protein Transformer (Tra) is required for XX insects to follow the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e pathway. The nature and source of the signal that regulates male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> determination in XY beetles are not known. Parental RNAi-aided knockdown in expression of <i>tra</i> masculinizes genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es (XX) that are fertile. The virgin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es mated with these masculinized genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es produced all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e progeny. We present the genetic evidence to show that the factor responsible for male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> determination is present on the Y chromosome. These data also suggest that the Y chromosome in <i>T. castaneum</i> is not required for male fertility.</p>

Sexually different physiological responses of <i>Populus cathayana</i> to nitrogen and phosphorus deficiencies
<p>Previous studies have shown that there are significant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual differences in the morphological and physiological responses of <i>Populus cathayana</i> Rehder under stressful conditions. However, little is known about <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>-specific differences in responses to nutrient deficiencies. In this study, the effects of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) deficiencies on the morphological, physiological and chloroplast ultrastructural traits of <i>P. cathayana</i> males and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es were investigated. The results showed that N and P deficiencies significantly decreased plant growth, foliar N and P contents, chlorophyll content, photosynthesis, and instantaneous photosynthetic N- and P-use efficiencies (PNUE and PPUE) in both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>es. Males had higher photosynthesis, higher PNUE and PPUE rates, and a lower accumulation of plastoglobules in chloroplasts than did <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es when exposed to N- and P-deficiency conditions. Nitrogen-deficient males had higher glutamate dehydrogenase and peroxidase activities, and a more intact chloroplast ultrastructure, but less starch accumulation than did N-deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es. Phosphorus-deficient males had higher nitrate reductase, glutamine synthetase and acid phosphatase activities, but a lower foliar N : P ratio and less PSII damage than did P-deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es. These results suggest that N and P deficiencies cause greater negative effects on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es than on males, and that the different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>es of <i>P. cathayana</i> may employ different strategies to cope with N and P deficiencies.</p>

Long-term (10-year) outcomes with each treatment were compared according to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>At baseline, women were older (63.4 versus 59.3 years; <i>P</i>=0.016) with higher body mass index (27.9 versus 26.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; <i>P</i>=0.001). Women had more coronary artery disease risk factors (diabetes mellitus, 55.4% versus 37.2%; hypertension, 70.9% versus 58.6%; hyperlipidemia, 70.3% versus 58.9%) except for smoking (13.5% versus 21.8%) and had lower rates of prior CABG (0% versus 3.4%; all <i>P</i><0.05) than men. Moreover, women had higher New York Heart Association class (class III/IV, 66.2% versus 57.0%), lower 6-minute walk capacity (300 versus 350 m), and lower Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire overall summary scores (51 versus 63; all <i>P</i><0.05).

Impact of Lipid Measurements in Youth in Addition to Conventional Clinic-Based Risk Factors on Predicting Preclinical Atherosclerosis in Adulthood
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Data suggest that the prediction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong> cardiovascular disease using a model comprised entirely of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong> nonlaboratory-based risk factors is equivalent to an approach that additionally incorporates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong> lipid measures. We assessed and compared the utility of a risk model based solely on nonlaboratory risk factors in adolescence versus a lipid model based on nonlaboratory risk factors plus lipids for predicting high-risk carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong>hood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The study comprised 2893 participants 12 to 18 years of age from 4 longitudinal cohort studies from the United States (Bogalusa Heart Study and the Insulin Study), Australia (Childhood Determinants of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong> Health Study), and Finland (The Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study) and followed into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong>hood when cIMT was measured (mean follow-up, 23.4 years). Overweight status was defined according to the Cole classification. Hypertension was defined according to the Fourth Report on High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents from the National High Blood Pressure Education Program. High-risk plasma lipid levels were defined according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Cholesterol Levels in Children.

In multivariable models (relative risk [95% confidence interval]), male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> (2.7 [2.0–2.6]), prehypertension (1.4 [1.0–1.9]), hypertension (1.9 [1.3–2.9]), overweight (2.0 [1.4–2.9]), obesity (3.7 [2.0–7.0]), borderline high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (1.6 [1.2–2.2]), high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (1.6 [1.1–2.1]), and borderline low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (1.4 [1.0–1.8]) remained significant predictors of high cIMT (<i>P</i><0.05). The addition of lipids into the nonlaboratory risk model slightly but significantly improved discrimination in predicting high cIMT compared with nonlaboratory-based risk factors only (C statistics for laboratory-based model 0.717 [95% confidence interval, 0.685–0.748] and for nonlaboratory 0.698 [95% confidence interval, 0.667–0.731]; <i>P</i>=0.02).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Nonlaboratory-based risk factors and lipids measured in adolescence independently predicted preclinical atherosclerosis in young <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong>hood.

Cardiovascular Health Promotion in Children: Challenges and Opportunities for 2020 and Beyond: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association
<p>This document provides a pediatric-focused companion to “Defining and Setting National Goals for Cardiovascular Health Promotion and Disease Reduction: The American Heart Association’s Strategic Impact Goal Through 2020 and Beyond,” focused on cardiovascular health promotion and disease reduction in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong>. The principles detailed in the document reflect the American Heart Association’s new dynamic and proactive goal to promote cardiovascular health throughout the life course. The primary focus is on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong> cardiovascular health and disease prevention, but critical to achievement of this goal is maintenance of ideal cardiovascular health from birth through childhood to young <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong>hood and beyond. Emphasis is placed on the fundamental principles and metrics that define cardiovascular health in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> for the clinical or research setting, and a balanced and critical appraisal of the strengths and weaknesses of the cardiovascular health construct in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> and adolescents is provided. Specifically, this document discusses 2 important factors: the promotion of ideal cardiovascular health in all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> and the improvement of cardiovascular health metric scores in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> currently classified as having poor or intermediate cardiovascular health. Other topics include the current status of cardiovascular health in US <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong>, opportunities for the refinement of health metrics, improvement of health metric scores, and possibilities for promoting ideal cardiovascular health. Importantly, concerns about the suitability of using single thresholds to identify elevated cardiovascular risk throughout the childhood years and the limits of our current knowledge are noted, and suggestions for future directions and research are provided.</p>

Sexual competition affects biomass partitioning, carbon–nutrient balance, Cd allocation and ultrastructure of <i>Populus cathayana</i> females and males exposed to Cd stress
<p>Although increasing attention has been paid to plant adaptation to soil heavy metal contamination, competition and neighbor effects have been largely overlooked, especially in dioecious plants. In this study, we investigated growth as well as biochemical and ultrastructural responses of <i>Populus cathayana</i> Rehder <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es and males to cadmium (Cd) stress under different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual competition patterns. The results showed that competition significantly affects biomass partitioning, photosynthetic capacity, leaf and root ultrastructure, Cd accumulation, the contents of polyphenols, and structural and nonstructural carbohydrates. Compared with single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> cultivation, plants of opposite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>es exposed to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual competition accumulated more Cd in tissues and their growth was more strongly inhibited, indicating enhanced Cd toxicity under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual competition. Under intra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual competition, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es showed greater Cd accumulation, more serious damage at the ultrastructural level and greater reduction in physiological activity than under inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual competition, while males performed better under intra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual competition than under inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual competition. Males improved the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e microenvironment by greater Cd uptake and lower resource consumption under inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual competition. These results demonstrate that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> of neighbor plants and competition affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual differences in growth and in key physiological processes under Cd stress. The asymmetry of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual competition highlighted here might regulate population structure, and spatial segregation and phytoremediation potential of both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>es in <i>P. cathayana</i> growing in heavy metal-contaminated soils.</p>

The histone demethylase KDM6B regulates temperature-dependent sex determination in a turtle species
<p>Temperature-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> determination is a notable model of phenotypic plasticity. In many reptiles, including the red-eared slider turtle <i>Trachemys scripta elegans</i> (<i>T. scripta</i>), the individual’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> is determined by the ambient temperature during egg incubation. In this study, we show that the histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylase KDM6B exhibits temperature-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ually dimorphic expression in early <i>T. scripta</i> embryos before the gonad is distinct. Knockdown of <i>Kdm6b</i> at 26°C (a temperature at which all offspring develop into males) triggers male-to-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> reversal in >80% of surviving embryos. KDM6B directly promotes the transcription of the male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>-determining gene <i>Dmrt1</i> by eliminating the trimethylation of H3K27 near its promoter. Additionally, overexpression of <i>Dmrt1</i> is sufficient to rescue the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> reversal induced by disruption of <i>Kdm6b</i>. This study establishes causality and a direct genetic link between epigenetic mechanisms and temperature-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> determination in a turtle species.</p>

Prevalence and Predictors of Cholesterol Screening, Awareness, and Statin Treatment Among US Adults With Familial Hypercholesterolemia or Other Forms of Severe Dyslipidemia (1999–2014)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and other extreme elevations in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol significantly increase the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; however, recent data suggest that prescription rates for statins remain low in these patients. National rates of screening, awareness, and treatment with statins among individuals with FH or severe dyslipidemia are unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data from the 1999 to 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were used to estimate prevalence rates of self-reported screening, awareness, and statin therapy among US <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong>s (n=42 471 weighted to represent 212 million US <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong>s) with FH (defined using the Dutch Lipid Clinic criteria) and with severe dyslipidemia (defined as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels ≥190 mg/dL). Logistic regression was used to identify sociodemographic and clinical correlates of hypercholesterolemia awareness and statin therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The estimated US prevalence of definite/probable FH was 0.47% (standard error, 0.03%) and of severe dyslipidemia was 6.6% (standard error, 0.2%). The frequency of cholesterol screening and awareness was high (>80%) among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong>s with definite/probable FH or severe dyslipidemia; however, statin use was uniformly low (52.3% [standard error, 8.2%] of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong>s with definite/probable FH and 37.6% [standard error, 1.2%] of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong>s with severe dyslipidemia). Only 30.3% of patients with definite/probable FH on statins were taking a high-intensity statin. The prevalence of statin use in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong>s with severe dyslipidemia increased over time (from 29.4% to 47.7%) but not faster than trends in the general population (from 5.7% to 17.6%). Older age, health insurance status, having a usual source of care, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and having a personal history of early atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease were associated with higher statin use.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Despite the high prevalence of cholesterol screening and awareness, only ≈50% of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong>s with FH are on statin therapy, with even fewer prescribed a high-intensity statin; young and uninsured patients are at the highest risk for lack of screening and for undertreatment. This study highlights an imperative to improve the frequency of cholesterol screening and statin prescription rates to better identify and treat this high-risk population. Additional studies are needed to better understand how to close these gaps in screening and treatment.</p></sec>

Sex Differences and Similarities in Atrial Fibrillation Epidemiology, Risk Factors, and Mortality in Community Cohorts
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac disease in aging populations with high comorbidity and mortality. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> differences in AF epidemiology are insufficiently understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In N=79 793 individuals without AF diagnosis at baseline (median age, 49.6 years; age range, 24.1–97.6 years; 51.7% women) from 4 community-based European studies (FINRISK, DanMONICA, Moli-sani Northern Sweden) of the BiomarCaRE consortium (Biomarker for Cardiovascular Risk Assessment in Europe), we examined AF incidence, its association with mortality, common risk factors, biomarkers, and prevalent cardiovascular disease, and their attributable risk by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>. Median follow-up time was 12.6 (to a maximum of 28.2) years.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Fewer AF cases were observed in women (N=1796; 4.4%), than in men (N=2465; 6.4%). Cardiovascular risk factor distribution and lipid profile at baseline were less beneficial in men than in women, and cardiovascular disease was more prevalent in men. Cumulative incidence increased markedly after the age of 50 years in men and after 60 years in women. The lifetime risk was similar (>30%) for both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>es. Subjects with incident AF had a 3.5-fold risk of death in comparison with those without AF. Multivariable-adjusted models showed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> differences for the association of body mass index and AF (hazard ratio per standard deviation increase, 1.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12–1.23 in women versus 1.31; 95% CI 1.25–1.38 in men; interaction <i>P</i> value of 0.001).

Aging impairs both primary and secondary RIG-I signaling for interferon induction in human monocytes
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong>s older than 65 account for most of the deaths caused by respiratory influenza A virus (IAV) infections, but the underlying mechanisms for this susceptibility are poorly understood. IAV RNA is detected by the cytosolic sensor retinoic acid–inducible gene I (RIG-I), which induces the production of type I interferons (IFNs) that curtail the spread of the virus and promote the elimination of infected cells. We have previously identified a marked defect in the IAV-inducible secretion of type I IFNs, but not proinflammatory cytokines, in monocytes from older (>65 years) healthy human donors. We found that monocytes from older <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong>s exhibited decreased abundance of the adaptor protein TRAF3 (tumor necrosis factor receptor–associated factor 3) because of its increased proteasomal degradation with age, thereby impairing the primary RIG-I signaling pathway for the induction of type I IFNs. We determined that monocytes from older <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong>s also failed to effectively stimulate the production of the IFN regulatory transcription factor IRF8, which compromised IFN induction through secondary RIG-I signaling. IRF8 played a central role in IFN induction in monocytes, because knocking down IRF8 in monocytes from younger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong>s was sufficient to replicate the IFN defects observed in monocytes from older <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong>s, whereas restoring IRF8 expression in older <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong> monocytes was sufficient to restore RIG-I–induced IFN responses. Aging thus compromises both the primary and secondary RIG-I signaling pathways that govern expression of type I IFN genes, thereby impairing antiviral resistance to IAV.</p>

Cognitive science in the field: A preschool intervention durably enhances intuitive but not formal mathematics
<p>Many poor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> are underprepared for demanding primary school curricula. Research in cognitive science suggests that school achievement could be improved by preschool pedagogy in which numerate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong>s engage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong>’s spontaneous, nonsymbolic mathematical concepts. To test this suggestion, we designed and evaluated a game-based preschool curriculum intended to exercise <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong>’s emerging skills in number and geometry. In a randomized field experiment with 1540 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> (average age 4.9 years) in 214 Indian preschools, 4 months of math game play yielded marked and enduring improvement on the exercised intuitive abilities, relative to no-treatment and active control conditions. Math-trained <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> also showed immediate gains on symbolic mathematical skills but displayed no advantage in subsequent learning of the language and concepts of school mathematics.</p>

Male sex in houseflies is determined by <i>Mdmd</i>, a paralog of the generic splice factor gene <i>CWC22</i>
<p>Across species, animals have diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> determination pathways, each consisting of a hierarchical cascade of genes and its associated regulatory mechanism. Houseflies have a distinctive polymorphic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> determination system in which a dominant male determiner, the M-factor, can reside on any of the chromosomes. We identified a gene, <i>Musca domestica</i> <i>male determiner</i> (<i>Mdmd</i>), as the M-factor. <i>Mdmd</i> originated from a duplication of the spliceosomal factor gene <i>CWC22</i> (<i>nucampholin</i>). Targeted <i>Mdmd</i> disruption results in complete <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> reversal to fertile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es because of a shift from male to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e expression of the downstream genes <i>transformer</i> and <i>double<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong></i>. The presence of <i>Mdmd</i> on different chromosomes indicates that <i>Mdmd</i> translocated to different genomic sites. Thus, an instructive signal in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> determination can arise by duplication and neofunctionalization of an essential splicing regulator.</p>

Physiological basis of starvation resistance in <i>Drosophila leontia</i>: analysis of sexual dimorphism
<p>Geographically varying starvation stress has often been considered as a natural selector that constrains between-population differences for starvation resistance (SR) in <i>Drosophila</i> species. On the Indian subcontinent, a dozen <i>Drosophila</i> species have shown clinal variations in SR across latitude, but the evolved physiological basis of such contrasting adaptations is largely unknown. In the present study, I untangled the physiological basis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>-specific as well as between-population divergence for SR in <i>D. leontia</i>, collected across a latitudinal transect of the Indian subcontinent (11°45′–31°19′N). Secondly, I tested the assumptions that hardening to starvation stress facilitates an increased survival under subsequent lethal levels of starvation, and such plastic effects differ between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>es. I observed several interesting results. In contrast to a steeper cline of starvation-related traits with latitude in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es, a shallower gradient was observed for males. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es stored higher (~1.3-fold) dry-mass-specific levels of body lipids and glycogen contents, and utilized these both of these energy resources under starvation stress, whereas the starved males metabolized only body lipids as a source of energy. Conversely, the rate of body lipid utilization and threshold need were considerably higher in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es as compared with males. Between-population differences were significant for storage levels of energy reserves only, but not for other avenues (rate of metabolite utilization and threshold need) of SR for both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>es. These findings indicate that multiple pathways shape the physiological basis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual dimorphism for SR in <i>D. leontia</i>. Further, single or multiple bouts of starvation hardening conferred an increased longevity (~4–9 h; <i>P</i><0.001) under subsequent lethal levels of starvation stress for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es only, and such plastic responses were consistent with a decrease in rate of metabolite utilization. Nevertheless, between-population effects were non-significant for absolute hardening capacity (AHC=<i>K</i><sub>SR</sub>–C). Altogether, these findings suggest that similar evolutionary constraints have resulted in divergent genetic as well as plastic responses to evolve adaptations under starvation stress, and account for the observed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual dimorphism for basal SR in <i>D. leontia</i>.</p>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
Phenotypic rescue of a <i>Drosophila</i> model of mitochondrial ANT1 disease
<p>A point mutation in the <i>Drosophila</i> gene that codes for the major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong> isoform of adenine nuclear translocase (ANT) represents a model for human diseases that are associated with ANT insufficiency [<i>stress-sensitive B<sup>1</sup></i> (<i>sesB<sup>1</sup></i>)]. We characterized the organismal, bioenergetic and molecular phenotype of <i>sesB<sup>1</sup></i> flies then tested strategies to compensate the mutant phenotype. In addition to developmental delay and mechanical-stress-induced seizures, <i>sesB<sup>1</sup></i> flies have an impaired response to sound, defective male courtship, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e sterility and curtailed lifespan. These phenotypes, excluding the latter two, are shared with the mitoribosomal protein S12 mutant, <i>tko<sup>25t</sup></i>. Mitochondria from <i>sesB<sup>1</sup></i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong>s showed a decreased respiratory control ratio and downregulation of cytochrome oxidase. <i>sesB<sup>1</sup></i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong>s exhibited ATP depletion, lactate accumulation and changes in gene expression that were consistent with a metabolic shift towards glycolysis, characterized by activation of lactate dehydrogenase and anaplerotic pathways. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es also showed downregulation of many genes that are required for oogenesis, and their eggs, although fertilized, failed to develop to the larval stages. The <i>sesB<sup>1</sup></i> phenotypes of developmental delay and mechanical-stress-induced seizures were alleviated by an altered mitochondrial DNA background. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e sterility was substantially rescued by somatic expression of alternative oxidase (AOX) from the sea squirt <i>Ciona intestinalis</i>, whereas AOX did not alleviate developmental delay. Our findings illustrate the potential of different therapeutic strategies for ANT-linked diseases, based on alleviating metabolic stress.</p>

Exposure to Low-Dose Ionizing Radiation From Cardiac Procedures and Malignancy Risk in Adults With Congenital Heart Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong>s with congenital heart disease (CHD) are exposed to increasing amounts of low-dose ionizing radiation (LDIR) from cardiac procedures. Cancer prevalence in this population is higher than in the general population. This study estimates the association between LDIR exposure from cardiac procedures and incident cancer in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong> patients with CHD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The study population derived from the Quebec Congenital Heart Disease Database. We measured cumulative numbers of LDIR-related cardiac procedures for each patient until 1 year before the time of cancer diagnosis or administrative censoring. To assess the association between LDIR exposure and cancer risk, we conducted a nested case-control study and matched cancer cases with controls on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>, CHD severity, birth year, and age.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The study included 24 833 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong> patients with CHD aged 18 to 64 years from 1995 to 2009. In >250 791 person-years of follow-up, 602 cancer cases were observed (median age, 55.4 years). The cumulative incidence of cancer estimated up to 64 years of age was 15.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 14.2–16.5). Cases had more LDIR-related cardiac procedures than controls (1410 versus 921 per 1000 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong> patients with CHD, <i>P</i><0.0001). Cumulative LDIR exposure was independently associated with cancer (odds ratio [OR], 1.08 per procedure; 95% CI, 1.04–1.13). Similar results were obtained by using dose estimates for LDIR exposure (OR, 1.10 per 10 mSv; 95% CI, 1.05–1.15) with a possible dose-related response. The effect measure was in the same direction, and the association was persistent for exposure from ≥6 procedures in all sensitivity analyses: after excluding most smoking-related cancer cases (OR, 1.10 per procedure; 95% CI, 1.05–1.16 and OR when exposure from ≥6 procedures, 3.08; 95% CI, 1.77–5.37), and after applying a 3-year lag period (OR, 1.09 per procedure; 95% CI, 1.03–1.14 and OR when exposure from ≥6 procedures: 2.58; 95% CI, 1.43–4.69).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first large population-based study to analyze and document the association between LDIR-related cardiac procedures and incident cancer in the population of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong>s with CHD. Confirmations of these findings by prospective studies are needed to reinforce policy recommendations for radiation surveillance in patients with CHD where no regulation currently exists. Physicians ordering and performing cardiac imaging should ensure that exposure is as low as reasonably achievable without sacrificing quality of care.</p></sec>

Latent Rheumatic Heart Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Screening echocardiography has emerged as a potentially powerful tool for early diagnosis of rheumatic heart disease (RHD). The utility of screening echocardiography hinges on the rate of RHD progression and the ability of penicillin prophylaxis to improve outcome. We report the longitudinal outcomes of a cohort of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> with latent RHD and identify risk factors for unfavorable outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This was a prospective natural history study conducted under the Ugandan RHD registry. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> with latent RHD and ≥1 year of follow-up were included. All echocardiograms were re-reviewed by experts (2012 World Heart Federation criteria) for inclusion and evidence of change. Bi- and multivariable logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and Cox proportional hazards models, as well, were developed to search for risk factors for unfavorable outcome and compare progression-free survival between those treated and not treated with penicillin. Propensity and other matching methods with sensitivity analysis were implemented for the evaluation of the penicillin effect.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Blinded review confirmed 227 cases of latent RHD: 164 borderline and 63 definite (42 mild, 21 moderate/severe). Median age at diagnosis was 12 years and median follow-up was 2.3 years (interquartile range, 2.0–2.9). Penicillin prophylaxis was prescribed in 49.3% with overall adherence of 84.7%. Of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> with moderate-to-severe definite RHD, 47.6% had echocardiographic progression (including 2 deaths), and 9.5% had echocardiographic regression. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> with mild definite and borderline RHD showed 26% and 9.8% echocardiographic progression and 45.2% and 46.3% echocardiographic improvement, respectively.

Although long-term outcome remains unclear, the initial change in latent RHD may be evident during the first 1 to 2 years following diagnosis.

Elimination of the male reproductive tract in the female embryo is promoted by COUP-TFII in mice
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual differentiation paradigm contends that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e pattern of the reproductive system is established by default because the male reproductive tracts (Wolffian ducts) in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e degenerate owing to a lack of androgen. Here, we discovered that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e mouse embryos lacking <i>Coup-tfII</i> (chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor II) in the Wolffian duct mesenchyme became inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>—possessing both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e and male reproductive tracts. Retention of Wolffian ducts was not caused by ectopic androgen production or action. Instead, enhanced phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling in Wolffian duct epithelium was responsible for the retention of male structures in an androgen-independent manner. We thus suggest that elimination of Wolffian ducts in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e embryos is actively promoted by COUP-TFII, which suppresses a mesenchyme-epithelium cross-talk responsible for Wolffian duct maintenance.</p>

Ductal sex determination
<p>How the physical differences between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>es develop is an intriguing process. In mammals, the first important stage in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> determination occurs during fetal life, when the male-determining Y chromosome expresses a gene called <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> determining region Y</i> (<i>SRY</i>), which acts on the bipotential gonad to initiate testis (instead of ovary) formation (<i>1</i>). Landmark experiments by Jost in the 1950s showed that the development of male-specific structures is established by factors produced from the emerging testis, namely androgens and anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) (<i>2</i>). This suggested that the formation of male characteristics is an active process, whereas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e-specific differentiation is passive. On page 717 of this issue, Zhao <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e development is also an active process.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
A Group D MAPK Protects Plants from Autotoxicity by Suppressing Herbivore-Induced Defense Signaling
<p>The mechanisms by which plants activate and enhance defense responses have been well studied; however, the regulatory mechanisms that allow plants to avoid excessive defense responses are poorly understood. Here, we identified a group D mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) gene from rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), <i>OsMAPK20-5</i>, whose expression was rapidly induced by infestation of gravid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong>s of a destructive rice pest, brown planthopper (BPH, <i>Nilaparvata lugens</i>), but not by BPH nymphs. Expression silencing of <i>OsMAPK20-5</i> (irMAPK) increased the accumulation of ethylene and nitric oxide (NO) after gravid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e BPH infestation, and thereby increased rice plant resistance to BPH <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong>s and oviposited eggs. However, when exposed to high densities of gravid BPH <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es, irMAPK plants wilted earlier than wild-type plants, which could be attributed to the hyperaccumulation of ethylene and NO in irMAPK plants. Interestingly, when released into the field, irMAPK plants displayed broad resistance to BPH and white-backed planthopper (<i>Sogatella furcifera</i>), the two most destructive pests of rice, and produced higher yield. Taken together, our study shows that although OsMAPK20-5 can reduce the resistance of rice plants to planthoppers, it also enables rice plants to control excessive defense responses and thereby prevents defense-response–related autotoxicity.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
The Evolution of Male–Female Sexual Dimorphism Predates the Gender-Based Divergence of the Mating Locus Gene <i>MAT3/RB</i>
<p>The molecular bases for the evolution of male–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>ual dimorphism are possible to study in volvocine algae because they encompass the entire range of reproductive morphologies from isogamy to oogamy. In 1978, Charlesworth suggested the model of a gamete size gene becoming linked to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>-determining or mating type locus (<i>MT</i>) as a mechanism for the evolution of anisogamy. Here, we carried out the first comprehensive study of a candidate <i>MT-</i>linked oogamy gene, <i>MAT3/RB</i>, across the volvocine lineage. We found that evolution of anisogamy/oogamy predates the extremely high male–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e divergence of <i>MAT3</i> that characterizes the <i>Volvox carteri</i> lineage. These data demonstrate very little <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>-linked sequence divergence of <i>MAT3</i> between the two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>es in other volvocine groups, though linkage between <i>MAT3</i> and the mating locus appears to be conserved. These data implicate genetic determinants other than or in addition to <i>MAT3</i> in the evolution of anisogamy in volvocine algae.</p>

High basal metabolic rate does not elevate oxidative stress during reproduction in laboratory mice
<p>Increased oxidative stress (OS) has been suggested as a physiological cost of reproduction. However, previous studies reported ambiguous results, with some even showing a reduction of oxidative damage during reproduction. We tested whether the link between reproduction and OS is mediated by basal metabolic rate (BMR), which has been hypothesized to affect both the rate of radical oxygen species production and antioxidative capacity. We studied the effect of reproduction on OS in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es of laboratory mice divergently selected for high (H-BMR) and low (L-BMR) BMR, previously shown to differ with respect to parental investment. Non-reproducing L-BMR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es showed higher oxidative damage to lipids (quantified as the level of malondialdehyde in internal organ tissues) and DNA (quantified as the level of 8-oxodG in blood serum) than H-BMR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es. Reproduction did not affect oxidative damage to lipids in either line; however, it reduced damage to DNA in L-BMR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es. Reproduction increased catalase activity in liver (significantly stronger in L-BMR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es) and decreased it in kidneys. We conclude that the effect of reproduction on OS depends on the initial variation in BMR and varies between studied internal organs and markers of OS.</p>

The management of open tibial fractures in children
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Following the introduction of national standards in 2009, most   major paediatric trauma is now triaged to specialist units offering   combined orthopaedic and plastic surgical expertise. We investigated   the management of open tibia fractures at a paediatric trauma centre,   primarily reporting the risk of infection and rate of union.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A retrospective review was performed on 61 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> who between   2007 and 2015 presented with an open tibia fracture. Their mean   age was nine years (2 to 16) and the median follow-up was ten months   (interquartile range 5 to 18). Management involved IV antibiotics,   early debridement and combined treatment of the skeletal and soft-tissue injuries   in line with standards proposed by the British Orthopaedic Association.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were 36 diaphyseal fractures and 25 distal tibial fractures.   Of the distal fractures, eight involved the physis. Motor vehicle   collisions accounted for two thirds of the injuries and 38 patients   (62%) arrived outside of normal working hours. The initial method   of stabilisation comprised: casting in nine cases (15%); elastic   nailing in 19 (31%); Kirschner (K)-wiring in 13 (21%); intramedullary   nailing in one (2%); open reduction and plate fixation in four (7%); and   external fixation in 15 (25%). Wound management comprised: primary   wound closure in 24 (39%), delayed primary closure in 11 (18%),   split skin graft (SSG) in eight (13%), local flap with SSG in 17   (28%) and a free flap in one. A total of 43 fractures (70%) were   Gustilo-Anderson grade III. There were four superficial (6.6%) and   three (4.9%) deep infections. Two deep infections occurred following   open reduction and plate fixation and the third after    K-wire fixation of a distal fracture. No patient who underwent primary   wound closure developed an infection. All the fractures united,   although nine patients required revision of a mono-lateral to circular   frame for delayed union (two) or for altered alignment or length   (seven). The mean time to union was two weeks longer in diaphyseal fractures   than in distal fractures (13 weeks <i>versus</i> 10.8   weeks, p<i> = </i>0.016). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> aged > 12 years had   a significantly longer time to union than those aged < 12 years   (16.3 weeks <i>versus</i> 11.4 weeks, p<i> = </i>0.045).   The length of stay in hospital for patients with a Gustilo-Anderson   grade IIIB fracture was twice as long as for less severe injuries. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Fractures in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> heal better than those in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong>s. Based   on our experience of deep infection we discourage the use of internal   fixation with a plate for open tibial fractures in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong>. We   advocate aggressive initial wound debridement in theatre with early   definitive combined orthopaedic and plastic surgery in order to   obtain skeletal stabilisation and soft-tissue cover.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:544–53.</p></sec>

Identification and characterization of putative stem cells in the adult pig ovary
<p>Recently, the concept of ‘neo-oogenesis’ has received increasing attention, since it was shown that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong> mammals have a renewable source of eggs. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the origin of these eggs and to confirm whether neo-oogenesis continues throughout life in the ovaries of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong> mammal. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e pigs were utilized to isolate, identify and characterize, including their proliferation and differentiation capabilities, putative stem cells (PSCs) from the ovary. PSCs were found to comprise a heterogeneous population based on c-kit expression and cell size, and also express stem and germ cell markers. Analysis of PSC molecular progression during establishment showed that these cells undergo cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation of Oct4 in a manner reminiscent of gonadal primordial germ cells (PGCs). Hence, cells with the characteristics of early PGCs are present or are generated in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong> pig ovary. Furthermore, the <i>in vitro</i> establishment of porcine PSCs required the presence of ovarian cell-derived extracellular regulatory factors, which are also likely to direct stem cell niche interactions <i>in vivo</i>. In conclusion, the present work supports a crucial role for c-kit and kit ligand/stem cell factor in stimulating the growth, proliferation and nuclear reprogramming of porcine PSCs, and further suggests that porcine PSCs might be the culture equivalent of early PGCs.</p>

Atrial Fibrillation Burden in Young Patients With Congenital Heart Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) are assumed to be vulnerable to atrial fibrillation (AF) as a result of residual shunts, anomalous vessel anatomy, progressive valvulopathy, hypertension, and atrial scars from previous heart surgery. However, the risk of developing AF and the complications associated with AF in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> and young <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong>s with CHD have not been compared with those in control subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data from the Swedish Patient and Cause of Death registers were used to identify all patients with a diagnosis of CHD who were born from 1970 to 1993. Each patient with CHD was matched by birth year, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>, and county with 10 control subjects from the Total Population Register in Sweden. Follow-up data were collected until 2011.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 21 982 patients (51.6% men) with CHD and 219 816 matched control subjects, 654 and 328 developed AF, respectively. The mean follow-up was 27 years. The risk of developing AF was 21.99 times higher (95% confidence interval, 19.26–25.12) in patients with CHD than control subjects. According to a hierarchical CHD classification, patients with conotruncal defects had the highest risk (hazard ratio, 84.27; 95% confidence interval, 56.86–124.89). At the age of 42 years, 8.3% of all patients with CHD had a recorded diagnosis of AF.

Up to the age of 42 years, 1 of 12 patients with CHD had developed AF, and 1 of 10 patients with CHD with AF had developed heart failure. The patient groups with the most complex congenital defects carried the greatest risk of AF and could be considered for targeted monitoring.</p></sec>

Mental Stress–Induced-Myocardial Ischemia in Young Patients With Recent Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI) is frequent in patients with coronary artery disease and is associated with worse prognosis. Young women with a previous myocardial infarction (MI), a group with unexplained higher mortality than men of comparable age, have shown elevated rates of MSIMI, but the mechanisms are unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied 306 patients (150 women and 156 men) ≤61 years of age who were hospitalized for MI in the previous 8 months and 112 community controls (58 women and 54 men) frequency matched for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> and age to the patients with MI. Endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilation and microvascular reactivity (reactive hyperemia index) were measured at rest and 30 minutes after mental stress. The digital vasomotor response to mental stress was assessed using peripheral arterial tonometry. Patients received <sup>99m</sup>Tc-sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging at rest, with mental (speech task) and conventional (exercise/pharmacological) stress.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The mean age of the sample was 50 years (range, 22–61). In the MI group but not among controls, women had a more adverse socioeconomic and psychosocial profile than men. There were no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> differences in cardiovascular risk factors, and among patients with MI, clinical severity tended to be lower in women. Women in both groups showed a higher peripheral arterial tonometry ratio during mental stress but a lower reactive hyperemia index after mental stress, indicating enhanced microvascular dysfunction after stress. There were no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> differences in flow-mediated dilation changes with mental stress. The rate of MSIMI was twice as high in women as in men (22% versus 11%, <i>P</i>=0.009), and ischemia with conventional stress was similarly elevated (31% versus 16%, <i>P</i>=0.002). Psychosocial and clinical risk factors did not explain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> differences in inducible ischemia. Although vascular responses to mental stress (peripheral arterial tonometry ratio and reactive hyperemia index) also did not explain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> differences in MSIMI, they were predictive of MSIMI in women only.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Young women after MI have a 2-fold likelihood of developing MSIMI compared with men and a similar increase in conventional stress ischemia. Microvascular dysfunction and peripheral vasoconstriction with mental stress are implicated in MSIMI among women but not among men, perhaps reflecting women’s proclivity toward ischemia because of microcirculatory abnormalities.</p></sec>

Multicellular Transcriptional Analysis of Mammalian Heart Regeneration
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The inability of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong> mammalian heart to regenerate following injury represents a major barrier in cardiovascular medicine. In contrast, the neonatal mammalian heart retains a transient capacity for regeneration, which is lost shortly after birth. Defining the molecular mechanisms that govern regenerative capacity in the neonatal period remains a central goal in cardiac biology. Here, we assemble a transcriptomic framework of multiple cardiac cell populations during postnatal development and following injury, which enables comparative analyses of the regenerative (neonatal) versus nonregenerative (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong>) state for the first time.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, leukocytes, and endothelial cells from infarcted and noninfarcted neonatal (P1) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong> (P56) mouse hearts were isolated by enzymatic dissociation and fluorescence-activated cell sorting at day 3 following surgery. RNA sequencing was performed on these cell populations to generate the transcriptome of the major cardiac cell populations during cardiac development, repair, and regeneration. To complement our transcriptomic data, we also surveyed the epigenetic landscape of cardiomyocytes during postnatal maturation by performing deep sequencing of accessible chromatin regions by using the Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin from purified mouse cardiomyocyte nuclei (P1, P14, and P56).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Profiling of cardiomyocyte and nonmyocyte transcriptional programs uncovered several injury-responsive genes across regenerative and nonregenerative time points. However, the majority of transcriptional changes in all cardiac cell types resulted from developmental maturation from neonatal stages to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong>hood rather than activation of a distinct regeneration-specific gene program. Furthermore, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong> leukocytes and fibroblasts were characterized by the expression of a proliferative gene expression network following infarction, which mirrored the neonatal state. In contrast, cardiomyocytes failed to reactivate the neonatal proliferative network following infarction, which was associated with loss of chromatin accessibility around cell cycle genes during postnatal maturation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This work provides a comprehensive framework and transcriptional resource of multiple cardiac cell populations during cardiac development, repair, and regeneration. Our findings define a regulatory program underpinning the neonatal regenerative state and identify alterations in the chromatin landscape that could limit reinduction of the regenerative program in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong> cardiomyocytes.</p></sec>

Atrial Fibrillation and Ventricular Arrhythmias
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong>-specific differences in the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, clinical treatment, and clinical outcomes of atrial fibrillation (AF), sustained ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death are recognized. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> hormones cause differences in cardiac electrophysiological parameters between men and women that may affect the risk for arrhythmias. The incidence and prevalence of AF is lower in women than in men. However, because women live longer and AF prevalence increases with age, the absolute number of women with AF exceeds that of men. Women with AF are more symptomatic, present with more atypical symptoms, and report worse quality of life in comparison with men. Female <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> is an independent risk factor for death or stroke attributable to AF. Oral anticoagulation therapy for stroke prevention has similar efficacy for men and women, but older women treated with warfarin have a higher residual risk of stroke in comparison with men. Women with AF are less likely to receive rhythm control antiarrhythmic drug therapy, electric cardioversion, or catheter ablation in comparison with men. The incidence and prevalence of sustained ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death are lower in women than in men. Women receiving implantable cardioverter defibrillators for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death are less likely to experience sustained ventricular arrhythmias in comparison with men. In contrast, women receiving a cardiac resynchronization therapy implantable cardioverter defibrillator for the treatment of heart failure are more likely to benefit than men. Women are less likely to be referred for implantable cardioverter defibrillator therapy despite current guideline recommendations. Women are more likely to experience a significant complication related to implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantation in comparison with men. Whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sex</span></strong> differences in treatment decisions reflect patient preferences or treatment biases requires further study.</p>

Cardiovascular Consequences of Childhood Secondhand Tobacco Smoke Exposure: Prevailing Evidence, Burden, and Racial and Socioeconomic Disparities: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although public health programs have led to a substantial decrease in the prevalence of tobacco smoking, the adverse health effects of tobacco smoke exposure are by no means a thing of the past. In the United States, 4 of 10 school-aged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> and 1 of 3 adolescents are involuntarily exposed to secondhand tobacco smoke (SHS), with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> of minority ethnic backgrounds and those living in low-socioeconomic-status households being disproportionately affected (68% and 43%, respectively). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong> are particularly vulnerable, with little control over home and social environment, and lack the understanding, agency, and ability to avoid SHS exposure on their own volition; they also have physiological or behavioral characteristics that render them especially susceptible to effects of SHS. Side-stream smoke (the smoke emanating from the burning end of the cigarette), a major component of SHS, contains a higher concentration of some toxins than mainstream smoke (inhaled by the smoker directly), making SHS potentially as dangerous as or even more dangerous than direct smoking. Compelling animal and human evidence shows that SHS exposure during childhood is detrimental to arterial function and structure, resulting in premature atherosclerosis and its cardiovascular consequences. Childhood SHS exposure is also related to impaired cardiac autonomic function and changes in heart rate variability. In addition, childhood SHS exposure is associated with clustering of cardiometabolic risk factors such as obesity, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance. Individualized interventions to reduce childhood exposure to SHS are shown to be at least modestly effective, as are broader-based policy initiatives such as community smoking bans and increased taxation.</p></sec><sec><title>Purpose:</title><p>The purpose of this statement is to summarize the available evidence on the cardiovascular health consequences of childhood SHS exposure; this will support ongoing efforts to further reduce and eliminate SHS exposure in this vulnerable population. This statement reviews relevant data from epidemiological studies, laboratory-based experiments, and controlled behavioral trials concerning SHS and cardiovascular disease risk in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong>. Information on the effects of SHS exposure on the cardiovascular system in animal and pediatric studies, including vascular disruption and platelet activation, oxidation and inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, increased vascular stiffness, changes in vascular structure, and autonomic dysfunction, is examined.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The epidemiological, observational, and experimental evidence accumulated to date demonstrates the detrimental cardiovascular consequences of SHS exposure in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">children</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Implications:</title><p>Increased awareness of the adverse, lifetime cardiovascular consequences of childhood SHS may facilitate the development of innovative individual, family-centered, and community health interventions to reduce and ideally eliminate SHS exposure in the vulnerable pediatric population. This evidence calls for a robust public health policy that embraces zero tolerance of childhood SHS exposure.</p></sec>

Cross-generation plasticity in cold hardiness is associated with diapause, but not the non-diapause developmental pathway, in the blow fly <i>Calliphora vicina</i>
<p>Predicting insect responses to global climate change involves understanding cross-generation effects of temperature. The majority of temperate insects overwinter in a state of diapause, a pre-emptive response to winter conditions associated with increased cold hardiness. Diapause is often induced following maternal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong> detection of an environmental cue signifying the onset of winter, whilst diapause is initiated in a subsequent life stage and/or generation. Continued global warming will expose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong>s to higher late-autumn temperatures, whilst diapause life stages will still experience prolonged winter cold. The cross-generation effect of temperature was investigated by acclimating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong> <i>Calliphora vicina</i> to present-day (15°C) and future (20°C) late-autumn conditions and assessing cold-hardiness in diapause (D15 and D20) and non-diapause (ND15 and ND20) progeny. A cross-generation plasticity in cold hardiness was associated with D but not ND larvae. D15 larvae exhibited an enhanced ability to suppress internal freezing (supercooling point=−18.9±0.9°C) compared with D20 (−15.3±0.8°C), and displayed a greater tolerance of prolonged exposure to −4°C (LT<sub>50</sub>=26.0±1.0 and 11.4±1.1 days, respectively) and −8°C (5.1±1.1 and 3.0±1.1 days, respectively). These changes were associated with a reduced glucose content in D15 (2.4±0.3 g mg<sup>−1</sup>) compared with D20 (3.0±0.3 g mg<sup>−1</sup>) larvae. In conclusion, <i>C. vicina</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adult</span></strong>s exposed to warmer autumn conditions during diapause induction will produce larvae with a reduced cold hardiness capacity, which could negatively impact winter survival. Given that maternal regulation of diapause is common among temperate insects, this could be a widespread phenomenon.</p>

Artemin, a diapause-specific chaperone, contributes to the stress tolerance of <i>Artemia franciscana</i> cysts and influences their release from females
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es of the crustacean <i>Artemia franciscana</i> produce either motile nauplii or gastrula stage embryos enclosed in a shell impermeable to nonvolatile compounds and known as cysts. The encysted embryos enter diapause, a state of greatly reduced metabolism and profound stress tolerance. Artemin, a diapause-specific ferritin homolog in cysts has molecular chaperone activity <i>in vitro</i>. Artemin represents 7.2% of soluble protein in cysts, approximately equal to the amount of p26, a small heat shock protein. However, there is almost twice as much artemin mRNA in cysts as compared with p26 mRNA, suggesting that artemin mRNA is translated less efficiently. RNA interference employing the injection of artemin double-stranded RNA into the egg sacs of <i>A. franciscana</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es substantially reduced artemin mRNA and protein in cysts. Decreasing artemin diminished desiccation and freezing tolerance of cysts, demonstrating a role for this protein in stress resistance. Knockdown of artemin increased the time required for complete discharge of a brood of cysts carried within a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>e from a few hours up to 4 days, an effect weakened in successive broods. Artemin, an abundant molecular chaperone, contributes to stress tolerance of <i>A. franciscana</i> cysts while influencing their development and/or exit from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">femal</span></strong>es.</p>

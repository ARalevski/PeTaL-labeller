Plasticity in the Neurotransmitter Repertoire
<p>In the earliest days of neuroscience, it was thought that a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> made and released only a single chemical, known as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>er, to send a signal across a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e to an adjacent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> (<i>1</i>). At the same time, it was deeply mysterious why so many signaling molecules were used in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>ous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. Subsequently, it became clear that many, if not most, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s (including those in mammals) make and release two or more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>ers including small-molecules and neuropeptides (<i>2</i>–<i>4</i>). As the list of these potential cotransmitters and their receptors has increased, we are faced with understanding the functional relevance of this embarrassment of riches for neural circuits and behavior. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>ers and neuromodulators (substances often released with small-molecule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>ers) can elicit a variety of different actions on their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> targets, including directly opening ion channels or acting through signal transduction pathways to alter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al excitability or synaptic transmission. Thus, characterizing the mixture of cotransmitters released by a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> is important for understanding how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al circuits operate. The mechanisms that change the profile of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>er release provide opportunities for plastic changes in circuit function, and consequently in organism behavior. On page 449 of this issue, Dulcis <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) report changes in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>er profile of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s that underlie photoperiod-triggered changes in animal behavior. The findings argue that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>er switching is a new mechanism for neuroplasticity (<i>6</i>) in adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>ous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Local and Systemic Metabolic Responses during Light-Induced Rapid Systemic Signaling
<p>Plants evolved multiple signaling pathways that transduce light-related signals between leaves. These are thought to improve light stress acclimation in a process termed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic acquired acclimation. Although responses to light stress have been studied extensively in local leaves, and to a lesser degree in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic leaves, little is known about the responses that occur in the different tissues that connect the local to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic leaves. These could be important in defining the specificity of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic response as well as in supporting the generation of different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic signals. Here, we report that local application of light stress to one rosette leaf of bolting Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants resulted in a metabolic response that encompassed local, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic and transport tissues (stem tissues that connect the local to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic tissues), demonstrating a high degree of physical and metabolic continuity between different tissues throughout the plant. Our results further indicate that the response of many of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ically altered metabolites is associated with the function of the reactive oxygen species wave and that the levels of eight different metabolites are altered in a similar manner in all tissues tested (local, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic, and transport). These compounds could define a core metabolic signature for light stress that propagates from the local to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic leaves. Our findings suggest that metabolic changes occurring in cells that connect the local and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic tissues play an important role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic acquired acclimation and could convey specificity to the rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic response of plants to light stress.</p>

Synaptic transmission from subplate neurons controls radial migration of neocortical neurons
<p>The neocortex exhibits a six-layered structure that is formed by radial migration of excitatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s, for which the multipolar-to-bipolar transition of immature migrating multipolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s is required. Here, we report that subplate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s, one of the first <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> types born in the neocortex, manage the multipolar-to-bipolar transition of migrating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s. By histochemical, imaging, and microarray analyses on the mouse embryonic cortex, we found that subplate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s extend neurites toward the ventricular side of the subplate and form transient glutamatergic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es on the multipolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s just below the subplate. NMDAR (<i>N</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate receptor)–mediated synaptic transmission from subplate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s to multipolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s induces the multipolar-to-bipolar transition, leading to a change in migration mode from slow multipolar migration to faster radial glial-guided locomotion. Our data suggested that transient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es formed on early immature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s regulate radial migration.</p>

A New Wrap for Neuronal Activity?
<p>As we learn and experience the world around us, our brains are remodeling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al pathways. Is this remodeling only a property of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s, or are other brain cell types also adapting and contributing to learning? A substantial proportion of cells in the mammalian brain are oligodendrocytes and their precursors (collectively called oligodendroglia). Oligodendrocytes generate multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myelin</span></strong> sheaths, lipid-rich extensions of specialized plasma membrane that spirally coat condensed layers around <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s. This insulation facilitates rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e conduction, increasing velocities of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> signals 10-fold (<i>1</i>) by restricting current flow to the small gaps between sheaths—the nodes of Ranvier. More than half of the human brain is composed of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myelin</span></strong>ated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>es (“white matter”). With such extensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myelin</span></strong>ated neural networks, it raises the questions: Do the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myelin</span></strong>-producing oligodendrocytes in the brain also adapt as neural circuits are modified in response to activity, and does adaptation of oligodendrocytes then affect the underlying neural circuits? On page 487 of this issue, Gibson <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) provide new evidence to address how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> activity may promote oligodendroglia changes.</p>

Sheet-Like Remodeling of the Transverse Tubular System in Human Heart Failure Impairs Excitation-Contraction Coupling and Functional Recovery by Mechanical Unloading
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac recovery in response to mechanical unloading by left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) has been demonstrated in subgroups of patients with chronic heart failure (HF). Hallmarks of HF are depletion and disorganization of the transverse tubular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> (t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>) in cardiomyocytes. Here, we investigated remodeling of the t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> in human end-stage HF and its role in cardiac recovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Left ventricular biopsies were obtained from 5 donors and 26 patients with chronic HF undergoing implantation of LVADs. Three-dimensional confocal microscopy and computational image analysis were applied to assess t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> structure, density, and distance of ryanodine receptor clusters to the sarcolemma, including the t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. Recovery of cardiac function in response to mechanical unloading was assessed by echocardiography during turndown of the LVAD.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The majority of HF myocytes showed remarkable t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> remodeling, particularly sheet-like invaginations of the sarcolemma. Circularity of t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> components was decreased in HF versus controls (0.37±0.01 versus 0.46±0.02; <i>P</i><0.01), and the volume/length ratio was increased in HF (0.36±0.01 versus 0.25±0.02 µm<sup>2</sup>; <i>P</i><0.0001). T-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> density was reduced in HF, leading to increased ryanodine receptor–sarcolemma distances (0.96±0.05 versus 0.64±0.1 µm; <i>P</i><0.01). Low ryanodine receptor–sarcolemma distances at the time of LVAD implantation predicted high post-LVAD left ventricular ejection fractions (<i>P</i><0.01) and ejection fraction increases during unloading (<i>P</i><0.01). Ejection fraction in patients with pre-LVAD ryanodine receptor–sarcolemma distances >1 µm did not improve after mechanical unloading. In addition, calcium transients were recorded in field-stimulated isolated human cardiomyocytes and analyzed with respect to local t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> density. Calcium release in HF myocytes was restricted to regions proximal to the sarcolemma. Local calcium upstroke was delayed (23.9±4.9 versus 10.3±1.7 milliseconds; <i>P</i><0.05) and more asynchronous (18.1±1.5 versus 8.9±2.2 milliseconds; <i>P</i><0.01) in HF cells with low t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> density versus cells with high t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> density.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> in end-stage human HF presents a characteristic novel phenotype consisting of sheet-like invaginations of the sarcolemma. Our results suggest that the remodeled t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> impairs excitation-contraction coupling and functional recovery during chronic LVAD unloading. An intact t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> at the time of LVAD implantation may constitute a precondition and predictor for functional cardiac recovery after mechanical unloading.</p></sec>

Role of insulin signaling impairment, adiponectin and dyslipidemia in peripheral and central neuropathy in mice
<p>One of the tissues or organs affected by diabetes is the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>ous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, predominantly the peripheral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> (peripheral polyneuropathy and/or painful peripheral neuropathy) but also the central <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> with impaired learning, memory and mental flexibility. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the pre-diabetic or diabetic condition caused by a high-fat diet (HFD) can damage both the peripheral and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">central <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>ous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong></span></strong>s. Groups of C57BL6 and Swiss Webster mice were fed a diet containing 60% fat for 8 months and compared to control and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic groups that were fed a standard diet containing 10% fat. Aspects of peripheral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e function (conduction velocity, thermal sensitivity) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">central <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>ous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong></span></strong> function (learning ability, memory) were measured at assorted times during the study. Both strains of mice on HFD developed impaired glucose tolerance, indicative of insulin resistance, but only the C57BL6 mice showed statistically significant hyperglycemia. STZ-diabetic C57BL6 mice developed learning deficits in the Barnes maze after 8 weeks of diabetes, whereas neither C57BL6 nor Swiss Webster mice fed a HFD showed signs of defects at that time point. By 6 months on HFD, Swiss Webster mice developed learning and memory deficits in the Barnes maze test, whereas their peripheral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>ous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> remained normal. In contrast, C57BL6 mice fed the HFD developed peripheral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e dysfunction, as indicated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e conduction slowing and thermal hyperalgesia, but showed normal learning and memory functions. Our data indicate that STZ-induced diabetes or a HFD can damage both peripheral and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">central <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>ous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong></span></strong>s, but learning deficits develop more rapidly in insulin-deficient than in insulin-resistant conditions and only in Swiss Webster mice. In addition to insulin impairment, dyslipidemia or adiponectinemia might determine the neuropathy phenotype.</p>

Architects of neuronal wiring
<p>Nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> function relies on precise connectivity of a multitude of distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al cell types. Each class of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> exhibits a characteristic morphology where synaptic connections are patterned across the cell surface. Thus, individual types of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s establish <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es on specific domains of target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s, such as the cell body (soma) or a distal branch (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dendrit</span></strong>e). Moreover, functionally related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es are often clustered on a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dendrit</span></strong>e or on one branch of an axon. This compartmentalized organization of synaptic connections affects the integration of synaptic inputs and increases the computational power of neural circuits (<i>1</i>). Studies by Urwyler <i>et al.</i> on page 454 of this issue (<i>2</i>) and by Favuzzi <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) report in a fruit fly and mouse model, respectively, mechanisms of how spatial distribution of synaptic connections is achieved.</p>

Whispering neurons fuel cortical highways
<p>The mammalian neocortex is one of the most intricate entities found in nature, both in terms of structure and function. It is the brain region responsible for the execution of high-order functions, including sensory perception, motor control, cognition, and speech. Its development is equally complex because it requires that millions to billions (depending on the species) of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s assemble in distinct layers and connect with exquisite precision to perform complicated information processing operations. During embryonic development, formation of the cerebral cortex involves the migration of excitatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s generated in the ventricular zone toward the cortical plate, where they establish their final position in six well-defined horizontal layers consisting of different types of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s and architecture. Along this migratory phase, developing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s undergo a morphological transition from multipolar shape to bipolar morphology. Bipolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s exhibit faster locomotion, quickly reaching their final destination. On page 313 of this issue, Ohtaka-Maruyama <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) reveal that this important switch to bipolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s is influenced by glutamate release from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s located at the subplate, just beneath the cortical plate. Subplate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s trigger this transformation by making transient synaptic contacts with multipolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s in transit to the cortical laminae. Understanding this process is important because disruption of neocortical migration results in several human neuro-developmental diseases.</p>

Astrocyte-derived interleukin-33 promotes microglial synapse engulfment and neural circuit development
<p>Neuronal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e formation and remodeling are essential to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">central <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>ous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong></span></strong> (CNS) development and are dysfunctional in neurodevelopmental diseases. Innate immune signals regulate tissue remodeling in the periphery, but how this affects CNS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es is largely unknown. Here, we show that the interleukin-1 family cytokine interleukin-33 (IL-33) is produced by developing astrocytes and is developmentally required for normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e numbers and neural circuit function in the spinal cord and thalamus. We find that IL-33 signals primarily to microglia under physiologic conditions, that it promotes microglial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e engulfment, and that it can drive microglial-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e depletion in vivo. These data reveal a cytokine-mediated mechanism required to maintain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s during CNS development.</p>

Proteomic analysis of S-nitrosylated nuclear proteins in rat cortical neurons
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s modulate gene expression in response to extrinsic signals to enable brain development, cognition, and learning and to process stimuli that regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic physiological functions. This signal-to-gene communication is facilitated by posttranslational modifications such as S-nitrosylation, the covalent attachment of a nitric oxide (NO) moiety to cysteine thiols. In the cerebral cortex, S-nitrosylation of histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) is required for gene transcription during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al development, but few other nuclear targets of S-nitrosylation have been identified to date. We used S-nitrosothiol resin-assisted capture on NO donor-treated nuclear extracts from rat cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s and identified 614 S-nitrosylated nuclear proteins. Of these, 131 proteins have not previously been shown to be S-nitrosylated in any <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, and 555 are previously unidentified targets of S-nitrosylation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s. The sites of S-nitrosylation were identified for 59% of the targets, and motifs containing single lysines were found at 33% of these sites. In addition, lysine motifs were necessary for promoting the S-nitrosylation of HDAC2 and methyl-CpG binding protein 3 (MBD3). Moreover, S-nitrosylation of the histone-binding protein RBBP7 was necessary for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dendrit</span></strong>ogenesis of cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s in culture. Together, our findings characterize S-nitrosylated nuclear proteins in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s and identify S-nitrosylation motifs that may be shared with other targets of NO signaling.</p>

Niche-derived laminin-511 promotes midbrain dopaminergic neuron survival and differentiation through YAP
<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder in which the loss of dopaminergic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s in the midbrain (mDA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s) causes progressive loss of motor control and function. Using embryonic and mDA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s, midbrain tissue from mice, and differentiated human neural stem cells, we investigated the mechanisms controlling the survival of mDA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s. We found that the extracellular matrix protein laminin-511 (LM511) promoted the survival and differentiation of mDA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s. LM511 bound to integrin α<sub>3</sub>β<sub>1</sub> and activated the transcriptional cofactor YAP. LM511-YAP signaling enhanced cell survival by inducing the expression of the microRNA miR-130a, which suppressed the synthesis of the cell death–associated protein PTEN. In addition, LM511-YAP signaling increased the expression of transcription factors critical for mDA identity, such as LMX1A and PITX3, and prevented the loss of mDA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s in response to oxidative stress, a finding that warrants further investigation to assess therapeutic potential for PD patients. We propose that by enhancing LM511-YAP signaling, it may be possible to prevent mDA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> degeneration in PD or enhance the survival of mDA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s in cell replacement therapies.</p>

Activation of CaMKIV by soluble amyloid-β<sub>1–42</sub> impedes trafficking of axonal vesicles and impairs activity-dependent synaptogenesis
<p>The prefibrillar form of soluble amyloid-β (sAβ<sub>1–42</sub>) impairs synaptic function and is associated with the early phase of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We investigated how sAβ<sub>1–42</sub> led to presynaptic defects using a quantum dot–based, single particle–tracking method to monitor synaptic vesicle (SV) trafficking along axons. We found that sAβ<sub>1–42</sub> prevented new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e formation induced by chemical long-term potentiation (cLTP). In cultured rat hippocampal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s, nanomolar amounts of sAβ<sub>1–42</sub> impaired Ca<sup>2+</sup> clearance from presynaptic terminals and increased the basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration. This caused an increase in the phosphorylation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV) and its substrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>in, which markedly inhibited SV trafficking along axons between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s derived from a transgenic AD mouse model had similar defects, which were prevented by an inhibitor of CaMK kinase (CaMKK; which activates CaMKIV), by antibodies against Aβ<sub>1–42</sub>, or by expression a phosphodeficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>in mutant. The CaMKK inhibitor also abolished the defects in activity-dependent synaptogenesis caused by sAβ<sub>1–42</sub>. Our results suggest that by disrupting SV reallocation between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es, sAβ<sub>1–42</sub> prevents <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s from forming new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es or adjusting strength and activity among neighboring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es.

Branch-restricted localization of phosphatase Prl-1 specifies axonal synaptogenesis domains
<p>Central <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>ous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> (CNS) circuit development requires subcellular control of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e formation and patterning of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e abundance. We identified the <i>Drosophila</i> membrane-anchored phosphatase of regenerating liver (Prl-1) as an axon-intrinsic factor that promotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e formation in a spatially restricted fashion. The loss of Prl-1 in mechanosensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s reduced the number of CNS pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es localized on a single axon collateral and organized as a terminal arbor. Flies lacking all Prl-1 protein had locomotor defects. The overexpression of Prl-1 induced ectopic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es. In mechanosensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s, Prl-1 modulates the insulin receptor (InR) signaling pathway within a single contralateral axon compartment, thereby affecting the number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es. The axon branch–specific localization and function of Prl-1 depend on untranslated regions of the <i>prl-1</i> messenger RNA (mRNA). Therefore, compartmentalized restriction of Prl-1 serves as a specificity factor for the subcellular control of axonal synaptogenesis.</p>

A gut feeling
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anatomi</span></strong>st Friedrich S. Merkel predicted in 1880 that sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s are composed of epithelial cells and sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>es, which together transform environmental cues into neural signals that trigger our rich sensory experiences (<i>1</i>). We now know that this hypothesis mostly holds true for the canonical senses of vision, hearing, taste, and touch. Perhaps surprisingly, the peripheral outposts of these classical sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s (eyes, ears, tongue, and skin) are dwarfed by the human body's largest sensory organ—the gut. Enteroendocrine cells, which are rare epithelial cells that decorate the gut lining, have long been suspected to be sensory receptor cells that inform the brain about ingested nutrients (<i>2</i>). Since their description, these cells were assumed to play a role in metabolism and gut physiology by releasing slow-acting peptide hormones that stimulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s throughout the gut and in the brain. On page 1219 of this issue, Kaelberer <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) challenge this view by demonstrating that gut enteroendocrine cells locally excite sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>es through release of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>er glutamate. A recent study of enterochromaffin cells, a subset of enteroendocrine cells, also found that gut signals are transmitted at epithelial-neural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es through release of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>er serotonin (<i>4</i>). Together, these findings overturn a decades-old dogma that enteroendocrine cells signal exclusively through hormones.</p>

<p>Movement is the most common final output of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>ous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> activity and is essential for survival. But what makes this seemingly trivial statement so scientifically challenging? <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s that contribute to when and how our body moves are distributed throughout the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>ous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. Thus, even a simple movement such as arm flexion requires the coordinated activation of many different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al populations across multiple brain regions. A key question is how the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>ous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> produces diverse and precise actions aligned with the organisms' behavioral needs. These processes are affected in diseases such as Parkinson's or Huntington's, in which aberrant motor behavior dominates. Recent studies are transformative in how we think about the control of movement. A common denominator of these studies is that brain regions that contribute to motor behavior can no longer be considered as interacting boxes. Instead, deep circuit-level insight based on specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al populations emerges as being critical to revealing motor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> organization and understanding its function. It is likely that insights at this level can also help to design more specific and direct interventions for diseases of the motor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> and neuroprosthetics applied after injuries.</p>

A bioinspired flexible organic artificial afferent nerve
<p>The distributed network of receptors, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es in the somatosensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> efficiently processes complex tactile information. We used flexible organic electronics to mimic the functions of a sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e. Our artificial afferent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e collects pressure information (1 to 80 kilopascals) from clusters of pressure sensors, converts the pressure information into action potentials (0 to 100 hertz) by using ring oscillators, and integrates the action potentials from multiple ring oscillators with a synaptic transistor. Biomimetic hierarchical structures can detect movement of an object, combine simultaneous pressure inputs, and distinguish braille characters. Furthermore, we connected our artificial afferent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e to motor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>es to construct a hybrid bioelectronic reflex arc to actuate muscles. Our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> has potential applications in neurorobotics and neuroprosthetics.</p>

Wire together, fire apart
<p>The ability to learn and remember new experiences lies at the heart of our existence. After all, we are our memories. It has been widely accepted that memories are formed and stored via strengthening of neural connections due to the correlated activities of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s, where presumably one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> is causing or at least contributing to the activity of another connecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> and hence becomes associated with it. This principle is known as the Hebbian learning rule (<i>1</i>): i.e., if interconnected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s become active very close in time during a particular event, their connection strengthens and “a memory” of this event is formed (<i>1</i>). In other words, “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s wire together, if they fire together” (<i>2</i>). Thus, neural connection must show some sort of plasticity—i.e., an ability to be modified based on the mutual firing patterns of interconnected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s—in order to form memories and associations. Indeed, it has been shown that brief (hundreds of milliseconds) stimulations of interconnected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s significantly improve signal transmission between the two, a phenomenon known as long-term potentiation (LTP). On page 1033 of this issue, Bittner <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) describe a different learning mechanism called behavioral time scale synaptic plasticity (BTSP), which spans a considerably longer time course of several seconds, implying that no causal relationship of interconnected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s may be necessary to form long-lasting associations between them.</p>

Glia relay differentiation cues to coordinate neuronal development in <i>Drosophila</i>
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al birth and specification must be coordinated across the developing brain to generate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s that constitute neural circuits. We used the <i>Drosophila</i> visual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> to investigate how development is coordinated to establish retinotopy, a feature of all visual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. Photoreceptors achieve retinotopy by inducing their target field in the optic lobe, the lamina <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s, with a secreted differentiation cue, epidermal growth factor (EGF). We find that communication between photoreceptors and lamina cells requires a signaling relay through glia. In response to photoreceptor-EGF, glia produce insulin-like peptides, which induce lamina <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al differentiation. Our study identifies a role for glia in coordinating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al development across distinct brain regions, thus reconciling the timing of column assembly with that of delayed differentiation, as well as the spatiotemporal pattern of lamina <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> differentiation.</p>

Single-cell methylomes identify neuronal subtypes and regulatory elements in mammalian cortex
<p>The mammalian brain contains diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al types, yet we lack single-cell epigenomic assays that are able to identify and characterize them. DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic mark that distinguishes cell types and marks regulatory elements. We generated >6000 methylomes from single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al nuclei and used them to identify 16 mouse and 21 human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al subpopulations in the frontal cortex. CG and non-CG methylation exhibited cell type–specific distributions, and we identified regulatory elements with differential methylation across <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> types. Methylation signatures identified a layer 6 excitatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> subtype and a unique human parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> subtype. We observed stronger cross-species conservation of regulatory elements in inhibitory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s than in excitatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s. Single-nucleus methylomes expand the atlas of brain cell types and identify regulatory elements that drive conserved brain cell diversity.</p>

The sacral autonomic outflow is sympathetic
<p>A kinship between cranial and pelvic visceral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>es of vertebrates has been accepted for a century. Accordingly, sacral preganglionic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s are considered parasympathetic, as are their targets in the pelvic ganglia that prominently control rectal, bladder, and genital functions. Here, we uncover 15 phenotypic and ontogenetic features that distinguish pre- and postganglionic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s of the cranial parasympathetic outflow from those of the thoracolumbar sympathetic outflow in mice. By every single one, the sacral outflow is indistinguishable from the thoracolumbar outflow. Thus, the parasympathetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>ous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> receives input from cranial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>es exclusively and the sympathetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>ous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> from spinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>es, thoracic to sacral inclusively. This simplified, bipartite architecture offers a new framework to understand pelvic neurophysiology as well as development and evolution of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">autonomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>ous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong></span></strong>.</p>

Vocal production complexity correlates with neural instructions in the oyster toadfish (<i>Opsanus tau</i>)
<p>Sound communication is fundamental to many social interactions and essential to courtship and agonistic behaviours in many vertebrates. The swimbladder and associated muscles in batrachoidid fishes (midshipman and toadfish) is a unique vertebrate sound production <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, wherein fundamental frequencies are determined directly by the firing rate of a vocal-acoustic neural network that drives the contraction frequency of superfast swimbladder muscles. The oyster toadfish boatwhistle call starts with an irregular sound waveform that could be an emergent property of the peripheral nonlinear sound-producing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> or reflect complex encoding in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">central <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>ous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong></span></strong>. Here, we demonstrate that the start of the boatwhistle is indicative of a chaotic strange attractor, and tested whether its origin lies in the peripheral sound-producing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> or in the vocal motor network. We recorded sound and swimbladder muscle activity in awake, freely behaving toadfish during motor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e stimulation, and recorded sound, motor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e and muscle activity during spontaneous grunts. The results show that rhythmic motor volleys do not cause complex sound signals. However, arrhythmic recruitment of swimbladder muscle during spontaneous grunts correlates with complex sounds. This supports the hypothesis that the irregular start of the boatwhistle is encoded in the vocal pre-motor neural network, and not caused by peripheral interactions with the sound-producing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. We suggest that sound production <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> demands across vocal tetrapods have selected for muscles and motor<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s adapted for speed, which can execute complex neural instructions into equivalently complex vocalisations.</p>

Development
The phosphorylation status of Ascl1 is a key determinant of neuronal differentiation and maturation <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>
<p>Generation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s from patient fibroblasts using a combination of developmentally defined transcription factors has great potential in disease modelling, as well as ultimately for use in regeneration and repair. However, generation of physiologically mature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s <i>in vitro</i> remains problematic. Here we demonstrate the cell-cycle-dependent phosphorylation of a key reprogramming transcription factor, Ascl1, on multiple serine-proline sites. This multisite phosphorylation is a crucial regulator of the ability of Ascl1 to drive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al differentiation and maturation <i>in vivo</i> in the developing embryo; a phosphomutant form of Ascl1 shows substantially enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al induction activity in <i>Xenopus</i> embryos. Mechanistically, we see that this un(der)phosphorylated Ascl1 is resistant to inhibition by both cyclin-dependent kinase activity and Notch signalling, both of which normally limit its neurogenic potential. Ascl1 is a central component of reprogramming transcription factor cocktails to generate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s from human fibroblasts; the use of phosphomutant Ascl1 in place of the wild-type protein significantly promotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al maturity after human fibroblast reprogramming <i>in vitro</i>. These results demonstrate that cell-cycle-dependent post-translational modification of proneural proteins directly regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al differentiation <i>in vivo</i> during development, and that this regulatory mechanism can be harnessed to promote maturation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s obtained by transdifferentiation of human cells <i>in vitro</i>.</p>

Pin1 mediates Aβ<sub>42</sub>-induced dendritic spine loss
<p>Early-stage Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by the loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dendrit</span></strong>ic spines in the neocortex of the brain. This phenomenon precedes tau pathology, plaque formation, and neurodegeneration and likely contributes to synaptic loss, memory impairment, and behavioral changes in patients. Studies suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dendrit</span></strong>ic spine loss is induced by soluble, multimeric amyloid-β (Aβ<sub>42</sub>), which, through postsynaptic signaling, activates the protein phosphatase calcineurin. We investigated how calcineurin caused spine pathology and found that the cis-trans prolyl isomerase Pin1 was a critical downstream target of Aβ<sub>42</sub>-calcineurin signaling. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dendrit</span></strong>ic spines, Pin1 interacted with and was dephosphorylated by calcineurin, which rapidly suppressed its isomerase activity. Knockout of Pin1 or exposure to Aβ<sub>42</sub> induced the loss of mature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dendrit</span></strong>ic spines, which was prevented by exogenous Pin1. The calcineurin inhibitor FK506 blocked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dendrit</span></strong>ic spine loss in Aβ<sub>42</sub>-treated wild-type cells but had no effect on <i>Pin1</i>-null <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s. These data implicate Pin1 in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dendrit</span></strong>ic spine maintenance and synaptic loss in early Alzheimer’s disease.</p>

Systematic discovery of antiphage defense systems in the microbial pangenome
<p>The arms race between bacteria and phages led to the development of sophisticated antiphage defense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s, including CRISPR-Cas and restriction-modification <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. Evidence suggests that known and unknown defense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s are located in “defense islands” in microbial genomes. Here, we comprehensively characterized the bacterial defensive arsenal by examining gene families that are clustered next to known defense genes in prokaryotic genomes. Candidate defense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>atically engineered and validated in model bacteria for their antiphage activities. We report nine previously unknown antiphage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s and one antiplasmid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> that are widespread in microbes and strongly protect against foreign invaders. These include <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s that adopted components of the bacterial flagella and condensin complexes.

Nerves switch on angiogenic metabolism
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>es release <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>ers to regulate most physiologic functions in the body. Recently, it has been recognized that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>es play dominant roles in organogenesis and tissue regeneration (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). In addition, growing evidence suggests that cancer development in a variety of tissues is controlled by an assortment of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e-mediated signals, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>ers and other molecules (<i>3</i>–<i>5</i>).

Dynamics of cortical dendritic membrane potential and spikes in freely behaving rats

DAP firing rates were several-fold larger than somatic rates. DAP rates were also modulated by subthreshold DMP fluctuations, which were far larger than DAP amplitude, indicating hybrid, analog-digital coding in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dendrit</span></strong>es.

Midbrain dopamine neurons control judgment of time

Midbrain dopamine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s have been implicated in variable time estimation. However, a direct link between signals carried by dopamine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s and temporal judgments is lacking.

We found that pharmacogenetic suppression of dopamine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s decreased behavioral sensitivity to time and that dopamine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s encoded information about trial-to-trial variability in time estimates.

CyanoGate: A Modular Cloning Suite for Engineering Cyanobacteria Based on the Plant MoClo Syntax
<p>Recent advances in synthetic biology research have been underpinned by an exponential increase in available genomic information and a proliferation of advanced DNA assembly tools. The adoption of plasmid vector assembly standards and parts libraries has greatly enhanced the reproducibility of research and the exchange of parts between different labs and biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. However, a standardized modular cloning (MoClo) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> is not yet available for cyanobacteria, which lag behind other prokaryotes in synthetic biology despite their huge potential regarding biotechnological applications. By building on the assembly library and syntax of the Plant Golden Gate MoClo kit, we have developed a versatile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> called CyanoGate that unites cyanobacteria with plant and algal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. Here, we describe the generation of a suite of parts and acceptor vectors for making (1) marked/unmarked knock-outs or integrations using an integrative acceptor vector, and (2) transient multigene expression and repression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s using known and previously undescribed replicative vectors. We tested and compared the CyanoGate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> in the established model cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp.

The UTEX 2973 fast-growth phenotype was only evident under specific growth conditions; however, UTEX 2973 accumulated high levels of proteins with strong native or synthetic promoters. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> is publicly available and can be readily expanded to accommodate other standardized MoClo parts to accelerate the development of reliable synthetic biology tools for the cyanobacterial community.</p>

A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e palsy may cause difficulty with the post-operative   rehabilitation, and overall mobility of the patient. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e palsy   may result from compression and tension to the affected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e(s)   during the course of the operation via surgical manipulation and   retractor placement, tension from limb lengthening or compression   from post-operative hematoma.

Disease Models & Mechanisms
Axon degeneration and PGC-1α-mediated protection in a zebrafish model of α-synuclein toxicity
<p>α-synuclein (aSyn) expression is implicated in neurodegenerative processes, including Parkinson’s disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). In animal models of these diseases, axon pathology often precedes cell death, raising the question of whether aSyn has compartment-specific toxic effects that could require early and/or independent therapeutic intervention. The relevance of axonal pathology to degeneration can only be addressed through longitudinal, <i>in vivo</i> monitoring of different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al compartments. With current imaging methods, dopaminergic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s do not readily lend themselves to such a task in any vertebrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. We therefore expressed human wild-type aSyn in zebrafish peripheral sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s, which project elaborate superficial axons that can be continuously imaged <i>in vivo</i>. Axonal outgrowth was normal in these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s but, by 2 days post-fertilization (dpf), many aSyn-expressing axons became dystrophic, with focal varicosities or diffuse beading. Approximately 20% of aSyn-expressing cells died by 3 dpf. Time-lapse imaging revealed that focal axonal swelling, but not overt fragmentation, usually preceded cell death. Co-expressing aSyn with a mitochondrial reporter revealed deficits in mitochondrial transport and morphology even when axons appeared overtly normal. The axon-protective protein Wallerian degeneration slow (WldS) delayed axon degeneration but not cell death caused by aSyn. By contrast, the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1α, which has roles in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and reactive-oxygen-species detoxification, abrogated aSyn toxicity in both the axon and the cell body. The rapid onset of axonal pathology in this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, and the relatively moderate degree of cell death, provide a new model for the study of aSyn toxicity and protection. Moreover, the accessibility of peripheral sensory axons will allow effects of aSyn to be studied in different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al compartments and might have utility in screening for novel disease-modifying compounds.</p>

Behavioral abnormalities and Parkinson’s-like histological changes resulting from <i>Id2</i> inactivation in mice
<p>Characterizing dopaminergic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al development and function in novel genetic animal models might uncover strategies for researchers to develop disease-modifying treatments for neurologic disorders. <i>Id2</i> is a transcription factor expressed in the developing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">central <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>ous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong></span></strong>. <i>Id2</i><sup>−/−</sup> mice have fewer dopaminergic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s in the olfactory bulb and reduced olfactory discrimination, a pre-clinical marker of Parkinson’s disease. Here, we summarize behavioral, histological and <i>in vitro</i> molecular biological analyses to determine whether midbrain dopaminergic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s are affected by <i>Id2</i> loss. <i>Id2</i><sup>−/−</sup> mice were hyperactive at 1 and 3 months of age, but by 6 months showed reduced activity. <i>Id2</i><sup>−/−</sup> mice showed age-dependent histological alterations in dopaminergic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpC) associated with changes in locomotor activity. Reduced dopamine transporter (<i>DAT)</i> expression was observed at early ages in <i>Id2</i><sup>−/−</sup> mice and <i>DAT</i> expression was dependent on <i>Id2</i> expression in an <i>in vitro</i> dopaminergic differentiation model. Evidence of neurodegeneration, including activated caspase-3 and glial infiltration, were noted in the SNpC of older <i>Id2</i><sup>−/−</sup> mice. These findings document a novel role for <i>Id2</i> in the maintenance of midbrain dopamine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s. The <i>Id2</i><sup>−/−</sup> mouse should provide unique opportunities to study the progression of neurodegenerative disorders involving the dopamine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>.</p>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
Motor neurons and glia exhibit specific individualized responses to TDP-43 expression in a <i>Drosophila</i> model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
<p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal disease characterized by complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al and glial phenotypes. Recently, RNA-based mechanisms have been linked to ALS via RNA-binding proteins such as TDP-43, which has been studied <i>in vivo</i> using models ranging from yeast to rodents. We have developed a <i>Drosophila</i> model of ALS based on TDP-43 that recapitulates several aspects of pathology, including motor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> loss, locomotor dysfunction and reduced survival. Here we report the phenotypic consequences of expressing wild-type and four different ALS-linked TDP-43 mutations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s and glia. We show that TDP-43-driven neurodegeneration phenotypes are dose- and age-dependent. In motor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s, TDP-43 appears restricted to nuclei, which are significantly misshapen due to mutant but not wild-type protein expression. In glia and in the developing neuroepithelium, TDP-43 associates with cytoplasmic puncta. TDP-43-containing RNA granules are motile in cultured motor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s, although wild-type and mutant variants exhibit different kinetic properties. At the neuromuscular junction, the expression of TDP-43 in motor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s versus glia leads to seemingly opposite synaptic phenotypes that, surprisingly, translate into comparable locomotor defects. Finally, we explore sleep as a behavioral readout of TDP-43 expression and find evidence of sleep fragmentation consistent with hyperexcitability, a suggested mechanism in ALS. These findings support the notion that although motor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s and glia are both involved in ALS pathology, at the cellular level they can exhibit different responses to TDP-43. In addition, our data suggest that individual TDP-43 alleles utilize distinct molecular mechanisms, which will be important for developing therapeutic strategies.</p>

Excitatory neuron–specific SHP2-ERK signaling network regulates synaptic plasticity and memory
<p>Mutations in RAS signaling pathway components cause diverse neurodevelopmental disorders, collectively called RASopathies. Previous studies have suggested that dysregulation in RAS–extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) activation is restricted to distinct cell types in different RASopathies. Some cases of Noonan syndrome (NS) are associated with gain-of-function mutations in the phosphatase SHP2 (encoded by <i>PTPN11</i>); however, SHP2 is abundant in multiple cell types, so it is unclear which cell type(s) contribute to NS phenotypes. Here, we found that expressing the NS-associated mutant SHP2<sup>D61G</sup> in excitatory, but not inhibitory, hippocampal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s increased ERK signaling and impaired both long-term potentiation (LTP) and spatial memory in mice, although endogenous SHP2 was expressed in both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al types. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that the genes encoding SHP2-interacting proteins that are critical for ERK activation, such as GAB1 and GRB2, were enriched in excitatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s. Accordingly, expressing a dominant-negative mutant of GAB1, which reduced its interaction with SHP2<sup>D61G</sup>, selectively in excitatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s, reversed SHP2<sup>D61G</sup>-mediated deficits. Moreover, ectopic expression of GAB1 and GRB2 together with SHP2<sup>D61G</sup> in inhibitory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s resulted in ERK activation. These results demonstrate that RAS-ERK signaling networks are notably different between excitatory and inhibitory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s, accounting for the cell type–specific pathophysiology of NS and perhaps other RASopathies.</p>

Inhibition of somatosensory mechanotransduction by annexin A6
<p>Mechanically activated, slowly adapting currents in sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s have been linked to noxious mechanosensation. The conotoxin NMB-1 (noxious mechanosensation blocker-1) blocks such currents and inhibits mechanical pain. Using a biotinylated form of NMB-1 in mass spectrometry analysis, we identified 67 binding proteins in sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s and a sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>–derived cell line, of which the top candidate was annexin A6, a membrane-associated calcium-binding protein. Annexin A6–deficient mice showed increased sensitivity to mechanical stimuli. Sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s from these mice showed increased activity of the cation channel Piezo2, which mediates a rapidly adapting mechano-gated current linked to proprioception and touch, and a decrease in mechanically activated, slowly adapting currents. Conversely, overexpression of annexin A6 in sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s inhibited rapidly adapting currents that were partially mediated by Piezo2. Furthermore, overexpression of annexin A6 in sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s attenuated mechanical pain in a mouse model of osteoarthritis, a disease in which mechanically evoked pain is particularly problematic. These data suggest that annexin A6 can be exploited to inhibit chronic mechanical pain.</p>

Chemical synapses without synaptic vesicles: Purinergic neurotransmission through a CALHM1 channel-mitochondrial signaling complex
<p>Conventional chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>ous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> involve a presynaptic accumulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>er-containing vesicles, which fuse with the plasma membrane to release <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>ers that activate postsynaptic receptors. In taste buds, type II receptor cells do not have conventional synaptic features but nonetheless show regulated release of their afferent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>er, ATP, through a large-pore, voltage-gated channel, CALHM1. Immunohistochemistry revealed that CALHM1 was localized to points of contact between the receptor cells and sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e fibers. Ultrastructural and super-resolution light microscopy showed that the CALHM1 channels were consistently associated with distinctive, large (1- to 2-μm) mitochondria spaced 20 to 40 nm from the presynaptic membrane. Pharmacological disruption of the mitochondrial respiratory chain limited the ability of taste cells to release ATP, suggesting that the immediate source of released ATP was the mitochondrion rather than a cytoplasmic pool of ATP. These large mitochondria may serve as both a reservoir of releasable ATP and the site of synthesis. The juxtaposition of the large mitochondria to areas of membrane displaying CALHM1 also defines a restricted compartment that limits the influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> upon opening of the nonselective CALHM1 channels. These findings reveal a distinctive organelle signature and functional organization for regulated, focal release of purinergic signals in the absence of synaptic vesicles.</p>

Neuronal activity drives FMRP- and HSPG-dependent matrix metalloproteinase function required for rapid synaptogenesis
<p>Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) functions modulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e formation and activity-dependent plasticity. Aberrant MMP activity is implicated in fragile X syndrome (FXS), a disease caused by the loss of the RNA-binding protein FMRP and characterized by neurological dysfunction and intellectual disability. Gene expression studies in <i>Drosophila</i> suggest that Mmps cooperate with the heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) glypican co-receptor Dally-like protein (Dlp) to restrict trans-synaptic Wnt signaling and that synaptogenic defects in the fly model of FXS are alleviated by either inhibition of Mmp or genetic reduction of Dlp. We used the <i>Drosophila</i> neuromuscular junction (NMJ) glutamatergic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e to test activity-dependent Dlp and Mmp intersections in the context of FXS. We found that rapid, activity-dependent synaptic bouton formation depended on secreted Mmp1. Acute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al stimulation reduced the abundance of Mmp2 but increased that of both Mmp1 and Dlp, as well as enhanced the colocalization of Dlp and Mmp1 at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e. Dlp function promoted Mmp1 abundance, localization, and proteolytic activity around <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es. Dlp glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains mediated this functional interaction with Mmp1. In the FXS fly model, activity-dependent increases in Mmp1 abundance and activity were lost but were restored by reducing the amount of synaptic Dlp. The data suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al activity-induced, HSPG-dependent Mmp regulation drives activity-dependent synaptogenesis and that this is impaired in FXS. Thus, exploring this mechanism further may reveal therapeutic targets that have the potential to restore synaptogenesis in FXS patients.</p>

The paraventricular thalamus is a critical thalamic area for wakefulness
<p>Clinical observations indicate that the paramedian region of the thalamus is a critical node for controlling wakefulness. However, the specific nucleus and neural circuitry for this function remain unknown. Using in vivo fiber photometry or multichannel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electrophysiolog</span></strong>ical recordings in mice, we found that glutamatergic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s of the paraventricular thalamus (PVT) exhibited high activities during wakefulness. Suppression of PVT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al activity caused a reduction in wakefulness, whereas activation of PVT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s induced a transition from sleep to wakefulness and an acceleration of emergence from general anesthesia.

Locally coordinated synaptic plasticity of visual cortex neurons in vivo

This is accompanied by a decrease in the strength of adjacent spines on a slower time scale.

Hebbian strengthening of activated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es and heterosynaptic weakening of adjacent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es thus cooperatively orchestrate cell-wide plasticity of functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al responses.</p>

Topological and modality-specific representation of somatosensory information in the fly brain

As explosions pattern the sky, the visual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> must capture information about the time-varying positions, colors, and contrasts of myriad spots of light. This testament to high-acuity vision necessitates the development of neural circuits that map visual space.

Rapid binge-like eating and body weight gain driven by zona incerta GABA neuron activation

Heterochronic Genes Turn Back the Clock in Old Neurons
<p>Although some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> types regenerate better than others, all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s lose the ability to regenerate with age. This intrinsic decline is the primary cause of regeneration failure even in permissive environments. This was shown in 1995 by comparing the regeneration ability of retinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s from different aged retinas growing into tectums of different ages (<i>1</i>). Embryonic retinal axons regrew into tectum of any age, including older tectum with an inhibitory glial environment, whereas postnatal day 2 or older retinal axons failed to regrow even into embryonic tectum. This indicated a “programmed” loss of axon regeneration ability with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> age. Similarly, young hindbrain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s transplanted into older spinal cords could regenerate axons into a normally inhibitory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myelin</span></strong>ated environment (<i>2</i>). Despite the clear therapeutic implications of these observations, the underlying molecular mechanisms controlling age-dependent regenerative capacity were unclear. On page 372 in this issue, Zou <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) report that the highly conserved <i>let-7</i>–LIN-41 heterochronic signaling pathway is responsible for part of the age-related decline in axon regeneration in the worm <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>.</p>

Independent Regulation of Symbiotic Nodulation by the SUNN Negative and CRA2 Positive Systemic Pathways
<p>Plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic signaling pathways allow the integration and coordination of shoot and root organ metabolism and development at the whole-plant level depending on nutrient availability. In legumes, two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic pathways have been reported in the <i>Medicago truncatula</i> model to regulate root nitrogen-fixing symbiotic nodulation. Both pathways involve leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases acting in shoots and proposed to perceive signaling peptides produced in roots depending on soil nutrient availability. In this study, we characterized in the <i>M. truncatula</i> Jemalong A17 genotype a mutant allelic series affecting the Compact Root Architecture2 (CRA2) receptor. These analyses revealed that this pathway acts <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ically from shoots to positively regulate nodulation and is required for the activity of carboxyl-terminally encoded peptides (CEPs). In addition, we generated a double mutant to test genetic interactions of the CRA2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic pathway with the CLAVATA3/EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGION peptide (CLE)/Super Numeric Nodule (SUNN) receptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic pathway negatively regulating nodule number from shoots, which revealed an intermediate nodule number phenotype close to the wild type. Finally, we showed that the nitrate inhibition of nodule numbers was observed in <i>cra2</i> mutants but not in <i>sunn</i> and <i>cra2 sunn</i> mutants. Overall, these results suggest that CEP/CRA2 and CLE/SUNN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic pathways act independently from shoots to regulate nodule numbers.</p>

A Genetic Network for Systemic RNA Silencing in Plants
<p>Non-cell autonomous RNA silencing can spread from cell to cell and over long distances in animals and plants. However, the genetic requirements and signals involved in plant mobile gene silencing are poorly understood. Here, we identified a <i>DICER-LIKE2</i> (<i>DCL2</i>)<i>-</i>dependent mechanism for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic spread of posttranscriptional RNA silencing, also known as posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS), in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. Using a suite of transgenic <i>DCL</i> RNAi lines coupled with a GFP reporter, we demonstrated that <i>N. benthamiana</i> DCL1, DCL2, DCL3, and DCL4 are required to produce microRNAs and 22, 24, and 21nt small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), respectively. All investigated siRNAs produced in local incipient cells were present at low levels in distal tissues. Inhibition of <i>DCL2</i> expression reduced the spread of gene silencing, while suppression of <i>DCL3</i> or <i>DCL4</i> expression enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS. In contrast to <i>DCL4</i> RNAi lines, <i>DCL2</i>-<i>DCL4</i> double-RNAi lines developed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS similar to that observed in <i>DCL2</i> RNAi. We further showed that the 21 or 24 nt local siRNAs produced by DCL4 or DCL3 were not involved in long-distance gene silencing. Grafting experiments demonstrated that <i>DCL2</i> was required in the scion to respond to the signal, but not in the rootstock to produce/send the signal. These results suggest a coordinated <i>DCL</i> genetic pathway in which <i>DCL2</i> plays an essential role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS in <i>N. benthamiana</i>, while both <i>DCL4</i> and <i>DCL3</i> attenuate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS.

Defective cholesterol clearance limits remyelination in the aged central nervous system
<p>Age-associated decline in regeneration capacity limits the restoration of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>ous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> functionality after injury. In a model for de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myelin</span></strong>ation, we found that old mice fail to resolve the inflammatory response initiated after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myelin</span></strong> damage. Aged phagocytes accumulated excessive amounts of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myelin</span></strong> debris, which triggered cholesterol crystal formation and phagolysosomal membrane rupture and stimulated inflammasomes. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myelin</span></strong> debris clearance required cholesterol transporters, including apolipoprotein E. Stimulation of reverse cholesterol transport was sufficient to restore the capacity of old mice to re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myelin</span></strong>ate lesioned tissue. Thus, cholesterol-rich <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myelin</span></strong> debris can overwhelm the efflux capacity of phagocytes, resulting in a phase transition of cholesterol into crystals and thereby inducing a maladaptive immune response that impedes tissue regeneration.</p>

RNA editing with CRISPR-Cas13
<p>Nucleic acid editing holds promise for treating genetic disease, particularly at the RNA level, where disease-relevant sequences can be rescued to yield functional protein products. Type VI CRISPR-Cas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s contain the programmable single-effector RNA-guided ribonuclease Cas13. We profiled type VI <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s in order to engineer a Cas13 ortholog capable of robust knockdown and demonstrated RNA editing by using catalytically inactive Cas13 (dCas13) to direct adenosine-to-inosine deaminase activity by ADAR2 (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA type 2) to transcripts in mammalian cells. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, referred to as RNA Editing for Programmable A to I Replacement (REPAIR), which has no strict sequence constraints, can be used to edit full-length transcripts containing pathogenic mutations. We further engineered this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> to create a high-specificity variant and minimized the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> to facilitate viral delivery. REPAIR presents a promising RNA-editing platform with broad applicability for research, therapeutics, and biotechnology.</p>

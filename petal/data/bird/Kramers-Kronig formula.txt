Heart rate as a predictor of metabolic rate in heterothermic bats
<p>While heart rate (<i>f</i><sub>H</sub>) has been used as an indicator of energy expenditure, quantitative data showing the relationship between these variables are only available for normothermic animals. To determine whether <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> also predicts oxygen consumption ([Formula]) during torpor, we simultaneously measured [Formula], <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> and subcutaneous body temperature (<i>T</i><sub>sub</sub>) of a hibernator, Gould's long-eared bats (<i>Nyctophilus gouldi</i>, 9 g, <i>N</i>=18), at ambient temperatures (<i>T</i><sub>a</sub>) between 0 and 25°C. At rest, <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> of normothermic resting bats was negatively correlated with <i>T</i><sub>a</sub>, with maximum <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> of 803 beats min<sup>−1</sup> (<i>T</i><sub>a</sub>=5°C). During torpor, the relationship between <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> and <i>T</i><sub>a</sub> was curvilinear, and at low <i>T</i><sub>sub</sub> (~6°C), <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> fell to a minimum average of 8 beats min<sup>−1</sup>. The minimum average values for both [Formula] and <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> in torpor reported here were among the lowest recorded for bats. The relationship between <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> and [Formula] was significant for both resting (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup>=0.64, <i>P</i><0.001) and torpid bats (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup>=0.84, <i>P</i><0.001), with no overlap between the two states. These variables were also significantly correlated (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup>=0.44, <i>P</i><0.001) for entire torpor bouts. Moreover, estimates of [Formula] from <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> did not differ significantly from measured values during the different physiological states. Our study is the first to investigate the accuracy of <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> as a predictor of [Formula] during torpor and indicates the reliability of this method as a potential measure of energy expenditure in the field. Nevertheless, <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> should only be used to predict [Formula] within the range of activities for which robust correlations have been established.</p>

An excess of massive stars in the local 30 Doradus starburst
<p>The 30 Doradus star-forming region in the Large Magellanic Cloud is a nearby analog of large star-formation events in the distant universe. We determined the recent formation history and the initial mass function (IMF) of massive stars in 30 Doradus on the basis of spectroscopic observations of 247 stars more massive than 15 solar masses ([Formula]). The main episode of massive star formation began about 8 million years (My) ago, and the star-formation rate seems to have declined in the last 1 My. The IMF is densely sampled up to 200 [Formula] and contains 32 ± 12% more stars above 30 [Formula] than predicted by a standard Salpeter IMF. In the mass range of 15 to 200 [Formula], the IMF power-law exponent is [Formula], shallower than the Salpeter value of 2.35.</p>

Observation of fractional Chern insulators in a van der Waals heterostructure
<p>Topologically ordered phases are characterized by long-range quantum entanglement and fractional statistics rather than by symmetry breaking. First observed in a fractionally filled continuum Landau level, topological order has since been proposed to arise more generally at fractional fillings of topologically nontrivial Chern bands. Here we report the observation of gapped states at fractional fillings of Harper-Hofstadter bands arising from the interplay of a magnetic field and a superlattice potential in a bilayer graphene–hexagonal boron nitride heterostructure. We observed phases at fractional filling of bands with Chern indices [Formula]. Some of these phases, in [Formula] and [Formula] bands, are characterized by fractional Hall conductance—that is, they are known as fractional Chern insulators and constitute an example of topological order beyond Landau levels.</p>

Mechanistic origin and prediction of enhanced ductility in magnesium alloys
<p>Pure magnesium exhibits poor ductility owing to pyramidal [Formula] dislocation transformations to immobile structures, making this lowest-density structural metal unusable for many applications where it could enhance energy efficiency. We show why magnesium can be made ductile by specific dilute solute additions, which increase the [Formula] cross-slip and multiplication rates to levels much faster than the deleterious [Formula] transformation, enabling both favorable texture during processing and continued plastic straining during deformation. A quantitative theory establishes the conditions for ductility as a function of alloy composition in very good agreement with experiments on many existing magnesium alloys, and the solute-enhanced cross-slip mechanism is confirmed by transmission electron microscopy observations in magnesium-yttrium. The mechanistic theory can quickly screen for alloy compositions favoring conditions for high ductility and may help in the development of high-formability magnesium alloys.</p>

The Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 early science investigations of regional carbon dioxide fluxes
<p>NASA’s Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) mission was motivated by the need to diagnose how the increasing concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is altering the productivity of the biosphere and the uptake of CO<sub>2</sub> by the oceans. Launched on 2 July 2014, OCO-2 provides retrievals of the column-averaged CO<sub>2</sub> dry-air mole fraction ([Formula]) as well as the fluorescence from chlorophyll in terrestrial plants. The seasonal pattern of uptake by the terrestrial biosphere is recorded in fluorescence and the drawdown of [Formula] during summer. Launched just before one of the most intense El Niños of the past century, OCO-2 measurements of [Formula] and fluorescence record the impact of the large change in ocean temperature and rainfall on uptake and release of CO<sub>2</sub> by the oceans and biosphere.</p>

An accreting pulsar with extreme properties drives an ultraluminous x-ray source in NGC 5907
<p>Ultraluminous x-ray sources (ULXs) in nearby galaxies shine brighter than any x-ray source in our Galaxy. ULXs are usually modeled as stellar-mass black holes (BHs) accreting at very high rates or intermediate-mass BHs. We present observations showing that NGC 5907 ULX is instead an x-ray accreting neutron star (NS) with a spin period evolving from 1.43 seconds in 2003 to 1.13 seconds in 2014. It has an isotropic peak luminosity of [Formula]1000 times the Eddington limit for a NS at 17.1 megaparsec. Standard accretion models fail to explain its luminosity, even assuming beamed emission, but a strong multipolar magnetic field can describe its properties. These findings suggest that other extreme ULXs (x-ray luminosity [Formula] 10<sup>41 </sup>erg second[Formula]) might harbor NSs.</p>

Diurnal Variation in Nonstructural Carbohydrate Storage in Trees: Remobilization and Vertical Mixing
<p>Nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) storage plays a critical role in tree function and survival, but understanding and predicting local NSC storage dynamics is challenging because NSC storage pools are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed throughout the complex architecture of trees and continuously exchange carbon between source and sink organs at different time scales. To address these knowledge gaps, characterization and understanding of NSC diel variation are necessary. Here, we analyzed diurnal NSC dynamics in the overall architecture of almond (<i>Prunus dulcis</i>) trees. We also analyzed the allocation of newly assimilated carbon using isotopic labeling. We show that both components of NSC (i.e. soluble carbohydrates and starch) are highly dynamic at the diurnal time scale and that these trends are influenced by tissue type, age, and/or position within the canopy. In leaves, starch reserves can be depleted completely during the night, while woody tissue starch levels may vary by more than 50% over a daily cycle. Recently assimilated carbon showed a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed downward allocation across the entire tree. NSC diurnal fluctuations within the tree’s structure in combination with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed carbon allocation patterns provide evidence for the presence of vertical mixing and suggest that the xylem acts as a secondary NSC redistribution pathway.</p>

Dynamic Interplay between Nucleoid Segregation and Genome Integrity in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> Chloroplasts
<p>The chloroplast (cp) genome is organized as nucleoids that are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed throughout the cp stroma. Previously, a cp homolog of bacterial recombinase RecA (cpRECA) was shown to be involved in the maintenance of cp genome integrity by repairing damaged chloroplast DNA and by suppressing aberrant recombination between short <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed repeats in the moss <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. Here, overexpression and knockdown analysis of cpRECA in the green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> revealed that cpRECA was involved in cp nucleoid dynamics as well as having a role in maintaining cp genome integrity. Overexpression of <i>cpRECA</i> tagged with yellow fluorescent protein or hemagglutinin resulted in the formation of giant filamentous structures that colocalized exclusively to chloroplast DNA and cpRECA localized to cp nucleoids in a heterogenous manner. Knockdown of <i>cpRECA</i> led to a significant reduction in cp nucleoid number that was accompanied by nucleoid enlargement. This phenotype resembled those of gyrase inhibitor-treated cells and <i>monokaryotic chloroplast</i> mutant cells and suggested that cpRECA was involved in organizing cp nucleoid dynamics. The cp genome also was destabilized by induced recombination between short <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed repeats in <i>cpRECA-</i>knockdown cells and gyrase inhibitor-treated cells. Taken together, these results suggest that cpRECA and gyrase are both involved in nucleoid dynamics and the maintenance of genome integrity and that the mechanisms underlying these processes may be intimately related in <i>C. reinhardtii</i> cps.</p>

Observation of Dicke cooperativity in magnetic interactions
<p>The interaction of <i>N</i> two-level atoms with a single-mode light field is an extensively studied many-body problem in quantum optics, first analyzed by Dicke in the context of superradiance. A characteristic of such systems is the cooperative enhancement of the coupling strength by a factor of [Formula]. In this study, we extended this cooperatively enhanced coupling to a solid-state system, demonstrating that it also occurs in a magnetic solid in the form of matter-matter interaction. Specifically, the exchange interaction of <i>N</i> paramagnetic erbium(III) (Er<sup>3+</sup>) spins with an iron(III) (Fe<sup>3+</sup>) magnon field in erbium orthoferrite (ErFeO<sub>3</sub>) exhibits a vacuum Rabi splitting whose magnitude is proportional to [Formula].

The earliest modern humans outside Africa
<p>To date, the earliest modern human fossils found outside of Africa are dated to around 90,000 to 120,000 years ago at the Levantine sites of Skhul and Qafzeh. A maxilla and associated dentition recently discovered at Misliya Cave, Israel, was dated to 177,000 to 194,000 years ago, suggesting that members of the <i>Homo sapiens</i> clade left Africa earlier than previously thought. This finding changes our view on modern human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>al and is consistent with recent genetic studies, which have posited the possibility of an earlier <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>al of <i>Homo sapiens</i> around 220,000 years ago.

Early spectra of the gravitational wave source GW170817: Evolution of a neutron star merger
<p>On 17 August 2017, Swope Supernova Survey 2017a (SSS17a) was discovered as the optical counterpart of the binary neutron star gravitational wave event GW170817. We report time-series spectroscopy of SSS17a from 11.75 hours until 8.5 days after the merger. Over the first hour of observations, the ejecta rapidly expanded and cooled. Applying blackbody fits to the spectra, we measured the photosphere cooling from [Formula] to [Formula] kelvin, and determined a photospheric velocity of roughly 30% of the speed of light. The spectra of SSS17a began displaying broad features after 1.46 days and evolved qualitatively over each subsequent day, with distinct blue (early-time) and red (late-time) components. The late-time component is consistent with theoretical models of r-process–enriched neutron star ejecta, whereas the blue component requires high-velocity, lanthanide-free material.</p>

Tsunami-driven rafting: Transoceanic species dispersal and implications for marine biogeography

Observation of a large-scale anisotropy in the arrival directions of cosmic rays above 8 × 10<sup>18</sup> eV

Direction-specific van der Waals attraction between rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> nanocrystals
<p>Mutual lattice orientations dictate the types and magnitudes of forces between crystalline particles. When lattice polarizability is anisotropic, the van der Waals <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ion attraction can, in principle, contribute to this direction dependence. We report measurement of this attraction between rutile nanocrystals, as a function of their mutual orientation and surface hydration extent. At tens of nanometers of separation, the attraction is weak and shows no dependence on azimuthal alignment or surface hydration. At separations of approximately one hydration layer, the attraction is strongly dependent on azimuthal alignment and systematically decreases as intervening water density increases. Measured forces closely agree with predictions from Lifshitz theory and show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ion forces can generate a torque between particles interacting in solution and between grains in materials.</p>

On the basis of a low Faraday rotation (12.0 ± 0.7 radians per square meter), we infer negligible magnetization in the circum-burst plasma and constrain the net magnetization of the cosmic web along this sightline to <21 nanogauss, parallel to the line-of-sight.

Buffer-gas cooling of antiprotonic helium to 1.5 to 1.7 K, and antiproton-to–electron mass ratio
<p>Charge, parity, and time reversal (CPT) symmetry implies that a particle and its antiparticle have the same mass. The antiproton-to-electron mass ratio [Formula] can be precisely determined from the single-photon transition frequencies of antiprotonic helium. We measured 13 such frequencies with laser spectroscopy to a fractional precision of 2.5 × 10<sup>−9</sup> to 16 × 10<sup>−9</sup>. About 2 × 10<sup>9</sup> antiprotonic helium atoms were cooled to temperatures between 1.5 and 1.7 kelvin by using buffer-gas cooling in cryogenic low-pressure helium gas; the narrow thermal distribution led to the observation of sharp spectral lines of small thermal Doppler width. The deviation between the experimental frequencies and the results of three-body quantum electrodynamics calculations was reduced by a factor of 1.4 to 10 compared with previous single-photon experiments. From this, [Formula] was determined as 1836.1526734(15), which agrees with a recent proton-to-electron experimental value within 8 × 10<sup>−10</sup>.</p>

Even-denominator fractional quantum Hall states in bilayer graphene
<p>The distinct Landau level spectrum of bilayer graphene (BLG) is predicted to support a non-abelian even-denominator fractional quantum Hall (FQH) state similar to the [Formula] state first identified in GaAs. However, the nature of this state has remained difficult to characterize. Here, we report transport measurements of a robust sequence of even-denominator FQH in dual-gated BLG devices. Parallel field measurement confirms the spin-polarized nature of the ground state, which is consistent with the Pfaffian/anti-Pfaffian description. The sensitivity of the even-denominator states to both filling fraction and transverse displacement field provides new opportunities for tunability. Our results suggest that BLG is a platform in which topological ground states with possible non-abelian excitations can be manipulated and controlled.</p>

Single polymer growth dynamics
<p>In chain-growth polymerization, a chain grows continually to reach thousands of subunits. However, the real-time dynamics of chain growth remains unknown. Using magnetic tweezers, we visualized real-time polymer growth at the single-polymer level. Focusing on ring-opening metathesis polymerization, we found that the extension of a growing polymer under a pulling force does not increase continuously but exhibits wait-and-jump steps. These steps are attributable to the formation and unraveling of conformational entanglements from newly incorporated monomers, whose key features can be recapitulated with molecular dynamics simulations. The configurations of these entanglements appear to play a key role in determining the polymerization rates and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ion among individual polymers.</p>

Spatiotemporal mode-locking in multimode fiber lasers
<p>A laser is based on the electromagnetic modes of its resonator, which provides the feedback required for oscillation. Enormous progress has been made toward controlling the interactions of longitudinal modes in lasers with a single transverse mode. For example, the field of ultrafast science has been built on lasers that lock many longitudinal modes together to form ultrashort light pulses. However, coherent superposition of longitudinal and transverse modes in a laser has received little attention. We show that modal and chromatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ions in fiber lasers can be counteracted by strong spatial and spectral filtering. This allows locking of multiple transverse and longitudinal modes to create ultrashort pulses with a variety of spatiotemporal profiles.

Dengue diversity across spatial and temporal scales: Local structure and the effect of host population size
<p>A fundamental mystery for dengue and other infectious pathogens is how observed patterns of cases relate to actual chains of individual transmission events. These pathways are intimately tied to the mechanisms by which strains interact and compete across spatial scales. Phylogeographic methods have been used to characterize pathogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>al at global and regional scales but have yielded few insights into the local spatiotemporal structure of endemic transmission. Using geolocated genotype (800 cases) and serotype (17,291 cases) data, we show that in Bangkok, Thailand, 60% of dengue cases living <200 meters apart come from the same transmission chain, as opposed to 3% of cases separated by 1 to 5 kilometers. At distances <200 meters from a case (encompassing an average of 1300 people in Bangkok), the effective number of chains is 1.7. This number rises by a factor of 7 for each 10-fold increase in the population of the “enclosed” region. This trend is observed regardless of whether population density or area increases, though increases in density over 7000 people per square kilometer do not lead to additional chains. Within Thailand these chains quickly mix, and by the next dengue season viral lineages are no longer highly spatially structured within the country. In contrast, viral flow to neighboring countries is limited. These findings are consistent with local, density-dependent transmission and implicate densely populated communities as key sources of viral diversity, with home location the focal point of transmission. These findings have important implications for targeted vector control and active surveillance.</p>

Direct observation of individual hydrogen atoms at trapping sites in a ferritic steel
<p>The design of atomic-scale microstructural traps to limit the diffusion of hydrogen is one key strategy in the development of hydrogen-embrittlement–resistant materials. In the case of bearing steels, an effective trapping mechanism may be the incorporation of finely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed V-Mo-Nb carbides in a ferrite matrix. First, we charged a ferritic steel with deuterium by means of electrolytic loading to achieve a high hydrogen concentration. We then immobilized it in the microstructure with a cryogenic transfer protocol before atom probe tomography (APT) analysis. Using APT, we show trapping of hydrogen within the core of these carbides with quantitative composition profiles. Furthermore, with this method the experiment can be feasibly replicated in any APT-equipped laboratory by using a simple cold chain.</p>

Decoupled ecomorphological evolution and diversification in Neogene-Quaternary horses
<p>Evolutionary theory has long proposed a connection between trait evolution and diversification rates. In this work, we used phylogenetic methods to evaluate the relationship of lineage-specific speciation rates and the mode of evolution of body size and tooth morphology in the Neogene and Quaternary radiation of horses (7 living and 131 extinct species). We show that diversification pulses are a recurrent feature of equid evolution but that these pulses are not correlated with rapid bursts in phenotypic evolution. Instead, rapid cladogenesis seems repeatedly associated with extrinsic factors that relaxed diversity bounds, such as increasing productivity and geographic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>als into the Old World. This evidence suggests that diversity dynamics in Equinae were controlled mainly by ecological limits under diversity dependence rather than rapid ecomorphological differentiation.</p>

Molecular gas in the halo fuels the growth of a massive cluster galaxy at high redshift
<p>The largest galaxies in the universe reside in galaxy clusters. Using sensitive observations of carbon monoxide, we show that the Spiderweb galaxy—a massive galaxy in a distant protocluster—is forming from a large reservoir of molecular gas. Most of this molecular gas lies between the protocluster galaxies and has low velocity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ion, indicating that it is part of an enriched intergalactic medium. This may constitute the reservoir of gas that fuels the widespread star formation seen in earlier ultraviolet observations of the Spiderweb galaxy. Our results support the notion that giant galaxies in clusters formed from extended regions of recycled gas at high redshift.</p>

Command of active matter by topological defects and patterns

By <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ing swimming <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> in a liquid crystalline environment with spatially varying orientation of the anisotropy axis, we demonstrate control over the distribution of bacterial concentration, as well as the geometry and polarity of their trajectories. Bacteria recognize subtle differences in liquid crystal deformations, engaging in bipolar swimming in regions of pure splay and bend but switching to unipolar swimming in mixed splay-bend regions. They differentiate topological defects, heading toward defects of positive topological charge and avoiding negative charges. Sensitivity of bacteria to preimposed orientational patterns represents a previously unknown facet of the interplay between hydrodynamics and topology of active matter.</p>

Extensive migration of young neurons into the infant human frontal lobe
<p>The first few months after birth, when a child begins to interact with the environment, are critical to human brain development. The human frontal lobe is important for social behavior and executive function; it has increased in size and complexity relative to other species, but the processes that have contributed to this expansion are unknown. Our studies of postmortem infant human brains revealed a collection of neurons that migrate and integrate widely into the frontal lobe during infancy. Chains of young neurons move tangentially close to the walls of the lateral ventricles and along blood vessels. These cells then individually <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>e long distances to reach cortical tissue, where they differentiate and contribute to inhibitory circuits.

Ballistic miniband conduction in a graphene superlattice
<p>Rational design of long-period artificial lattices yields effects unavailable in simple solids. The moiré pattern in highly aligned graphene/hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) heterostructures is a lateral superlattice with high electron mobility and an unusual electronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ion whose miniband edges and saddle points can be reached by electrostatic gating. We investigated the dynamics of electrons in moiré minibands by measuring ballistic transport between adjacent local contacts in a magnetic field, known as the transverse electron focusing effect. At low temperatures, we observed caustics of skipping orbits extending over hundreds of superlattice periods, reversals of the cyclotron revolution for successive minibands, and breakdown of cyclotron motion near van Hove singularities. At high temperatures, electron-electron collisions suppress focusing. Probing such miniband conduction properties is a necessity for engineering novel transport behaviors in superlattice devices.</p>

Electron optics with p-n junctions in ballistic graphene
<p>Electrons transmitted across a ballistic semiconductor junction are expected to undergo refraction, analogous to light rays across an optical boundary. In graphene, the linear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ion and zero-gap band structure admit highly transparent p-n junctions by simple electrostatic gating. Here, we employ transverse magnetic focusing to probe the propagation of carriers across an electrostatically defined graphene junction. We find agreement with the predicted Snell’s law for electrons, including the observation of both positive and negative refraction. Resonant transmission across the p-n junction provides a direct measurement of the angle-dependent transmission coefficient. Comparing experimental data with simulations reveals the crucial role played by the effective junction width, providing guidance for future device design. Our results pave the way for realizing electron optics based on graphene p-n junctions.</p>

Ancient DNA reveals elephant birds and kiwi are sister taxa and clarifies ratite bird evolution
<p>The evolution of the ratite birds has been widely attributed to vicariant speciation, driven by the Cretaceous breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana. The early isolation of Africa and Madagascar implies that the ostrich and extinct Madagascan elephant birds (Aepyornithidae) should be the oldest ratite lineages. We sequenced the mitochondrial genomes of two elephant birds and performed phylogenetic analyses, which revealed that these birds are the closest relatives of the New Zealand kiwi and are distant from the basal ratite lineage of ostriches. This unexpected result strongly contradicts continental vicariance and instead supports flighted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>al in all major ratite lineages. We suggest that convergence toward gigantism and flightlessness was facilitated by early Tertiary expansion into the diurnal herbivory niche after the extinction of the dinosaurs.</p>

The Vertebral Column of <i>Australopithecus sediba</i>
<p>Two partial vertebral columns of <i>Australopithecus sediba</i> grant insight into aspects of early hominin spinal mobility, lumbar curvature, vertebral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">formula</span></strong>, and transitional vertebra position. <i>Au. sediba</i> likely possessed five non–rib-bearing lumbar vertebrae and five sacral elements, the same configuration that occurs modally in modern humans. This finding contrasts with other interpretations of early hominin regional vertebral numbers. Importantly, the transitional vertebra is distinct from and above the last rib-bearing vertebra in <i>Au. sediba</i>, resulting in a functionally longer lower back. This configuration, along with a strongly wedged last lumbar vertebra and other indicators of lordotic posture, would have contributed to a highly flexible spine that is derived compared with earlier members of the genus <i>Australopithecus</i> and similar to that of the Nariokotome <i>Homo erectus</i> skeleton.</p>

Massive Tandem Proliferation of ELIPs Supports Convergent Evolution of Desiccation Tolerance across Land Plants
<p>Desiccation tolerance was a critical adaptation for the colonization of land by early nonvascular plants. Resurrection plants have maintained or rewired these ancestral protective mechanisms, and desiccation-tolerant species are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed across the land plant phylogeny. Although common physiological, biochemical, and molecular signatures are observed across resurrection plant lineages, features underlying the recurrent evolution of desiccation tolerance are unknown. Here we used a comparative approach to identify patterns of genome evolution and gene duplication associated with desiccation tolerance. We identified a single gene family with dramatic expansion in all sequenced resurrection plant genomes and no expansion in desiccation-sensitive species. This gene family of early light-induced proteins (ELIPs) expanded in resurrection plants convergent through repeated tandem gene duplication. ELIPs are universally highly expressed during desiccation in all surveyed resurrection plants and may play a role in protecting against photooxidative damage of the photosynthetic apparatus during prolonged dehydration. Photosynthesis is particularly sensitive to dehydration, and the increased abundance of ELIPs may help facilitate the rapid recovery observed for most resurrection plants. Together, these observations support convergent evolution of desiccation tolerance in land plants through tandem gene duplication.</p>

Time-Course Transcriptome Analysis of Arabidopsis Siliques Discloses Genes Essential for Fruit Development and Maturation
<p>Fruits protect the developing seeds of angiosperms and actively contribute to seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ion. Furthermore, fruit and seed development are highly synchronized and require exchange of information between the mother plant and the developing generations. To explore the mechanisms controlling fruit formation and maturation, we performed a transcriptomic analysis on the valve tissue of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) silique using RNA sequencing. In doing so, we have generated a data set of differentially regulated genes that will help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that underpin the initial phase of fruit growth and, subsequently, trigger fruit maturation. The robustness of our data set has been tested by functional genomic studies. Using a reverse genetics approach, we selected 10 differentially expressed genes and explored the consequences of their disruption for both silique growth and senescence. We found that genes contained in our data set play essential roles in different stages of silique development and maturation, indicating that our transcriptome-based gene list is a powerful tool for the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms controlling fruit formation in Arabidopsis.</p>

A Maternally Deposited Endosperm Cuticle Contributes to the Physiological Defects of <i>transparent testa</i> Seeds
<p>Mature dry seeds are highly resilient plant structures where the encapsulated embryo is kept protected and dormant to facilitate its ultimate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ion. Seed viability is heavily dependent on the seed coat’s capacity to shield living tissues from mechanical and oxidative stress. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the seed coat, also called the testa, arises after the differentiation of maternal ovular integuments during seed development. We recently described a thick cuticle tightly embedded in the mature seed’s endosperm cell wall. We show here that it is produced by the maternal inner integument 1 layer and, remarkably, transferred to the developing endosperm. Arabidopsis <i>transparent testa</i> (<i>tt</i>) mutations cause maternally derived seed coat pigmentation defects. <i>TT</i> gene products encode proteins involved in flavonoid metabolism and regulators of seed coat development. <i>tt</i> mutants have abnormally high seed coat permeability, resulting in lower seed viability and dormancy. However, the biochemical basis of this high permeability is not fully understood. We show that the cuticles of developing <i>tt</i> mutant integuments have profound structural defects, which are associated with enhanced cuticle permeability. Genetic analysis indicates that a functional proanthocyanidin synthesis pathway is required to limit cuticle permeability, and our results suggest that proanthocyanidins could be intrinsic components of the cuticle. Together, these results show that the formation of a maternal cuticle is an intrinsic part of the normal integumental differentiation program leading to testa formation and is essential for the seed’s physiological properties.</p>

RECX Interacts with Mitochondrial RECA to Maintain Mitochondrial Genome Stability
<p>The chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes are essential for photosynthesis and respiration, respectively. RECA and RECG, which are plant-specific homologs of the bacterial homologous recombination repair proteins RecA and RecG, maintain organelle genome stability by suppressing aberrant recombination between short <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed repeats (SDRs) in the moss <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. In this study, we analyzed the plant-specific factor RECX, a homolog of bacterial RecX that regulates RecA. RECX fused to GFP colocalized with mitochondrial RECA1 and chloroplast RECA2 on mitochondrial and chloroplast nucleoids, respectively. Knockout (KO) and overexpression (OEX) of <i>RECX</i> did not alter the <i>P. patens</i> morphological phenotype. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA, however, showed that products from recombination between SDRs increased significantly in <i>RECX</i> OEX mitochondria and modestly in <i>RECX</i> KO mitochondria. By contrast, analysis of chloroplast DNA revealed no substantial alteration in the number of products from recombination between SDRs in <i>RECX</i> KO and OEX chloroplasts. Yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed interactions between RECX and RECA1 and between RECX and RECA2. Expression profiles showed a positive correlation between <i>RECX</i> and factors maintaining the stability of both organelle genomes and <i>RECA1</i>. Collectively, these results suggest that RECX maintains mitochondrial genome stability, likely by modulating RECA1 activity, and that the compromised function of RECX induces mitochondrial genome instability.</p>

Exocyst Subunit EXO70H4 Has a Specific Role in Callose Synthase Secretion and Silica Accumulation<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Biogenesis of the plant secondary cell wall involves many important aspects, such as phenolic compound deposition and often silica encrustation. Previously, we demonstrated the importance of the exocyst subunit EXO70H4 for biogenesis of the trichome secondary cell wall, namely for deposition of the autofluorescent and callose-rich cell wall layer. Here, we reveal that EXO70H4-driven cell wall biogenesis is constitutively active in the mature trichome, but also can be activated elsewhere upon pathogen attack, giving this study a broader significance with an overlap into phytopathology. To address the specificity of EXO70H4 among the EXO70 family, we complemented the <i>exo70H4-1</i> mutant by 18 different Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) EXO70 paralogs subcloned under the EXO70H4 promoter. Only EXO70H4 had the capacity to rescue the <i>exo70H4</i>-<i>1</i> trichome phenotype. Callose deposition phenotype of <i>exo70H4-1</i> mutant is caused by impaired secretion of PMR4, a callose synthase responsible for the synthesis of callose in the trichome. PMR4 colocalizes with EXO70H4 on plasma membrane microdomains that do not develop in the <i>exo70H4-1</i> mutant. Using energy-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ive x-ray microanalysis, we show that both EXO70H4- and PMR4-dependent callose deposition in the trichome are essential for cell wall silicification.</p>

The <i>RIN-MC</i> Fusion of MADS-Box Transcription Factors Has Transcriptional Activity and Modulates Expression of Many Ripening Genes
<p>Fruit development and ripening is regulated by genetic and environmental factors and is of critical importance for seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>al, reproduction, and fruit quality. Tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) <i>ripening inhibitor</i> (<i>rin</i>) mutant fruit have a classic ripening-inhibited phenotype, which is attributed to a genomic DNA deletion resulting in the fusion of two truncated transcription factors, <i>RIN</i> and <i>MC</i>. In wild-type fruit, RIN, a MADS-box transcription factor, is a key regulator of the ripening gene expression network, with hundreds of gene targets controlling changes in color, flavor, texture, and taste during tomato fruit ripening; <i>MC</i>, on the other hand, has low expression in fruit, and the potential functions of the <i>RIN-MC</i> fusion gene in ripening remain unclear. Here, overexpression of <i>RIN-MC</i> in transgenic wild-type cv Ailsa Craig tomato fruits impaired several ripening processes, and down-regulating <i>RIN-MC</i> expression in the <i>rin</i> mutant was found to stimulate the normal yellow mutant fruit to produce a weak red color, suggesting a distinct negative role for <i>RIN-MC</i> in tomato fruit ripening. By comparative transcriptome analysis of <i>rin</i> and <i>rin 35S</i>::<i>RIN-MC</i> RNA interference fruits, a total of 1,168 and 1,234 genes were identified as potential targets of RIN-MC activation and inhibition. Furthermore, the <i>RIN-MC</i> fusion gene was shown to be translated into a chimeric transcription factor that was localized to the nucleus and was capable of protein interactions with other MADS-box factors. These results indicated that tomato RIN-MC fusion plays a negative role in ripening and encodes a chimeric transcription factor that modulates the expression of many ripening genes, thereby contributing to the <i>rin</i> mutant phenotype.</p>

Physical Mapping of Amplified Copies of the 5-Enolpyruvylshikimate-3-Phosphate Synthase Gene in Glyphosate-Resistant <i>Amaranthus tuberculatus</i><xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Recent and rapid evolution of resistance to glyphosate, the most widely used herbicides, in several weed species, including common waterhemp (<i>Amaranthus tuberculatus</i>), poses a serious threat to sustained crop production. We report that glyphosate resistance in <i>A</i>. <i>tuberculatus</i> was due to amplification of the 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-P synthase (<i>EPSPS</i>) gene, which encodes the molecular target of glyphosate. There was a positive correlation between <i>EPSPS</i> gene copies and its transcript expression. We analyzed the distribution of <i>EPSPS</i> copies in the genome of <i>A</i>. <i>tuberculatus</i> using fluorescence in situ hybridization on mitotic metaphase chromosomes and interphase nuclei. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis mapped the <i>EPSPS</i> gene to pericentromeric regions of two homologous chromosomes in glyphosate sensitive <i>A</i>. <i>tuberculatus</i>. In glyphosate-resistant plants, a cluster of <i>EPSPS</i> genes on the pericentromeric region on one pair of homologous chromosomes was detected. Intriguingly, two highly glyphosate-resistant plants harbored an additional chromosome with several <i>EPSPS</i> copies besides the native chromosome pair with <i>EPSPS</i> copies. These results suggest that the initial event of <i>EPSPS</i> gene duplication may have occurred because of unequal recombination mediated by repetitive DNA. Subsequently, gene amplification may have resulted via several other mechanisms, such as chromosomal rearrangements, deletion/insertion, transposon-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ion, or possibly by interspecific hybridization. This report illustrates the physical mapping of amplified <i>EPSPS</i> copies in <i>A</i>. <i>tuberculatus</i>.</p>

Brown and Polar Bear Y Chromosomes Reveal Extensive Male-Biased Gene Flow within Brother Lineages
<p>Brown and polar bears have become prominent examples in phylogeography, but previous phylogeographic studies relied largely on maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or were geographically restricted. The male-specific Y chromosome, a natural counterpart to mtDNA, has remained underexplored. Although this paternally inherited chromosome is indispensable for comprehensive analyses of phylogeographic patterns, technical difficulties and low variability have hampered its application in most mammals. We developed 13 novel Y-chromosomal sequence and microsatellite markers from the polar bear genome and screened these in a broad geographic sample of 130 brown and polar bears. We also analyzed a 390-kb-long Y-chromosomal scaffold using sequencing data from published male ursine genomes. Y chromosome evidence support the emerging understanding that brown and polar bears started to diverge no later than the Middle Pleistocene. Contrary to mtDNA patterns, we found 1) brown and polar bears to be reciprocally monophyletic sister (or rather brother) lineages, without signals of introgression, 2) male-biased gene flow across continents and on phylogeographic time scales, and 3) male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>al that links the Alaskan ABC islands population to mainland brown bears. Due to female philopatry, mtDNA provides a highly structured estimate of population differentiation, while male-biased gene flow is a homogenizing force for nuclear genetic variation. Our findings highlight the importance of analyzing both maternally and paternally inherited loci for a comprehensive view of phylogeographic history, and that mtDNA-based phylogeographic studies of many mammals should be reevaluated. Recent advances in sequencing technology render the analysis of Y-chromosomal variation feasible, even in nonmodel organisms.</p>

Y Chromosome Analysis of Dingoes and Southeast Asian Village Dogs Suggests a Neolithic Continental Expansion from Southeast Asia Followed by Multiple Austronesian Dispersals
<p>Dogs originated more than 14,000 BP, but the location(s) where they first arose is uncertain. The earliest archeological evidence of ancient dogs was discovered in Europe and the Middle East, some 5–7 millennia before that from Southeast Asia. However, mitochondrial DNA analyses suggest that most modern dogs derive from Southeast Asia, which has fueled the controversial hypothesis that dog domestication originated in this region despite the lack of supporting archeological evidence. We propose and investigate with Y chromosomes an alternative hypothesis for the proximate origins of dogs from Southeast Asia—a massive Neolithic expansion of dogs from this region that largely replaced more primitive dogs to the west and north. Previous attempts to test matrilineal findings with independent patrilineal markers have lacked the necessary genealogical resolution and mutation rate estimates. Here, we used Y chromosome genotypes, composed of 29 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) and 5 single tandem repeats (STRs), from 338 Australian dingoes, New Guinea singing dogs, and village dogs from Island Southeast Asia, along with modern European breed dogs, to estimate the evolutionary mutation rates of Y chromosome STRs based on calibration to the independently known age of the dingo population. Dingoes exhibited a unique haplogroup characterized by a single distinguishing SNP mutation and 14 STR haplotypes. The age of the European haplogroup was estimated to be only 1.7 times older than that of the dingo population, suggesting an origin during the Neolithic rather than the Paleolithic (as predicted by the Southeast Asian origins hypothesis). We hypothesize that isolation of Neolithic dogs from wolves in Southeast Asia was a key step accelerating their phenotypic transformation, enhancing their value in trade and as cargo, and enabling them to rapidly expand and replace more primitive dogs to the West. Our findings also suggest that dingoes could have arrived in Australia directly from Taiwan, independently of later <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>als of dogs through Thailand to Island Southeast Asia.</p>

Reduction of blood oxygen levels enhances postprandial cardiac hypertrophy in Burmese python (<i>Python bivittatus</i>)
<p>Physiological cardiac hypertrophy is characterized by reversible enlargement of cardiomyocytes and changes in chamber architecture, which increase stroke volume and [Formula] via augmented convective oxygen transport. Cardiac hypertrophy is known to occur in response to repeated elevations of O<sub>2</sub> demand and/or reduced O<sub>2</sub> supply in several species of vertebrate ectotherms, including postprandial Burmese pythons (<i>Python bivittatus</i>). Recent data suggest postprandial cardiac hypertrophy in <i>P. bivittatus</i> is a facultative rather than obligatory response to digestion, though the triggers of this response are unknown. Here, we hypothesized that an O<sub>2</sub> supply–demand mismatch stimulates postprandial cardiac enlargement in Burmese pythons. To test this hypothesis, we rendered animals anemic prior to feeding, essentially halving blood oxygen content during the postprandial period. Fed anemic animals had heart rates 126% higher than those of fasted controls, which, coupled with a 71% increase in mean arterial pressure, suggests fed anemic animals were experiencing significantly elevated cardiac work. We found significant cardiac hypertrophy in fed anemic animals, which exhibited ventricles 39% larger than those of fasted controls and 28% larger than in fed controls. These findings support our hypothesis that those animals with a greater magnitude of O<sub>2</sub> supply–demand mismatch exhibit the largest hearts. The ‘low O<sub>2</sub> signal’ stimulating postprandial cardiac hypertrophy is likely mediated by elevated ventricular wall stress associated with postprandial hemodynamics.</p>

MerTK signaling in macrophages promotes the synthesis of inflammation resolution mediators by suppressing CaMKII activity
<p>Inflammation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion counterbalances excessive inflammation and restores tissue homeostasis after injury. Failure of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion contributes to the pathology of numerous chronic inflammatory diseases. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion is mediated by endogenous specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs), which are derived from long-chain fatty acids by lipoxygenase (LOX) enzymes. 5-LOX plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of two classes of SPMs: lipoxins and resolvins. Cytoplasmic localization of the nonphosphorylated form of 5-LOX is essential for SPM biosynthesis, whereas nuclear localization of phosphorylated 5-LOX promotes proinflammatory leukotriene production. We previously showed that MerTK, an efferocytosis receptor on macrophages, promotes SPM biosynthesis by increasing the abundance of nonphosphorylated, cytoplasmic 5-LOX. We now show that activation of MerTK in human macrophages led to ERK-mediated expression of the gene encoding sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2 (SERCA2), which decreased the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration and suppressed the activity of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). This, in turn, reduced the activities of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 and the kinase MK2, resulting in the increased abundance of the nonphosphorylated, cytoplasmic form of 5-LOX and enhanced SPM biosynthesis. In a zymosan-induced peritonitis model, an inflammatory setting in which macrophage MerTK activation promotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion, inhibition of ERK activation delayed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion, which was characterized by an increased number of neutrophils and decreased amounts of SPMs in tissue exudates. These findings contribute to our understanding of how MerTK signaling induces 5-LOX–derived SPM biosynthesis and suggest a therapeutic strategy to boost inflammation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion in settings where defective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion promotes disease progression.</p>

Atomic-resolution transmission electron microscopy of electron beam–sensitive crystalline materials
<p>High-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion imaging of electron beam–sensitive materials is one of the most difficult applications of transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The challenges are manifold, including the acquisition of images with extremely low beam doses, the time-constrained search for crystal zone axes, the precise image alignment, and the accurate determination of the defocus value. We develop a suite of methods to fulfill these requirements and acquire atomic-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion TEM images of several metal organic frameworks that are generally recognized as highly sensitive to electron beams. The high image <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion allows us to identify individual metal atomic columns, various types of surface termination, and benzene rings in the organic linkers. We also apply our methods to other electron beam–sensitive materials, including the organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbBr<sub>3</sub>.</p>

Structure Annotation and Quantification of Wheat Seed Oxidized Lipids by High-Resolution LC-MS/MS
<p>Lipid oxidation is a process ubiquitous in life, but the direct and comprehensive analysis of oxidized lipids has been limited by available analytical methods. We applied high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to quantify oxidized lipids (glycerides, fatty acids, phospholipids, lysophospholipids, and galactolipids) and implemented a platform-independent high-throughput-amenable analysis pipeline for the high-confidence annotation and acyl composition analysis of oxidized lipids. Lipid contents of 90 different naturally aged wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) seed stocks were quantified in an untargeted high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion LC-MS experiment, resulting in 18,556 quantitative mass-to-charge ratio features. In a posthoc liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry experiment, high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion MS/MS spectra (5 mD accuracy) were recorded for 8,957 out of 12,080 putatively monoisotopic features of the LC-MS data set. A total of 353 nonoxidized and 559 oxidized lipids with up to four additional oxygen atoms were annotated based on the accurate mass recordings (1.5 ppm tolerance) of the LC-MS data set and filtering procedures. MS/MS spectra available for 828 of these annotations were analyzed by translating experimentally known fragmentation rules of lipids into the fragmentation of oxidized lipids. This led to the identification of 259 nonoxidized and 365 oxidized lipids by both accurate mass and MS/MS spectra and to the determination of acyl compositions for 221 nonoxidized and 295 oxidized lipids. Analysis of 15-year aged wheat seeds revealed increased lipid oxidation and hydrolysis in seeds stored in ambient versus cold conditions.</p>

The apo-structure of the leucine sensor Sestrin2 is still elusive
<p>Sestrin2 is a GATOR2-interacting protein that directly binds leucine and is required for the inhibition of mTORC1 under leucine deprivation, indicating that it is a leucine sensor for the mTORC1 pathway. We recently reported the structure of Sestrin2 in complex with leucine [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID, 5DJ4] and demonstrated that mutations in the leucine-binding pocket that alter the affinity of Sestrin2 for leucine result in a corresponding change in the leucine sensitivity of mTORC1 in cells. A lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion structure of human Sestrin2 (PDB ID, 5CUF), which was crystallized in the absence of exogenous leucine, showed Sestrin2 to be in a nearly identical conformation as the leucine-bound structure. On the basis of this observation, it has been argued that leucine binding does not affect the conformation of Sestrin2 and that Sestrin2 may not be a sensor for leucine. We show that simple analysis of the reported “apo”-Sestrin2 structure reveals the clear presence of prominent, unmodeled electron density in the leucine-binding pocket that exactly accommodates the leucine observed in the higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion structure. Refining the reported apo-structure with leucine eliminated the large <i>F</i><sub>obs</sub>-<i>F</i><sub>calc</sub> difference density at this position and improved the working and free R factors of the model. Consistent with this result, our own structure of Sestrin2 crystallized in the absence of exogenous leucine also contained electron density that is best explained by leucine. Thus, the structure of apo-Sestrin2 remains elusive.</p>

Splenic leukocytes define the resolution of inflammation in heart failure
<p>Inflammation promotes healing in myocardial infarction but, if unresolved, leads to heart failure. To define the inflammatory and resolving responses, we quantified leukocyte trafficking and specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs) in the infarcted left ventricle and spleen after myocardial infarction, with the goal of distinguishing inflammation from its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion. Our data suggest that the spleen not only served as a leukocyte reservoir but also was the site where SPMs were actively generated after coronary ligation in mice. Before myocardial infarction, SPMs were more abundant in the spleen than in the left ventricle. At day 1 after coronary ligation, the spleen was depleted of leukocytes, a phenomenon that was associated with greater numbers of leukocytes in the infarcted left ventricle and increased generation of SPMs at the same site, particularly resolvins, maresin, lipoxins, and protectin. In addition, the infarcted left ventricle showed increased expression of genes encoding lipoxygenases and enhanced production of SPMs generated by these enzymes. We found that macrophages were necessary for SPM generation. The abundance of SPMs in the spleen before myocardial infarction and increased SPM concentrations in the infarcted left ventricle within 24 hours after myocardial infarction were temporally correlated with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion of inflammation. Thus, the acute inflammatory response coincided with the active resolving phase in post–myocardial infarction and suggests that further investigation into macrophage-derived SPMs in heart failure is warranted.</p>

Phase-only transmissive spatial light modulator based on tunable dielectric metasurface
<p>Rapidly developing augmented reality, solid-state light detection and ranging (LIDAR), and holographic display technologies require spatial light modulators (SLMs) with high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion and viewing angle to satisfy increasing customer demands. Performance of currently available SLMs is limited by their large pixel sizes on the order of several micrometers. Here, we propose a concept of tunable dielectric metasurfaces modulated by liquid crystal, which can provide abrupt phase change, thus enabling pixel-size miniaturization. We present a metasurface-based transmissive SLM, configured to generate active beam steering with >35% efficiency and a large beam deflection angle of 11°. The high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion and steering angle obtained provide opportunities to develop the next generation of LIDAR and display technologies.</p>

Cryo-EM structure of the mammalian ATP synthase tetramer bound with inhibitory protein IF1

We isolated porcine tetrameric ATP synthase and solved its structure at 6.2-angstrom <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion using a single-particle cryo–electron microscopy method. Two classical V-shaped ATP synthase dimers lie antiparallel to each other to form an H-shaped ATP synthase tetramer, as viewed from the matrix. ATP synthase inhibitory factor subunit 1 (IF1) is a well-known in vivo inhibitor of mammalian ATP synthase at low pH. Two IF1 dimers link two ATP synthase dimers, which is consistent with the ATP synthase tetramer adopting an inhibited state. Within the tetramer, we refined structures of intact ATP synthase in two different rotational conformations at 3.34- and 3.45-Å <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion.</p>

Mechanism of 5′ splice site transfer for human spliceosome activation
<p>The prespliceosome, comprising U1 and U2 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) bound to the precursor messenger RNA 5′ splice site (5′SS) and branch point sequence, associates with the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP to form the fully assembled precatalytic pre–B spliceosome. Here, we report cryo–electron microscopy structures of the human pre–B complex captured before U1 snRNP dissociation at 3.3-angstrom core <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion and the human tri-snRNP at 2.9-angstrom <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion. U1 snRNP inserts the 5′SS–U1 snRNA helix between the two RecA domains of the Prp28 DEAD-box helicase. Adenosine 5′-triphosphate–dependent closure of the Prp28 RecA domains releases the 5′SS to pair with the nearby U6 ACAGAGA-box sequence presented as a mobile loop. The structures suggest that formation of the 5′SS-ACAGAGA helix triggers remodeling of an intricate protein-RNA network to induce Brr2 helicase relocation to its loading sequence in U4 snRNA, enabling Brr2 to unwind the U4/U6 snRNA duplex to allow U6 snRNA to form the catalytic center of the spliceosome.</p>

Improving mechanical sensor performance through larger damping
<p>Mechanical resonances are used in a wide variety of devices, from smartphone accelerometers to computer clocks and from wireless filters to atomic force microscopes. Frequency stability, a critical performance metric, is generally assumed to be tantamount to resonance quality factor (the inverse of the linewidth and of the damping). We show that the frequency stability of resonant nanomechanical sensors can be improved by lowering the quality factor. At high bandwidths, quality-factor reduction is completely mitigated by increases in signal-to-noise ratio. At low bandwidths, notably, increased damping leads to better stability and sensor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion, with improvement proportional to damping. We confirm the findings by demonstrating temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion of 60 microkelvin at 300-hertz bandwidth.

We experimentally differentiated and assigned the Doppler-broadened features of two naturally occurring isotopes of rubidium atoms (<sup>87</sup>Rb and <sup>85</sup>Rb) according to the placement of their hyperfine energy states in a two-dimensional spectrum.</p>

Fabrication of fillable microparticles and other complex 3D microstructures
<p>Three-dimensional (3D) microstructures created by microfabrication and additive manufacturing have demonstrated value across a number of fields, ranging from biomedicine to microelectronics. However, the techniques used to create these devices each have their own characteristic set of advantages and limitations with regards to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion, material compatibility, and geometrical constraints that determine the types of microstructures that can be formed. We describe a microfabrication method, termed StampEd Assembly of polymer Layers (SEAL), and create injectable pulsatile drug-delivery microparticles, pH sensors, and 3D microfluidic devices that we could not produce using traditional 3D printing. SEAL allows us to generate microstructures with complex geometry at high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion, produce fully enclosed internal cavities containing a solid or liquid, and use potentially any thermoplastic material without processing additives.</p>

Spectral narrowing of x-ray pulses for precision spectroscopy with nuclear resonances
<p>Spectroscopy of nuclear resonances offers a wide range of applications due to the remarkable energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion afforded by their narrow linewidths. However, progress toward higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion is inhibited at modern x-ray sources because they deliver only a tiny fraction of the photons on resonance, with the remainder contributing to an off-resonant background. We devised an experimental setup that uses the fast mechanical motion of a resonant target to manipulate the spectrum of a given x-ray pulse and to redistribute off-resonant spectral intensity onto the resonance. As a consequence, the resonant pulse brilliance is increased while the off-resonant background is reduced. Because our method is compatible with existing and upcoming pulsed x-ray sources, we anticipate that this approach will find applications that require ultranarrow x-ray resonances.</p>

Nanoscale nuclear magnetic resonance with chemical resolution
<p>Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a key analytical technique in chemistry, biology, and medicine. However, conventional NMR spectroscopy requires an at least nanoliter-sized sample volume to achieve sufficient signal. We combined the use of a quantum memory and high magnetic fields with a dedicated quantum sensor based on nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond to achieve chemical shift <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion in <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>19</sup>F NMR spectroscopy of 20-zeptoliter sample volumes. We demonstrate the application of NMR pulse sequences to achieve homonuclear decoupling and spin diffusion measurements. The best measured NMR linewidth of a liquid sample was ~1 part per million, mainly limited by molecular diffusion. To mitigate the influence of diffusion, we performed high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion solid-state NMR by applying homonuclear decoupling and achieved a 20-fold narrowing of the NMR linewidth.</p>

Quantum sensing with arbitrary frequency resolution
<p>Quantum sensing takes advantage of well-controlled quantum systems for performing measurements with high sensitivity and precision. We have implemented a concept for quantum sensing with arbitrary frequency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion, independent of the qubit probe and limited only by the stability of an external synchronization clock. Our concept makes use of quantum lock-in detection to continuously probe a signal of interest. Using the electronic spin of a single nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond, we demonstrate detection of oscillating magnetic fields with a frequency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion of 70 microhertz over a megahertz bandwidth. The continuous sampling further guarantees an enhanced sensitivity, reaching a signal-to-noise ratio in excess of 10<sup>4</sup> for a 170-nanotesla test signal measured during a 1-hour interval. Our technique has applications in magnetic resonance spectroscopy, quantum simulation, and sensitive signal detection.</p>

The extent of forest in dryland biomes
<p>Dryland biomes cover two-fifths of Earth’s land surface, but their forest area is poorly known. Here, we report an estimate of global forest extent in dryland biomes, based on analyzing more than 210,000 0.5-hectare sample plots through a photo-interpretation approach using large databases of satellite imagery at (i) very high spatial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion and (ii) very high temporal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion, which are available through the Google Earth platform. We show that in 2015, 1327 million hectares of drylands had more than 10% tree-cover, and 1079 million hectares comprised forest. Our estimate is 40 to 47% higher than previous estimates, corresponding to 467 million hectares of forest that have never been reported before. This increases current estimates of global forest cover by at least 9%.</p>

Revealing the subfemtosecond dynamics of orbital angular momentum in nanoplasmonic vortices
<p>The ability of light to carry and deliver orbital angular momentum (OAM) in the form of optical vortices has attracted much interest. The physical properties of light with a helical wavefront can be confined onto two-dimensional surfaces with subwavelength dimensions in the form of plasmonic vortices, opening avenues for thus far unknown light-matter interactions. Because of their extreme rotational velocity, the ultrafast dynamics of such vortices remained unexplored. Here we show the detailed spatiotemporal evolution of nanovortices using time-resolved two-photon photoemission electron microscopy. We observe both long- and short-range plasmonic vortices confined to deep subwavelength dimensions on the scale of 100 nanometers with nanometer spatial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion and subfemtosecond time-step <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion. Finally, by measuring the angular velocity of the vortex, we directly extract the OAM magnitude of light.</p>

Hidden dynamics in the unfolding of individual bacteriorhodopsin proteins
<p>Protein folding occurs as a set of transitions between structural states within an energy landscape. An oversimplified view of the folding process emerges when transiently populated states are undetected because of limited instrumental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion. Using force spectroscopy optimized for 1-microsecond <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion, we reexamined the unfolding of individual bacteriorhodopsin molecules in native lipid bilayers. The experimental data reveal the unfolding pathway in unprecedented detail. Numerous newly detected intermediates—many separated by as few as two or three amino acids—exhibited complex dynamics, including frequent refolding and state occupancies of <10 μs. Equilibrium measurements between such states enabled the folding free-energy landscape to be deduced. These results sharpen the picture of the mechanical unfolding of membrane proteins and, more broadly, enable experimental access to previously obscured protein dynamics.</p>

Time-resolved x-ray absorption spectroscopy with a water window high-harmonic source
<p>Time-resolved x-ray absorption spectroscopy (TR-XAS) has so far practically been limited to large-scale facilities, to subpicosecond temporal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion, and to the condensed phase. We report the realization of TR-XAS with a temporal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion in the low femtosecond range by developing a tabletop high-harmonic source reaching up to 350 electron volts, thus partially covering the spectral region of 280 to 530 electron volts, where water is transmissive. We used this source to follow previously unexamined light-induced chemical reactions in the lowest electronic states of isolated CF<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and SF<sub>6</sub><sup>+</sup> molecules in the gas phase. By probing element-specific core-to-valence transitions at the carbon K-edge or the sulfur L-edges, we characterized their reaction paths and observed the effect of symmetry breaking through the splitting of absorption bands and Rydberg-valence mixing induced by the geometry changes.</p>

Cryo-EM structures and atomic model of the HIV-1 strand transfer complex intasome
<p>Like all retroviruses, HIV-1 irreversibly inserts a viral DNA (vDNA) copy of its RNA genome into host target DNA (tDNA). The intasome, a higher-order nucleoprotein complex composed of viral integrase (IN) and the ends of linear vDNA, mediates integration. Productive integration into host chromatin results in the formation of the strand transfer complex (STC) containing catalytically joined vDNA and tDNA. HIV-1 intasomes have been refractory to high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion structural studies. We used a soluble IN fusion protein to facilitate structural studies, through which we present a high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the core tetrameric HIV-1 STC and a higher-order form that adopts carboxyl-terminal domain rearrangements.

Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Resolves Molecular Relationships Among Individual Plant Cells
<p>Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has been used extensively to study cell-specific gene expression in animals, but it has not been widely applied to plants. Here, we describe the use of a commercially available droplet-based microfluidics platform for high-throughput scRNA-seq to obtain single-cell transcriptomes from protoplasts of more than 10,000 Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) root cells. We find that all major tissues and developmental stages are represented in this single-cell transcriptome population. Further, distinct subpopulations and rare cell types, including putative quiescent center cells, were identified. A focused analysis of root epidermal cell transcriptomes defined developmental trajectories for individual cells progressing from meristematic through mature stages of root-hair and nonhair cell differentiation. In addition, single-cell transcriptomes were obtained from root epidermis mutants, enabling a comparative analysis of gene expression at single-cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion and providing an unprecedented view of the impact of the mutated genes. Overall, this study demonstrates the feasibility and utility of scRNA-seq in plants and provides a first-generation gene expression map of the Arabidopsis root at single-cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion.</p>

Nuclear Transcriptomes at High Resolution Using Retooled INTACT
<p>Isolated nuclei provide access to early steps in gene regulation involving chromatin as well as transcript production and processing. Here, we describe transfer of the isolation of nuclei from tagged specific cell types (INTACT) to the monocot rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.). The purification of biotinylated nuclei was redesigned by replacing the outer nuclear-envelope-targeting domain of the nuclear tagging fusion (NTF) protein with an outer nuclear-envelope-anchored domain. This modified NTF was combined with codon-optimized <i>Escherichia coli BirA</i> in a single T-DNA construct. We also developed inexpensive methods for INTACT, T-DNA insertion mapping, and profiling of the complete nuclear transcriptome, including a ribosomal RNA degradation procedure that minimizes pre-ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) transcripts. A high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion comparison of nuclear and steady-state poly(A)<sup>+</sup> transcript populations of seedling root tips confirmed the capture of pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) and exposed distinctions in diversity and abundance of the nuclear and total transcriptomes.

High-Resolution Mapping of Chromatin Conformation in Cardiac Myocytes Reveals Structural Remodeling of the Epigenome in Heart Failure

Mice with cardiac-specific deletion of CTCF (a ubiquitous chromatin structural protein) were generated to explore the role of this protein in chromatin structure and cardiac phenotype. Transcriptome analyses by RNA-seq were conducted as a functional readout of the epigenomic structural changes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Depletion of CTCF was sufficient to induce heart failure in mice, and human patients with heart failure receiving mechanical unloading via left ventricular assist devices show increased CTCF abundance. Chromatin structural analyses revealed interactions within the cardiac myocyte genome at 5-kb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion, enabling examination of intra- and interchromosomal events, and providing a resource for future cardiac epigenomic investigations. Pressure overload or CTCF depletion selectively altered boundary strength between topologically associating domains and A/B compartmentalization, measurements of genome accessibility. Heart failure involved decreased stability of chromatin interactions around disease-causing genes.

Efficacy and Safety of a Pharmaco-Invasive Strategy With Half-Dose Alteplase Versus Primary Angioplasty in ST-Segment–Elevation Myocardial Infarction

Subsequent correlation analysis allowed for the identification of novel factors that share a comparable transcriptional regulation pattern across the infarcted tissue. The strong correlation between the expression levels of these known marker genes and the expression of the coregulated genes could be confirmed in human ischemic cardiac tissue samples. Follow-up analysis identified SOX9 as common transcriptional regulator of a large portion of the fibrosis-related genes that become activated under conditions of ischemic injury.

Protoplast Swelling and Hypocotyl Growth Depend on Different Auxin Signaling Pathways
<p>Members of the TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE1/AUXIN SIGNALING F-BOX PROTEIN (TIR1/AFB) family are known auxin receptors. To analyze the possible receptor function of AUXIN BINDING PROTEIN1 (ABP1), an auxin receptor currently under debate, we performed different approaches. We performed a pharmacological approach using α-(2,4-dimethylphenylethyl-2-oxo)-indole-3-acetic acid (auxinole), α-(phenylethyl-2-oxo)-indole-3-acetic acid (PEO-IAA), and 5-fluoroindole-3-acetic acid (5-F-IAA) to discriminate between ABP1- and TIR1/AFB-mediated processes in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We used a peptide of the carboxyl-terminal region of AtABP1 as a tool. We performed mutant analysis with the null alleles of <i>ABP1</i>, <i>abp1-c1</i> and <i>abp1-TD1</i>, and the TILLING mutant <i>abp1-5</i>. We employed Coimbra, an accession that exhibits an amino acid exchange in the auxin-binding domain of ABP1. We measured either volume changes of single hypocotyl protoplasts or hypocotyl growth, both at high temporal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion. 5-F-IAA selectively activated the TIR1/AFB pathway but did not induce protoplast swelling; instead, it showed auxin activity in the hypocotyl growth test. In contrast, PEO-IAA induced an auxin-like swelling response but no hypocotyl growth. The carboxyl-terminal peptide of AtABP1 induced an auxin-like swelling response. In the <i>ABP1</i>-related mutants and Coimbra, no auxin-induced protoplast swelling occurred. ABP1 seems to be involved in mediating rapid auxin-induced protoplast swelling, but it is not involved in the control of rapid auxin-induced growth.</p>

Structure of eIF4E in Complex with an eIF4G Peptide Supports a Universal Bipartite Binding Mode for Protein Translation
<p>The association-dissociation of the cap-binding protein eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) with eIF4G is a key control step in eukaryotic translation. The paradigm on the eIF4E-eIF4G interaction states that eIF4G binds to the dorsal surface of eIF4E through a single canonical alpha-helical motif, while metazoan eIF4E-binding proteins (m4E-BPs) advantageously compete against eIF4G via bimodal interactions involving this canonical motif and a second noncanonical motif of the eIF4E surface. Metazoan eIF4Gs share this extended binding interface with m4E-BPs, with significant implications on the understanding of translation regulation and the design of therapeutic molecules. Here we show the high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion structure of melon (<i>Cucumis melo</i>) eIF4E in complex with a melon eIF4G peptide and propose the first eIF4E-eIF4G structural model for plants. Our structural data together with functional analyses demonstrate that plant eIF4G binds to eIF4E through both the canonical and noncanonical motifs, similarly to metazoan eIF4E-eIF4G complexes. As in the case of metazoan eIF4E-eIF4G, this may have very important practical implications, as plant eIF4E-eIF4G is also involved in a significant number of plant diseases. In light of our results, a universal eukaryotic bipartite mode of binding to eIF4E is proposed.</p>

9-cis-Neoxanthin in Light Harvesting Complexes of Photosystem II Regulates the Binding of Violaxanthin and Xanthophyll Cycle
<p>The light-harvesting chlorophyll <i>a/b</i> complex of photosystem II (LHCII) is able to switch to multiple functions under different light conditions (i.e. harvesting solar energy for photosynthesis and dissipating excess excitation energy for photoprotection). The role of the different carotenoids bound to LHCII in regulating the structure and function of the complex is a long-lasting question in photosynthesis research. 9-cis-Neoxanthin (Nx) is one of the important carotenoids, which can only be found in the LHCIIs. High-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion structural analysis of LHCII shows that Nx is located between different monomeric LHCIIs, with one side protruding into the lipid membrane. In this study, the various functional significances of this unique feature of Nx binding in LHCII are studied with the in vitro reconstituted LHCIIs both with and without Nx and the native complexes isolated either from wild-type Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) or from its mutant <i>aba4-3</i> lacking Nx. Our results reveal that the binding of Nx affects the binding affinity of violaxanthin (Vx) to LHCII significantly. In the absence of Nx, Vx has a much higher binding affinity to trimeric LHCII. The strong coordination between Nx and Vx at the interfaces of adjacent monomers of LHCII plays an important role both in operating the xanthophyll cycle and in the transient modulation of nonphotochemical quenching.</p>

Outside-Xylem Vulnerability, Not Xylem Embolism, Controls Leaf Hydraulic Decline during Dehydration<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[CC-BY]</sup></xref>
<p>Leaf hydraulic supply is crucial to maintaining open stomata for CO<sub>2</sub> capture and plant growth. During drought-induced dehydration, the leaf hydraulic conductance (<i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub>) declines, which contributes to stomatal closure and, eventually, to leaf death. Previous studies have tended to attribute the decline of <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> to embolism in the leaf vein xylem. We visualized at high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion and quantified experimentally the hydraulic vulnerability of xylem and outside-xylem pathways and modeled their respective influences on plant water transport. Evidence from all approaches indicated that the decline of <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> during dehydration arose first and foremost due to the vulnerability of outside-xylem tissues. In vivo x-ray microcomputed tomography of dehydrating leaves of four diverse angiosperm species showed that, at the turgor loss point, only small fractions of leaf vein xylem conduits were embolized, and substantial xylem embolism arose only under severe dehydration. Experiments on an expanded set of eight angiosperm species showed that outside-xylem hydraulic vulnerability explained 75% to 100% of <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> decline across the range of dehydration from mild water stress to beyond turgor loss point. Spatially explicit modeling of leaf water transport pointed to a role for reduced membrane conductivity consistent with published data for cells and tissues. Plant-scale modeling suggested that outside-xylem hydraulic vulnerability can protect the xylem from tensions that would induce embolism and disruption of water transport under mild to moderate soil and atmospheric droughts. These findings pinpoint outside-xylem tissues as a central locus for the control of leaf and plant water transport during progressive drought.</p>

Constitutive Expression of Arabidopsis <i>SMALL AUXIN UP RNA19</i> (<i>SAUR19</i>) in Tomato Confers Auxin-Independent Hypocotyl Elongation<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The plant hormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA or auxin) mediates the elongation growth of shoot tissues by promoting cell expansion. According to the acid growth theory proposed in the 1970s, auxin activates plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases (PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases) to facilitate cell expansion by both loosening the cell wall through acidification and promoting solute uptake. Mechanistically, however, this process is poorly understood. Recent findings in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) have demonstrated that auxin-induced <i>SMALL AUXIN UP RNA</i> (<i>SAUR</i>) genes promote elongation growth and play a key role in PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activation by inhibiting PP2C.D family protein phosphatases. Here, we extend these findings by demonstrating that SAUR proteins also inhibit tomato PP2C.D family phosphatases and that AtSAUR19 overexpression in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) confers the same suite of phenotypes as previously reported for Arabidopsis. Furthermore, we employ a custom image-based method for measuring hypocotyl segment elongation with high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion and a method for measuring cell wall mechanical properties, to add mechanistic details to the emerging description of auxin-mediated cell expansion. We find that constitutive expression of GFP-AtSAUR19 bypasses the normal requirement of auxin for elongation growth by increasing the mechanical extensibility of excised hypocotyl segments. In contrast, hypocotyl segments overexpressing a PP2C.D phosphatase are specifically impaired in auxin-mediated elongation. The time courses of auxin-induced <i>SAUR</i> expression and auxin-dependent elongation growth were closely correlated. These findings indicate that induction of <i>SAUR</i> expression is sufficient to elicit auxin-mediated expansion growth by activating PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases to facilitate apoplast acidification and mechanical wall loosening.</p>

The Transcription Factor ATHB5 Affects GA-Mediated Plasticity in Hypocotyl Cell Growth during Seed Germination
<p>Gibberellic acid (GA)-mediated cell expansion initiates the seed-to-seedling transition in plants and is repressed by DELLA proteins. Using digital single-cell analysis, we identified a cellular subdomain within the midhypocotyl, whose expansion drives the final step of this developmental transition under optimal conditions. Using network inference, the transcription factor ATHB5 was identified as a genetic factor whose localized expression promotes GA-mediated expansion specifically within these cells. Both this protein and its putative growth-promoting target <i>EXPANSIN3</i> are repressed by DELLA, and coregulated at single-cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion during seed germination. The cellular domains of hormone sensitivity were explored within the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) embryo by putting seeds under GA-limiting conditions and quantifying cellular growth responses. The middle and upper hypocotyl have a greater requirement for GA to promote cell expansion than the lower embryo axis. Under these conditions, germination was still completed following enhanced growth within the radicle and lower axis. Under GA-limiting conditions, the <i>athb5</i> mutant did not show a phenotype at the level of seed germination, but it did at a cellular level with reduced cell expansion in the hypocotyl relative to the wild type. These data reveal that the spatiotemporal cell expansion events driving this transition are not determinate, and the conditional use of GA-ATHB5-mediated hypocotyl growth under optimal conditions may be used to optionally support rapid seedling growth. This study demonstrates that multiple genetic and spatiotemporal cell expansion mechanisms underlie the seed to seedling transition in Arabidopsis.</p>

Rice Cellulose SynthaseA8 Plant-Conserved Region Is a Coiled-Coil at the Catalytic Core Entrance
<p>The crystallographic structure of a rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) cellulose synthase, OsCesA8, plant-conserved region (P-CR), one of two unique domains in the catalytic domain of plant CesAs, was solved to 2.4 ÅÅ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion. Two antiparallel α-helices form a coiled-coil domain linked by a large extended connector loop containing a conserved trio of aromatic residues. The P-CR structure was fit into a molecular envelope for the P-CR domain derived from small-angle X-ray scattering data. The P-CR structure and molecular envelope, combined with a homology-based chain trace of the CesA8 catalytic core, were modeled into a previously determined CesA8 small-angle X-ray scattering molecular envelope to produce a detailed topological model of the CesA8 catalytic domain. The predicted position for the P-CR domain from the molecular docking models places the P-CR connector loop into a hydrophobic pocket of the catalytic core, with the coiled-coil aligned near the entrance of the substrate UDP-glucose into the active site. In this configuration, the P-CR coiled-coil alone is unlikely to regulate substrate access to the active site, but it could interact with other domains of CesA, accessory proteins, or other CesA catalytic domains to control substrate delivery.</p>

Dirigent Protein Mode of Action Revealed by the Crystal Structure of AtDIR6
<p>Dirigent proteins impart stereoselectivity to phenoxy radical coupling reactions in plants and, thus, play an essential role in the biosynthesis of biologically active natural products. This includes the regioselective and enantioselective coupling and subsequent cyclization of two coniferyl alcohol radicals to pinoresinol as the committed step of lignan biosynthesis. The reaction is controlled by dirigent proteins, which, depending on the species and protein, direct the reaction to either (+)- or (−)-pinoresinol. We present the crystal structure of the (−)-pinoresinol forming DIRIGENT PROTEIN6 (AtDIR6) from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) with data to 1.4 Å <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion. The structure shows AtDIR6 as an eight-stranded antiparallel β-barrel that forms a trimer with spatially well-separated cavities for substrate binding. The binding cavities are two lobed, exhibiting two opposing pockets, each lined with a set of hydrophilic and potentially catalytic residues, including essential aspartic acids. These residues are conserved between (+) and (−)-pinoresinol-forming DIRs and required for activity. The structure supports a model in which two substrate radicals bind to each of the DIR monomers. With the aromatic rings fixed in the two pockets, the propionyl side chains face each other for radical-radical coupling, and stereoselectivity is determined by the exact positioning of the side chains. Extensive mutational analysis supports a previously unrecognized function for DIRs in catalyzing the cyclization of the bis-quinone methide reaction intermediate to yield (+)- or (−)-pinoresinol.</p>

The Roles of Mutation, Selection, and Expression in Determining Relative Rates of Evolution in Mitochondrial versus Nuclear Genomes
<p>Eukaryotes rely on proteins encoded by the nuclear and mitochondrial (mt) genomes, which interact within multisubunit complexes such as oxidative-phosphorylation enzymes. Although selection is thought to be less efficient on the asexual mt genome, in bilaterian animals the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions (<i>ω</i>) is lower in mt- compared with nuclear-encoded OXPHOS subunits, suggesting <i>stronger</i> effects of purifying selection in the mt genome. Because high levels of gene expression constrain protein sequence evolution, one proposed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion to this paradox is that mt genes are expressed more highly than nuclear genes. To test this hypothesis, we investigated expression and sequence evolution of mt and nuclear genes from 84 diverse eukaryotes that vary in mt gene content and mutation rate. We found that the relationship between mt and nuclear <i>ω</i> values varied dramatically across eukaryotes. In contrast, transcript abundance is consistently higher for mt genes than nuclear genes, regardless of which genes happen to be in the mt genome. Consequently, expression levels cannot be responsible for the differences in <i>ω</i>. Rather, 84% of the variance in the ratio of <i>ω</i> values between mt and nuclear genes could be explained by differences in mutation rate between the two genomes. We relate these findings to the hypothesis that high rates of mt mutation select for compensatory changes in the nuclear genome. We also propose an explanation for why mt transcripts consistently outnumber their nuclear counterparts, with implications for mitonuclear protein imbalance and aging.</p>

Y Chromosome Analysis of Dingoes and Southeast Asian Village Dogs Suggests a Neolithic Continental Expansion from Southeast Asia Followed by Multiple Austronesian Dispersals
<p>Dogs originated more than 14,000 BP, but the location(s) where they first arose is uncertain. The earliest archeological evidence of ancient dogs was discovered in Europe and the Middle East, some 5–7 millennia before that from Southeast Asia. However, mitochondrial DNA analyses suggest that most modern dogs derive from Southeast Asia, which has fueled the controversial hypothesis that dog domestication originated in this region despite the lack of supporting archeological evidence. We propose and investigate with Y chromosomes an alternative hypothesis for the proximate origins of dogs from Southeast Asia—a massive Neolithic expansion of dogs from this region that largely replaced more primitive dogs to the west and north. Previous attempts to test matrilineal findings with independent patrilineal markers have lacked the necessary genealogical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion and mutation rate estimates. Here, we used Y chromosome genotypes, composed of 29 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) and 5 single tandem repeats (STRs), from 338 Australian dingoes, New Guinea singing dogs, and village dogs from Island Southeast Asia, along with modern European breed dogs, to estimate the evolutionary mutation rates of Y chromosome STRs based on calibration to the independently known age of the dingo population. Dingoes exhibited a unique haplogroup characterized by a single distinguishing SNP mutation and 14 STR haplotypes. The age of the European haplogroup was estimated to be only 1.7 times older than that of the dingo population, suggesting an origin during the Neolithic rather than the Paleolithic (as predicted by the Southeast Asian origins hypothesis). We hypothesize that isolation of Neolithic dogs from wolves in Southeast Asia was a key step accelerating their phenotypic transformation, enhancing their value in trade and as cargo, and enabling them to rapidly expand and replace more primitive dogs to the West. Our findings also suggest that dingoes could have arrived in Australia directly from Taiwan, independently of later dispersals of dogs through Thailand to Island Southeast Asia.</p>

Keyhole threshold and morphology in laser melting revealed by ultrahigh-speed x-ray imaging
<p>We used ultrahigh-speed synchrotron x-ray imaging to quantify the phenomenon of vapor depressions (also known as keyholes) during laser melting of metals as practiced in additive manufacturing. Although expected from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">weld</span></strong>ing and inferred from postmortem cross sections of fusion zones, the direct visualization of the keyhole morphology and dynamics with high-energy x-rays shows that (i) keyholes are present across the range of power and scanning velocity used in laser powder bed fusion; (ii) there is a well-defined threshold from conduction mode to keyhole based on laser power density; and (iii) the transition follows the sequence of vaporization, depression of the liquid surface, instability, and then deep keyhole formation. These and other aspects provide a physical basis for three-dimensional printing in laser powder bed machines.</p>

Combining polyethylene and polypropylene: Enhanced performance with PE/<i>i</i>PP multiblock polymers
<p>Polyethylene (PE) and isotactic polypropylene (<i>i</i>PP) constitute nearly two-thirds of the worldâ€™s plastic. Despite their similar hydrocarbon makeup, the polymers are immiscible with one another. Thus, common grades of PE and <i>i</i>PP do not adhere or blend, creating challenges for recycling these materials. We synthesized PE/<i>i</i>PP multiblock copolymers using an isoselective alkene polymerization initiator. These polymers can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">weld</span></strong> common grades of commercial PE and <i>i</i>PP together, depending on the molecular weights and architecture of the block copolymers. Interfacial compatibilization of phase-separated PE and <i>i</i>PP with tetrablock copolymers enables morphological control, transforming brittle materials into mechanically tough blends.</p>

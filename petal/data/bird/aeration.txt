A Synthetic Oxygen Sensor for Plants Based on Animal Hypoxia Signaling
<p>Due to the involvement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> in many essential metabolic reactions, all living organisms have developed molecular systems that allow adaptive physiological and metabolic transitions depending on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> availability. In mammals, the expression of hypoxia-response genes is controlled by the heterodimeric Hypoxia-Inducible Factor. The activity of this transcriptional regulator is linked mainly to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>-dependent hydroxylation of conserved proline residues in its α-subunit, carried out by prolyl-hydroxylases, and subsequent ubiquitination via the E3 ligase von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor, which targets Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-α to the proteasome. By exploiting bioengineered versions of this mammalian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> sensor, we designed and optimized a synthetic device that drives gene expression in an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>-dependent fashion in plants. Transient assays in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mesophyll protoplasts indicated that a combination of the yeast Gal4/upstream activating sequence system and the mammalian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> sensor machinery can be used effectively to engineer a modular, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>-inducible transcriptional regulator. This synthetic device also was shown to be selectively controlled by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> in whole plants when its components were expressed stably in Arabidopsis seedlings. We envision the exploitation of our genetically encoded controllers to generate plants able to switch gene expression selectively depending on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> availability, thereby providing a proof of concept for the potential of synthetic biology to assist agricultural practices in environments with variable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> provision.</p>

Singlet Oxygen Plays an Essential Role in the Root’s Response to Osmotic Stress
<p>The high osmotic potentials in plants subjected to drought stress can be mimicked by the application of high molecular weight polyethylene glycol. Here, we quantified the effects of exposure to polyethylene glycol on the growth of the main and lateral roots of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings. The effects on root growth were highly correlated with the appearance of singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>, as visualized using the singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>-specific probe singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> sensor green. The production of singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> was followed by cell death, as indicated by the intracellular accumulation of propidium iodide due to the loss of membrane integrity. Cell death began in the epidermal region of the root tip and spread in a dynamic manner to meristematic sections. In parallel, gene expression changes specific to the presence of singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> were observed. The accumulation of other reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species, namely hydrogen, peroxide, nitric oxide, and superoxide, did not correlate with cell death. In addition, both the singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> scavenger His and the lip<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ase inhibitor salicylhydroxamic acid specifically inhibited singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> accumulation and cell death. These results suggest a light-independent, type-I source of singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> production. Serpin-protease interactions were used as a model to assess the possibility of vacuolar-type cell death. Osmotic stress induced the accumulation of complexes between the cytoplasmic serpin AtSERPIN1 and its cognate vacuolar proteases, indicating that vacuolar integrity was compromised. These findings imply that singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> plays an essential role in conveying the root response to osmotic stress.</p>

Simultaneous high-resolution pH and spectrophotometric recordings of oxygen binding in blood microvolumes
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> equilibrium curves have been widely used to understand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> transport in numerous organisms. A major challenge has been to monitor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> binding characteristics and concomitant pH changes as they occur <i>in vivo</i>, in limited sample volumes. Here we report a technique allowing highly resolved and simultaneous monitoring of pH and blood pigment saturation in minute blood volumes. We equipped a gas diffusion chamber with a broad-range fibre-optic spectrophotometer and a micro-pH optode and recorded changes of pigment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ation along <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> partial pressure (<i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>) and pH gradients to test the setup. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> binding parameters derived from measurements in only 15 μl of haemolymph from the cephalopod <i>Octopus vulgaris</i> showed low instrumental error (0.93%) and good agreement with published data. Broad-range spectra, each resolving 2048 data points, provided detailed insight into the complex absorbance characteristics of diverse blood types. After consideration of photobleaching and intrinsic fluorescence, pH optodes yielded accurate recordings and resolved a sigmoidal shift of 0.03 pH units in response to changing <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> from 0 to 21 kPa. Highly resolved continuous recordings along pH gradients conformed to stepwise measurements at low rates of pH changes. In this study we showed that a diffusion chamber upgraded with a broad-range spectrophotometer and an optical pH sensor accurately characterizes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> binding with minimal sample consumption and manipulation. We conclude that the modified diffusion chamber is highly suitable for experimental biologists who demand high flexibility, detailed insight into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> binding as well as experimental and biological accuracy combined in a single setup.</p>

Rapid mitochondrial adjustments in response to short-term hypoxia and re-oxygenation in the Pacific oyster, <i>Crassostrea gigas</i>
<p>As <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> concentrations in marine coastal habitats can fluctuate rapidly and drastically, sessile marine organisms such as the oyster <i>Crassostrea gigas</i> can experience marked and rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> variations. In this study, we investigated the responses of oyster gill mitochondria to short-term hypoxia (3 and 12 h, at 1.7 mg O<sub>2</sub> l<sup>−1</sup>) and subsequent re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ation. Mitochondrial respiratory rates (states 3 and 4 stimulated by glutamate) and phosphorylation efficiency [respiratory control ratio (RCR) and the relationship between ADP and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> consumption (ADP/O)] were measured. Cytochrome <i>c</i> oxidase (CCO) activity and cytochrome concentrations (<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>c</i>) were measured to investigate the rearrangements of respiratory chain subunits. The potential implication of an alternative oxidase (AOX) was investigated using an inhibitor of the respiratory chain (antimycin A) and through gene expression analysis in gills and digestive gland. Results indicate a downregulation of mitochondrial capacity, with 60% inhibition of respiratory rates after 12 h of hypoxia. RCR remained stable, while ADP/O increased after 12 h of hypoxia and 1 h of re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ation, suggesting increased phosphorylation efficiency. CCO showed a fast and remarkable increase of its catalytic activity only after 3 h of hypoxia. AOX mRNA levels showed similar patterns in gills and digestive gland, and were upregulated after 12 and 24 h of hypoxia and during re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ation. Results suggest a set of controls regulating mitochondrial functions in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> fluctuations, and demonstrate the fast and extreme plasticity of oyster mitochondria in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> variations.</p>

Histone demethylase KDM6A directly senses oxygen to control chromatin and cell fate
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> sensing is central to metazoan biology and has implications for human disease. Mammalian cells express multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>-dependent enzymes called 2-oxoglutarate (OG)-dependent di<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ases (2-OGDDs), but they vary in their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> affinities and hence their ability to sense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>. The 2-OGDD histone demethylases control histone methylation. Hypoxia increases histone methylation, but whether this reflects direct effects on histone demethylases or indirect effects caused by the hypoxic induction of the HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor) transcription factor or the 2-OG antagonist 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) is unclear. Here, we report that hypoxia promotes histone methylation in a HIF- and 2-HG–independent manner. We found that the H3K27 histone demethylase KDM6A/UTX, but not its paralog KDM6B, is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> sensitive. KDM6A loss, like hypoxia, prevented H3K27 demethylation and blocked cellular differentiation. Restoring H3K27 methylation homeostasis in hypoxic cells reversed these effects. Thus, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> directly affects chromatin regulators to control cell fate.</p>

Histone modifiers are oxygen sensors
<p>Approximately 2.6 billion years ago, during the Proterozoic period, the evolution of photosynthesis in cyanobacteria led to the introduction of the by-product of this reaction, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>, into Earth's atmosphere (<i>1</i>). This great oxidative event heralded the rise of multicellular organisms, which are almost totally dependent on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> as an efficient fuel for metabolism and as a cofactor in many critical physiological enzymatic reactions. Central to this adaptation, and to allow cellular physiology across a wide range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> concentrations (tensions), metazoans have evolved the highly conserved hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway (<i>2</i>). This is important for both physiological and pathological processes that occur in a hypoxic microenvironment, including embryogenesis, stem cell homeostasis, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. It has long been observed that hypoxia induces histone lysine hypermethylation, a form of epigenetic chromatin modification. However, whether this represents a direct sensing of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> tension or an indirect effect, perhaps through the HIF pathway, has not been established (<i>3</i>). On pages 1222 and 1217 of this issue, Batie <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) and Chakraborty <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>), respectively, resolve this question, demonstrating in different cellular systems that the activity of the lysine-specific demethylases (KDMs) KDM5A and KDM6A is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> sensitive, and thereby identifying them as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> sensors.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Root Bending Is Antagonistically Affected by Hypoxia and ERF-Mediated Transcription via Auxin Signaling
<p>When plants encounter soil water logging or flooding, roots are the first organs to be confronted with reduced gas diffusion resulting in limited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> supply. Since roots do not generate photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>, they are rapidly faced with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> shortage rendering roots particularly prone to damage. While metabolic adaptations to low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> conditions, which ensure basic energy supply, have been well characterized, adaptation of root growth and development have received less attention. In this study, we show that hypoxic conditions cause the primary root to grow sidewise in a low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> environment, possibly to escape soil patches with reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> availability. This growth behavior is reversible in that gravitropic growth resumes when seedlings are returned to normoxic conditions. Hypoxic root bending is inhibited by the group VII ethylene response factor (ERFVII) RAP2.12, as <i>rap2.12-1</i> seedlings show exaggerated primary root bending. Furthermore, overexpression of the ERFVII member <i>HRE2</i> inhibits root bending, suggesting that primary root growth direction at hypoxic conditions is antagonistically regulated by hypoxia and hypoxia-activated ERFVIIs. Root bending is preceded by the establishment of an auxin gradient across the root tip as quantified with DII-VENUS and is synergistically enhanced by hypoxia and the auxin transport inhibitor naphthylphthalamic acid. The protein abundance of the auxin efflux carrier PIN2 is reduced at hypoxic conditions, a response that is suppressed by RAP2.12 overexpression, suggesting antagonistic control of auxin flux by hypoxia and ERFVII. Taken together, we show that hypoxia triggers an escape response of the primary root that is controlled by ERFVII activity and mediated by auxin signaling in the root tip.</p>

Physiological correlates of symbiont migration during bleaching of two octocoral species
<p>Perturbed colonies of <i>Phenganax parrini</i> and <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. exhibit migration of symbionts of <i>Symbiodinium</i> spp. into the stolons. Densitometry and visual inspection indicated that polyps bleached while stolons did not. When migration was triggered by temperature, light and confinement, colonies of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. decreased rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> formation in the light (due to the effects of perturbation on photosynthesis and respiration) and increased rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> uptake in the dark (due to the effects of perturbation on respiration alone). Colonies of <i>P. parrini</i>, by contrast, showed no significant changes in either aspect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> metabolism. When migration was triggered by light and confinement, colonies of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. showed decreased rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> formation in the light and increased rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> uptake in the dark, while colonies of <i>P. parrini</i> maintained the former and increased the latter. During symbiont migration into their stolons, colonies of both species showed dramatic increases in reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species (ROS), as visualized with a fluorescent probe, with stolons of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. exhibiting a nearly immediate increase of ROS. Differences in symbiont type may explain the greater sensitivity of colonies of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. Using fluorescent probes, direct measurements of migrating symbionts in the stolons of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. showed higher levels of reactive nitrogen species and lower levels of ROS than the surrounding host tissue. As measured by native fluorescence, levels of NAD(P)H in the stolons were unaffected by perturbation. Symbiont migration thus correlates with dramatic physiological changes and may serve as a marker for coral condition.</p>

Late inception of a resiliently oxygenated upper ocean
<p>Rising oceanic and atmospheric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> levels through time have been crucial to enhanced habitability of surface Earth environments. Few redox proxies can track secular variations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissolv</span></strong>ed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> concentrations around threshold levels for metazoan survival in the upper ocean. We present an extensive compilation of iodine-to-calcium ratios (I/Ca) in marine carbonates. Our record supports a major rise in the partial pressure of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> in the atmosphere at ~400 million years (Ma) ago and reveals a step change in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ation of the upper ocean to relatively sustainable near-modern conditions at ~200 Ma ago. An Earth system model demonstrates that a shift in organic matter remineralization to greater depths, which may have been due to increasing size and biomineralization of eukaryotic plankton, likely drove the I/Ca signals at ~200 Ma ago.</p>

Xylem Surfactants Introduce a New Element to the Cohesion-Tension Theory
<p>Vascular plants transport water under negative pressure without constantly creating gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bubbl</span></strong>es that would disable their hydraulic systems. Attempts to replicate this feat in artificial systems almost invariably result in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bubbl</span></strong>e formation, except under highly controlled conditions with pure water and only hydrophilic surfaces present. In theory, conditions in the xylem should favor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bubbl</span></strong>e nucleation even more: there are millions of conduits with at least some hydrophobic surfaces, and xylem sap is saturated or sometimes supersaturated with atmospheric gas and may contain surface-active molecules that can lower surface tension. So how do plants transport water under negative pressure? Here, we show that angiosperm xylem contains abundant hydrophobic surfaces as well as insoluble lipid surfactants, including phospholipids, and proteins, a composition similar to pulmonary surfactants. Lipid surfactants were found in xylem sap and as nanoparticles under transmission electron microscopy in pores of intervessel pit membranes and deposited on vessel wall surfaces. Nanoparticles observed in xylem sap via nanoparticle-tracking analysis included surfactant-coated nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bubbl</span></strong>es when examined by freeze-fracture electron microscopy. Based on their fracture behavior, this technique is able to distinguish between dense-core particles, liquid-filled, bilayer-coated vesicles/liposomes, and gas-filled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bubbl</span></strong>es. Xylem surfactants showed strong surface activity that reduces surface tension to low values when concentrated as they are in pit membrane pores. We hypothesize that xylem surfactants support water transport under negative pressure as explained by the cohesion-tension theory by coating hydrophobic surfaces and nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bubbl</span></strong>es, thereby keeping the latter below the critical size at which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bubbl</span></strong>es would expand to form embolisms.</p>

Giant nonlinear response at a plasmonic nanofocus drives efficient four-wave mixing
<p>Efficient optical frequency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mix</span></strong>ing typically must accumulate over large interaction lengths because nonlinear responses in natural materials are inherently weak. This limits the efficiency of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mix</span></strong>ing processes owing to the requirement of phase matching. Here, we report efficient four-wave <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mix</span></strong>ing (FWM) over micrometer-scale interaction lengths at telecommunications wavelengths on silicon. We used an integrated plasmonic gap waveguide that strongly confines light within a nonlinear organic polymer. The gap waveguide intensifies light by nanofocusing it to a mode cross-section of a few tens of nanometers, thus generating a nonlinear response so strong that efficient FWM accumulates over wavelength-scale distances. This technique opens up nonlinear optics to a regime of relaxed phase matching, with the possibility of compact, broadband, and efficient frequency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mix</span></strong>ing integrated with silicon photonics.</p>

Control of zeolite framework flexibility and pore topology for separation of ethane and ethylene

Then, using isotopically labeled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> (O<sub>2</sub>) as an oxidant in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)<sub>,</sub> we demonstrated that the resulting methanol incorporated a substantial fraction (70%) of gas-phase O<sub>2</sub>.

Infrared Nanospectroscopy Reveals the Chemical Nature of Pit Membranes in Water-Conducting Cells of the Plant Xylem
<p>In the xylem of angiosperm plants, microscopic pits through the secondary cell walls connect the water-conducting vessels. Cellulosic meshes originated from primary walls, and middle lamella between adjacent vessels, called the pit membrane, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ates one conduit from another. The intricate structure of the nano-sized pores in pit membranes enables the passage of water under negative pressure without hydraulic failure due to obstruction by gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bubbl</span></strong>es (i.e. embolism) under normal conditions or mild drought stress. Since the chemical composition of pit membranes affects embolism formation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bubbl</span></strong>e behavior, we directly measured pit membrane composition in <i>Populus nigra</i> wood. Here, we characterized the chemical composition of cell wall structures by synchrotron infrared nanospectroscopy and atomic force microscopy-infrared nanospectroscopy with high spatial resolution. Characteristic peaks of cellulose, phenolic compounds, and proteins were found in the intervessel pit membranes of <i>P. nigra</i> wood. In addition, the vessel to parenchyma pit membranes and developing cell walls of the vascular cambium showed clear signals of cellulose, proteins, and pectin. We did not find a distinct peak of lignin and other compounds in these structures. Our investigation of the complex chemical composition of intervessel pit membranes furthers our understanding of the flow of water and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bubbl</span></strong>es between neighboring conduits. The advances presented here pave the way for further label-free studies related to the nanochemistry of plant cell components.</p>

<p>The diffusion efficiency of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> in the atmosphere, like that of CO<sub>2</sub>, is approximately 10<sup>4</sup> times greater than that in aqueous environments. Consequently, terrestrial photosynthetic organisms need mechanisms to protect against potential oxidative damage. The liverwort <i>Marchantia polymorpha</i>, a basal land plant, has habitats where it is exposed to both water and the atmosphere. Furthermore, like cyanobacteria, <i>M. polymorpha</i> has genes encoding flavodiiron proteins (FLV). In cyanobacteria, FLVs mediate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>-dependent alternative electron flow (AEF) to suppress the production of reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species. Here, we investigated whether FLVs are required for the protection of photosynthesis in <i>M. polymorpha</i>. A mutant deficient in the FLV1 isozyme (Δ<i>MpFlv1</i>) sustained photooxidative damage to photosystem I (PSI) following repetitive short-saturation pulses of light. Compared with the wild type (Takaragaike-1), Δ<i>MpFlv1</i> showed the same photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> evolution rate but a lower electron transport rate during the induction phase of photosynthesis. Additionally, the reaction center chlorophyll in PSI, P700, was highly reduced in Δ<i>MpFlv1</i> but not in Takaragaike-1. These results indicate that the gene product of <i>MpFlv1</i> drives AEF to oxidize PSI, as in cyanobacteria. Furthermore, FLV-mediated AEF supports the production of a proton motive force to possibly induce the nonphotochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence and suppress electron transport in the cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub>/<i>f</i> complex. After submerging the thalli, a decrease in photosystem II operating efficiency was observed, particularly in Δ<i>MpFlv1</i>, which implies that species living in these sorts of habitats require FLV-mediated AEF.</p>

Deep-diving sea lions exhibit extreme bradycardia in long-duration dives
<p>Heart rate and peripheral blood flow distribution are the primary determinants of the rate and pattern of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> store utilisation and ultimately breath-hold duration in marine endotherms. Despite this, little is known about how otariids (sea lions and fur seals) regulate heart rate (<i>f</i><sub>H</sub>) while diving. We investigated dive <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> in five adult female California sea lions (<i>Zalophus californianus</i>) during foraging trips by instrumenting them with digital electrocardiogram (ECG) loggers and time depth recorders. In all dives, dive <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> (number of beats/duration; 50±9 beats min<sup>−1</sup>) decreased compared with surface rates (113±5 beats min<sup>−1</sup>), with all dives exhibiting an instantaneous <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> below resting (<54 beats min<sup>−1</sup>) at some point during the dive. Both dive <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> and minimum instantaneous <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> significantly decreased with increasing dive duration. Typical instantaneous <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> profiles of deep dives (>100 m) consisted of: (1) an initial rapid decline in <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> resulting in the lowest instantaneous <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> of the dive at the end of descent, often below 10 beats min<sup>−1</sup> in dives longer than 6 min in duration; (2) a slight increase in <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> to ~10–40 beats min<sup>−1</sup> during the bottom portion of the dive; and (3) a gradual increase in <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> during ascent with a rapid increase prior to surfacing. Thus, <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> regulation in deep-diving sea lions is not simply a progressive bradycardia. Extreme bradycardia and the presumed associated reductions in pulmonary and peripheral blood flow during late descent of deep dives should (a) contribute to preservation of the lung <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> store, (b) increase dependence of muscle on the myoglobin-bound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> store, (c) conserve the blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> store and (d) help limit the absorption of nitrogen at depth. This <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> profile during deep dives of sea lions may be characteristic of deep-diving marine endotherms that dive on inspiration as similar <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> profiles have been recently documented in the emperor penguin, another deep diver that dives on inspiration.</p>

Particulate Matter Exposure and Stress Hormone Levels
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Exposure to ambient particulate matter (PM) is associated with a number of adverse health outcomes, but potential mechanisms are largely unknown. Metabolomics represents a powerful approach to study global metabolic changes in response to environmental exposures. We therefore conducted this study to investigate changes in serum metabolites in response to the reduction of PM exposure among healthy college students.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a randomized, double-blind crossover trial in 55 healthy college students in Shanghai, China. Real and sham air <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">purif</span></strong>iers were placed in participants’ dormitories in random order for 9 days with a 12-day washout period. Serum metabolites were quantified by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Between-treatment differences in metabolites were examined using orthogonal partial least square-discriminant analysis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mix</span></strong>ed-effect models. Secondary outcomes include blood pressure, corticotropin-releasing hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, insulin resistance, and biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The average personal exposure to PMs with aerodynamic diameters ≤2.5 μm was 24.3 μg/m<sup>3</sup> during the real <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">purif</span></strong>ication and 53.1 μg/m<sup>3</sup> during the sham <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">purif</span></strong>ication. Metabolomics analysis showed that higher exposure to PMs with aerodynamic diameters ≤2.5 μm led to significant increases in cortisol, cortisone, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. Between-treatment differences were also observed for glucose, amino acids, fatty acids, and lipids. We found significantly higher blood pressure, hormones, insulin resistance, and biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation among individuals exposed to higher PMs with aerodynamic diameters ≤2.5 μm.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This study suggests that higher PM may induce metabolic alterations that are consistent with activations of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal and sympathetic-adrenal-medullary axes, adding potential mechanistic insights into the adverse health outcomes associated with PM.

Spatially structured cell populations process multiple sensory signals in parallel in intact vascular endothelium
<p>Blood flow, blood clotting, angiogenesis, vascular permeability, and vascular remodeling are each controlled by a large number of variable, noisy, and interacting chemical inputs to the vascular endothelium. The endothelium processes the entirety of the chemical composition to which the cardiovascular system is exposed, carrying out sophisticated computations that determine physiological output. Processing this enormous quantity of information is a major challenge facing the endothelium. We analyzed the responses of hundreds of endothelial cells to carbachol (CCh) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and found that the endothelium segregates the responses to these two distinct components of the chemical environment into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate streams of complementary information that are processed in parallel. Sensitivities to CCh and ATP mapped to different clusters of cells, and each agonist generated distinct signal patterns. The distinct signals were features of agonist activation rather than properties of the cells themselves. When there was more than one stimulus present, the cells communicated and combined inputs to generate new distinct signals that were nonlinear combinations of the inputs. Our results demonstrate that the endothelium is a structured, collaborative sensory network that simplifies the complex environment using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate cell clusters that are sensitive to distinct aspects of the overall biochemical environment and interactively compute signals from diverse but interrelated chemical inputs. These features enable the endothelium to selectively process <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate signals and perform multiple computations in an environment that is noisy and variable.</p>

Large-area graphene-nanomesh/carbon-nanotube hybrid membranes for ionic and molecular nanofiltration
<p>Nanoporous two-dimensional materials are attractive for ionic and molecular nanofiltration but limited by insufficient mechanical strength over large areas. We report a large-area graphene-nanomesh/single-walled carbon nanotube (GNM/SWNT) hybrid membrane with excellent mechanical strength while fully capturing the merit of atomically thin membranes. The monolayer GNM features high-density, subnanometer pores for efficient transport of water molecules while blocking solute ions or molecules to enable size-selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation. The SWNT network physically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ates the GNM into microsized islands and acts as the microscopic framework to support the GNM, thus ensuring the structural integrity of the atomically thin GNM. The resulting GNM/SWNT membranes show high water permeance and a high rejection ratio for salt ions or organic molecules, and they retain stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation performance in tubular modules.</p>

Hypoxia induces rapid changes to histone methylation and reprograms chromatin
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> is essential for the life of most multicellular organisms. Cells possess enzymes called molecular di<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ases that depend on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> for activity. A subclass of molecular di<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ases is the histone demethylase enzymes, which are characterized by the presence of a Jumanji-C (JmjC) domain. Hypoxia can alter chromatin, but whether this is a direct effect on JmjC-histone demethylases or due to other mechanisms is unknown. Here, we report that hypoxia induces a rapid and hypoxia-inducible factor–independent induction of histone methylation in a range of human cultured cells. Genomic locations of histone-3 lysine-4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and H3K36me3 after a brief exposure of cultured cells to hypoxia predict the cell’s transcriptional response several hours later. We show that inactivation of one of the JmjC-containing enzymes, lysine demethylase 5A (KDM5A), mimics hypoxia-induced cellular responses. These results demonstrate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> sensing by chromatin occurs via JmjC-histone demethylase inhibition.</p>

Design and control of gas diffusion process in a nanoporous soft crystal

Zeolitic imidazolate framework membranes made by ligand-induced permselectivation

However, their reliable and scalable manufacturing remains a challenge. We demonstrate the fabrication of ZIF nanocomposite membranes by means of an all-vapor-phase processing method based on atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZnO in a porous support followed by ligand-vapor treatment. After ALD, the obtained nanocomposite exhibits low flux and is not selective, whereas after ligand-vapor (2-methylimidazole) treatment, it is partially transformed to ZIF and shows stable performance with high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mix</span></strong>ture <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation factor for propylene over propane (an energy-intensive high-volume <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation) and high propylene flux.

DNA-induced liquid phase condensation of cGAS activates innate immune signaling
<p>The binding of DNA to cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS) leads to the production of the secondary messenger cyclic GMP–AMP (cGAMP), which activates innate immune responses. We have shown that DNA binding to cGAS robustly induced the formation of liquidlike droplets in which cGAS was activated. The disordered and positively charged cGAS N terminus enhanced cGAS-DNA phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation by increasing the valencies of DNA binding. Long DNA was more efficient in promoting cGAS liquid phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation and cGAS enzyme activity than short DNA. Moreover, free zinc ions enhanced cGAS enzyme activity both in vitro and in cells by promoting cGAS-DNA phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation.

Mixed tailing by TENT4A and TENT4B shields mRNA from rapid deadenylation
<p>RNA tails play integral roles in the regulation of messenger RNA (mRNA) translation and decay. Guanylation of the poly(A) tail was discovered recently, yet the enzymology and function remain obscure. Here we identify TENT4A (PAPD7) and TENT4B (PAPD5) as the enzymes responsible for mRNA guanylation. Purified TENT4 proteins generate a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mix</span></strong>ed poly(A) tail with intermittent non-adenosine residues, the most common of which is guanosine. A single guanosine residue is sufficient to impede the deadenylase CCR4-NOT complex, which trims the tail and exposes guanosine at the 3′ end. Consistently, depletion of TENT4A and TENT4B leads to a decrease in mRNA half-life and abundance in cells. Thus, TENT4A and TENT4B produce a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mix</span></strong>ed tail that shields mRNA from rapid deadenylation. Our study unveils the role of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mix</span></strong>ed tailing and expands the complexity of posttranscriptional gene regulation.</p>

Spatially distributed multipartite entanglement enables EPR steering of atomic clouds

Based on the strength of EPR steering, we constructed a witness, which confirmed genuine 5-partite entanglement.</p>

Phase separation of a yeast prion protein promotes cellular fitness
<p>Despite the important role of prion domains in neurodegenerative disease, their physiological function has remained enigmatic. Previous work with yeast prions has defined prion domains as sequences that form self-propagating aggregates. Here, we uncovered an unexpected function of the canonical yeast prion protein Sup35. In stressed conditions, Sup35 formed protective gels via pH-regulated liquid-like phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation followed by gelation. Phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation was mediated by the N-terminal prion domain and regulated by the adjacent pH sensor domain.

Thus, prion-like domains represent conserved environmental stress sensors that facilitate rapid adaptation in unstable environments by modifying protein phase behavior.</p>

On the origins of oxygenic photosynthesis and aerobic respiration in Cyanobacteria

All members of the <i>Melainabacteria</i> and <i>Sericytochromatia</i> lack photosynthetic machinery, indicating that phototrophy was not an ancestral feature of the Cyanobacteria and that <i>Oxyphotobacteria</i> acquired the genes for photosynthesis relatively late in cyanobacterial evolution.

Archaeal (Per)Chlorate Reduction at High Temperature: An Interplay of Biotic and Abiotic Reactions

<p>Identification and functional characterization of hypoxia-responsive transcription factors is important for understanding plant responses to natural anaerobic environments and during storage and transport of fresh horticultural products. In this study, yeast one-hybrid library screening using the persimmon (<i>Diospyros kaki</i>) pyruvate decarboxylase (<i>DkPDC2</i>) promoter identified three ethylene response factor (ERF) genes (<i>DkERF23</i>/<i>DkERF24</i>/<i>DkERF25</i>) and four WRKY transcription factor genes (<i>DkWRKY/DdkWRKY5</i>/<i>DkWRKY6</i>/<i>DkWRKY7</i>) that were differentially expressed in response to high CO<sub>2</sub> (95%, with 4% N<sub>2</sub> and 1% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>) and high N<sub>2</sub> (99% N<sub>2</sub> and 1% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>). Yeast one-hybrid assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that DkERF23, DkERF24, DkERF25, DkWRKY6, and DkWRKY7 could directly bind to the <i>DkPDC2</i> promoter. Dual-luciferase assays confirmed that these transcription factors were capable of transactivating the <i>DkPDC2</i> promoter. DkERF24 and DkWRKY1 in combination synergistically transactivated the <i>DkPDC2</i> promoter, and yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays confirmed protein–protein interaction between DkERF24 and DkWRKY1. Transient overexpression of <i>DkERF24</i> and <i>DkWRKY1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ately and in combination in persimmon fruit discs was effective in maintaining insolubilization of tannins, concomitantly with the accumulation of DkPDC2 transcripts. Studies with Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) homologs <i>AtERF1</i> and <i>AtWRKY53</i> indicated that similar protein–protein interactions and synergistic regulatory effects also occur with the <i>DkPDC2</i> promoter. We propose that an ERF and WRKY transcription factor complex contributes to responses to hypoxia in both persimmon fruit and Arabidopsis, and the possibility that this is a general plant response requires further investigation.</p>

Protein Phosphatase 2A B'α and B'β Protect Centromeric Cohesion during Meiosis I
<p>During meiosis, the stepwise release of sister chromatid cohesion is crucial for the equal distribution of genetic material to daughter cells, enabling generation of fertile gametophytes. However, the molecular mechanism that protects centromeric cohesion from release at meiosis I is unclear in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Here, we report that the protein phosphatase 2A regulatory subunits B'α and B'β participate in the control of sister chromatid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation. The double mutant <i>b'αβ</i> exhibited severe male and female sterility, caused by the lack of a nucleus or presence of an abnormal nucleus in mature microspores and embryo sacs. 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole staining revealed unequal amounts of DNA in the mononuclear microspores. Transverse sections of the anthers revealed unevenly sized tetrads with or without a nucleus, suggesting a defect in meiocyte meiosis. An analysis of chromosome spreads showed that the sister chromatids <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated prematurely at anaphase I in <i>b'αβ</i>. Immunoblotting showed that AtRECOMBINATION DEFECTIVE8 (AtREC8), a key member of the cohesin complex, was hyperphosphorylated in <i>b'αβ</i> anthers and pistils during meiosis but hypophosphorylated in the wild type. Furthermore, yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays showed that B'α and B'β interact specifically with AtREC8, AtSHUGOSHIN1 (AtSGO1), AtSGO2, and PATRONUS1. Given that B'α was reported to localize to the centromere in meiotic cells, we propose that protein phosphatase 2A B'α and B'β are recruited by AtSGO1/2 and PATRONUS1 to dephosphorylate AtREC8 at the site of centromere cohesion to shield it from cleavage until anaphase II, contributing to the balanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of sister chromatids at meiosis.</p>

Signal Dynamics and Interactions during Flooding Stress
<p>Flooding is detrimental for nearly all higher plants, including crops. The compound stress elicited by slow gas exchange and low light levels under water is responsible for both a carbon and an energy crisis ultimately leading to plant death. The endogenous concentrations of four gaseous compounds, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>, carbon dioxide, ethylene, and nitric oxide, change during the submergence of plant organs in water. These gases play a pivotal role in signal transduction cascades, leading to adaptive processes such as metabolic adjustments and anatomical features. Of these gases, ethylene is seen as the most consistent, pervasive, and reliable signal of early flooding stress, most likely in tight interaction with the other gases. The production of reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species (ROS) in plant cells during flooding and directly after subsidence, during which the plant is confronted with high light and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> levels, is characteristic for this abiotic stress. Low, well-controlled levels of ROS are essential for adaptive signaling pathways, in interaction with the other gaseous flooding signals. On the other hand, excessive uncontrolled bursts of ROS can be highly damaging for plants. Therefore, a fine-tuned balance is important, with a major role for ROS production and scavenging. Our understanding of the temporal dynamics of the four gases and ROS is basal, whereas it is likely that they form a signature readout of prevailing flooding conditions and subsequent adaptive responses.</p>

Flavodiiron Proteins Promote Fast and Transient O<sub>2</sub> Photoreduction in <i>Chlamydomonas</i><xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>During <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ic photosynthesis, the reducing power generated by light energy conversion is mainly used to reduce carbon dioxide. In bacteria and archae, flavodiiron (Flv) proteins catalyze O<sub>2</sub> or NO reduction, thus protecting cells against oxidative or nitrosative stress. These proteins are found in cyanobacteria, mosses, and microalgae, but have been lost in angiosperms. Here, we used chlorophyll fluorescence and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> exchange measurement using [<sup>18</sup>O]-labeled O<sub>2</sub> and a membrane inlet mass spectrometer to characterize <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii flvB</i> insertion mutants devoid of both FlvB and FlvA proteins. We show that Flv proteins are involved in a photo-dependent electron flow to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>, which drives most of the photosynthetic electron flow during the induction of photosynthesis. As a consequence, the chlorophyll fluorescence patterns are strongly affected in <i>flvB</i> mutants during a light transient, showing a lower PSII operating yield and a slower nonphotochemical quenching induction. Photoautotrophic growth of <i>flvB</i> mutants was indistinguishable from the wild type under constant light, but severely impaired under fluctuating light due to PSI photo damage. Remarkably, net photosynthesis of <i>flv</i> mutants was higher than in the wild type during the initial hour of a fluctuating light regime, but this advantage vanished under long-term exposure, and turned into PSI photo damage, thus explaining the marked growth retardation observed in these conditions. We conclude that the <i>C. reinhardtii</i> Flv participates in a Mehler-like reduction of O<sub>2</sub>, which drives a large part of the photosynthetic electron flow during a light transient and is thus critical for growth under fluctuating light regimes.</p>

The <i>Synechocystis</i> Manganese Exporter Mnx Is Essential for Manganese Homeostasis in Cyanobacteria
<p>The essential micronutrient manganese (Mn) functions as redox-active cofactor in active sites of enzymes and, thus, is involved in various physiological reactions. Moreover, in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ic photosynthetic organisms, Mn is of special importance, since it is central to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>-evolving complex in photosystem II. Although Mn is an essential micronutrient, increased amounts are detrimental to the organism; thus, only a small window exists for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">benefici</span></strong>al concentrations. Accordingly, Mn homeostasis must be carefully maintained. In contrast to the well-studied uptake mechanisms in cyanobacteria, it is largely unknown how Mn is distributed to the different compartments inside the cell. We identified a protein with so far unknown function as a hypothetical Mn transporter in the cyanobacterial model strain <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 and named this protein Mnx for Mn exporter. The knockout mutant Δ<i>mnx</i> showed increased sensitivity toward externally supplied Mn and Mn toxicity symptoms, which could be linked to intracellular Mn accumulation. <sup>54</sup>Mn chase experiments demonstrated that the mutant was not able to release Mn from the internal pool. Microscopic analysis of a Mnx::yellow fluorescent protein fusion showed that the protein resides in the thylakoid membrane. Heterologous expression of <i>mnx</i> suppressed the Mn-sensitive phenotype of the <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> mutant Δ<i>pmr1</i>. Our results indicate that Mnx functions as a thylakoid Mn transporter and is a key player in maintaining Mn homeostasis in <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803. We propose that Mn export from the cytoplasm into the thylakoid lumen is crucial to prevent toxic cytoplasmic Mn accumulation and to ensure Mn provision to photosystem II.</p>

The cost of muscle power production: muscle oxygen consumption per unit work increases at low temperatures in <i>Xenopus laevis</i>
<p>Metabolic energy (ATP) supply to muscle is essential to support activity and behaviour. It is expected, therefore, that there is strong selection to maximise muscle power output for a given rate of ATP use. However, the viscosity and stiffness of muscle increases with a decrease in temperature, which means that more ATP may be required to achieve a given work output. Here, we tested the hypothesis that ATP use increases at lower temperatures for a given power output in <i>Xenopus laevis.</i> To account for temperature variation at different time scales, we considered the interaction between acclimation for 4 weeks (to 15 or 25°C) and acute exposure to these temperatures. Cold-acclimated frogs had greater sprint speed at 15°C than warm-acclimated animals. However, acclimation temperature did not affect isolated gastrocnemius muscle biomechanics. Isolated muscle produced greater tetanus force, and faster isometric force generation and relaxation, and generated more work loop power at 25°C than at 15°C acute test temperature. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> consumption of isolated muscle at rest did not change with test temperature, but <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> consumption while muscle was performing work was significantly higher at 15°C than at 25°C, regardless of acclimation conditions. Muscle therefore consumed significantly more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> at 15°C for a given work output than at 25°C, and plastic responses did not modify this thermodynamic effect. The metabolic cost of muscle performance and activity therefore increased with a decrease in temperature. To maintain activity across a range of temperature, animals must increase ATP production or face an allocation trade-off at lower temperatures. Our data demonstrate the potential energetic benefits of warming up muscle before activity, which is seen in diverse groups of animals such as bees, which warm flight muscle before take-off, and humans performing warm ups before exercise.</p>

Comparison of the elution properties of commercially available gentamicin and bone cement containing vancomycin with ‘home-made’ preparations
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Vancomycin is commonly added to acrylic bone cement during revision   arthroplasty surgery. Proprietary cement preparations containing   vancomycin are available, but are significantly more expensive.   We investigated whether the elution of antibiotic from ‘home-made’   cement containing vancomycin was comparable with more expensive   commercially available vancomycin impregnated cement.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A total of 18 cement discs containing either proprietary CopalG+V;   or ‘home-made’ CopalR+G with vancomycin added by hand, were made.   Each disc contained the same amount of antibiotic (0.5 g gentamycin,   2 g vancomycin) and was immersed in ammonium acetate buffer in a   sealed container. Fluid from each container was sampled at eight   time points over a two-week period. The concentrations of gentamicin   and vancomycin in the fluid were analysed using high performance   liquid chromatography mass spectrometry.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The highest peak concentrations of antibiotic were observed from   the ‘home-made’ cements containing vancomycin, added as in the operating   theatre. The overall elution of antibiotic was, fivefold (vancomycin)   and twofold (gentamicin) greater from the ‘home-made’ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mix</span></strong> compared   with the commercially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mix</span></strong>ed cement. The use of a vacuum during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mix</span></strong>ing   had no significant effect on antibiotic elution in any of the samples.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These findings suggest that the addition of 2 g vancomycin powder   to gentamicin-impregnated bone cement by hand significantly increases   the elution of both antibiotics compared with commercially prepared   cements containing vancomycin. We found no significant advantages   of using expensive commercially produced vancomycin-impregnated cement   and recommend the addition of vancomycin powder by hand in the operating theatre.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:73–7.</p></sec>

Antibody-Mediated Inhibition of Tspan12 Ameliorates Vasoproliferative Retinopathy Through Suppression of β-Catenin Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Anti-angiogenic biologicals represent an important concept for the treatment of vasoproliferative diseases. However, the need for continued treatment, the presence of nonresponders, and the risk of long-term side effects limit the success of existing therapeutic agents. Although Tspan12 has been shown to regulate retinal vascular development, nothing is known about its involvement in neovascular disease and its potential as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of vasoproliferative diseases.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Rodent models of retinal neovascular disease, including the mouse model of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>-induced retinopathy and the very low density lipoprotein receptor knockout mouse model were analyzed for Tspan/β-catenin regulation. Screening of a phage display of a human combinatorial antibody (Ab) library was used for the development of a high-affinity Ab against Tspan12. Therapeutic effects of the newly developed Ab on vascular endothelial cells were tested in vitro and in vivo in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>-induced retinopathy and very low density lipoprotein receptor knockout mouse model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The newly developed anti-Tspan12 Ab exhibited potent inhibitory effects on endothelial cell migration and tube formation. Mechanistic studies confirmed that the Ab inhibited the interaction between Tspan12 and Frizzled-4 and effectively modulates β-catenin levels and target genes in vascular endothelial cells. Tspan12/β-catenin signaling was activated in response to acute and chronic stress in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>-induced retinopathy and very low density lipoprotein receptor mouse model of proliferative retinopathy. Intravitreal application of the Ab showed significant therapeutic effects in both models without inducing negative side effects on retina function. Moreover, combined intravitreal injection of the Ab with a known vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor, Aflibercept, resulted in significant enhancement of the therapeutic efficacy of each monotherapy. Combination therapy with the Tspan12 blocking antibody can be used to reduce anti-vascular endothelial growth factor doses, thus decreasing the risk of long-term off-target effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Tspan12/β-catenin signaling is critical for the progression of vasoproliferative disease. The newly developed anti-Tspan12 antibody has therapeutic effects in vasoproliferative retinopathy and can enhance the potency of existing anti- vascular endothelial growth factor agents.</p></sec>

cGMP-Elevating Compounds and Ischemic Conditioning Provide Cardioprotection Against Ischemia and Reperfusion Injury via Cardiomyocyte-Specific BK Channels
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The nitric oxide–sensitive guanylyl cyclase/cGMP-dependent protein kinase type I signaling pathway can afford protection against the ischemia/reperfusion injury that occurs during myocardial infarction. Reportedly, voltage and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channels of the BK type are stimulated by cGMP/cGMP-dependent protein kinase type I, and recent ex vivo studies implicated that increased BK activity favors the survival of the myocardium at ischemia/reperfusion. It remains unclear, however, whether the molecular events downstream of cGMP involve BK channels present in cardiomyocytes or in other cardiac cell types.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Gene-targeted mice with a cardiomyocyte- or smooth muscle cell–specific deletion of the BK (CMBK or SMBK knockouts) were subjected to the open-chest model of myocardial infarction. Infarct sizes of the conditional mutants were compared with litter-matched controls, global BK knockout, and wild-type mice. Cardiac damage was assessed after mechanical conditioning or pharmacological stimulation of the cGMP pathway and by using direct modulators of BK. Long-term outcome was studied with respect to heart functions and cardiac fibrosis in a chronic myocardial infarction model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Global BK knockouts and CMBK knockouts, in contrast with SMBK knockouts, exhibited significantly larger infarct sizes compared with their respective controls. Ablation of CMBK resulted in higher serum levels of cardiac troponin I and elevated amounts of reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species, lower phosphorylated extracellular receptor kinase and phosphorylated AKT levels and an increase in myocardial apoptosis. Moreover, CMBK was required to allow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">benefici</span></strong>al effects of both nitric oxide–sensitive guanylyl cyclase activation and inhibition of the cGMP-degrading phosphodiesterase-5, ischemic preconditioning, and postconditioning regimens. To this end, after 4 weeks of reperfusion, fibrotic tissue increased and myocardial strain echocardiography was significantly compromised in CMBK-deficient mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Lack of CMBK channels renders the heart more susceptible to ischemia/reperfusion injury, whereas the pathological events elicited by ischemia/reperfusion do not involve BK in vascular smooth muscle cells. BK seems to permit the protective effects triggered by cinaciguat, riociguat, and different phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">benefici</span></strong>al actions of ischemic preconditioning and ischemic postconditioning by a mechanism stemming primarily from cardiomyocytes. This study establishes mitochondrial CMBK channels as a promising target for limiting acute cardiac damage and adverse long-term events that occur after myocardial infarction.</p></sec>

Physiology of Angina and Its Alleviation With Nitroglycerin
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The mechanisms governing exercise-induced angina and its alleviation by the most commonly used antianginal drug, nitroglycerin, are incompletely understood. The purpose of this study was to develop a method by which the effects of antianginal drugs could be evaluated invasively during physiological exercise to gain further understanding of the clinical impact of angina and nitroglycerin.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Forty patients (mean age, 65.2±7.6 years) with exertional angina and coronary artery disease underwent cardiac catheterization via radial access and performed incremental exercise using a supine cycle ergometer. As they developed limiting angina, sublingual nitroglycerin was administered to half the patients, and all patients continued to exercise for 2 minutes at the same workload. Throughout exercise, distal coronary pressure and flow velocity and central aortic pressure were recorded with sensor wires.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Patients continued to exercise after nitroglycerin administration with less ST-segment depression (<i>P</i>=0.003) and therefore myocardial ischemia. Significant reductions in afterload (aortic pressure, <i>P</i>=0.030) and myocardial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> demand were seen (tension-time index, <i>P</i>=0.024; rate-pressure product, <i>P</i>=0.046), as well as an increase in myocardial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> supply (Buckberg index, <i>P</i>=0.017). Exercise reduced peripheral arterial wave reflection (<i>P</i><0.05), which was not further augmented by the administration of nitroglycerin (<i>P</i>=0.648). The observed increases in coronary pressure gradient, stenosis resistance, and flow velocity did not reach statistical significance; however, the diastolic velocity–pressure gradient relation was consistent with a significant increase in relative stenosis severity (k coefficient, <i>P</i><0.0001), in keeping with exercise-induced vasoconstriction of stenosed epicardial segments and dilatation of normal segments, with trends toward reversal with nitroglycerin.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The catheterization laboratory protocol provides a model to study myocardial ischemia and the actions of novel and established antianginal drugs. Administration of nitroglycerin causes changes in the systemic and coronary circulation that combine to reduce myocardial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> demand and to increase supply, thereby attenuating exercise-induced ischemia. Designing antianginal therapies that exploit these mechanisms may provide new therapeutic strategies.</p></sec>

The median follow-up was 23.2 months (range; 1–112 months). Among the 717 survivors, recurrent PVO was observed in 111 patients (15%). Associated risk factors for recurrent PVO included preoperative PVO (<i>P</i><0.001), infracardiac TAPVC (<i>P</i><0.001), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mix</span></strong>ed TAPVC (<i>P</i>=0.013), and prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass time (<i>P</i><0.001). Sutureless technique was associated with a lower restenosis rate compared with conventional repair in patients with preoperative PVO (<i>P</i>=0.038), except in newborn patients (<i>P</i>=0.443).

The function of most survivors (91%) was classified according to the New York Heart Association as functional class I or II.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Surgical correction in patients with TAPVC with a biventricular anatomy can achieve an acceptable outcome.

Gene Regulation and Survival under Hypoxia Requires Starch Availability and Metabolism
<p>Plants respond to hypoxia, often caused by submergence, by expressing a specific set of genes that contribute to acclimation to this unfavorable environmental condition. Genes induced by low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> include those encoding enzymes for carbohydrate metabolism and fermentation, pathways that are required for survival. Sugar availability is therefore of crucial importance for energy production under hypoxia. Here, we show that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants require starch for surviving submergence as well as for ensuring the rapid induction of genes encoding enzymes required for anaerobic metabolism. The starchless <i>pgm</i> mutant is highly susceptible to submergence and also fails to induce anaerobic genes at the level of the wild type. Treating wild-type plants under conditions inducing sugar starvation results in a weak induction of alcohol dehydrogenase and other anaerobic genes. Induction of gene expression under hypoxia requires transcription factors belonging to group VII ethylene response factors (ERF-VII) that, together with plant Cys oxidases, act as an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>-sensing mechanism. We show that repression of this pathway by sugar starvation occurs downstream of the hypoxia-dependent stabilization of ERF-VII proteins and independently of the energy sensor protein kinases SnRK1.1 (SNF1-related kinase 1.1).</p>

Carnosic Acid and Carnosol, Two Major Antioxidants of Rosemary, Act through Different Mechanisms
<p>Carnosic acid, a phenolic diterpene specific to the Lamiaceae family, is highly abundant in rosemary (<i>Rosmarinus officinalis</i>). Despite numerous industrial and medicinal/pharmaceutical applications of its antioxidative features, this compound in planta and its antioxidant mechanism have received little attention, except a few studies of rosemary plants under natural conditions. In vitro analyses, using high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet and luminescence imaging, revealed that carnosic acid and its major oxidized derivative, carnosol, protect lipids from oxidation. Both compounds preserved linolenic acid and monogalactosyldiacylglycerol from singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> and from hydroxyl radical. When applied exogenously, they were both able to protect thylakoid membranes prepared from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves against lipid peroxidation. Different levels of carnosic acid and carnosol in two contrasting rosemary varieties correlated with tolerance to lipid peroxidation. Upon reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species (ROS) oxidation of lipids, carnosic acid was consumed and oxidized into various derivatives, including into carnosol, while carnosol resisted, suggesting that carnosic acid is a chemical quencher of ROS. The antioxidative function of carnosol relies on another mechanism, occurring directly in the lipid oxidation process. Under oxidative conditions that did not involve ROS generation, carnosol inhibited lipid peroxidation, contrary to carnosic acid. Using spin probes and electron paramagnetic resonance detection, we confirmed that carnosic acid, rather than carnosol, is a ROS quencher. Various oxidized derivatives of carnosic acid were detected in rosemary leaves in low light, indicating chronic oxidation of this compound, and accumulated in plants exposed to stress conditions, in parallel with a loss of carnosic acid, confirming that chemical quenching of ROS by carnosic acid takes place in planta.</p>

Paralogs of the C-Terminal Domain of the Cyanobacterial Orange Carotenoid Protein Are Carotenoid Donors to Helical Carotenoid Proteins
<p>The photoactive Orange Carotenoid Protein (OCP) photoprotects cyanobacteria cells by quenching singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> and excess excitation energy. Its N-terminal domain is the active part of the protein, and the C-terminal domain regulates the activity. Recently, the characteristics of a family of soluble carotenoid-binding proteins (Helical Carotenoid Proteins [HCPs]), paralogs of the N-terminal domain of OCP, were described. Bioinformatics studies also revealed the existence of genes coding for homologs of CTD. Here, we show that the latter genes encode carotenoid proteins (CTDHs). This family of proteins contains two subgroups with distinct characteristics. One CTDH of each clade was further characterized, and they proved to be very good singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> quenchers. When synthesized in <i>Escherichia coli</i> or <i>Synechocystis</i> PCC 6803, CTDHs formed dimers that share a carotenoid molecule and are able to transfer their carotenoid to apo-HCPs and apo-OCP. The CTDHs from clade 2 have a cysteine in position 103. A disulfide bond is easily formed between the monomers of the dimer preventing carotenoid transfer. This suggests that the transfer of the carotenoid could be redox regulated in clade 2 CTDH. We also demonstrate here that apo-OCPs and apo-CTDHs are able to take the carotenoid directly from membranes, while HCPs are unable to do so. HCPs need the presence of CTDH to become holo-proteins. We propose that, in cyanobacteria, the CTDHs are carotenoid donors to HCPs.</p>

Histone Deacetylase Is Required for GA-Induced Programmed Cell Death in Maize Aleurone Layers
<p>Recent discoveries have shown that epigenetic regulation is an integral part of phytohormone-mediated processes. The phytohormone gibberellin (GA) triggers a series of events in cereal aleurone cells that lead to programmed cell death (PCD), but the signaling cascade mediating GA-induced PCD in cereal aleurone layers remains largely unknown. Here, we showed that histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity gradually increased relative to histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity, leading to a global decrease in histone H3 and H4 acetylation levels during PCD of maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) embryoless aleurone layers after 3 d of treatment with GA. HDAC inhibition prevented GA-induced PCD in embryoless aleurone cells, whereas HAT inhibition resulted in PCD even in the absence of GA. Hydrogen peroxide concentrations increased in GA- or HAT inhibitor-treated aleurone cells due to reduced levels of reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species scavengers. Hydrogen peroxide-treated aleurone cells showed no changes in the activity or expression of HATs and HDACs. We show that it is possible to predict whether epigenetic modification enzymes serve as a regulator of the GA-triggered PCD signaling pathway in maize aleurone layers. Taken together, these findings reveal that HDAC activity is required for GA-induced PCD in maize aleurone layers and regulates PCD via the reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species-mediated signal transduction pathway.</p>

Pea Border Cell Maturation and Release Involve Complex Cell Wall Structural Dynamics
<p>The adhesion of plant cells is vital for support and protection of the plant body and is maintained by a variety of molecular associations between cell wall components. In some specialized cases, though, plant cells are programmed to detach, and root cap-derived border cells are examples of this. Border cells (in some species known as border-like cells) provide an expendable barrier between roots and the environment. Their maturation and release is an important but poorly characterized cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation event. To gain a deeper insight into the complex cellular dynamics underlying this process, we undertook a systematic, detailed analysis of pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) root tip cell walls. Our study included immunocarbohydrate microarray profiling, monosaccharide composition determination, Fourier-transformed infrared microspectroscopy, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR of cell wall biosynthetic genes, analysis of hydrolytic activities, transmission electron microscopy, and immunolocalization of cell wall components. Using this integrated glycobiology approach, we identified multiple novel modes of cell wall structural and compositional rearrangement during root cap growth and the release of border cells. Our findings provide a new level of detail about border cell maturation and enable us to develop a model of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation process. We propose that loss of adhesion by the dissolution of homogalacturonan in the middle lamellae is augmented by an active biophysical process of cell curvature driven by the polarized distribution of xyloglucan and extensin epitopes.</p>

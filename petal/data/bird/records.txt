Discovering relationships between nuclear receptor signaling pathways, genes, and tissues in Transcriptomine
<p>We previously developed a web tool, Transcriptomine, to explore expression profiling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> sets involving small-molecule or genetic manipulations of nuclear receptor signaling pathways. We describe advances in biocuration, query interface design, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> visualization that enhance the discovery of uncharacterized biology in these pathways using this tool. Transcriptomine currently contains about 45 million <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> points encompassing more than 2000 experiments in a reference library of nearly 550 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> sets retrieved from public archives and systematically curated. To make the underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> points more accessible to bench biologists, we classified experimental small molecules and gene manipulations into signaling pathways and experimental tissues and cell lines into physiological systems and organs. Incorporation of these mappings into Transcriptomine enables the user to readily evaluate tissue-specific regulation of gene expression by nuclear receptor signaling pathways. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> points from animal and cell model experiments and from clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> sets elucidate the roles of nuclear receptor pathways in gene expression events accompanying various normal and pathological cellular processes. In addition, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> sets targeting non-nuclear receptor signaling pathways highlight transcriptional cross-talk between nuclear receptors and other signaling pathways. We demonstrate with specific examples how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> points that exist in isolation in individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> sets validate each other when connected and made accessible to the user in a single interface. In summary, Transcriptomine allows bench biologists to routinely develop research hypotheses, validate experimental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong>, or model relationships between signaling pathways, genes, and tissues.</p>

Phylogenetic Signal Variation in the Genomes of <i>Medicago</i> (Fabaceae)
<p>Genome-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> offer the opportunity to clarify phylogenetic relationships that are difficult to resolve with few loci, but they can also identify genomic regions with evolutionary history distinct from that of the species history. We collected whole-genome sequence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> from 29 taxa in the legume genus <i>Medicago</i>, then aligned these sequences to the <i>Medicago truncatula</i> reference genome to confidently identify 87 596 variable homologous sites. We used this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> set to estimate phylogenetic relationships among <i>Medicago</i> species, to investigate the number of sites needed to provide robust phylogenetic estimates and to identify specific genomic regions supporting topologies in conflict with the genome-wide phylogeny. Our full genomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> set resolves relationships within the genus that were previously intractable. Subsampling the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> reveals considerable variation in phylogenetic signal and power in smaller subsets of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong>. Even when sampling 5000 sites, no random sample of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> supports a topology identical to that of the genome-wide phylogeny. Phylogenetic relationships estimated from 500-site sliding windows revealed genome regions supporting several alternative species relationships among recently diverged taxa, consistent with the expected effects of deep coalescence or introgression in the recent history of <i>Medicago</i>.

BIG Regulates Dynamic Adjustment of Circadian Period in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>Circadian clocks drive rhythms with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">period</span></strong> near 24 h, but the molecular basis of the regulation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">period</span></strong> of the circadian clockis poorly understood. We previously demonstrated that metabolites affect the free-running <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">period</span></strong> of the circadian oscillator of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), with endogenous sugars acting as an accelerator and exogenous nicotinamide acting as a brake. Changes in circadian oscillator <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">period</span></strong> are thought to adjust the timing of biological activities through the process of entrainment, in which the circadian oscillator becomes synchronized to rhythmic signals such as light and dark cycles as well as changes in internal metabolism. To identify the molecular components associated with the dynamic adjustment of circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">period</span></strong>, we performed a forward genetic screen. We identified Arabidopsis mutants that were either <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">period</span></strong> insensitive to nicotinamide (<i>sin</i>) or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">period</span></strong> oversensitive to nicotinamide (<i>son</i>). We mapped <i>son1</i> to <i>BIG</i>, a gene of unknown molecular function that was shown previously to play a role in light signaling. We found that <i>son1</i> has an early entrained phase, suggesting that the dynamic alteration of circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">period</span></strong> contributes to the correct timing of biological events. Our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> provide insight into how the dynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">period</span></strong> adjustment of circadian oscillators contributes to establishing a correct phase relationship with the environment and show that BIG is involved in this process.</p>

Endogenous retinoid X receptor ligands in mouse hematopoietic cells
<p>The retinoid X receptor α (RXRA) has been implicated in diverse hematological processes. To identify natural ligands of RXRA that are present in hematopoietic cells, we adapted an upstream activation sequence–green fluorescent protein (UAS-GFP) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>er mouse to detect natural RXRA ligands in vivo. We observed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>er activity in diverse types of hematopoietic cells in vivo. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>er activity increased during granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)–induced granulopoiesis and after phenylhydrazine (PHZ)–induced anemia, suggesting the presence of dynamically regulated natural RXRA ligands in hematopoietic cells. Mouse plasma activated Gal4-UAS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>er cells in vitro, and plasma from mice treated with G-CSF or PHZ recapitulated the patterns of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>er activation that we observed in vivo. Plasma from mice with dietary vitamin A deficiency only mildly reduced RXRA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>er activity, whereas plasma from mice on a fatty acid restriction diet reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>er activity, implicating fatty acids as plasma RXRA ligands.

Together, these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> suggest that natural RXRA ligands are present and dynamically increased in abundance in mouse hematopoietic cells in vivo.</p>

Digital chemical test impresses
<p>Toxicologists this week unveiled a chemical safety screening tool that could greatly reduce the need for six common animal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>s. Those <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>s account for nearly 60% of the estimated 3 million to 4 million animals used annually in risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing worldwide. The computerized tool—built on a massive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong>base of molecular structures and existing safety <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong>—appears to match, and sometimes improve on, the results of animal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>s for properties such as skin sensitization and eye irritation, the researchers <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong> in today's issue of <i>Toxicological Sciences</i>. But it also has limitations; for instance, the method can't reliably evaluate a chemical's risk of causing cancer. And it's not clear how open regulatory agencies will be to adopting a nonanimal approach, although both European and U.S. regulators say they are open to the idea. Still, the big <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> approach is encouraging to those seeking to reduce and replace animal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing.</p>

Synergistic Pectin Degradation and Guard Cell Pressurization Underlie Stomatal Pore Formation
<p>Stomatal pores are vital for the diffusion of gasses into and out of land plants and are, therefore, gatekeepers for photosynthesis and transpiration. Although much published literature has described the intercellular signaling and transcriptional regulators involved in early stomatal development, little is known about the cellular details of the local separation between sister guard cells that give rise to the stomatal pore or how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of this pore is achieved. Using three-dimensional (3D) time-lapse imaging, we found that stomatal pore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) is a highly dynamic process involving pore initiation and enlargement and traverses a set of morphological milestones in 3D. Confocal imaging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> revealed an enrichment of exocytic machinery, de-methyl-esterified pectic homogalacturonan (HG), and an HG-degrading enzyme at future pore sites, suggesting that both localized HG deposition and degradation might function in pore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. By manipulating HG modification via enzymatic, chemical, and genetic perturbations in seedling cotyledons, we found that augmenting HG modification promotes pore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion, whereas preventing HG de-methyl-esterification delays pore initiation and inhibits pore enlargement. Through mechanical modeling and experimentation, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ed whether pore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion is an outcome of sister guard cells being pulled away from each other upon turgor increase. Osmotic treatment to reduce turgor pressure did not prevent pore initiation but did lessen pore enlargement. Together, these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> provide evidence that HG delivery and modification, and guard cell pressurization, make functional contributions to stomatal pore initiation and enlargement.</p>

Development of the prethalamus is crucial for thalamocortical projection formation and is regulated by Olig2
<p>Thalamocortical axons (TCAs) pass through the prethalamus in the first step of their neural circuit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. Although it has been supposed that the prethalamus is an intermediate target for thalamocortical projection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion, much less is known about the molecular mechanisms of this targeting. Here, we demonstrated the functional implications of the prethalamus in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of this neural circuit. We show that Olig2 transcription factor, which is expressed in the ventricular zone (VZ) of prosomere 3, regulates prethalamus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion, and loss of Olig2 results in reduced prethalamus size in early development, which is accompanied by expansion of the thalamic eminence (TE). Extension of TCAs is disorganized in the <i>Olig2-KO</i> dorsal thalamus, and initial elongation of TCAs is retarded in the <i>Olig2-KO</i> forebrain. Microarray analysis demonstrated upregulation of several axon guidance molecules, including <i>Epha3</i> and <i>Epha5</i>, in the <i>Olig2-KO</i> basal forebrain. <i>In situ</i> hybridization showed that the prethalamus in the wild type excluded the expression of <i>Epha3</i> and <i>Epha5</i>, whereas loss of Olig2 resulted in reduction of this Ephas-negative area and the corresponding expansion of the Ephas-positive TE. Dissociated cultures of thalamic progenitor cells demonstrated that substrate-bound EphA3 suppresses neurite extension from dorsal thalamic neurons. These results indicate that Olig2 is involved in correct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of the prethalamus, which leads to exclusion of the EphA3-expressing region and is crucial for proper TCA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. Our observation is the first <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong> showing the molecular mechanisms underlying how the prethalamus acts on initial thalamocortical projection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion.</p>

Interferon Regulatory Factor 4 Inhibits Neointima Formation by Engaging Krüppel-Like Factor 4 Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The mechanisms underlying neointima <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion remain unclear. Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), which are key innate immune regulators, play important roles in cardiometabolic diseases. However, the function of IRF4 in arterial restenosis is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>IRF4 expression was first detected in human and mouse restenotic arteries. Then, the effects of IRF4 on neointima <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion were evaluated with universal IRF4-deficient mouse and rat carotid artery injury models. We performed immunostaining to identify IRF4-expressing cells in the lesions. Smooth muscle cell (SMC)–specific IRF4-knockout (KO) and -transgenic (TG) mice were generated to evaluate the effects of SMC-IRF4 on neointima <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. We used microarray, bioin<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ics analysis, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay to identify the downstream signals of IRF4 and to verify the targets in vitro. We compared SMC-IRF4-KO/Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4)–TG mice with SMC-IRF4-KO mice and SMC-specific IRF4-TG/KLF4-KO mice with SMC-specific IRF4-TG mice to investigate whether the effect of IRF4 on neointima <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion is KLF4-dependent. The effect of IRF4 on SMC phenotype switching was also evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>IRF4 expression in both the human and mouse restenotic arteries is eventually downregulated. Universal IRF4 ablation potentiates neointima <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion in both mice and rats. Immunostaining indicated that IRF4 was expressed primarily in SMCs in restenotic arteries. After injury, SMC-IRF4-KO mice developed a thicker neointima than control mice. This change was accompanied by increased SMC proliferation and migration. However, SMC-specific IRF4-TG mice exhibited the opposite phenotype, demonstrating that IRF4 exerts protective effects against neointima <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. The mechanistic study indicated that IRF4 promotes KLF4 expression by directly binding to its promoter. Genetic overexpression of KLF4 in SMCs largely reversed the neointima-promoting effect of IRF4 ablation, whereas ablation of KLF4 abolished the protective function of IRF4, indicating that the protective effects of IRF4 against neointima <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion are KLF4-dependent. In addition, IRF4 promoted SMC dedifferentiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>IRF4 protects arteries against neointima <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion by promoting the expression of KLF4 by directly binding to its promoter. Our findings suggest that this previously undiscovered IRF4-KLF4 axis plays a key role in vasculoproliferative pathology and may be a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of arterial restenosis.</p></sec>

Systematic Biology
Geometric Morphometric Character Suites as Phylogenetic Data: Extracting Phylogenetic Signal from Gastropod Shells
<p>Despite being the objects of numerous macroevolutionary studies, many of the best represented constituents of the fossil record—including diverse examples such as foraminifera, brachiopods, and mollusks—have mineralized skeletons with limited discrete characteristics, making morphological phylogenies difficult to construct. In contrast to their paucity of phylogenetic characters, the mineralized structures (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>s and shells) of these fossil groups frequently have distinctive shapes that have long proved useful for their classification. The recent introduction of methodologies for including continuous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> directly in a phylogenetic analysis has increased the number of available characters, making it possible to produce phylogenies based, in whole or part, on continuous character <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> collected from such taxa. Geometric morphometric methods provide tools for accurately characterizing shape variation and can produce quantitative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> that can therefore now be included in a phylogenetic matrix in a nonarbitrary manner. Here, the marine gastropod genus <i>Conus</i> is used to evaluate the ability of continuous characters—generated from a geometric morphometric analysis of shell shape—to contribute to a total evidence phylogenetic hypothesis constructed using molecular and morphological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong>. Furthermore, the ability of continuous characters derived from geometric morphometric analyses to place fossil taxa with limited discrete characters into a phylogeny with their extant relatives was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ed by simulating the inclusion of fossil taxa. This was done by removing the molecular partition of individual extant species to produce a “cladistic pseudofossil” with only the geometric morphometric derived characters coded. The phylogenetic position of each cladistic pseudofossil taxon was then compared with its placement in the total evidence tree and a symmetric resampling tree to evaluate the degree to which morphometric characters alone can correctly place simulated fossil species. In 33–45% of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> cases (depending upon the approach used for measuring success), it was possible to place the pseudofossil taxon into the correct regions of the phylogeny using only the morphometric characters. This suggests that the incorporation of extinct <i>Conus</i> taxa into phylogenetic hypotheses will be possible, permitting a wide range of macroevolutionary questions to be addressed within this genus. This methodology also has potential to contribute to phylogenetic reconstructions for other major components of the fossil record that lack numerous discrete characters.

Transcriptional Roadmap to Seasonal Variation in Wood Formation of Norway Spruce
<p>Seasonal cues influence several aspects of the secondary growth of tree stems, including cambial activity, wood chemistry, and transition to latewood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. We investigated seasonal changes in cambial activity, secondary cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion, and tracheid cell death in woody tissues of Norway spruce (<i>Picea abies</i>) throughout one seasonal cycle. RNA sequencing was performed simultaneously in both the xylem and cambium/phloem tissues of the stem. Principal component analysis revealed gradual shifts in the transcriptomes that followed a chronological order throughout the season. A notable remodeling of the transcriptome was observed in the winter, with many genes having maximal expression during the coldest months of the year. A highly coexpressed set of monolignol biosynthesis genes showed high expression during the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">period</span></strong> of secondary cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion as well as a second peak in midwinter. This midwinter peak in expression did not trigger lignin deposition, as determined by pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Coexpression consensus network analyses suggested the involvement of transcription factors belonging to the ASYMMETRIC LEAVES2/LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES and MYELOBLASTOSIS-HOMEOBOX families in the seasonal control of secondary cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of tracheids. Interestingly, the lifetime of the latewood tracheids stretched beyond the winter dormancy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">period</span></strong>, correlating with a lack of cell death-related gene expression. Our transcriptomic analyses combined with phylogenetic and microscopic analyses also identified the cellulose and lignin biosynthetic genes and putative regulators for latewood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion and tracheid cell death in Norway spruce, providing a toolbox for further physiological and functional assays of these important phase transitions.</p>

Wounding Triggers Callus Formation via Dynamic Hormonal and Transcriptional Changes
<p>Wounding is a primary trigger of organ regeneration, but how wound stress reactivates cell proliferation and promotes cellular reprogramming remains elusive. In this study, we combined transcriptome analysis with quantitative hormonal analysis to investigate how wounding induces callus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Our time course RNA-seq analysis revealed that wounding induces dynamic transcriptional changes, starting from rapid stress responses followed by the activation of metabolic processes and protein synthesis and subsequent activation of cell cycle regulators. Gene ontology analyses further uncovered that wounding modifies the expression of hormone biosynthesis and response genes, and quantitative analysis of endogenous plant hormones revealed accumulation of cytokinin prior to callus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. Mutants defective in cytokinin synthesis and signaling display reduced efficiency in callus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion, indicating that de novo synthesis of cytokinin is critical for wound-induced callus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. We further demonstrate that type-B ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR-mediated cytokinin signaling regulates the expression of <i>CYCLIN D3;1</i> (<i>CYCD3;1</i>) and that mutations in <i>CYCD3;1</i> and its homologs <i>CYCD3;2</i> and <i>3</i> cause defects in callus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. In addition to these hormone-mediated changes, our transcriptome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> uncovered that wounding activates multiple developmental regulators, and we found novel roles of ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR 115 and PLETHORA3 (PLT3), PLT5, and PLT7 in callus generation. All together, these results provide novel mechanistic insights into how wounding reactivates cell proliferation during callus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion.</p>

Construction and Optimization of a Large Gene Coexpression Network in Maize Using RNA-Seq Data
<p>With the emergence of massively parallel sequencing, genomewide expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> production has reached an unprecedented level. This abundance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> has greatly facilitated maize research, but may not be amenable to traditional analysis techniques that were optimized for other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> types. Using publicly available <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong>, a gene coexpression network (GCN) can be constructed and used for gene function prediction, candidate gene selection, and improving understanding of regulatory pathways. Several GCN studies have been done in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), mostly using microarray <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong>sets. To build an optimal GCN from plant materials RNA-Seq <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong>, parameters for expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> normalization and network inference were evaluated. A comprehensive evaluation of these two parameters and a ranked aggregation strategy on network performance, using libraries from 1266 maize samples, were conducted. Three normalization methods and 10 inference methods, including six correlation and four mutual in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion methods, were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ed. The three normalization methods had very similar performance. For network inference, correlation methods performed better than mutual in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion methods at some genes. Increasing sample size also had a positive effect on GCN. Aggregating single networks together resulted in improved performance compared to single networks.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
The Evolution of Human Cells in Terms of Protein Innovation
<p>Humans are composed of hundreds of cell types. As the genomic DNA of each somatic cell is identical, cell type is determined by what is expressed and when. Until recently, little has been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed about the determinants of human cell identity, particularly from the joint perspective of gene evolution and expression. Here, we chart the evolutionary past of all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong></span></strong>ed human cell types via the collective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">histori</span></strong>es of proteins, the principal product of gene expression. FANTOM5 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> provide cell-type–specific digital expression of human protein-coding genes and the SUPERFAMILY resource is used to provide protein domain annotation. The evolutionary epoch in which each protein was created is inferred by comparison with domain annotation of all other completely sequenced genomes. Studying the distribution across epochs of genes expressed in each cell type reveals insights into human cellular evolution in terms of protein innovation. For each cell type, its history of protein innovation is charted based on the genes it expresses. Combining the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">histori</span></strong>es of all cell types enables us to create a timeline of cell evolution. This timeline identifies the possibility that our common ancestor Coelomata (cavity-forming animals) provided the innovation required for the innate immune system, whereas cells which now form the brain of human have followed a trajectory of continually accumulating novel proteins since Opisthokonta (boundary of animals and fungi). We conclude that exaptation of existing domain architectures into new con<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">text</span></strong>s is the dominant source of cell-type–specific domain architectures.</p>

An empirical study of the wound effect on sap flux density measured with thermal dissipation probes
<p>The insertion of thermal dissipation (TD) sensors on tree stems for sap flux density (SFD) measurements can lead to SFD underestimations due to a wound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion close to the drill hole. However, the wound effect has not been assessed experimentally for this method yet. Here, we propose an empirical approach to investigate the effect of the wound healing on measured sap flux with TD probes. The approach was performed for both, diffuse-porous (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i> (Linnaeus)) and ring-porous (<i>Quercus petraea</i> (Lieblein)) species. Thermal dissipation probes were installed on different dates along the growing season to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong></span></strong> the effects of the dynamic wound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. The trees were cut in autumn and additional sensors were installed in the cut stems, therefore, without potential effects of wound development. A range of water pressures was applied to the stem segments and SFDs were simultaneously measured by TD sensors as well as gravimetrically in the laboratory. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of wounds around sensors installed in living tree stems led to underestimation of SFD by 21.4 ± 3 and 47.5 ± 3.8% in beech and oak, respectively. The differences between SFD underestimations of diffuse-porous beech and ring-porous oak were, however, not statistically significant. Sensors with 5-, 11- and 22-week-old wounds also showed no significant differences, which implies that the influence of wound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion on SFD estimates was completed within the first few weeks after perforation. These results were confirmed by time courses of SFD measurements in the field. Field SFD values decreased immediately after sensor installation and reached stable values after ~2 weeks with similar underestimations to the ones observed in the laboratory. We therefore propose a feasible approach to correct directly field observations of SFD for potential underestimations due to the wound effect.</p>

Thermal processing of diblock copolymer melts mimics metallurgy

Improving election prediction internationally
<p>This study <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>s the results of a multiyear program to predict direct executive elections in a variety of countries from globally pooled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong>. We developed prediction models by means of an election <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> set covering 86 countries and more than 500 elections, and a separate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> set with extensive polling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> from 146 election rounds. We also participated in two live forecasting experiments. Our models correctly predicted 80 to 90% of elections in out-of-sample <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>s. The results suggest that global elections can be successfully modeled and that they are likely to become more predictable as more in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion becomes available in future elections. The results provide strong evidence for the impact of political institutions and incumbent advantage. They also provide evidence to support contentions about the importance of international linkage and aid. Direct evidence for economic indicators as predictors of election outcomes is relatively weak. The results suggest that, with some adjustments, global polling is a robust predictor of election outcomes, even in developing states. Implications of these findings after the la<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> U.S. presidential election are discussed.</p>

BZR1 Mediates Brassinosteroid-Induced Autophagy and Nitrogen Starvation in Tomato
<p>Autophagy, an innate cellular destructive mechanism, plays crucial roles in plant development and responses to stress. Autophagy is known to be stimulated or suppressed by multiple molecular processes, but the role of phytohormone signaling in autophagy is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the transcripts of autophagy-related genes (<i>ATGs</i>) and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of autophagosomes are triggered by enhanced levels of brassinosteroid (BR). Furthermore, the BR-activated transcription factor brassinazole-resistant1 (BZR1), a positive regulator of the BR signaling pathway, is involved in BR-induced autophagy. Treatment with BR enhanced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of autophagosomes and the transcripts of <i>ATGs</i> in <i>BZR1</i>-overexpressing plants, while the effects of BR were compromised in <i>BZR1</i>-silenced plants. Yeast one-hybrid analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with quantitative polymerase chain reaction revealed that BZR1 bound to the promoters of <i>ATG2</i> and <i>ATG6</i>. The BR-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of autophagosomes decreased in <i>ATG2</i>- and <i>ATG6</i>-silenced plants. Moreover, exogenous application of BR enhanced chlorophyll content and autophagosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion and decreased the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins under nitrogen starvation. Leaf chlorosis and chlorophyll degradation were exacerbated in <i>BZR1</i>-silenced plants and the BR biosynthetic mutant <i>d<sup>^im</sup></i> but were alleviated in <i>BZR1</i>- and <i>BZR1-1D</i>-overexpressing plants under nitrogen starvation. Meanwhile, nitrogen starvation-induced expression of <i>ATGs</i> and autophagosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion were compromised in both <i>BZR1</i>-silenced and <i>d<sup>^im</sup></i> plants but were increased in <i>BZR1</i>- and <i>BZR1-1D</i>-overexpressing plants. Taken together, our results suggest that BZR1-dependent BR signaling up-regulates the expression of <i>ATGs</i> and autophagosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion, which plays a critical role in the plant response to nitrogen starvation in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>).</p>

Time-Course Transcriptome Analysis of Arabidopsis Siliques Discloses Genes Essential for Fruit Development and Maturation
<p>Fruits protect the developing seeds of angiosperms and actively contribute to seed dispersion. Furthermore, fruit and seed development are highly synchronized and require exchange of in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion between the mother plant and the developing generations. To explore the mechanisms controlling fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion and maturation, we performed a transcriptomic analysis on the valve tissue of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) silique using RNA sequencing. In doing so, we have generated a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> set of differentially regulated genes that will help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that underpin the initial phase of fruit growth and, subsequently, trigger fruit maturation. The robustness of our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> set has been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ed by functional genomic studies. Using a reverse genetics approach, we selected 10 differentially expressed genes and explored the consequences of their disruption for both silique growth and senescence. We found that genes contained in our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> set play essential roles in different stages of silique development and maturation, indicating that our transcriptome-based gene list is a powerful tool for the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms controlling fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion in Arabidopsis.</p>

NTL8 Regulates Trichome Formation in Arabidopsis by Directly Activating R3 MYB Genes <i>TRY</i> and <i>TCL1</i>
<p>The NAM, ATAF1/2, and CUC (NAC) are plant-specific transcription factors that regulate multiple aspects of plant growth and development and plant response to environmental stimuli. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong> here the identification of NTM1-LIKE8 (NTL8), a membrane-associated NAC transcription factor, as a novel regulator of trichome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). From an activation-tagged Arabidopsis population, we identified a dominant, gain-of-function mutant with glabrous inflorescence stem. By using plasmid rescue and RT-PCR analyses, we found that <i>NTL8</i> was tagged; thus, the mutant was named <i>ntl8-1 Dominant</i> (<i>ntl8-1D</i>). Recapitulation experiment further confirmed that the phenotype observed in the <i>ntl8-1D</i> mutant was caused by elevated expression of <i>NTL8</i>. Quantitative RT-PCR results showed that the expression level of the single-repeat R3 MYB genes <i>TRIPTYCHON</i> (<i>TRY</i>) and <i>TRICHOMELESS1</i> (<i>TCL1</i>) was elevated in the <i>ntl8-1D</i> mutant. Genetic analyses demonstrated that NTL8 acts upstream of TRY and TCL1 in the regulation of trichome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. When recruited to the promoter region of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>er gene <i>Gal4:GUS</i> by a fused GAL4 DNA-binding domain, NTL8 activated the expression of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>er gene. Chromatin immunoprecipitation results indicated that <i>TRY</i> and <i>TCL1</i> are direct targets of NTL8. However, NTL8 did not interact with SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN LIKE9, another transcription factor that regulates the expression of <i>TRY</i> and <i>TCL1</i>, in yeast and plant cells. Taken together, our results suggest that NTL8 negatively regulates trichome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion in Arabidopsis by directly activating the expression of <i>TRY</i> and <i>TCL1</i>.</p>

Monogalactosyldiacylglycerol Facilitates Synthesis of Photoactive Protochlorophyllide in Etioplasts
<p>Cotyledon cells of dark-germinated angiosperms develop etioplasts that are plastids containing unique internal membranes called prolamellar bodies (PLBs). Protochlorophyllide (Pchlide), a precursor of chlorophyll, accumulates in PLBs and forms a ternary complex with NADPH and light-dependent NADPH:protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (LPOR), which allows for the rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of chlorophyll after illumination while avoiding photodamage. PLBs are 3D lattice structures formed by the lipid bilayer rich in monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG). Although MGDG was found to be required for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion and function of the thylakoid membrane in chloroplasts in various plants, the roles of MGDG in PLB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion and etioplast development are largely unknown. To analyze the roles of MGDG in etioplast development, we suppressed <i>MGD1</i> encoding the major isoform of MGDG synthase by using a dexamethasone-inducible artificial microRNA in etiolated Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings. Strong <i>MGD1</i> suppression caused a 36% loss of MGDG in etiolated seedlings, together with a 41% decrease in total Pchlide content. The loss of MGDG perturbed etioplast membrane structures and impaired the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of the photoactive Pchlide-LPOR-NADPH complex and its oligomerization, without affecting LPOR accumulation. The <i>MGD1</i> suppression also impaired the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of Pchlide from protoporphyrin IX via multiple enzymatic reactions in etioplast membranes, which suggests that MGDG is required for the membrane-associated processes in the Pchlide biosynthesis pathway. Suppressing <i>MGD1</i> at several germination stages revealed that MGDG biosynthesis at an early germination stage is particularly important for Pchlide accumulation. MGDG biosynthesis may provide a lipid matrix for Pchlide biosynthesis and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of Pchlide-LPOR complexes as an initial step of etioplast development.</p>

The metabolic cost of communicative sound production in bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>)
<p>Bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>) produce various communicative sounds that are important for social behavior, maintaining group cohesion and coordinating foraging. For example, whistle production increases during disturbances, such as separations of mother–calf pairs and vessel approaches. It is clear that acoustic communication is important to the survival of these marine mammals, yet the metabolic cost of producing whistles and other socials sounds and the energetic consequences of modifying these sounds in response to both natural and anthropogenic disturbance are unknown. We used flow-through respirometry to determine whether the metabolic cost of sound production could be quantified in two captive dolphins producing social sounds (whistles and squawks). On average, we found that metabolic rates measured during 2 min <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">period</span></strong>s of sound production were 1.2 times resting values. Up to 7 min were required for metabolism to return to resting values following vocal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">period</span></strong>s. The total metabolic cost (over resting values) of the 2 min vocal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">period</span></strong> plus the required recovery <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">period</span></strong> (163.3 to 2995.9 ml O<sub>2</sub> or 3279.6 to 60,166.7 J) varied by individual as well as by mean duration of sounds produced within the vocal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">period</span></strong>. Observed variation in received cumulative sound energy levels of vocalizations was not related to total metabolic costs. Furthermore, our empirical findings did not agree with previous theoretical estimates of the metabolic cost of whistles. This study provides the first empirical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> on the metabolic cost of sound production in dolphins, which can be used to estimate metabolic costs of vocal responses to environmental perturbations in wild dolphins.</p>

Ventricular Fibrillation Conversion Testing After Implantation of a Subcutaneous Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Compared with transvenous implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), subcutaneous (S)-ICDs require a higher energy for effective defibrillation. Although ventricular fibrillation conversion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing (CT) is recommended after S-ICD implantation to ensure an adequate margin between the defibrillation threshold and maximum device output (80J), prior work found that adherence to this recommendation is declining.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied first-time recipients of S-ICDs (between September 28, 2012, and April 1, 2016) in the National Cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong>base Registry ICD Registry to determine predictors of use of CT, predictors of an insufficient safety margin (ISM, defined as ventricular fibrillation conversion energy >65J) during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing, and inhospital outcomes associated with use of CT. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to predict use of CT and ISM. Inverse probability weighted logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between use of CT and inhospital adverse events including death.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>CT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing was performed in 70.7% (n=5624) of 7960 patients with S-ICDs. Although deferral of CT was associated with several patient characteristics (including increased body mass index, increased body surface area, severely reduced ejection fraction, dialysis dependence, warfarin use, anemia, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), the facility effect was comparatively more important (area under the curve for patient level versus generalized linear mixed model: 0.619 versus 0.877). An ISM occurred in 6.9% (n=336) of 4864 patients without a prior ICD and was more common among white patients and those with ventricular pacing on the preimplant ECG, higher preimplant blood pressure, larger body surface area, higher body mass index, and lower ejection fraction. A risk score was able to identify patients at low (<5%), medium (5% to 10%), and high risk (>10%) for ISM. CT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing was not associated with a composite of inhospital complications including death.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Use of CT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing after S-ICD implantation was driven by facility preference to a greater extent than patient factors and was not associated with a composite of inhospital complications or death.

We evaluated those who underwent CAC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing as part of the anatomic evaluation (n=4209) and compared that with results of FT (n=4602). We stratified CAC and FT results as normal or mildly, moderately, or severely abnormal (for CAC: 0, 1–99 Agatston score [AS], 100–400 AS, and >400 AS, respectively; for FT: normal, mild=late positive treadmill, moderate=early positive treadmill or single-vessel ischemia, and severe=large ischemic region abnormality). The primary end point was all-cause death, myocardial infarction, or unstable angina hospitalization over a median follow-up of 26.1 months. Cox regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and C statistics to determine predictive and discriminatory values.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, the distribution of normal or mildly, moderately, or severely abnormal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> results was significantly different between FT and CAC (FT: normal, n=3588 [78.0%]; mild, n=432 [9.4%]; moderate, n=217 [4.7%]; severe, n=365 [7.9%]; CAC: normal, n=1457 [34.6%]; mild, n=1340 [31.8%]; moderate, n=772 [18.3%]; severe, n=640 [15.2%]; <i>P</i><0.0001).

A Population-Based Study of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Treatment in Finland 2000 to 2014

AAA prevalence and incidence of ruptures have been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed to be decreasing. The treatment of AAA has also undergone a change in recent decades with a shift toward endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). Our aim was to evaluate how these changes have affected the elective and emergency treatment of AAA and their results in Finland.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>All patients treated for AAA in Finland, a country with a population of 5.5 million, during 2000 to 2014 were searched from the registry of the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> on all patients who had died of AAA during the same time <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">period</span></strong> were obtained from Statistics Finland. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> were combined and analyzed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The annual incidence of ruptured AAA was 16.4 per 100 000 population over 50 years and decreased significantly during the study <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">period</span></strong>. Over half of the 4949 patients who had a ruptured AAA died outside the hospital. Thirty-day mortality after emergency repair was 39.4%. Intact AAA repairs numbered 4956. The absolute number of annual repairs increased during the study <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">period</span></strong>, and the use of EVAR became the dominant method of elective repair. Thirty-day mortality in elective AAA repair dropped significantly from 6.3% in 2000 to 2004 to 2.7% in 2010 to 2014 mostly because of the increased number of EVAR procedures with lower mortality. Long-term mortality in patients treated with EVAR was higher than in patients treated with open repair. Mortality after elective AAA repair was primarily attributable to cardiovascular causes, but there was a slightly higher proportion of AAA-related late deaths in patients treated with EVAR.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Ruptured AAA incidence for men >65 years has declined by nearly 30% in Finland, likely because of the decrease in AAA prevalence. The treatment results have improved as well for both elective and emergency repair. Increased use of EVAR has resulted in a decrease of mortality after elective AAA repair, but results of open repair have improved as well. However, late mortality from elective EVAR is surprisingly high in comparison with open repair, which may have been exaggerated by patient selection.</p></sec>

<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Current strategies for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk assessment among adults without known CVD are limited by suboptimal performance and a narrow focus on only atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD). We hypothesized that a strategy combining promising biomarkers across multiple different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing modalities would improve global and atherosclerotic CVD risk assessment among individuals without known CVD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We included participants from MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) (n=6621) and the Dallas Heart Study (n=2202) who were free from CVD and underwent measurement of left ventricular hypertrophy by ECG, coronary artery calcium, N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. Associations of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> results with the global composite CVD outcome (CVD death, myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary or peripheral revascularization, incident heart failure, or atrial fibrillation) and ASCVD (fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke) were assessed over >10 years of follow-up. Multivariable analyses for the primary global CVD end point adjusted for traditional risk factors plus statin use and creatinine (base model).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> result was independently associated with global composite CVD events in MESA after adjustment for the components of the base model and the other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> results (<i>P</i><0.05 for each). When the 5 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>s were added to the base model, the c-statistic improved from 0.74 to 0.79 (<i>P</i>=0.001), significant integrated discrimination improvement (0.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.06–0.08, <i>P</i><0.001) and category free net reclassification improvement (0.47; 95% CI, 0.38–0.56; <i>P</i>=0.003) were observed, and the model was well calibrated (χ<sup>2</sup>=12.2, <i>P</i>=0.20). Using a simple integer score counting the number of abnormal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>s, compared with those with a score of 0, global CVD risk was increased among participants with a score of 1 (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.4–2.6), 2 (hazard ratio, 3.2; 95% CI, 2.3–4.4), 3 (hazard ratio, 4.7; 95% CI, 3.4–6.5), and ≥4 (hazard ratio, 7.5; 95% CI, 5.2–10.6). Findings replicated in the Dallas Health Study were similar for the ASCVD outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among adults without known CVD, a novel multimodality <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing strategy using left ventricular hypertrophy by ECG, coronary artery calcium, N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein significantly improved global CVD and ASCVD risk assessment.</p></sec>

Its purpose is to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong></span></strong> outcomes of clinical safety and performance after European approval was given.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Here, we present the 30-day outcome of the SOURCE 3 Registry. All <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> are self-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed, and all participating centers have committed to support their consecutive experience with the SAPIEN 3 transcatheter heart valve, dependent on patient consent, before the start of the study. Adverse events are defined with Valve Academic Research Consortium 2 criteria and adjudicated by an independent clinical events committee.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 1950 patients from 80 centers in 10 countries were enrolled between July 2014 and October 2015. Of those, 1947 patients underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) with the SAPIEN 3 (mean age, 81.6±6.6 years; 48.1% female). Main comorbidities included coronary artery disease (51.5%), renal insufficiency (27.4%), diabetes mellitus (29.5%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (16.0%), and a mean logistic EuroSCORE of 18.3±13.2. Transfemoral access was used in 87.1% (n=1695); nontransfemoral, in 252 patients. Conscious sedation was used in 59.9% of transfemoral procedures, and in 50% of patients, TAVI was performed without aortic balloon valvuloplasty. Implantation success (1 valve in the intended location) was 98.3%. Conversion to conventional surgery (0.6%) and use of cardiopulmonary bypass (0.7%) were rare. Adverse events were low, with site-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed 30-day all-cause mortality of 2.2%, cardiovascular mortality of 1.1%, stroke of 1.4%, major vascular complications of 4.1%, life-threatening bleeding of 5%, and post-TAVI pacemaker implantation of 12%. Moderate or greater paravalvular regurgitation was observed in 3.1% of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ing patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Results from the SOURCE 3 Registry demonstrate contemporary European trends and good outcomes of TAVI in daily practice when this third-generation TAVI device is used.</p></sec>

MicroRNA-Based Therapy of GATA2-Deficient Vascular Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The transcription factor GATA2 orchestrates the expression of many endothelial-specific genes, illustrating its crucial importance for endothelial cell function. The capacity of this transcription factor in orchestrating endothelial-important microRNAs (miRNAs/miR) is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Endothelial GATA2 was functionally analyzed in human endothelial cells in vitro. Endogenous short interfering RNA–mediated knockdown and lentiviral-based overexpression were applied to decipher the capacity of GATA2 in regulating cell viability and capillary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. Next, the GATA2-dependent miR transcriptome was identified by using a profiling approach on the basis of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Transcriptional control of miR promoters was assessed via chromatin immunoprecipitation, luciferase promoter assays, and bisulfite sequencing analysis of sites in proximity. Selected miRs were modulated in combination with GATA2 to identify signaling pathways at the angiogenic cytokine level via proteome profiler and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Downstream miR targets were identified via bioin<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ic target prediction and luciferase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>er gene assays. In vitro findings were translated to a mouse model of carotid injury in an endothelial <i>GATA2</i> knockout background. Nanoparticle-mediated delivery of proangiogenic miR-126 was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ed in the reendothelialization model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>GATA2 gain- and loss-of-function experiments in human umbilical vein endothelial cells identified a key role of GATA2 as master regulator of multiple endothelial functions via miRNA-dependent mechanisms. Global miRNAnome-screening identified several GATA2-regulated miRNAs including miR-126 and miR-221. Specifically, proangiogenic miR-126 was regulated by GATA2 transcriptionally and targeted antiangiogenic SPRED1 and FOXO3a contributing to GATA2-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of normal vascular structures, whereas GATA2 deficiency led to vascular abnormalities. In contrast to GATA2 deficiency, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">supplement</span></strong>ation with miR-126 normalized vascular function and expression profiles of cytokines contributing to proangiogenic paracrine effects. GATA2 silencing resulted in endothelial DNA hypomethylation leading to induced expression of antiangiogenic miR-221 by GATA2-dependent demethylation of a putative CpG island in the miR-221 promoter. Mechanistically, a reverted GATA2 phenotype by endogenous suppression of miR-221 was mediated through direct proangiogenic miR-221 target genes ICAM1 and ETS1. In a mouse model of carotid injury, GATA2 was reduced, and systemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">supplement</span></strong>ation of miR-126–coupled nanoparticles enhanced miR-126 availability in the carotid artery and improved reendothelialization of injured carotid arteries in vivo.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>GATA2-mediated regulation of miR-126 and miR-221 has an important impact on endothelial biology. Hence, modulation of GATA2 and its targets miR-126 and miR-221 is a promising therapeutic strategy for treatment of many vascular diseases.</p></sec>

Altered DNA Methylation of Long Noncoding RNA <i>H19</i> in Calcific Aortic Valve Disease Promotes Mineralization by Silencing <i>NOTCH1</i>
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Calcific aortic valve disease is characterized by an abnormal mineralization of the aortic valve. Osteogenic activity in the aortic valve is under the control of <i>NOTCH1</i>, which regulates the expression of key pro-osteogenic genes such as <i>RUNX2</i> and <i>BMP2</i>. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) may reprogram cells by altering the gene expression pattern.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Multidimensional genomic profiling was performed in human aortic valves to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong></span></strong> the expression of lncRNAs and the DNA methylation pattern in calcific aortic valve disease.

Hypomethylation of the promoter region was observed in mineralized aortic valves and was inversely associated with <i>H19</i> expression. Knockdown and overexpression experiments showed that <i>H19</i> induces a strong osteogenic phenotype by altering the NOTCH1 pathway. Gene promoter analyses showed that <i>H19</i> silenced <i>NOTCH1</i> by preventing the recruitment of p53 to its promoter. A knockdown of <i>H19</i> in valve interstitial cells (VICs) increased the expression of <i>NOTCH1</i> and decreased the level of <i>RUNX2</i> and <i>BMP2</i>, 2 downstream targets repressed by <i>NOTCH1</i>. In rescue experiments, the transfection of a vector encoding for the active Notch intracellular domain prevented <i>H19</i>-induced mineralization of valve interstitial cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These findings indicate that a dysregulation of DNA methylation in the promoter of <i>H19</i> during calcific aortic valve disease is associated with a higher expression of this lncRNA, which promotes an osteogenic program by interfering with the expression of <i>NOTCH1.</i></p></sec>

Point-of-Care Hemostatic Testing in Cardiac Surgery
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac surgery is frequently complicated by coagulopathic bleeding that is difficult to optimally manage using standard hemostatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing. We hypothesized that point-of-care hemostatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing within the con<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">text</span></strong> of an integrated transfusion algorithm would improve the management of coagulopathy in cardiac surgery and thereby reduce blood transfusions.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a pragmatic multicenter stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial of a point-of-care–based transfusion algorithm in consecutive patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass at 12 hospitals from October 6, 2014, to May 1, 2015.

Cardiovascular Health Promotion in Children: Challenges and Opportunities for 2020 and Beyond: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association
<p>This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong></span></strong> provides a pediatric-focused companion to “Defining and Setting National Goals for Cardiovascular Health Promotion and Disease Reduction: The American Heart Association’s Strategic Impact Goal Through 2020 and Beyond,” focused on cardiovascular health promotion and disease reduction in adults and children. The principles detailed in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong></span></strong> reflect the American Heart Association’s new dynamic and proactive goal to promote cardiovascular health throughout the life course. The primary focus is on adult cardiovascular health and disease prevention, but critical to achievement of this goal is maintenance of ideal cardiovascular health from birth through childhood to young adulthood and beyond. Emphasis is placed on the fundamental principles and metrics that define cardiovascular health in children for the clinical or research setting, and a balanced and critical appraisal of the strengths and weaknesses of the cardiovascular health construct in children and adolescents is provided. Specifically, this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong></span></strong> discusses 2 important factors: the promotion of ideal cardiovascular health in all children and the improvement of cardiovascular health metric scores in children currently classified as having poor or intermediate cardiovascular health. Other topics include the current status of cardiovascular health in US children, opportunities for the refinement of health metrics, improvement of health metric scores, and possibilities for promoting ideal cardiovascular health. Importantly, concerns about the suitability of using single thresholds to identify elevated cardiovascular risk throughout the childhood years and the limits of our current knowledge are noted, and suggestions for future directions and research are provided.</p>

Regulation of Hormonal Control, Cell Reprogramming, and Patterning during De Novo Root Organogenesis
<p>Body regeneration through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of new organs is a major question in developmental biology. We investigated de novo root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion using whole leaves of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Our results show that local cytokinin biosynthesis and auxin biosynthesis in the leaf blade followed by auxin long-distance transport to the petiole leads to proliferation of J0121-marked xylem-associated tissues and others through signaling of INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID INDUCIBLE28 (IAA28), CRANE (IAA18), WOODEN LEG, and ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATORS1 (ARR1), ARR10, and ARR12. Vasculature proliferation also involves the cell cycle regulator KIP-RELATED PROTEIN2 and ABERRANT LATERAL ROOT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ION4, resulting in a mass of cells with rooting competence that resembles callus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. Endogenous callus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion precedes specification of postembryonic root founder cells, from which roots are initiated through the activity of SHORT-ROOT, PLETHORA1 (PLT1), and PLT2. Primordia initiation is blocked in <i>shr plt1 plt2</i> mutant. Stem cell regulators SCHIZORIZA, JACKDAW, BLUEJAY, and SCARECROW also participate in root initiation and are required to pattern the new organ, as mutants show disorganized and reduced number of layers and tissue initials resulting in reduced rooting. Our work provides an organ regeneration model through de novo root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion, stating key stages and the primary pathways involved.</p>

Pollen Aperture Factor INP1 Acts Late in Aperture Formation by Excluding Specific Membrane Domains from Exine Deposition
<p>Accurate placement of extracellular materials is a critical part of cellular development. To study how cells achieve this accuracy, we use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of pollen apertures as a model. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), three regions on the pollen surface lack deposition of pollen wall exine and develop into apertures. In developing pollen, Arabidopsis <i>INAPERTURATE POLLEN1</i> (INP1) protein acts as a marker for the preaperture domains, assembling there into three punctate lines. To understand the mechanism of aperture <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion, we studied the dynamics of INP1 expression and localization and its relationship with the membrane domains at which it assembles. We found that INP1 assembly occurs after meiotic cytokinesis at the interface between the plasma membrane and the overlying callose wall, and requires the normal callose wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. Sites of INP1 localization coincide with positions of protruding membrane ridges in proximity to the callose wall. Our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> suggest that INP1 is a late-acting factor involved in keeping specific membrane domains next to the callose wall to prevent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of exine at these sites.</p>

Roles of miR319 and TCP Transcription Factors in Leaf Development
<p>Sophisticated regulation of gene expression, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and their target genes, is required for leaf differentiation, growth, and senescence. The impact of miR319 and its target <i>TEOSINTE BRANCHED1</i>, <i>CYCLOIDEA</i>, and <i>PROLIFERATING CELL NUCLEAR ANTIGEN BINDING FACTOR</i> (<i>TCP</i>) genes on leaf development has been extensively investigated, but the redundancies of these gene families often interfere with the evaluation of their function and regulation in the developmental con<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">text</span></strong>. Here, we present the genetic evidence of the involvement of the <i>MIR319</i> and <i>TCP</i> gene families in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaf development. Single mutations in <i>MIR319A</i> and <i>MIR319B</i> genes moderately inhibited the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of leaf serrations, whereas double mutations increased the extent of this inhibition and resulted in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of smooth leaves. Mutations in <i>MIR319</i> and gain-of-function mutations in the <i>TCP4</i> gene conferred resistance against miR319 and impaired the cotyledon boundary and leaf serration <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. These mutations functionally associated with <i>CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON</i> genes, which regulate the cotyledon boundary and leaf serration <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. In contrast, loss-of-function mutations in miR319-targeted and nontargeted <i>TCP</i> genes cooperatively induced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of serrated leaves in addition to changes in the levels of their downstream gene transcript. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the <i>MIR319</i> and <i>TCP</i> gene families underlie robust and multilayer control of leaf development. This study also provides a framework toward future researches on redundant miRNAs and transcription factors in Arabidopsis and crop plants.</p>

Cuticle Biosynthesis in Tomato Leaves Is Developmentally Regulated by Abscisic Acid
<p>The expansion of aerial organs in plants is coupled with the synthesis and deposition of a hydrophobic cuticle, composed of cutin and waxes, which is critically important in limiting water loss. While the abiotic stress-related hormone abscisic acid (ABA) is known to up-regulate wax accumulation in response to drought, the hormonal regulation of cuticle biosynthesis during organ ontogeny is poorly understood. To address the hypothesis that ABA also mediates cuticle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion during organ development, we assessed the effect of ABA deficiency on cuticle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion in three ABA biosynthesis-impaired tomato mutants. The mutant leaf cuticles were thinner, had structural abnormalities, and had a substantial reduction in levels of cutin. ABA deficiency also consistently resulted in differences in the composition of leaf cutin and cuticular waxes. Exogenous application of ABA partially rescued these phenotypes, confirming that they were a consequence of reduced ABA levels. The ABA mutants also showed reduced expression of genes involved in cutin or wax <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. This difference was again countered by exogenous ABA, further indicating regulation of cuticle biosynthesis by ABA. The fruit cuticles were affected differently by the ABA-associated mutations, but in general were thicker. However, no structural abnormalities were observed, and the cutin and wax compositions were less affected than in leaf cuticles, suggesting that ABA action influences cuticle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion in an organ-dependent manner. These results suggest dual roles for ABA in regulating leaf cuticle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion: one that is fundamentally associated with leaf expansion, independent of abiotic stress, and another that is drought induced.</p>

Defense Responses in Aspen with Altered Pectin Methylesterase Activity Reveal the Hormonal Inducers of Tyloses
<p>Tyloses are ingrowths of parenchyma cells into the lumen of embolized xylem vessels, thereby protecting the remaining xylem from pathogens. They are found in heartwood, sapwood, and in abscission zones and can be induced by various stresses, but their molecular triggers are unknown. Here, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong> that down-regulation of <i>PECTIN METHYLESTERASE1</i> (<i>PtxtPME1</i>) in aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>tremuloides</i>) triggers the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of tyloses and activation of oxidative stress. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ed whether any of the oxidative stress-related hormones could induce tyloses in intact plantlets grown in sterile culture. Jasmonates, including jasmonic acid (JA) and methyl jasmonate, induced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of tyloses, whereas treatments with salicylic acid (SA) and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) were ineffective. SA abolished the induction of tyloses by JA, whereas ACC was synergistic with JA. The ability of ACC to stimulate tyloses <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion when combined with JA depended on ethylene (ET) signaling, as shown by a decrease in the response in ET-insensitive plants. Measurements of internal ACC and JA concentrations in wild-type and ET-insensitive plants treated simultaneously with these two compounds indicated that ACC and JA regulate each other’s concentration in an ET-dependent manner. The findings indicate that jasmonates acting synergistically with ethylene are the key molecular triggers of tyloses.</p>

A Rice Ca<sup>2+</sup> Binding Protein Is Required for Tapetum Function and Pollen Formation
<p>In flowering plants, successful male reproduction requires the sophisticated interaction between somatic anther wall layers and reproductive cells. Timely degradation of the innermost tissue of the anther wall layer, the tapetal layer, is critical for pollen development. Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a well-known stimulus for plant development, but whether it plays a role in affecting male reproduction remains elusive. Here we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong> a role of Defective in Exine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion 1 (OsDEX1) in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), a Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding protein, in regulating rice tapetal cell degradation and pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. In <i>osdex1</i> anthers, tapetal cell degeneration is delayed and degradation of the callose wall surrounding the microspores is compromised, leading to aborted pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion and complete male sterility. <i>OsDEX1</i> is expressed in tapetal cells and microspores during early anther development. Recombinant OsDEX1 is able to bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> and regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in vitro, and <i>osdex1</i> exhibited disturbed Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in tapetal cells. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that OsDEX1 may have a conserved function in binding Ca<sup>2+</sup> in flowering plants, and genetic complementation of pollen wall defects of an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>dex1</i> mutant confirmed its evolutionary conservation in pollen development. Collectively, these findings suggest that OsDEX1 plays a fundamental role in the development of tapetal cells and pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion, possibly via modulating the Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis during pollen development.</p>

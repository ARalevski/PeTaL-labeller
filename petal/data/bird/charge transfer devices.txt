Lunate morphology as a risk factor of idiopathic ulnar impaction syndrome
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Positive ulnar variance is an established risk factor for idiopathic   ulnar impaction syndrome (UIS). However, not all patients with positive   ulnar variance develop symptomatic UIS and other factors, including   the morphology of the lunate, may be involved. The aim of this study   was to clarify the relationship between lunate morphology and idiopathic   UIS.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A cohort of 95 patients with idiopathic UIS (UIS group) was compared   with 95 asymptomatic controls with positive ulnar variance. The   shape of the lunate was measured using the capitate-triquetrum distance   (CTD), ulnar coverage ratio (UCR), radiolunate distance and radiolunate   angle. The association of radiographic parameters and lunate types   with the development of UIS was investigated in univariable and   multivariable analyses. Receiver operating characteristic curves   were used to estimate a cutoff for any statistically significant   variables.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The proportion of type II lunates, which have a medial hamate   facet, were significantly higher in the UIS group than in the control   group in the univariable analysis (p = 0.001). CTD (odds ratio (OR)   1.52; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.11 to 2.06; p = 0.008) and   UCR (OR 44.78; 95% CI 5.35 to 374.90; p = 0.002) showed a positive   association with UIS in the multivariable analysis. Estimated cutoff   values were 2.5 mm for the CTD (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.65) and   0.4 for the UCR (AUC = 0.64).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The proportion of type II lunates was greater in the UIS group   than in the control group. A large UCR, which represents the broad   base of the lunate, was positively associated with the development   of idiopathic UIS.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1508–14.</p></sec>

A long-term follow-up study of the clinical and radiographic outcome of distal trochanteric transfer in Legg-Calvé-Perthes’ disease following varus derotational osteotomy
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To assess the long-term effect of distal trochanteric transfer   (DTT) on the clinical and radiographic outcomes of patients with   Legg-Calvé-Perthes’ disease (LCPD) following a varus derotational   osteotomy (VDRO).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>For this single centre cross-sectional retrospective study we   analysed the data of 22 patients (24 hips) with LCPD who had greater   trochanteric overgrowth (GTO), following a VDRO performed in our   institution between 1959 and 1983. GTO was defined as an articular   trochanteric distance (ATD) of < 5 mm. We compared the radiographic   and clinical outcomes of patients who underwent DTT for GTO (ten   patients, ten hips) with those who did not (12 patients, 14 hips).   Age at presentation was 6.9 years (4 to 10) and 8.0 years (3.2 to   12) respectively. Symptoms associated with the hip and general quality   of life were assessed using the Harris hip score (HHS) and the Short Form   (SF)-36 questionnaires.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At long-term follow-up of the DTT group, the ATD was 21.7 mm   (standard deviation (<sc>sd</sc>) 9.8) and the centro-trochanteric   distance (CTD) was 13.8 mm (<sc>sd</sc> 8.3). In the control group   the ATD was -0.6 mm (<sc>sd</sc> 7.8) and the CTD was 32.5 mm (<sc>sd</sc> 10.2).   These differences were statistically significant (p < 0.001).   The mean HHS and SF-36 scores were 68.4 (<sc>sd</sc> 25.0) and 62.0   (<sc>sd</sc> 27.7) for the DTT group and 73.2 (<sc>sd</sc> 24.2)   and 73.3 (<sc>sd</sc> 21.5) for the control group, respectively.   There was no statistically significant difference in the HHS (p   = 0.63) or SF-36 score (p = 0.25). There were four patients who   had undergone hip arthroplasty in the DTT group (40%) and one patient   (7.1%) in the control group (p = 0.07). The mean age at the time   of arthroplasty was 45.3 years (42.1 to 56.5) and 43.6 years respectively. Six   patients in the DTT group suffered from moderate to severe osteoarthritis   (Tönnis grade 2 or 3) compared with eight patients in the control   group (60% <i>versus</i> 57.1%, p = 0.61).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Although DTT improved the radiographic results in the long-term   follow-up of patients with GTO following VDRO, there was no clinical   benefit seen in the HHS, SF-36 or incidence of osteoarthritis compared   with patients who had not undergone DTT.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:987–92.</p></sec>

Paralogs of the C-Terminal Domain of the Cyanobacterial Orange Carotenoid Protein Are Carotenoid Donors to Helical Carotenoid Proteins
<p>The photoactive Orange Carotenoid Protein (OCP) photoprotects cyanobacteria cells by quenching singlet oxygen and excess excitation energy. Its N-terminal domain is the active part of the protein, and the C-terminal domain regulates the activity. Recently, the characteristics of a family of soluble carotenoid-binding proteins (Helical Carotenoid Proteins [HCPs]), paralogs of the N-terminal domain of OCP, were described. Bioinformatics studies also revealed the existence of genes coding for homologs of CTD. Here, we show that the latter genes encode carotenoid proteins (CTDHs). This family of proteins contains two subgroups with distinct characteristics. One CTDH of each clade was further characterized, and they proved to be very good singlet oxygen quenchers. When synthesized in <i>Escherichia coli</i> or <i>Synechocystis</i> PCC 6803, CTDHs formed dimers that share a carotenoid molecule and are able to transfer their carotenoid to apo-HCPs and apo-OCP. The CTDHs from clade 2 have a cysteine in position 103. A disulfide bond is easily formed between the monomers of the dimer preventing carotenoid transfer. This suggests that the transfer of the carotenoid could be redox regulated in clade 2 CTDH. We also demonstrate here that apo-OCPs and apo-CTDHs are able to take the carotenoid directly from membranes, while HCPs are unable to do so. HCPs need the presence of CTDH to become holo-proteins. We propose that, in cyanobacteria, the CTDHs are carotenoid donors to HCPs.</p>

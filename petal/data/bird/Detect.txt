The role of the olfactory recess in olfactory airflow
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">olfactory</span></strong> recess – a blind pocket at the back of the nasal airway – is thought to play an important role in mammalian olfaction by sequestering air outside of the main airstream, thus giving odorants time to re-circulate. Several studies have shown that species with large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">olfactory</span></strong> recesses tend to have a well-developed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sense</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">smell</span></strong>. However, no study has investigated how the size of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">olfactory</span></strong> recess relates to air circulation near the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">olfactory</span></strong> epithelium. Here we used a computer model of the nasal cavity from a bat (<i>Carollia perspicillata</i>) to test the hypothesis that a larger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">olfactory</span></strong> recess improves <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">olfactory</span></strong> airflow. We predicted that during inhalation, models with an enlarged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">olfactory</span></strong> recess would have slower rates of flow through the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">olfactory</span></strong> region (i.e. the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">olfactory</span></strong> recess plus airspace around the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">olfactory</span></strong> epithelium), while during exhalation these models would have little to no flow through the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">olfactory</span></strong> recess. To test these predictions, we experimentally modified the size of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">olfactory</span></strong> recess while holding the rest of the morphology constant. During inhalation, we found that an enlarged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">olfactory</span></strong> recess resulted in lower rates of flow in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">olfactory</span></strong> region. Upon exhalation, air flowed through the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">olfactory</span></strong> recess at a lower rate in the model with an enlarged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">olfactory</span></strong> recess. Taken together, these results indicate that an enlarged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">olfactory</span></strong> recess improves <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">olfactory</span></strong> airflow during both inhalation and exhalation. These findings add to our growing understanding of how the morphology of the nasal cavity may relate to function in this understudied region of the skull.</p>

Dynamic use of optic flow during pheromone tracking by the male silkmoth, <i>Bombyx mori</i>
<p>Several insects require both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">olfactory</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visual</span></strong> cues during odour-source localisation to successfully <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">locate</span></strong> an odour source. In the male silkmoth, <i>Bombyx mori</i>, detection of the female sex pheromone triggers a programmed walking pattern, starting from a surge (straight-line walking) followed by zigzag walking. Although pheromone-triggered behaviour in silkmoths is well understood, the role of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visual</span></strong> cues remains obscure. To address this question, we performed behavioural experiments on tethered-walking moths by recording their locomotion during stimulation with a pheromone and a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visual</span></strong> motion pattern (optic flow). The experiments were conducted under open- and closed-loop <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visual</span></strong> stimuli. We found that the use of optic flow input was determined by the behavioural state of surge and zigzagging. Silkmoths exhibited an optomotor response, which is a behavioural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visual</span></strong> response, by turning towards the same direction as optic flow stimuli only during surge, but not during zigzagging. In addition, modulation of the zigzag walking pattern was observed when the moths were presented with biased closed-loop <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visual</span></strong> stimuli (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visual</span></strong> feedback with biased constant optic flow); however, the directional preference mechanism was different from that of the optomotor response. Based on these findings, we suggest that the optomotor response is utilised for course control during straight-line walking, whereas the absence of optomotor response during zigzagging is used to effectively perform the programmed walking pattern. Considering the neural basis of programmed behaviour, we speculate that at least two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visual</span></strong> pathways are involved in the state-dependent use of optic flow during odour tracking behaviour in silkmoths.</p>

A collicular visual cortex: Neocortical space for an ancient midbrain visual structure
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visual</span></strong> responses in the cerebral cortex are believed to rely on the geniculate input to the primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visual</span></strong> cortex (V1). Indeed, V1 lesions substantially reduce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visual</span></strong> responses throughout the cortex. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visual</span></strong> information enters the cortex also through the superior colliculus (SC), but the function of this input on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visual</span></strong> responses in the cortex is less clear. SC lesions affect cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visual</span></strong> responses less than V1 lesions, and no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visual</span></strong> cortical area appears to entirely rely on SC inputs. We show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visual</span></strong> responses in a mouse lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visual</span></strong> cortical area called the postrhinal cortex are independent of V1 and are abolished upon silencing of the SC. This area outperforms V1 in discriminating moving objects. We thus identify a collicular primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visual</span></strong> cortex that is independent of the geniculo-cortical pathway and is capable of motion discrimination.</p>

WT1 regulates the development of the posterior taste field
<p>Despite the importance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">taste</span></strong> in determining nutrient intake, our understanding of the processes that control the development of the peripheral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">taste</span></strong> system is lacking. Several early regulators of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">taste</span></strong> development have been identified, including sonic hedgehog, bone morphogenetic protein 4 and multiple members of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. However, the regulation of these factors, including their induction, remains poorly understood. Here, we identify a crucial role for the Wilms' tumor 1 protein (WT1) in circumvallate (CV) papillae development. WT1 is a transcription factor that is important in the normal development of multiple tissues, including both the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">olfactory</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visual</span></strong> systems. In mice, WT1 expression is detectable by E12.5, when the CV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">taste</span></strong> placode begins to form. In mice lacking WT1, the CV fails to develop normally and markers of early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">taste</span></strong> development are dysregulated compared with wild type. We demonstrate that expression of the WT1 target genes <i>Lef1</i>, <i>Ptch1</i> and <i>Bmp4</i> is significantly reduced in developing tongue tissue derived from <i>Wt1</i> knockout mice and that, in normal tongue, WT1 is bound to the promoter regions of these genes. Moreover, siRNA knockdown of WT1 in cultured <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">taste</span></strong> cells leads to a reduction in the expression of <i>Lef1</i> and <i>Ptch1</i>. Our data identify WT1 as a crucial transcription factor in the development of the CV through the regulation of multiple signaling pathways that have established roles in the formation and patterning of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">taste</span></strong> placodes.</p>

Ranking Businesses and Municipal Locations by Spatiotemporal Cardiac Arrest Risk to Guide Public Defibrillator Placement
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Efforts to guide automated external defibrillator placement for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) treatment have focused on identifying broadly defined location categories without considering hours of operation. Broad location categories may be composed of many businesses with varying accessibility. Identifying specific locations for automated external defibrillator deployment incorporating operating hours and time of OHCA occurrence may improve automated external defibrillator accessibility. We aim to identify specific businesses and municipal locations that maximize OHCA coverage on the basis of spatiotemporal assessment of OHCA risk in the immediate vicinity of franchise locations.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This study was a retrospective population-based cohort study using data from the Toronto Regional RescuNET Epistry cardiac arrest database. We identified all nontraumatic public OHCAs occurring in Toronto, ON, Canada, from January 2007 through December 2015. We identified 41 unique businesses and municipal location types with ≥20 locations in Toronto from the YellowPages, Canadian Franchise Association, and the City of Toronto Open Data Portal. We obtained their geographic coordinates and hours of operation from Web sites, by phone, or in person. We determined the number of OHCAs that occurred within 100 m of each location when it was open (spatiotemporal coverage) for Toronto overall and downtown. The businesses and municipal locations were then ranked by spatiotemporal OHCA coverage. To evaluate temporal stability of the rankings, we calculated intraclass correlation of the annual coverage values.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>There were 2654 nontraumatic public OHCAs. Tim Hortons ranked first in Toronto, covering 286 OHCAs. Starbucks ranked first in downtown, covering 110 OHCAs. Coffee shops and bank machines from the 5 largest Canadian banks occupied 8 of the top 10 spots in both Toronto and downtown. The rankings exhibited high temporal stability with intraclass correlation values of 0.88 (95% confidence interval, 0.83–0.93) in Toronto and 0.79 (95% confidence interval, 0.71–0.86) in downtown.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We identified and ranked businesses and municipal locations by spatiotemporal OHCA risk in their immediate vicinity. This approach may help policy makers and funders to identify and prioritize potential partnerships for automated external defibrillator deployment in public-access defibrillator programs.</p></sec>

Neuropathic pain promotes adaptive changes in gene expression in brain networks involved in stress and depression
<p>Neuropathic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> is a complex chronic condition characterized by various sensory, cognitive, and affective symptoms. A large percentage of patients with neuropathic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> are also afflicted with depression and anxiety disorders, a pattern that is also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">see</span></strong>n in animal models. Furthermore, clinical and preclinical studies indicate that chronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> corresponds with adaptations in several brain networks involved in mood, motivation, and reward. Chronic stress is also a major risk factor for depression. We investigated whether chronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> and stress affect similar molecular mechanisms and whether chronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> can affect gene expression patterns that are involved in depression. Using two mouse models of neuropathic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> and depression [spared nerve injury (SNI) and chronic unpredictable stress (CUS)], we performed next-generation RNA sequencing and pathway analysis to monitor changes in gene expression in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and the periaqueductal gray (PAG). In addition to finding unique transcriptome profiles across these regions, we identified a substantial number of signaling pathway–associated genes with similar changes in expression in both SNI and CUS mice. Many of these genes have been implicated in depression, anxiety, and chronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> in patients. Our study provides a resource of the changes in gene expression induced by long-term neuropathic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> in three distinct brain regions and reveals molecular connections between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> and chronic stress.</p>

Scaling pain threshold with microRNAs
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> is not something universally enjoyed, especially chronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> involving nerve damage, referred to as neuropathic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> (<i>1</i>). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> perception can be modulated in a variety of ways—for example, by focusing attention on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong>ful stimulus. On page 1168 of this issue, Peng <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) report that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> threshold in dorsal root ganglion neurons (DRG), which relay peripheral sensory information to the central nervous system, can be modulated by mechanisms involving a specific cluster of microRNAs (miRNAs). Remarkably, the same cluster also regulates the threshold of neuropathic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> in DRG neurons that would not be involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> under normal conditions. The study provides important new insights into molecular mechanisms that control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> threshold, both in normal and pathological conditions.</p>

Baseline hearing abilities and variability in wild beluga whales (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>)
<p>While <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hear</span></strong>ing is the primary sensory modality for odontocetes, there are few data addressing variation within a natural population. This work describes the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hear</span></strong>ing ranges (4–150 kHz) and sensitivities of seven apparently healthy, wild beluga whales (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>) during a population health assessment project that captured and released belugas in Bristol Bay, Alaska. The baseline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hear</span></strong>ing abilities and subsequent variations were addressed. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hear</span></strong>ing was measured using auditory evoked potentials (AEPs). All audiograms showed a typical cetacean U-shape; substantial variation (>30 dB) was found between most and least sensitive thresholds. All animals <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hear</span></strong>d well, up to at least 128 kHz. Two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hear</span></strong>d up to 150 kHz. Lowest auditory thresholds (35–45 dB) were identified in the range 45–80 kHz. Greatest differences in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hear</span></strong>ing abilities occurred at both the high end of the auditory range and at frequencies of maximum sensitivity. In general, wild beluga <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hear</span></strong>ing was quite sensitive. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hear</span></strong>ing abilities were similar to those of belugas measured in zoological settings, reinforcing the comparative importance of both settings. The relative degree of variability across the wild belugas suggests that audiograms from multiple individuals are needed to properly describe the maximum sensitivity and population variance for odontocetes. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hear</span></strong>ing measures were easily incorporated into field-based settings. This detailed examination of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hear</span></strong>ing abilities in wild Bristol Bay belugas provides a basis for a better understanding of the potential impact of anthropogenic noise on a noise-sensitive species. Such information may help design noise-limiting mitigation measures that could be applied to areas heavily influenced and inhabited by endangered belugas.</p>

Decreased abundance of TRESK two-pore domain potassium channels in sensory neurons underlies the pain associated with bone metastasis
<p>Cancer-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> is debilitating. Understanding the mechanisms that cause it can inform drug development that may improve quality of life in patients. Here, we found that the reduced abundance of potassium channels called TRESK in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons sensitized nociceptive sensory neurons and cancer-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong>. Overexpressing TRESK in DRG neurons suppressed tumor-induced neuronal hyperexcitability and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> hypersensitivity in bone metastasis model rats, whereas knocking down TRESK increased neuronal hyperexcitability and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> hypersensitivity in normal rats. Mechanistically, tumor-associated production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) activated the receptor VEGFR2 on DRGs, which increased the abundance of the calcineurin inhibitor DSCR1, which, in turn, decreased calcineurin-mediated activation of the transcription factor NFAT, thereby reducing the transcription of the gene encoding TRESK. Intrathecal application of exogenous calcineurin to tumor-bearing rats rescued TRESK abundance and abrogated both DRG hyperexcitability and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> hypersensitivity, whereas either inhibition or knockdown of calcineurin in normal rats reduced TRESK abundance and increased DRG excitability and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> sensitivity. These findings identify a potentially targetable mechanism that may cause bone metastasis–associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> in cancer patients.</p>

Bacterial <sc>d</sc>-amino acids suppress sinonasal innate immunity through sweet taste receptors in solitary chemosensory cells
<p>In the upper respiratory epithelium, bitter and sweet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">taste</span></strong> receptors present in solitary chemosensory cells influence antimicrobial innate immune defense responses. Whereas activation of bitter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">taste</span></strong> receptors (T2Rs) stimulates surrounding epithelial cells to release antimicrobial peptides, activation of the sweet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">taste</span></strong> receptor (T1R) in the same cells inhibits this response. This mechanism is thought to control the magnitude of antimicrobial peptide release based on the sugar content of airway surface liquid. We hypothesized that <sc>d</sc>-amino acids, which are produced by various bacteria and activate T1R in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">taste</span></strong> receptor cells in the mouth, may also activate T1R in the airway. We showed that both the T1R2 and T1R3 subunits of the sweet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">taste</span></strong> receptor (T1R2/3) were present in the same chemosensory cells of primary human sinonasal epithelial cultures. Respiratory isolates of <i>Staphylococcus</i> species, but not <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, produced at least two <sc>d</sc>-amino acids that activate the sweet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">taste</span></strong> receptor. In addition to inhibiting <i>P. aeruginosa</i> biofilm formation, <sc>d</sc>-amino acids derived from <i>Staphylococcus</i> inhibited T2R-mediated signaling and defensin secretion in sinonasal cells by activating T1R2/3. <sc>d</sc>-Amino acid–mediated activation of T1R2/3 also enhanced epithelial cell death during challenge with <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> in the presence of the bitter receptor–activating compound denatonium benzoate. These data establish a potential mechanism for interkingdom signaling in the airway mediated by bacterial <sc>d</sc>-amino acids and the mammalian sweet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">taste</span></strong> receptor in airway chemosensory cells.</p>

An amygdalar neural ensemble that encodes the unpleasantness of pain
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> is an unpleasant experience. How the brain’s affective neural circuits attribute this aversive quality to nociceptive information remains unknown. By means of time-lapse in vivo calcium imaging and neural activity manipulation in freely behaving mice encountering noxious stimuli, we identified a distinct neural ensemble in the basolateral amygdala that encodes the negative affective valence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong>. Silencing this nociceptive ensemble alleviated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> affective-motivational behaviors without altering the detection of noxious stimuli, withdrawal reflexes, anxiety, or reward. Following peripheral nerve injury, innocuous stimuli activated this nociceptive ensemble to drive dysfunctional perceptual changes associated with neuropathic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong>, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> aversion to light touch (allodynia). These results identify the amygdalar representations of noxious stimuli that are functionally required for the negative affective qualities of acute and chronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> perception.</p>

miR-183 cluster scales mechanical pain sensitivity by regulating basal and neuropathic pain genes
<p>Nociception is protective and prevents tissue damage but can also facilitate chronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong>. Whether a general principle governs these two types of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> is unknown. Here, we show that both basal mechanical and neuropathic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> are controlled by the microRNA-183 (miR-183) cluster in mice. This single cluster controls more than 80% of neuropathic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong>–regulated genes and scales basal mechanical sensitivity and mechanical allodynia by regulating auxiliary voltage-gated calcium channel subunits α2δ-1 and α2δ-2. Basal sensitivity is controlled in nociceptors, and allodynia involves TrkB<sup>+</sup> light-touch mechanoreceptors. These light-touch–sensitive neurons, which normally do not elicit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong>, produce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> during neuropathy that is reversed by gabapentin. Thus, a single microRNA cluster continuously scales acute noxious mechanical sensitivity in nociceptive neurons and suppresses neuropathic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> transduction in a specific, light-touch–sensitive neuronal type recruited during mechanical allodynia.</p>

Mexican blind cavefish use mouth suction to detect obstacles
<p>Fish commonly use their lateral line system to detect moving bodies such as prey and predators. A remarkable case is the Mexican blind cavefish <i>Astyanax fasciatus</i>, which evolved the ability to detect non-moving obstacles. The swimming body of <i>A. fasciatus</i> generates fluid disturbances, the alteration of which by an obstacle can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sense</span></strong>d by the fish's lateral line system. It is generally accepted that these alterations can provide information on the distance to the obstacle. We observed that <i>A. fasciatus</i> swimming in an unfamiliar environment open and close their mouths at high frequency (0.7–4.5 Hz) in order to generate suction flows. We hypothesized that repeated mouth suction generates a hydrodynamic velocity field, which is altered by an obstacle, inducing pressure gradients in the neuromasts of the lateral line and corresponding strong lateral line stimuli. We observed that the frequency and rate of mouth-opening events varied with the fish's distance to obstacles, a hallmark of pulse-based navigation mechanisms such as echolocation. We formulated a mathematical model of this hitherto unrecognized mechanism of obstacle detection and parameterized it experimentally. This model suggests that suction flows induce lateral line stimuli that are weakly dependent on the fish's speed, and may be an order of magnitude stronger than the correspondent stimuli induced by the fish's gliding body. We illustrate that <i>A. fasciatus</i> can navigate non-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visual</span></strong>ly using a combination of two deeply ancestral and highly conserved mechanisms of ray-finned fishes: the mechanism of sensing water motion by the lateral line system and the mechanism of generating water motion by mouth suction.</p>

Proximal femoral resection without post-operative traction for the painful dislocated hip in young patients with cerebral palsy

Sex Differences in the Presentation and Perception of Symptoms Among Young Patients With Myocardial Infarction

Structured patient interviews during the index AMI hospitalization were used to collect information on symptom presentation, perception of symptoms, and care-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">see</span></strong>king behaviors. We compared patient characteristics and presentation information by sex. Multivariable hierarchical logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between sex and symptom presentation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The majority of women (87.0%) and men (89.5%) presented with chest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> (defined as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong>, pressure, tightness, or discomfort).

A systems approach for discovering linoleic acid derivatives that potentially mediate pain and itch
<p>Chronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> and itch are common hypersensitivity syndromes that are affected by endogenous mediators. We applied a systems-based, translational approach to predict, discover, and characterize mediators of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> and itch that are regulated by diet and inflammation. Profiling of tissue-specific precursor abundance and biosynthetic gene expression predicted that inflamed skin would be abundant in four previously unknown 11-hydroxy-epoxy- or 11-keto-epoxy-octadecenoate linoleic acid derivatives and four previously identified 9- or 13-hydroxy-epoxy- or 9- or 13-keto-epoxy-octadecenoate linoleic acid derivatives. All of these mediators were confirmed to be abundant in rat and human skin by mass spectrometry. However, only the two 11-hydroxy-epoxy-octadecenoates sensitized rat dorsal root ganglion neurons to release more calcitonin gene–related peptide (CGRP), which is involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> transmission, in response to low pH (which mimics an inflammatory state) or capsaicin (which activates ion channels involved in nociception). The two 11-hydroxy-epoxy-octadecenoates share a 3-hydroxy-<i>Z</i>-pentenyl-<i>E</i>-epoxide moiety, thus suggesting that this substructure could mediate nociceptor sensitization. In rats, intradermal hind paw injection of 11-hydroxy-12,13-<i>trans</i>-epoxy-(9<i>Z</i>)-octadecenoate elicited C-fiber–mediated sensitivity to thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong>. In a randomized trial testing adjunctive strategies to manage refractory chronic headaches, reducing the dietary intake of linoleic acid was associated with decreases in plasma 11-hydroxy-12,13-<i>trans</i>-epoxy-(9<i>Z</i>)-octadecenoate, which correlated with clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> reduction. Human psoriatic skin had 30-fold higher 9-keto-12,13-<i>trans</i>-epoxy-(10<i>E</i>)-octadecenoate compared to control skin, and intradermal injection of this compound induced itch-related scratching behavior in mice. Collectively, these findings define a family of endogenous mediators with potential roles in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> and itch.</p>

A Mobile Auxin Signal Connects Temperature Sensing in Cotyledons with Growth Responses in Hypocotyls
<p>Plants have a remarkable capacity to adjust their growth and development to elevated ambient temperatures. Increased elongation growth of roots, hypocotyls, and petioles in warm temperatures are hallmarks of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">see</span></strong>dling thermomorphogenesis. In the last decade, significant progress has been made to identify the molecular signaling components regulating these growth responses. Increased ambient temperature utilizes diverse components of the light sensing and signal transduction network to trigger growth adjustments. However, it remains unknown whether temperature sensing and responses are universal processes that occur uniformly in all plant organs. Alternatively, temperature sensing may be confined to specific tissues or organs, which would require a systemic signal that mediates responses in distal parts of the plant. Here, we show that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">see</span></strong>dlings show organ-specific transcriptome responses to elevated temperatures and that thermomorphogenesis involves both autonomous and organ-interdependent temperature sensing and signaling. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">see</span></strong>dling roots can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sense</span></strong> and respond to temperature in a shoot-independent manner, whereas shoot temperature responses require both local and systemic processes. The induction of cell elongation in hypocotyls requires temperature sensing in cotyledons, followed by the generation of a mobile auxin signal. Subsequently, auxin travels to the hypocotyl, where it triggers local brassinosteroid-induced cell elongation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">see</span></strong>dling stems, which depends upon a distinct, permissive temperature sensor in the hypocotyl.</p>

Control of Cognate Sense mRNA Translation by cis-Natural Antisense RNAs
<p>Cis-Natural Anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sense</span></strong> Transcripts (cis-NATs), which overlap protein coding genes and are transcribed from the opposite DNA strand, constitute an important group of noncoding RNAs. Whereas several examples of cis-NATs regulating the expression of their cognate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sense</span></strong> gene are known, most cis-NATs function by altering the steady-state level or structure of mRNA via changes in transcription, mRNA stability, or splicing, and very few cases involve the regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sense</span></strong> mRNA translation. This study was designed to systematically search for cis-NATs influencing cognate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sense</span></strong> mRNA translation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Establishment of a pipeline relying on sequencing of total polyA<sup>+</sup> and polysomal RNA from Arabidopsis grown under various conditions (i.e. nutrient deprivation and phytohormone treatments) allowed the identification of 14 cis-NATs whose expression correlated either positively or negatively with cognate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sense</span></strong> mRNA translation. With use of a combination of cis-NAT stable over-expression in transgenic plants and transient expression in protoplasts, the impact of cis-NAT expression on mRNA translation was confirmed for 4 out of 5 tested cis-NAT:<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sense</span></strong> mRNA pairs. These results expand the number of cis-NATs known to regulate cognate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sense</span></strong> mRNA translation and provide a foundation for future studies of their mode of action. Moreover, this study highlights the role of this class of noncoding RNAs in translation regulation.</p>

Can bees see at a glance?
<p>Primates can analyse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visual</span></strong> scenes extremely rapidly, making accurate decisions for presentation times of only 20 ms. We asked whether bumblebees, despite having potentially more limited processing power, could similarly detect and discriminate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visual</span></strong> patterns presented for durations of 100 ms or less. Bumblebees detected stimuli and discriminated between differently oriented and coloured stimuli when presented as briefly as 25 ms but failed to identify ecologically relevant shapes (predatory spiders on flowers) even when presented for 100 ms. This suggests an important difference between primate and insect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visual</span></strong> processing, so that while primates can capture entire <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visual</span></strong> scenes ‘at a glance’, insects might have to rely on continuous online sampling of the world around them, using a process of active vision, which requires longer integration times.</p>

Pheromones exert top-down effects on visual recognition in the jumping spider <i>Lyssomanes viridis</i>
<p>In diverse and productive habitats, predaceous arthropods are expected to frequently encounter dangerous conspecifics and heterospecifics. This should make quick and accurate discriminations between species and sexes adaptive. By simultaneously sampling both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visual</span></strong> cues and pheromones, and by utilizing stringent species- and sex-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visual</span></strong> recognition templates, an individual should be able to increase both its speed and accuracy in making such discriminations. We tested for the use and stringency of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visual</span></strong> recognition templates in the jumping spider <i>Lyssomanes viridis</i> by presenting males with animated images of conspecifics, heterospecifics and composite images that combined the facial coloration and morphology of one sex or species with the leg coloration of another. Males' courtship <i>versus</i> threat displays indicated whether a stimulus was perceived as a potential mate or a threat. By comparing males' <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visual</span></strong> inspection times of, and display types towards, the various images in the presence <i>versus</i> absence of female pheromones, we were able to deduce whether males tend to inspect a subset of the color pattern and morphological features that make up their conspecific recognition templates (i.e. those on just the face or just the legs), or all features, and whether this changes in the presence of pheromones. We found that the male recognition template for conspecific female was surprisingly coarse, whereas the recognition template for conspecific male, and especially the male face, was more specific. Pheromones hastened the recognition of images with coloration and morphology closely matching those of conspecifics, presumably by activating conspecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visual</span></strong> recognition templates. When males were presented with an image that was, overall, a poor match to a conspecific female, but that contained a subset of female or female-like features, female pheromones usually did not hasten recognition, but did increase the likelihood that the image would be identified as a female. Taken together, our data suggest that males examined features on both the face and the legs in both the presence and absence of pheromones, and that female pheromones tipped the balance in favor of a female identification when a male was unsure how to categorize an incongruous set of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visual</span></strong> features.</p>

TRPV1 promotes opioid analgesia during inflammation
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> and inflammation are inherently linked responses to injury, infection, or chronic diseases. Given that acute inflammation in humans or mice enhances the analgesic properties of opioids, there is much interest in determining the inflammatory transducers that prime opioid receptor signaling in primary afferent nociceptors. Here, we found that activation of the transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) channel stimulated a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway that was accompanied by the shuttling of the scaffold protein β-arrestin2 to the nucleus. The nuclear translocation of β-arrestin2 in turn prevented its recruitment to the μ-opioid receptor (MOR), the subsequent internalization of agonist-bound MOR, and the suppression of MOR activity that occurs upon receptor desensitization. Using the complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) inflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> model to examine the role of TRPV1 in regulating endogenous opioid analgesia in mice, we found that naloxone methiodide (Nal-M), a peripherally restricted, nonselective, and competitive opioid receptor antagonist, slowed the recovery from CFA-induced hypersensitivity in wild-type, but not TRPV1-deficient, mice. Furthermore, we showed that inflammation prolonged morphine-induced antinociception in a mouse model of opioid receptor desensitization, a process that depended on TRPV1. Together, our data reveal a TRPV1-mediated signaling pathway that serves as an endogenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong>-resolution mechanism by promoting the nuclear translocation of β-arrestin2 to minimize MOR desensitization. This previously uncharacterized mechanism may underlie the peripheral opioid control of inflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong>. Dysregulation of the TRPV1–β-arrestin2 axis may thus contribute to the transition from acute to chronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong>.</p>

The transcription factor C/EBPβ in the dorsal root ganglion contributes to peripheral nerve trauma–induced nociceptive hypersensitivity
<p>Changes in gene transcription in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) after nerve trauma contribute to the genesis of neuropathic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong>. We report that peripheral nerve trauma caused by chronic constriction injury (CCI) increased the abundance of the transcription factor C/EBPβ (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β) in the DRG. Blocking this increase mitigated the development and maintenance of CCI-induced mechanical, thermal, and cold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> hypersensitivities without affecting basal responses to acute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> and locomotor activity. Conversely, mimicking this increase produced hypersensitivity to mechanical, thermal, or cold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong>. In the ipsilateral DRG, C/EBPβ promoted a decrease in the abundance of the voltage-gated potassium channel subunit Kv1.2 and μ opioid receptor (MOR) at the mRNA and protein levels, which would be predicted to increase excitability in the ipsilateral DRG neurons and reduce the efficacy of morphine analgesia. These effects required C/EPBβ-mediated transcriptional activation of <i>Ehmt2</i> (euchromatic histone-lysine <i>N</i>-methyltransferase 2), which encodes G9a, an epigenetic silencer of the genes encoding Kv1.2 and MOR. Blocking the increase in C/EBPβ in the DRG improved morphine analgesia after CCI. These results suggest that C/EBPβ is an endogenous initiator of neuropathic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> and could be a potential target for the prevention and treatment of this disorder.</p>

The threshold for conscious report: Signal loss and response bias in visual and frontal cortex

We investigated the fate of weak <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visual</span></strong> stimuli in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visual</span></strong> and frontal cortex of awake monkeys trained to report stimulus presence. Reported stimuli were associated with strong sustained activity in the frontal cortex, and frontal activity was weaker and quickly decayed for unreported stimuli. Information about weak stimuli could be lost at successive stages en route from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visual</span></strong> to the frontal cortex, and these propagation failures were confirmed through microstimulation of area V1. Fluctuations in response bias and sensitivity during perception of identical stimuli were traced back to prestimulus brain-state markers. A model in which stimuli become consciously reportable when they elicit a nonlinear ignition process in higher cortical areas explained our results.</p>

Quantum sensing with arbitrary frequency resolution
<p>Quantum sensing takes advantage of well-controlled quantum systems for performing measurements with high sensitivity and precision. We have implemented a concept for quantum sensing with arbitrary frequency resolution, independent of the qubit probe and limited only by the stability of an external synchronization clock. Our concept makes use of quantum lock-in detection to continuously probe a signal of interest. Using the electronic spin of a single nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond, we demonstrate detection of oscillating magnetic fields with a frequency resolution of 70 microhertz over a megahertz bandwidth. The continuous sampling further guarantees an enhanced sensitivity, reaching a signal-to-noise ratio in excess of 10<sup>4</sup> for a 170-nanotesla test signal measured during a 1-hour interval. Our technique has applications in magnetic resonance spectroscopy, quantum simulation, and sensitive signal detection.</p>

Nucleic acid detection with CRISPR-Cas13a/C2c2
<p>Rapid, inexpensive, and sensitive nucleic acid detection may aid point-of-care pathogen detection, genotyping, and disease monitoring. The RNA-guided, RNA-targeting clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) effector Cas13a (previously known as C2c2) exhibits a “collateral effect” of promiscuous ribonuclease activity upon target recognition. We combine the collateral effect of Cas13a with isothermal amplification to establish a CRISPR-based diagnostic (CRISPR-Dx), providing rapid DNA or RNA detection with attomolar sensitivity and single-base mismatch specificity. We use this Cas13a-based molecular detection platform, termed Specific High-Sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter UnLOCKing (SHERLOCK), to detect specific strains of Zika and Dengue virus, distinguish pathogenic bacteria, genotype human DNA, and identify mutations in cell-free tumor DNA. Furthermore, SHERLOCK reaction reagents can be lyophilized for cold-chain independence and long-term storage and be readily reconstituted on paper for field applications.</p>

Arthroscopic decompression not recommended in the treatment of rotator cuff tendinopathy
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Rotator cuff tendinopathy has a multifactorial origin.

The cecal ligation puncture technique was used to induce sepsis in 18 mice. Results were compared with those from 13 sham-operated and 13 untreated control mice. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hear</span></strong>ing thresholds of the animals were evaluated with auditory evoked brainstem responses prior to the induction of sepsis and again at the peak of the disease. Immediately after the second measurement, the mice were sacrificed and the inner ears harvested and prepared for further evaluation. The cochleae were examined with light microscopy, electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry for Bax, cleaved caspase-3 and Bcl-2. The mice with sepsis showed a significant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hear</span></strong>ing loss but not the control groups. Induction of apoptosis could be shown in the supporting cells of the organ of Corti. Furthermore, excitotoxicity could be shown at the basal pole of the inner hair cells. In this murine model, sepsis leads to significant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hear</span></strong>ing impairment. The physiological alteration could be linked to apoptosis in the supporting cells of the organ of Corti and to a disturbance of the synapses of the inner hair cells.</p>

Clinical Usefulness, Angiographic Characteristics, and Safety Evaluation of Intracoronary Acetylcholine Provocation Testing Among 921 Consecutive White Patients With Unobstructed Coronary Arteries
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Coronary spasm can cause myocardial ischemia and angina in patients with and those without obstructive coronary artery disease. However, provocation tests using intracoronary acetylcholine administration are rarely performed in clinical routine in the United States and Europe. Thus, we assessed the clinical usefulness, angiographic characteristics, and safety of intracoronary acetylcholine provocation testing in white patients with unobstructed coronary arteries.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>From September 2007 to June 2010, a total of 921 consecutive patients (362 men, mean age 62±12years) who underwent diagnostic angiography for suspected myocardial ischemia and were found to have unobstructed coronary arteries (no stenosis ≥50%) were enrolled. The intracoronary acetylcholine provocation testing was performed directly after angiography according to a standardized protocol. Three hundred forty-six patients (35%) reported chest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> at rest, 222 (22%) reported chest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> on exertion, 238 (24%) reported a combination of effort and resting chest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong>, and 41 (4%) presented with troponin-positive acute coronary syndrome. The overall frequency of epicardial spasm (>75% diameter reduction with angina and ischemic ECG shifts) was 33.4%, and the overall frequency of microvascular spasm (angina and ischemic ECG shifts without epicardial spasm) was 24.2%. Epicardial spasm was most often diffuse and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">locate</span></strong>d in the distal coronary segments (<i>P</i><0.01). No fatal or irreversible nonfatal complications occurred.

Identifying Locations for Public Access Defibrillators Using Mathematical Optimization
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Geospatial methods using mathematical optimization to identify clusters of cardiac arrests and prioritize public locations for defibrillator deployment have not been studied. Our objective was to develop such a method and test its performance against a population-guided approach.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>All public location cardiac arrests in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, from December 16, 2005, to July 15, 2010, and all automated external defibrillator (AED) locations registered with Toronto Emergency Medical Services as of September 2009 were plotted geographically. Current AED coverage was quantified by determining the number of cardiac arrests occurring within 100 m of a registered AED. Clusters of cardiac arrests without a registered AED within 100 m were identified. With the use of mathematical optimization techniques, cardiac arrest coverage improvements were computed and shown to be superior to results from a population-guided deployment method. There were 1310 eligible public location cardiac arrests and 1669 registered AEDs. Of the eligible cardiac arrests, 304 were within 100 m of at least 1 registered AED (23% coverage). The average distance from a cardiac arrest to the closest AED was 281 m. With AEDs deployed in the top 30 locations, an additional 112 historical cardiac arrests would be covered (32% total coverage), and the average distance to the closest AED would be 262 m.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Geographic clusters of cardiac arrests can be easily identified and prioritized with the use of mathematical modeling. Optimized AED deployment can increase cardiac arrest coverage and decrease the distance to the closest AED. Mathematical modeling can augment public AED deployment programs.</p></sec>

Multimessenger observations of a flaring blazar coincident with high-energy neutrino IceCube-170922A
<p>Previous detections of individual astrophysical sources of neutrinos are limited to the Sun and the supernova 1987A, whereas the origins of the diffuse flux of high-energy cosmic neutrinos remain unidentified. On 22 September 2017, we detected a high-energy neutrino, IceCube-170922A, with an energy of ~290 tera–electron volts. Its arrival direction was consistent with the location of a known γ-ray blazar, TXS 0506+056, observed to be in a flaring state. An extensive multiwavelength campaign followed, ranging from radio frequencies to γ-rays. These observations characterize the variability and energetics of the blazar and include the detection of TXS 0506+056 in very-high-energy γ-rays. This observation of a neutrino in spatial coincidence with a γ-ray–emitting blazar during an active phase suggests that blazars may be a source of high-energy neutrinos.</p>

Prevalence-induced concept change in human judgment
<p>Why do some social problems <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">see</span></strong>m so intractable?

When blue dots became rare, participants began to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">see</span></strong> purple dots as blue; when threatening faces became rare, participants began to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">see</span></strong> neutral faces as threatening; and when unethical requests became rare, participants began to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">see</span></strong> innocuous requests as unethical. This “prevalence-induced concept change” occurred even when participants were forewarned about it and even when they were instructed and paid to resist it.

Multiplexed and portable nucleic acid detection platform with Cas13, Cas12a, and Csm6
<p>Rapid detection of nucleic acids is integral for clinical diagnostics and biotechnological applications. We recently developed a platform termed SHERLOCK (specific high-sensitivity enzymatic reporter unlocking) that combines isothermal preamplification with Cas13 to detect single molecules of RNA or DNA. Through characterization of CRISPR enzymology and application development, we report here four advances integrated into SHERLOCK version 2 (SHERLOCKv2) (i) four-channel single-reaction multiplexing with orthogonal CRISPR enzymes; (ii) quantitative measurement of input as low as 2 attomolar; (iii) 3.5-fold increase in signal sensitivity by combining Cas13 with Csm6, an auxiliary CRISPR-associated enzyme; and (iv) lateral-flow readout. SHERLOCKv2 can detect Dengue or Zika virus single-stranded RNA as well as mutations in patient liquid biopsy samples via lateral flow, highlighting its potential as a multiplexable, portable, rapid, and quantitative detection platform of nucleic acids.</p>

An evolutionarily conserved gene family encodes proton-selective ion channels
<p>Ion channels form the basis for cellular electrical signaling. Despite the scores of genetically identified ion channels selective for other monatomic ions, only one type of proton-selective ion channel has been found in eukaryotic cells. By comparative transcriptome analysis of mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">taste</span></strong> receptor cells, we identified Otopetrin1 (OTOP1), a protein required for development of gravity-sensing otoconia in the vestibular system, as forming a proton-selective ion channel. We found that murine OTOP1 is enriched in acid-detecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">taste</span></strong> receptor cells and is required for their zinc-sensitive proton conductance. Two related murine genes, <i>Otop2</i> and <i>Otop3</i>, and a <i>Drosophila</i> ortholog also encode proton channels. Evolutionary conservation of the gene family and its widespread tissue distribution suggest a broad role for proton channels in physiology and pathophysiology.</p>

Detection and localization of surgically resectable cancers with a multi-analyte blood test
<p>Earlier detection is key to reducing cancer deaths. Here, we describe a blood test that can detect eight common cancer types through assessment of the levels of circulating proteins and mutations in cell-free DNA. We applied this test, called CancerSEEK, to 1005 patients with nonmetastatic, clinically detected cancers of the ovary, liver, stomach, pancreas, esophagus, colorectum, lung, or breast. CancerSEEK tests were positive in a median of 70% of the eight cancer types. The sensitivities ranged from 69 to 98% for the detection of five cancer types (ovary, liver, stomach, pancreas, and esophagus) for which there are no screening tests available for average-risk individuals. The specificity of CancerSEEK was greater than 99%: only 7 of 812 healthy controls scored positive. In addition, CancerSEEK localized the cancer to a small number of anatomic sites in a median of 83% of the patients.</p>

Swope Supernova Survey 2017a (SSS17a), the optical counterpart to a gravitational wave source
<p>On 17 August 2017, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and the Virgo interferometer detected gravitational waves (GWs) emanating from a binary neutron star merger, GW170817. Nearly simultaneously, the Fermi and INTEGRAL (INTErnational Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory) telescopes detected a gamma-ray transient, GRB 170817A.

Obstruction of pilus retraction stimulates bacterial surface sensing
<p>It is critical for bacteria to recognize surface contact and initiate physiological changes required for surface-associated lifestyles. Ubiquitous microbial appendages called pili are involved in sensing surfaces and facilitating downstream behaviors, but the mechanism by which pili mediate surface sensing has been unclear. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visual</span></strong>ized <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i> pili undergoing dynamic cycles of extension and retraction. Within seconds of surface contact, these cycles ceased, which coincided with synthesis of the adhesive holdfast required for attachment. Physically blocking pili imposed resistance to pilus retraction, which was sufficient to stimulate holdfast synthesis without surface contact. Thus, to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sense</span></strong> surfaces, bacteria use the resistance on retracting, surface-bound pili that occurs upon surface contact.</p>

Acoustic mirrors as sensory traps for bats
<p>Sensory traps pose a considerable and often fatal risk for animals, leading them to misinterpret their environment. Bats predominantly rely on their echolocation system to forage, orientate, and navigate. We found that bats can mistake smooth, vertical surfaces as clear flight paths, repeatedly colliding with them, likely as a result of their acoustic mirror properties. The probability of collision is influenced by the number of echolocation calls and by the amount of time spent in front of the surface. The echolocation call analysis corroborates that bats perceive smooth, vertical surfaces as open flyways. Reporting on occurrences with different species in the wild, we argue that it is necessary to more closely monitor potentially dangerous locations with acoustic mirror properties (such as glass fronts) to assess the true frequency of fatalities around these sensory traps.</p>

Glia put visual map in sync
<p>Watching a fireworks display is a breathtaking experience. As explosions pattern the sky, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visual</span></strong> system must capture information about the time-varying positions, colors, and contrasts of myriad spots of light. This testament to high-acuity vision necessitates the development of neural circuits that map <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visual</span></strong> space. To generate this retinotopy (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visual</span></strong> mapping), neurons must differentiate and connect to their synaptic targets with both spatial and temporal precision. How is this achieved? The molecules that regulate neuronal differentiation have been described in detail, as have the cues that allow differentiated neurons to reach and choose their synaptic partners (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). However, the mechanisms that coordinate neuronal specification with the development of retinotopic circuit wiring have remained elusive. On page 886 of this issue, Fernandes <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) demonstrate that in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visual</span></strong> system of flies (<i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>), photoreceptors use glial cells as intermediaries to communicate with their neural targets to generate retinotopic circuits.</p>

Olfactory foraging in temperate waters: sensitivity to dimethylsulphide of shearwaters in the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea
<p>Many procellariiforms use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">olfactory</span></strong> cues to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">locate</span></strong> food patches over the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">see</span></strong>mingly featureless ocean surface. In particular, some of them are able to detect and are attracted by dimethylsulphide (DMS), a volatile compound naturally occurring over worldwide oceans in correspondence with productive feeding areas. However, current knowledge is restricted to sub-Antarctic species and to only one study realized under natural conditions at sea. Here, for the first time, we investigated the response to DMS in parallel in two different environments in temperate waters, the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, employing Cory's (<i>Calonectris borealis</i>) and Scopoli's (<i>Calonectris diomedea</i>) s<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hear</span></strong>waters as models. To test whether these birds can detect and respond to DMS, we presented them with this substance in a Y-maze. Then, to determine whether they use this molecule in natural conditions, we tested the response to DMS at sea. The number of birds that chose DMS in the Y-maze and that were recruited at DMS-scented slicks at sea suggests that these s<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hear</span></strong>waters are attracted to DMS in both non-foraging and natural contexts. Our findings show that the use of DMS as a foraging cue may be a strategy adopted by procellariiforms across oceans but that regional differences may exist, giving a worldwide perspective to previous hypotheses concerning the use of DMS as a chemical cue.</p>

Development of the GABA-ergic signaling system and its role in larval swimming in sea urchin
<p>The present study aimed to elucidate the development and γ-amino butyric acid (GABA)-ergic regulation of larval swimming in the sea urchin <i>Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus</i> by cloning glutamate decarboxylase (<i>Hp-gad</i>), GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor (<i>Hp-gabrA</i>) and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-associated protein (<i>Hp-gabarap</i>), and by performing immunohistochemistry. The regulation of larval swimming was increasingly dependent on the GABAergic system, which was active from the 2 days post-fertilization (d.p.f.) pluteus stage onwards. GABA-immunoreactive cells were detected as a subpopulation of secondary mesenchyme cells during gastrulation and eventually constituted the ciliary band and a subpopulation of blastocoelar cells during the pluteus stage. <i>Hp-gad</i> transcription was detected by RT-PCR during the period when Hp-Gad-positive cells were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">see</span></strong>n as a subpopulation of blastocoelar cells and on the apical side of the ciliary band from the 2 d.p.f. pluteus stage. Consistent with these observations, inhibition of GAD with 3-mercaptopropioninc acid inhibited GABA immunoreactivity and larval swimming dose dependently. <i>Hp-gabrA</i> amplimers were detected weakly in unfertilized eggs and 4 d.p.f. plutei but strongly from fertilized eggs to 2 d.p.f. plutei, and Hp-GabrA, together with GABA, was localized at the ciliary band in association with dopamine receptor D1 from the two-arm pluteus stage. <i>Hp-gabarap</i> transcription and protein expression were detected from the swimming blastula stage. Inhibition of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor by bicuculline inhibited larval swimming dose dependently. Inhibition of larval swimming by either 3-mercaptopropionic acid or bicuculline was more severe in older larvae (17 and 34 d.p.f. plutei) than in younger ones (1 d.p.f. prism larvae).</p>

Olfactory memories are intensity specific in larval <i>Drosophila</i>
<p>Learning can rely on stimulus quality, stimulus intensity, or a combination of these. Regarding olfaction, the coding of odour quality is often proposed to be combinatorial along the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">olfactory</span></strong> pathway, and working hypotheses are available concerning short-term associative memory trace formation of odour quality. However, it is less clear how odour intensity is coded, and whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">olfactory</span></strong> memory traces include information about the intensity of the learnt odour. Using odour–sugar associative conditioning in larval <i>Drosophila</i>, we first describe the dose–effect curves of learnability across odour intensities for four different odours (<i>n</i>-amyl acetate, 3-octanol, 1-octen-3-ol and benzaldehyde). We then chose odour intensities such that larvae were trained at an intermediate odour intensity, but were tested for retention with either that trained intermediate odour intensity, or with respectively higher or lower intensities. We observed a specificity of retention for the trained intensity for all four odours used. This adds to the appreciation of the richness in ‘content’ of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">olfactory</span></strong> short-term memory traces, even in a system as simple as larval <i>Drosophila</i>, and to define the demands on computational models of associative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">olfactory</span></strong> memory trace formation. We suggest two kinds of circuit architecture that have the potential to accommodate intensity learning, and discuss how they may be implemented in the insect brain.</p>

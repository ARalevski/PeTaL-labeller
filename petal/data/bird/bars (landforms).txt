Mesophotic coral ecosystems are threatened and ecologically distinct from shallow water reefs
<p>The rapid degradation of coral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reef</span></strong>s is one of the most serious biodiversity problems facing our generation. Mesophotic coral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reef</span></strong>s (at depths of 30 to 150 meters) have been widely hypothesized to provide refuge from natural and anthropogenic impacts, a promise for the survival of shallow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reef</span></strong>s. The potential role of mesophotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reef</span></strong>s as universal refuges is often highlighted in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reef</span></strong> conservation research. This hypothesis rests on two assumptions: (i) that there is considerable overlap in species composition and connectivity between shallow and deep populations and (ii) that deep <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reef</span></strong>s are less susceptible to anthropogenic and natural impacts than their shallower counterparts. Here we present evidence contradicting these assumptions and argue that mesophotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reef</span></strong>s are distinct, impacted, and in as much need of protection as shallow coral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reef</span></strong>s.</p>

Coral reefs will transition to net dissolving before end of century
<p>Ocean acidification refers to the lowering of the ocean’s pH due to the uptake of anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere. Coral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reef</span></strong> calcification is expected to decrease as the oceans become more acidic. Dissolving calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) sands could greatly exacerbate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reef</span></strong> loss associated with reduced calcification but is presently poorly constrained. Here we show that CaCO<sub>3</sub> dissolution in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reef</span></strong> sediments across five globally distributed sites is negatively correlated with the aragonite saturation state (Ω<sub>ar</sub>) of overlying seawater and that CaCO<sub>3</sub> sediment dissolution is 10-fold more sensitive to ocean acidification than coral calcification. Consequently, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reef</span></strong> sediments globally will transition from net precipitation to net dissolution when seawater Ω<sub>ar</sub> reaches 2.92 ± 0.16 (expected circa 2050 CE). Notably, some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reef</span></strong>s are already experiencing net sediment dissolution.</p>

Plastic waste associated with disease on coral reefs
<p>Plastic waste can promote microbial colonization by pathogens implicated in outbreaks of disease in the ocean. We assessed the influence of plastic waste on disease risk in 124,000 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reef</span></strong>-building corals from 159 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reef</span></strong>s in the Asia-Pacific region. The likelihood of disease increases from 4% to 89% when corals are in contact with plastic. Structurally complex corals are eight times more likely to be affected by plastic, suggesting that microhabitats for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reef</span></strong>-associated organisms and valuable fisheries will be disproportionately affected. Plastic levels on coral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reef</span></strong>s correspond to estimates of terrestrial mismanaged plastic waste entering the ocean. We estimate that 11.1 billion plastic items are entangled on coral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reef</span></strong>s across the Asia-Pacific and project this number to increase 40% by 2025. Plastic waste management is critical for reducing diseases that threaten ecosystem health and human livelihoods.</p>

Recovery of an Isolated Coral Reef System Following Severe Disturbance

Mechanisms of reef coral resistance to future climate change
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reef</span></strong> corals are highly sensitive to heat, yet populations resistant to climate change have recently been identified. To determine the mechanisms of temperature tolerance, we reciprocally transplanted corals between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reef</span></strong> sites experiencing distinct temperature regimes and tested subsequent physiological and gene expression profiles. Local acclimatization and fixed effects, such as adaptation, contributed about equally to heat tolerance and are reflected in patterns of gene expression. In less than 2 years, acclimatization achieves the same heat tolerance that we would expect from strong natural selection over many generations for these long-lived organisms. Our results show both short-term acclimatory and longer-term adaptive acquisition of climate resistance. Adding these adaptive abilities to ecosystem models is likely to slow predictions of demise for coral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reef</span></strong> ecosystems.</p>

Spatial and temporal patterns of mass bleaching of corals in the Anthropocene
<p>Tropical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reef</span></strong> systems are transitioning to a new era in which the interval between recurrent bouts of coral bleaching is too short for a full recovery of mature assemblages. We analyzed bleaching records at 100 globally distributed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reef</span></strong> locations from 1980 to 2016. The median return time between pairs of severe bleaching events has diminished steadily since 1980 and is now only 6 years. As global warming has progressed, tropical sea surface temperatures are warmer now during current La Niñña conditions than they were during El Niññño events three decades ago. Consequently, as we transition to the Anthropocene, coral bleaching is occurring more frequently in all El Niñññño–Southern Oscillation phases, increasing the likelihood of annual bleaching in the coming decades.</p>

WDFY4 is required for cross-presentation in response to viral and tumor antigens
<p>During the process of cross-presentation, viral or tumor-derived antigens are presented to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells by <i>Batf3-</i>dependent CD8α<sup>+</sup>/XCR1<sup>+</sup> classical dendritic cells (cDC1s). We designed a functional CRISPR screen for previously unknown regulators of cross-presentation, and identified the BEACH domain–containing protein WDFY4 as essential for cross-presentation of cell-associated antigens by cDC1s in mice. However, WDFY4 was not required for major histocompatibility complex class II presentation, nor for cross-presentation by monocyte-derived dendritic cells. In contrast to <i>Batf3</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice, <i>Wdfy4</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice displayed normal lymphoid and nonlymphoid cDC1 populations that produce interleukin-12 and protect against <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> infection. However, similar to <i>Batf3</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice, <i>Wdfy4</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice failed to prime virus-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in vivo or induce tumor rejection, revealing a critical role for cross-presentation in antiviral and antitumor immunity.</p>

The nearshore cradle of early vertebrate diversification
<p>Ancestral vertebrate habitats are subject to controversy and obscured by limited, often contradictory paleontological data. We assembled fossil vertebrate occurrence and habitat datasets spanning the middle Paleozoic (480 million to 360 million years ago) and found that early vertebrate clades, both jawed and jawless, originated in restricted, shallow intertidal-subtidal environments. Nearshore divergences gave rise to body plans with different dispersal abilities: Robust fishes shifted shoreward, whereas gracile groups moved seaward. Fresh waters were invaded repeatedly, but movement to deeper waters was contingent upon form and short-lived until the later Devonian. Our results contrast with the onshore-offshore trends, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reef</span></strong>-centered diversification, and mid-shelf clustering observed for benthic invertebrates. Nearshore origins for vertebrates may be linked to the demands of their mobility and may have influenced the structure of their early fossil record and diversification.</p>

21st-century rise in anthropogenic nitrogen deposition on a remote coral reef
<p>With the rapid rise in pollution-associated nitrogen inputs to the western Pacific, it has been suggested that even the open ocean has been affected. In a coral core from Dongsha Atoll, a remote coral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reef</span></strong> ecosystem, we observe a decline in the <sup>15</sup>N/<sup>14</sup>N of coral skeleton–bound organic matter, which signals increased deposition of anthropogenic atmospheric N on the open ocean and its incorporation into plankton and, in turn, the atoll corals. The first clear change occurred just before 2000 CE, decades later than predicted by other work. The amplitude of change suggests that, by 2010, anthropogenic atmospheric N deposition represented 20 ± 5% of the annual N input to the surface ocean in this region, which appears to be at the lower end of other estimates.</p>

Surface changes on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko suggest a more active past
<p>The Rosetta spacecraft spent ~2 years orbiting comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, most of it at distances that allowed surface characterization and monitoring at submeter scales. From December 2014 to June 2016, numerous localized changes were observed, which we attribute to cometary-specific weathering, erosion, and transient events driven by exposure to sunlight and other processes. While the localized changes suggest compositional or physical heterogeneity, their scale has not resulted in substantial alterations to the comet’s landscape. This suggests that most of the major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">landform</span></strong>s were created early in the comet’s current orbital configuration. They may even date from earlier if the comet had a larger volatile inventory, particularly of CO or CO<sub>2</sub> ices, or contained amorphous ice, which could have triggered activity at greater distances from the Sun.</p>

Seagrass ecosystems reduce exposure to bacterial pathogens of humans, fishes, and invertebrates
<p>Plants are important in urban environments for removing pathogens and improving water quality. Seagrass meadows are the most widespread coastal ecosystem on the planet. Although these plants are known to be associated with natural biocide production, they have not been evaluated for their ability to remove microbiological contamination. Using amplicon sequencing of the 16<i>S</i> ribosomal RNA gene, we found that when seagrass meadows are present, there was a 50% reduction in the relative abundance of potential bacterial pathogens capable of causing disease in humans and marine organisms. Moreover, field surveys of more than 8000 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reef</span></strong>-building corals located adjacent to seagrass meadows showed twofold reductions in disease levels compared to corals at paired sites without adjacent seagrass meadows. These results highlight the importance of seagrass ecosystems to the health of humans and other organisms.</p>

Localized seismic deformation in the upper mantle revealed by dense seismic arrays
<p>Seismicity along continental transform faults is usually confined to the upper half of the crust, but the Newport-Inglewood fault (NIF), a major fault traversing the Los Angeles basin, is seismically active down to the upper mantle. We use seismic array analysis to illuminate the seismogenic root of the NIF beneath Long Beach, California, and identify seismicity in an actively deforming localized zone penetrating the lithospheric mantle. Deep earthquakes, which are spatially correlated with geochemical evidence of a fluid pathway from the mantle, as well as with a sharp vertical offset in the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary, exhibit narrow size distribution and weak temporal clustering. We attribute these characteristics to a transition from strong to weak interaction regimes in a system of seismic asperities embedded in a ductile fault zone matrix.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Glucose-Induced Trophic Shift in an Endosymbiont Dinoflagellate with Physiological and Molecular Consequences<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>Interactions between the dinoflagellate endosymbiont <i>Symbiodinium</i> and its cnidarian hosts (e.g. corals, sea anemones) are the foundation of coral-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reef</span></strong> ecosystems. Carbon flow between the partners is a hallmark of this mutualism, but the mechanisms governing this flow and its impact on symbiosis remain poorly understood. We showed previously that although <i>Symbiodinium</i> strain SSB01 can grow photoautotrophically, it can grow mixotrophically or heterotrophically when supplied with Glc, a metabolite normally transferred from the alga to its host. Here we show that Glc supplementation of SSB01 cultures causes a loss of pigmentation and photosynthetic activity, disorganization of thylakoid membranes, accumulation of lipid bodies, and alterations of cell-surface morphology. We used global transcriptome analyses to determine if these physiological changes were correlated with changes in gene expression. Glc-supplemented cells exhibited a marked reduction in levels of plastid transcripts encoding photosynthetic proteins, although most nuclear-encoded transcripts (including those for proteins involved in lipid synthesis and formation of the extracellular matrix) exhibited little change in their abundances. However, the altered carbon metabolism in Glc-supplemented cells was correlated with modest alterations (approximately 2x) in the levels of some nuclear-encoded transcripts for sugar transporters. Finally, Glc-bleached SSB01 cells appeared unable to efficiently populate anemone larvae. Together, these results suggest links between energy metabolism and cellular physiology, morphology, and symbiotic interactions. However, the results also show that in contrast to many other organisms, <i>Symbiodinium</i> can undergo dramatic physiological changes that are not reflected by major changes in the abundances of nuclear-encoded transcripts and thus presumably reflect posttranscriptional regulatory processes.</p>

Lineage-Specific Transcriptional Profiles of <i>Symbiodinium</i> spp. Unaltered by Heat Stress in a Coral Host
<p>Dinoflagellates of the genus <i>Symbiodinium</i> form an endosymbiosis with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reef</span></strong> building corals, in which photosynthetically derived nutrients comprise the majority of the coral energy budget. An extraordinary amount of functional and genetic diversity is contained within the coral-associated <i>Symbiodinium,</i> with some phylotypes (i.e., genotypic groupings), conferring enhanced stress tolerance to host corals. Recent advances in DNA sequencing technologies have enabled transcriptome-wide profiling of the stress response of the cnidarian coral host; however, a comprehensive understanding of the molecular response to stress of coral-associated <i>Symbiodinium,</i> as well as differences among physiologically susceptible and tolerant types, remains largely unexplored. Here, we examine the transcriptome-wide response to heat stress via RNA-Seq of two types of <i>Symbiodinium,</i> the putatively thermotolerant type D2 and the more susceptible type C3K, resident within the same coral host species, <i>Acropora hyacinthus</i>. Contrary to previous findings with coral hosts, we find no detectable change in gene expression across the dinoflagellate transcriptome after 3 days of elevated thermal exposure, despite physical evidence of symbiosis breakdown. However, hundreds of genes identified as orthologs between the C and D types exhibited significant expression differences within treatments (i.e., attributable solely to type, not heat exposure). These include many genes related to known thermotolerance mechanisms including heat shock proteins and chloroplast membrane components. Additionally, both the between-treatment similarities and between-type differences remained pervasive after 12–18 months of common garden acclimation and in mixed <i>Symbiodinium</i> assemblages within the same coral host colony.</p>

Similar specificities of symbiont uptake by adults and larvae in an anemone model system for coral biology
<p>Reef-building corals depend for much of their energy on photosynthesis by symbiotic dinoflagellate algae (genus <i>Symbiodinium</i>) that live within their gastrodermal cells. However, the cellular mechanisms underpinning this ecologically critical symbiosis, including those governing the specificity of symbiont uptake by the host, remain poorly understood, in part because of the difficulties of working with corals in the laboratory. Here, we used the small symbiotic sea anemone <i>Aiptasia</i> as an experimentally tractable model system to analyze the specificity and timing of symbiosis onset in larval and adult animals under controlled laboratory conditions. Using four clonal, axenic <i>Symbiodinium</i> strains, we found no difference in uptake specificity between larvae (even when very young) and adults. Although both compatible and incompatible algal strains were found within the larval guts, only the former appeared to be internalized by gastrodermal cells, and they (but not incompatible algae) proliferated rapidly within the larvae in the absence of detectable exchange with other larvae. Older larvae showed reduced ingestion of both compatible and incompatible algae, and the addition of food failed to promote the uptake of an incompatible algal strain. Thus, <i>Aiptasia</i> adults and larvae appear to have similar mechanisms for discriminating between compatible and incompatible dinoflagellate types prior to phagocytosis by host gastrodermal cells. Whether a particular algal strain is compatible or incompatible appears to be stable during years of axenic culture in the absence of a host. These studies provide a foundation for future analyses of the mechanisms of symbiont-uptake specificity in this emerging model system.</p>

Intertidal sea stars (<i>Pisaster ochraceus</i>) alter body shape in response to wave action
<p>Sea stars are some of the largest mobile animals able to live in the harsh flow environment of wave-exposed, rocky intertidal shores. In addition, some species, such as the northeastern Pacific <i>Pisaster ochraceus</i>, are ecologically significant predators in a broad range of environments, from sheltered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lagoon</span></strong>s to the most wave-exposed shorelines. How they function and survive under such an extreme range of wave exposures remains a puzzle. Here we examine the ability of <i>P. ochraceus</i> to alter body form in response to variation in flow conditions. We found that sea stars in wave-exposed sites had narrower arms and were lighter per unit arm length than those from sheltered sites. Body form was tightly correlated with maximum velocity of breaking waves across four sites and also varied over time. In addition, field transplant experiments showed that these differences in shape were due primarily to phenotypic plasticity. Sea stars transplanted from a sheltered site to a more wave-exposed site became lighter per unit arm length, and developed narrower arms, after 3 months. The tight correlation between water flow and morphology suggests that wave force must be a significant selective factor acting on body shape. On exposed shores, narrower arms probably reduce both lift and drag in breaking waves. On protected shores, fatter arms may provide more thermal inertia to resist overheating, or more body volume for gametes. Such plastic changes in body shape represent a unique method by which sea stars adapt to spatial, seasonal and possibly short-term variation in flow conditions.</p>

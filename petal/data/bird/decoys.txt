URI is required to maintain intestinal architecture during ionizing radiation
<p>Ionizing radiation (IR) can cause gastrointestinal syndrome (GIS), a lethal disorder, by means of unknown mechanisms. We show that high-dose irradiation increases unconventional prefoldin RPB5 interactor (URI) levels in mouse intestinal crypt, but organ regeneration correlates with URI reductions. URI overexpression in intestine protects mice from radiation-induced GIS, whereas halving URI expression sensitizes mice to IR. URI specifically inhibits β-catenin in stem cell–like label-retaining (LR) cells, which are essential for organ regeneration after IR. URI reduction activates β-catenin–induced c-MYC expression, causing proliferation of and DNA damage to LR cells, rendering them radiosensitive. Therefore, URI labels LR cells which promote tissue regeneration in response to high-dose irradiation, and c-MYC inhibitors could be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">countermeasur</span></strong>es for humans at risk of developing GIS.</p>

The Global Virome Project
<p>Outbreaks of novel and deadly viruses highlight global vulnerability to emerging diseases, with many having massive health and economic impacts. Our adaptive toolkit—based largely on vaccines and therapeutics—is often ineffective because <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">countermeasur</span></strong>e development can be outpaced by the speed of novel viral emergence and spread. Following each outbreak, the public health community bemoans a lack of prescience, but after decades of reacting to each event with little focus on mitigation, we remain only marginally better protected against the next epidemic. Our ability to mitigate disease emergence is undermined by our poor understanding of the diversity and ecology of viral threats, and of the drivers of their emergence. We describe a Global Virome Project (GVP) aimed to launch in 2018 that will help identify the bulk of this viral threat and provide timely data for public health interventions against future pandemics.</p>

Atomic structure of the human cytomegalovirus capsid with its securing tegument layer of pp150
<p>Herpesviruses possess a genome-pressurized capsid. The 235-kilobase genome of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is by far the largest of any herpesvirus, yet it has been unclear how its capsid, which is similar in size to those of other herpesviruses, is stabilized. Here we report a HCMV atomic structure consisting of the herpesvirus-conserved capsid proteins MCP, Tri1, Tri2, and SCP and the HCMV-specific tegument protein pp150—totaling ~4000 molecules and 62 different conformers. MCPs manifest as a complex of insertions around a bacteriophage HK97 gp5–like domain, which gives rise to three classes of capsid floor–defining interactions; triplexes, composed of two “embracing” Tri2 conformers and a “third-wheeling” Tri1, fasten the capsid floor. HCMV-specific strategies include using hexon channels to accommodate the genome and pp150 helix bundles to secure the capsid via cysteine tetrad–to-SCP interactions. Our structure should inform rational design of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">countermeasur</span></strong>es against HCMV, other herpesviruses, and even HIV/AIDS.</p>

Turnip Mosaic Virus Counteracts Selective Autophagy of the Viral Silencing Suppressor HCpro<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Autophagy is a conserved intracellular degradation pathway and has emerged as a key mechanism of antiviral immunity in metazoans, including the selective elimination of viral components. In turn, some animal viruses are able to escape and modulate autophagy for enhanced pathogenicity. Whether host autophagic responses and viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">countermeasur</span></strong>es play similar roles in plant-virus interactions is not well understood. Here, we have identified selective autophagy as antiviral pathway during plant infection with turnip mosaic virus (TuMV), a positive-stranded RNA potyvirus. We show that the autophagy cargo receptor NBR1 suppresses viral accumulation by targeting the viral RNA silencing suppressor helper-component proteinase (HCpro), presumably in association with virus-induced RNA granules. Intriguingly, TuMV seems to antagonize NBR1-dependent autophagy during infection by the activity of distinct viral proteins, thereby limiting its antiviral capacity. We also found that NBR1-independent bulk autophagy prevents premature plant death, thus extending the lifespan of virus reservoirs and particle production. Together, our study highlights a conserved role of selective autophagy in antiviral immunity and suggests the evolvement of viral protein functions to inhibit autophagy processes, despite a potential trade-off in host survival.</p>

Extended-Duration Betrixaban Reduces the Risk of Stroke Versus Standard-Dose Enoxaparin Among Hospitalized Medically Ill Patients
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Stroke is a morbid and potentially mortal complication among patients hospitalized with acute medical illness. The potential of extended-duration thromboprophylaxis with the factor Xa inhibitor betrixaban to reduce the risk of stroke compared with standard-dose enoxaparin in this population was assessed in this retrospective APEX trial substudy (Acute Medically Ill Venous Thromboembolism Prevention With Extended Duration Betrixaban).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Hospitalized acutely medically ill subjects (n=7513) were randomized in a double-dummy double-blind fashion to either extended-duration oral betrixaban (80 mg once daily for 35–42 days) or standard-dose subcutaneous enoxaparin (40 mg once daily for 10±4 days) for venous thromboprophylaxis. Stroke events were adjudicated by an independent, blinded event adjudication committee.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The mean age of study participants was 76 years; 45% were male; 13% had had a stroke; and 45% had congestive heart failure. There were fewer all-cause strokes (0.54% versus 0.97%; relative risk [RR]=0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.32–0.96; <i>P</i>=0.032; adjusted RR=0.43%; number needed to treat=233) and ischemic strokes (0.48% versus 0.91%; RR=0.53; 95% confidence interval, 0.30–0.94; <i>P</i>=0.026; adjusted RR=0.43%; number needed to treat=233) among patients treated with betrixaban versus enoxaparin through 77 days of follow-up. Among high-risk subjects, those with congestive heart failure or ischemic stroke as their index event, betrixaban reduced the risk of all-cause stroke (0.72% versus 1.48%; RR=0.49; 95% confidence interval, 0.26–0.90; <i>P</i>=0.019; adjusted RR=0.76%; number needed to treat=132) and ischemic stroke (0.63% versus 1.38%; RR=0.45; 95% confidence interval, 0.24–0.87; <i>P</i>=0.014; adjusted RR=0.75%; number needed to treat=134) compared with enoxaparin.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among hospitalized medically ill patients, extended-duration betrixaban significantly reduced all-cause stroke and ischemic stroke through 77 days of follow-up</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Outcomes of Temporary Interruption of Rivaroxaban Compared With Warfarin in Patients With Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>During long-term anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation, temporary interruptions (TIs) of therapy are common, but the relationship between patient outcomes and TIs has not been well studied. We sought to determine reasons for TI, the characteristics of patients undergoing TI, and the relationship between anticoagulant and outcomes among patients with TI.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>In the Rivaroxaban Once Daily, Oral, Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared With Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation (ROCKET AF), a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy study of rivaroxaban and warfarin in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, baseline characteristics, management, and outcomes, including stroke, non–central nervous system systemic embolism, death, myocardial infarction, and bleeding, were reported in participants who experienced TI (3–30 days) for any reason. The at-risk period for outcomes associated with TI was from TI start to 30 days after resumption of study drug. In 14 236 participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug, 4692 (33%) experienced TI. Participants with TI were similar to the overall ROCKET AF population in regard to baseline clinical characteristics. Only 6% (n=483) of TI incidences involved bridging therapy. Stroke/systemic embolism rates during the at-risk period were similar in rivaroxaban-treated and warfarin-treated participants (0.30% versus 0.41% per 30 days; hazard ratio [confidence interval]=0.74 [0.36–1.50]; <i>P</i>=0.40). Risk of major bleeding during the at-risk period was also similar in rivaroxaban-treated and warfarin-treated participants (0.99% versus 0.79% per 30 days; hazard ratio [confidence interval]=1.26 [0.80–2.00]; <i>P</i>=0.32).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>TI of oral anticoagulation is common and is associated with substantial stroke risks and bleeding risks that were similar among patients treated with rivaroxaban or warfarin.

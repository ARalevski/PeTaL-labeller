VAMP721 Conformations Unmask an Extended Motif for K<sup>+</sup> Channel Binding and Gating Control
<p>Soluble <i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attach</span></strong></span></strong>ment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins play a major role in membrane fusion and contribute to cell expansion, signaling, and polar growth in plants. The SNARE SYP121 of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> that facilitates vesicle fusion at the plasma membrane also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Bind</span></strong>s with, and regulates, K<sup>+</sup> channels already present at the plasma membrane to affect K<sup>+</sup> uptake and K<sup>+</sup>-dependent growth. Here, we report that its cognate partner VAMP721, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assemble</span></strong>s with SYP121 to drive membrane fusion, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Bind</span></strong>s to the KAT1 K<sup>+</sup> channel via two sites on the protein, only one of which contributes to channel-gating control. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Bind</span></strong>ing to the VAMP721 SNARE domain suppressed channel gating. By contrast, interaction with the amino-terminal longin domain conferred specificity on VAMP721 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Bind</span></strong>ing without influencing gating. Channel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Bind</span></strong>ing was defined by a linear motif within the longin domain. The SNARE domain is thought to wrap around this structure when not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assemble</span></strong>d with SYP121 in the SNARE complex. Fluorescence lifetime analysis showed that mutations within this motif, which suppressed channel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Bind</span></strong>ing and its effects on gating, also altered the conformational displacement between the VAMP721 SNARE and longin domains. The presence of these two channel-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Bind</span></strong>ing sites on VAMP721, one also required for SNARE complex assembly, implies a well-defined sequence of events coordinating K<sup>+</sup> uptake and the final stages of vesicle traffic. It suggests that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Bind</span></strong>ing begins with VAMP721, and subsequently with SYP121, thereby coordinating K<sup>+</sup> channel gating during SNARE assembly and vesicle fusion. Thus, our findings also are consistent with the idea that the K<sup>+</sup> channels are nucleation points for SNARE complex assembly.</p>

Dual Sites for SEC11 on the SNARE SYP121 Implicate a Binding Exchange during Secretory Traffic
<p>SNARE (soluble <i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attach</span></strong></span></strong>ment protein receptor) proteins facilitate vesicle traffic through their assembly in a heteromeric complex that drives membrane fusion. Much of vesicle traffic at the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plasma membrane is subject to the Sec1/Munc18 protein SEC11, which, along with plasma membrane K<sup>+</sup> channels, selectively binds with the SNARE SYP121 to regulate its assembly in complex. How SEC11 binding is coordinated with the K<sup>+</sup> channels is poorly understood, as both SEC11 and the channels are thought to compete for the same SNARE binding site. Here, we identify a second binding motif within the N terminus of SYP121 and demonstrate that this motif affects SEC11 binding independently of the F<sup>9</sup>xRF motif that is shared with the K<sup>+</sup> channels. This second, previously unrecognized motif is centered on residues R<sup>20</sup>R<sup>21</sup> of SYP121 and is essential for SEC11 interaction with SYP121. Mutation of the R<sup>20</sup>R<sup>21</sup> motif blocked vesicle traffic without uncoupling the effects of SYP121 on solute and K<sup>+</sup> uptake associated with the F<sup>9</sup>xRF motif; the mutation also mimicked the effects on traffic block observed on coexpression of the dominant-negative SEC11<sup>Δ149</sup> fragment. We conclude that the R<sup>20</sup>R<sup>21</sup> motif represents a secondary site of interaction for the Sec1/Munc18 protein during the transition of SYP121 from the occluded to the open conformation that leads to SNARE complex assembly.</p>

Mapping the stochastic sequence of individual ligand-receptor binding events to cellular activation: T cells act on the rare events
<p>T cell receptor (TCR) binding to agonist peptide major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) triggers signaling events that initiate T cell responses. This system is remarkably sensitive, requiring only a few binding events to successfully activate a cellular response. On average, activating pMHC ligands exhibit mean dwell times of at least a few seconds when bound to the TCR. However, a T cell accumulates pMHC-TCR interactions as a stochastic series of discrete, single-molecule binding events whose individual dwell times are broadly distributed. With activation occurring in response to only a handful of such binding events, individual cells are unlikely to experience the average binding time. Here, we mapped the ensemble of pMHC-TCR binding events in space and time while simultaneously monitoring cellular activation. Our findings revealed that T cell activation hinges on rare, long–dwell time binding events that are an order of magnitude longer than the average agonist pMHC-TCR dwell time. Furthermore, we observed that short pMHC-TCR binding events that were spatially correlated and temporally sequential led to cellular activation. These observations indicate that T cell antigen discrimination likely occurs by sensing the tail end of the pMHC-TCR binding dwell time distribution rather than its average properties.</p>

Mitotic phosphorylation regulates Hsp72 spindle localization by uncoupling ATP binding from substrate release
<p>Hsp72 is a member of the 70-kDa heat shock family of molecular chaperones (Hsp70s) that comprise a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and a substrate-binding domain (SBD) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">connect</span></strong>ed by a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">link</span></strong>er that couples the exchange of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) with the release of the protein substrate. Mitotic phosphorylation of Hsp72 by the kinase NEK6 at Thr<sup>66</sup> located in the NBD promotes the localization of Hsp72 to the mitotic spindle and is required for efficient spindle assembly and chromosome congression and segregation. We determined the crystal structure of the Hsp72 NBD containing a genetically encoded phosphoserine at position 66. This revealed structural changes that stabilized interactions between subdomains within the NBD. ATP binding to the NBD of unmodified Hsp72 resulted in the release of substrate from the SBD, but phosphorylated Hsp72 retained substrate in the presence of ATP. Mutations that prevented phosphorylation-dependent subdomain interactions restored the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">connect</span></strong>ion between ATP binding and substrate release. Thus, phosphorylation of Thr<sup>66</sup> is a reversible mechanism that decouples the allosteric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">connect</span></strong>ion between nucleotide binding and substrate release, providing further insight into the regulation of the Hsp70 family. We propose that phosphorylation of Hsp72 on Thr<sup>66</sup> by NEK6 during mitosis promotes its localization to the spindle by stabilizing its interactions with components of the mitotic spindle.</p>

NDH-PSI Supercomplex Assembly Precedes Full Assembly of the NDH Complex in Chloroplast
<p>The chloroplast NADH dehydrogenase-like (NDH) complex is structurally similar to respiratory complex I and mediates PSI cyclic electron flow. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), chloroplast NDH is composed of at least 29 subunits and associates with two copies of PSI to form the NDH-PSI supercomplex. Here, we found that CHLORORESPIRATORY REDUCTION3 (CRR3) is an assembly factor required for the accumulation of subcomplex B (SubB) of chloroplast NDH. In Suc density gradient centrifugation, CRR3 was detected in three protein complexes. Accumulation of the largest peak III complex was impaired in mutants defective in the SubB subunits PnsB2-PnsB5. The oligomeric form of CRR3 likely functions to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assemble</span></strong> the core of SubB to form the peak III complex as an assembly intermediate. A defect in the PnsL3 subunit increased the level of the peak III complex, suggesting that CRR3 was released from the assembly intermediate after PnsL3 binding. Unlike PnsB2-PnsB5 and PnsL3, PnsB1 was not absolutely necessary for stabilizing SubB. PnsB1 is likely incorporated into the intermediate at the final step during SubB assembly. Lhca6 is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">link</span></strong>er protein mediating NDH-PSI supercomplex formation, and its site of contact with NDH was suggested to be SubB. In the <i>lhca6</i> mutant, accumulation of the peak III complex was impaired, suggesting that SubB interacted with Lhca6 during the step of SubB assembly. The process of supercomplex formation was triggered before the completion of the NDH assembly. Consistent with its predicted function, CRR3 accumulated in young leaves, where the NDH complex was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assemble</span></strong>d.</p>

The Target of β-Expansin EXPB1 in Maize Cell Walls from Binding and Solid-State NMR Studies<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The wall-loosening actions of β-expansins are known primarily from studies of EXPB1 extracted from maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) pollen. EXPB1 selectively loosens cell walls (CWs) of grasses, but its specific binding target is unknown. We characterized EXPB1 binding to sequentially extracted maize CWs, finding that the protein primarily binds glucuronoarabinoxylan (GAX), the major matrix polysaccharide in grass CWs. This binding is strongly reduced by salts, indicating that it is predominantly electrostatic in nature. For direct molecular evidence of EXPB1 binding, we conducted solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance experiments using paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE), which is sensitive to distances between unpaired electrons and nuclei. By mixing <sup>13</sup>C-enriched maize CWs with EXPB1 functionalized with a Mn<sup>2+</sup> tag, we measured Mn<sup>2+</sup>-induced PRE. Strong <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C PREs were observed for the carboxyls of GAX, followed by more moderate PREs for carboxyl groups in homogalacturonan and rhamnogalacturonan-I, indicating that EXPB1 preferentially binds GAX. In contrast, no PRE was observed for cellulose, indicating very weak interaction of EXPB1 with cellulose. Dynamics experiments show that EXPB1 changes GAX mobility in a complex manner: the rigid fraction of GAX became more rigid upon EXPB1 binding while the dynamic fraction became more mobile. Combining these data with previous results, we propose that EXPB1 loosens grass CWs by disrupting noncovalent junctions between highly substituted GAX and GAX of low substitution, which binds cellulose. This study provides molecular evidence of β-expansin’s target in grass CWs and demonstrates a new strategy for investigating ligand binding for proteins that are difficult to express heterologously.</p>

RPA binds histone H3-H4 and functions in DNA replication–coupled nucleosome assembly
<p>DNA replication–coupled nucleosome assembly is essential to maintain genome integrity and retain epigenetic information. Multiple involved histone chaperones have been identified, but how nucleosome assembly is coupled to DNA replication remains elusive. Here we show that replication protein A (RPA), an essential replisome component that binds single-stranded DNA, has a role in replication-coupled nucleosome assembly. RPA directly binds free H3-H4. Assays using a synthetic sequence that mimics freshly unwound single-stranded DNA at replication fork showed that RPA promotes DNA-(H3-H4) complex formation immediately adjacent to double-stranded DNA. Further, an RPA mutant defective in H3-H4 binding exhibited attenuated nucleosome assembly on nascent chromatin. Thus, we propose that RPA functions as a platform for targeting histone deposition to replication fork, through which RPA couples nucleosome assembly with ongoing DNA replication.</p>

MoChlo: A Versatile, Modular Cloning Toolbox for Chloroplast Biotechnology
<p>Plant synthetic biology is a rapidly evolving field with new tools constantly emerging to drive innovation. Of particular interest is the application of synthetic biology to chloroplast biotechnology to generate plants capable of producing new metabolites, vaccines, biofuels, and high-value chemicals. Progress made in the assembly of large DNA molecules, composing multiple transcriptional units, has significantly aided in the ability to rapidly construct novel vectors for genetic engineering. In particular, Golden Gate assembly has provided a facile molecular tool for standardized assembly of synthetic genetic elements into larger DNA constructs. In this work, a complete modular chloroplast cloning system, MoChlo, was developed and validated for fast and flexible chloroplast engineering in plants. A library of 128 standardized chloroplast-specific parts (47 promoters, 38 5′ untranslated regions [5′UTRs], nine promoter:5′UTR fusions, 10 3′UTRs, 14 genes of interest, and 10 chloroplast-specific destination vectors) were mined from the literature and modified for use in MoChlo assembly, along with chloroplast-specific destination vectors. The strategy was validated by assembling synthetic operons of various sizes and determining the efficiency of assembly. This method was successfully used to generate chloroplast transformation vectors containing up to seven transcriptional units in a single vector (∼10.6-kb synthetic operon). To enable researchers with limited resources to engage in chloroplast biotechnology, and to accelerate progress in the field, the entire kit, as described, is available through Addgene at minimal cost. Thus, the MoChlo kit represents a valuable tool for fast and flexible design of heterologous metabolic pathways for plastid metabolic engineering.</p>

Notch-Jagged complex structure implicates a catch bond in tuning ligand sensitivity
<p>Notch receptor activation initiates cell fate decisions and is distinctive in its reliance on mechanical force and protein glycosylation. The 2.5-angstrom-resolution crystal structure of the extracellular interacting region of Notch1 complexed with an engineered, high-affinity variant of Jagged1 (Jag1) reveals a binding interface that extends ~120 angstroms along five consecutive domains of each protein. <i>O</i>-Linked fucose modifications on Notch1 epidermal growth factor–like (EGF) domains 8 and 12 engage the EGF3 and C2 domains of Jag1, respectively, and different Notch1 domains are favored in binding to Jag1 than those that bind to the Delta-like 4 ligand. Jag1 undergoes conformational changes upon Notch binding, exhibiting catch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> behavior that prolongs interactions in the range of forces required for Notch activation. This mechanism enables cellular forces to regulate binding, discriminate among Notch ligands, and potentiate Notch signaling.</p>

The Ribosome-Bound Protein Pam68 Promotes Insertion of Chlorophyll into the CP47 Subunit of Photosystem II
<p>Photosystem II (PSII) is a large enzyme complex embedded in the thylakoid membrane of oxygenic phototrophs. The biogenesis of PSII requires the assembly of more than 30 subunits, with the assistance of a number of auxiliary proteins. In plants and cyanobacteria, the photosynthesis-affected mutant 68 (Pam68) is important for PSII assembly. However, its mechanisms of action remain unknown. Using a <i>Synechocystis</i> PCC 6803 strain expressing Flag-tagged Pam68, we purified a large protein complex containing ribosomes, SecY translocase, and the chlorophyll-binding PSII inner antenna CP47. Using 2D gel electrophoresis, we identified a pigmented Pam68-CP47 subcomplex and found Pam68 bound to ribosomes. Our results show that Pam68 binds to ribosomes even in the absence of CP47 translation. Furthermore, Pam68 associates with CP47 at an early phase of its biogenesis and promotes the synthesis of this chlorophyll-binding polypeptide until the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attach</span></strong></span></strong>ment of the small PSII subunit PsbH. Deletion of both Pam68 and PsbH nearly abolishes the synthesis of CP47, which can be restored by enhancing chlorophyll biosynthesis. These results strongly suggest that ribosome-bound Pam68 stabilizes membrane segments of CP47 and facilitates the insertion of chlorophyll molecules into the translated CP47 polypeptide chain.</p>

Resolving Ambiguity of Species Limits and Concatenation in Multilocus Sequence Data for the Construction of Phylogenetic Supermatrices
<p>Public DNA databases are becoming too large and too complex for manual methods to generate phylogenetic supermatrices from multiple gene sequences. Delineating the terminals based on taxonomic labels is no longer practical because species identifications are frequently incomplete and gene trees are incongruent with Linnaean binomials, which results in uncertainty about how to combine species units among un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">link</span></strong>ed loci. We developed a procedure that minimizes the problem of forming multilocus species units in a large phylogenetic data set using algorithms from graph theory. An initial step established sequence clusters for each locus that broadly correspond to the species level. These clusters frequently include sequences labeled with various binomials and specimen identifiers that create multiple alternatives for concatenation. To choose among these possibilities, we minimize taxonomic conflict among the species units globally in the data set using a multipartite heuristic algorithm. The procedure was applied to all available GenBank data for Coleoptera (beetles) including > 10 500 taxon labels and > 23 500 sequences of 4 loci, which were grouped into 11 241 clusters or divergent singletons by the BlastClust software. Within each cluster, unidentified sequences could be assigned to a species name through the association with fully identified sequences, resulting in 510 new identifications (13.9% of total unidentified sequences) of which nearly half were “trans-locus” identifications by clustering of sequences at a secondary locus. The limits of DNA-based clusters were inconsistent with the Linnaean binomials for 1518 clusters (13.5%) that contained more than one binomial or split a single binomial among multiple clusters. By applying a scoring scheme for full and partial name matches in pairs of clusters, a maximum weight set of 7366 global species units was produced. Varying the match weights for partial matches had little effect on the number of units, although if partial matches were disallowed, the number increased greatly. Trees from the resulting supermatrices generally produced tree topologies in good agreement with the higher taxonomy of Coleoptera, with fewer terminals compared with trees generated according to standard filtering of sequences using species labels. The study illustrates a strategy for assembling the tree-of-life from an ever more complex primary database.

K63-linked polyubiquitin chains bind to DNA to facilitate DNA damage repair
<p>Polyubiquitylation is canonically viewed as a posttranslational modification that governs protein stability or protein-protein interactions, in which distinct polyubiquitin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">link</span></strong>ages ultimately determine the fate of modified protein(s). We explored whether polyubiquitin chains have any nonprotein-related function. Using in vitro pull-down assays with synthetic materials, we found that polyubiquitin chains with the Lys<sup>63</sup> (K63) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">link</span></strong>age bound to DNA through a motif we called the “DNA-interacting patch” (DIP), which is composed of the adjacent residues Thr<sup>9</sup>, Lys<sup>11</sup>, and Glu<sup>34</sup>. Upon DNA damage, the binding of K63-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">link</span></strong>ed polyubiquitin chains to DNA enhanced the recruitment of repair factors through their interaction with an Ile<sup>44</sup> patch in ubiquitin to facilitate DNA repair. Furthermore, experimental or cancer patient–derived mutations within the DIP impaired the DNA binding capacity of ubiquitin and subsequently attenuated K63-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">link</span></strong>ed polyubiquitin chain accumulation at sites of DNA damage, thereby resulting in defective DNA repair and increased cellular sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents.

Dimerization of the adaptor Gads facilitates antigen receptor signaling by promoting the cooperative binding of Gads to the adaptor LAT
<p>The accurate assembly of signalosomes centered on the adaptor protein LAT (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">link</span></strong>er of activated T cells) is required for antigen receptor signaling in T cells and mast cells. During signalosome assembly, members of the growth factor receptor–bound protein 2 (Grb2) family of cytosolic adaptor proteins bind cooperatively to LAT through interactions with its phosphorylated tyrosine (pTyr) residues. We demonstrated the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain–mediated dimerization of the Grb2 family member, Grb2-related adaptor downstream of Shc (Gads). Gads dimerization was mediated by an SH2 domain interface, which is distinct from the pTyr binding pocket and which promoted cooperative, preferential binding of paired Gads to LAT. This SH2 domain–intrinsic mechanism of cooperativity, which we quantified by mathematical modeling, enabled Gads to discriminate between dually and singly phosphorylated LAT molecules. Mutational inactivation of the dimerization interface reduced cooperativity and abrogated Gads signaling in T cells and mast cells. The dimerization-dependent, cooperative binding of Gads to LAT may increase antigen receptor sensitivity by reducing signalosome formation at incompletely phosphorylated LAT molecules, thereby prioritizing the formation of complete signalosomes.</p>

Complex signal processing in synthetic gene circuits using cooperative regulatory assemblies
<p>Eukaryotic genes are regulated by multivalent transcription factor complexes. Through cooperative self-assembly, these complexes perform nonlinear regulatory operations involved in cellular decision-making and signal processing. In this study, we apply this design principle to synthetic networks, testing whether engineered cooperative assemblies can program nonlinear gene circuit behavior in yeast. Using a model-guided approach, we show that specifying the strength and number of assembly subunits enables predictive tuning between linear and nonlinear regulatory responses for single- and multi-input circuits. We demonstrate that assemblies can be adjusted to control circuit dynamics. We harness this capability to engineer circuits that perform dynamic filtering, enabling frequency-dependent decoding in cell populations. Programmable cooperative assembly provides a versatile way to tune the nonlinearity of network <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">connect</span></strong>ions, markedly expanding the engineerable behaviors available to synthetic circuits.</p>

<p>Information relay at the molecular level is an essential phenomenon in numerous chemical and biological processes, such as intricate signaling cascades. One key challenge in synthetic molecular self-assembly is to construct artificial structures that imitate these complex behaviors in controllable systems. We demonstrated prescribed, long-range information relay in an artificial molecular array <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assemble</span></strong>d from modular DNA structural units. The dynamic DNA molecular array exhibits transformations with programmable initiation, propagation, and regulation. The transformation of the array can be initiated at selected units and then propagated, without addition of extra triggers, to neighboring units and eventually the entire array. The specific information pathways by which this transformation occurs can be controlled by altering the design of individual units and the arrays.</p>

Experimentally realized mechanochemistry distinct from force-accelerated scission of loaded bonds
<p>Stretching polymer chains accelerates dissociation of a variety of internal covalent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>s, to an extent that correlates well with the force experienced by the scissile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>. Recent theory has also predicted scenarios in which applied force accelerates dissociation of unloaded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>s and kinetically strengthens strained <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>s. We report here unambiguous experimental validation of this hypothesis: Detailed kinetic measurements demonstrate that stretching phosphotriesters accelerates dissociation of the unloaded phosphorus-oxygen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> orthogonal to the pulling axis, whereas stretching organosiloxanes inhibits dissociation of the aligned loaded silicon-oxygen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>s. Qualitatively, the outcome is determined by phosphoester elongation and siloxane contraction along the pulling axis in the respective rate-determining transition states. Quantitatively, the results agree with a simple mechanochemical kinetics model.</p>

De novo assembly of the <i>Aedes aegypti</i> genome using Hi-C yields chromosome-length scaffolds
<p>The Zika outbreak, spread by the <i>Aedes aegypti</i> mosquito, highlights the need to create high-quality assemblies of large genomes in a rapid and cost-effective way. Here we combine Hi-C data with existing draft assemblies to generate chromosome-length scaffolds. We validate this method by assembling a human genome, de novo, from short reads alone (67× coverage). We then combine our method with draft sequences to create genome assemblies of the mosquito disease vectors <i>Ae</i>.<i> aegypti</i> and <i>Culex quinquefasciatus</i>, each consisting of three scaffolds corresponding to the three chromosomes in each species. These assemblies indicate that almost all genomic rearrangements among these species occur within, rather than between, chromosome arms. The genome assembly procedure we describe is fast, inexpensive, and accurate, and can be applied to many species.</p>

OHP1, OHP2, and HCF244 Form a Transient Functional Complex with the Photosystem II Reaction Center
<p>The reaction center (RC) of photosystem II (PSII), which is composed of D1, D2, PsbI, and cytochrome <i>b559</i> subunits, forms at an early stage of PSII biogenesis. However, it is largely unclear how these components <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assemble</span></strong> to form a functional unit. In this work, we show that synthesis of the PSII core proteins D1/D2 and formation of the PSII RC is blocked specifically in the absence of ONE-HELIX PROTEIN1 (OHP1) and OHP2 proteins in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), indicating that OHP1 and OHP2 are essential for the formation of the PSII RC. Mutagenesis of the chlorophyll-binding residues in OHP proteins impairs their function and/or stability, suggesting that they may function in the binding of chlorophyll in vivo. We further show that OHP1, OHP2, and HIGH CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE244 (HCF244), together with D1, D2, PsbI, and cytochrome <i>b559</i>, form a complex. We designated this complex the PSII RC-like complex to distinguish it from the RC subcomplex in the intact PSII complex. Our data imply that OHP1, OHP2, and HCF244 are present in this PSII RC-like complex for a limited time at an early stage of PSII de novo assembly and of PSII repair under high-light conditions. In a subsequent stage of PSII biogenesis, OHP1, OHP2, and HCF244 are released from the PSII RC-like complex and replaced by the other PSII subunits. Together with previous reports on the cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i>, our results demonstrate that the process of PSII RC assembly is highly conserved among photosynthetic species.</p>

Structure of eIF4E in Complex with an eIF4G Peptide Supports a Universal Bipartite Binding Mode for Protein Translation
<p>The association-dissociation of the cap-binding protein eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) with eIF4G is a key control step in eukaryotic translation. The paradigm on the eIF4E-eIF4G interaction states that eIF4G binds to the dorsal surface of eIF4E through a single canonical alpha-helical motif, while metazoan eIF4E-binding proteins (m4E-BPs) advantageously compete against eIF4G via bimodal interactions involving this canonical motif and a second noncanonical motif of the eIF4E surface. Metazoan eIF4Gs share this extended binding interface with m4E-BPs, with significant implications on the understanding of translation regulation and the design of therapeutic molecules. Here we show the high-resolution structure of melon (<i>Cucumis melo</i>) eIF4E in complex with a melon eIF4G peptide and propose the first eIF4E-eIF4G structural model for plants. Our structural data together with functional analyses demonstrate that plant eIF4G binds to eIF4E through both the canonical and noncanonical motifs, similarly to metazoan eIF4E-eIF4G complexes. As in the case of metazoan eIF4E-eIF4G, this may have very important practical implications, as plant eIF4E-eIF4G is also involved in a significant number of plant diseases. In light of our results, a universal eukaryotic bipartite mode of binding to eIF4E is proposed.</p>

Molecular and functional characterization of hemocyanin of the giant African millipede, <i>Archispirostreptus gigas</i>
<p>In contrast to other terrestrial arthropods, where gaseous O<sub>2</sub> that fuels aerobic metabolism dif<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuse</span></strong>s to the tissues in tracheal tubes, and most other metazoans, where O<sub>2</sub> is transported to tissues by circulating respiratory proteins, the myriapods (millipedes and centipedes) strikingly have tracheal systems as well as circulating hemocyanin (Hc). In order to elucidate the evolutionary origin and biological significance of millipede Hc, we report the molecular structure (subunit composition and amino acid sequence) of multimeric (36-mer) Hc from the forest floor-dwelling giant African millipede <i>Archispirostreptus gigas</i> and its allosteric oxygen-binding properties under various physico-chemical conditions. <i>Archispirostreptus gigas</i> Hc consists of only a single subunit type with differential glycosylation. Phylogenic analysis revealed that millipede Hc is a sister group to centipede HcA, which supports an early divergence of distinct Hc subunits in myriapods and an ancient origin of multimeric Hcs. <i>Archispirostreptus gigas</i> Hc binds O<sub>2</sub> with a high affinity and shows a strong Bohr effect. O<sub>2</sub> binding is, moreover, modulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, which increase the O<sub>2</sub> affinity of the Hc in the tense (T; deoxygenated) as well as the relaxed (R; oxygenated) states, and by (<sc>l</sc>)-lactate, which modulates Hc–O<sub>2</sub> affinity by changing the allosteric equilibrium constant, <i>L</i>. Cooperativity in O<sub>2</sub> binding at half O<sub>2</sub> saturation (<i>n</i><sub>50</sub>) is pH dependent and maximal at ~pH 7.4, and the number of interacting O<sub>2</sub>-binding sites (<i>q</i>) is markedly increased by binding Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The data are discussed in the light of the mutually supplementary roles of Hc and the tracheal system for tissue O<sub>2</sub> supply.</p>

Substrate binding allosterically relieves autoinhibition of the pseudokinase TRIB1
<p>The Tribbles family of pseudokinases recruits substrates to the ubiquitin ligase COP1 to facilitate ubiquitylation. CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family transcription factors are crucial Tribbles substrates in adipocyte and myeloid cell development. We found that the TRIB1 pseudokinase was able to recruit various C/EBP family members and that the binding of C/EBPβ was attenuated by phosphorylation. To explain the mechanism of C/EBP recruitment, we solved the crystal structure of TRIB1 in complex with C/EBPα, which revealed that TRIB1 underwent a substantial conformational change relative to its substrate-free structure and bound C/EBPα in a pseudosubstrate-like manner. Crystallographic analysis and molecular dynamics and subsequent biochemical assays showed that C/EBP binding triggered allosteric changes that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">link</span></strong> substrate recruitment to COP1 binding. These findings offer a view of pseudokinase regulation with striking parallels to bona fide kinase regulation—by means of the activation loop and αC helix—and raise the possibility of small molecules targeting either the activation “loop-in” or “loop-out” conformations of Tribbles pseudokinases.</p>

Thrombospondin-1 promotes matrix homeostasis by interacting with collagen and lysyl oxidase precursors and collagen cross-linking sites
<p>Fibrillar collagens of the extracellular matrix are critical for tissue structure and physiology; however, excessive or abnormal deposition of collagens is a defining feature of fibrosis. Regulatory mechanisms that act on collagen fibril assembly potentially offer new targets for antifibrotic treatments. Tissue weakening, altered collagen fibril morphologies, or both, are shared phenotypes of mice lacking matricellular thrombospondins. Thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) plays an indirect role in collagen homeostasis through interactions with matrix metalloproteinases and transforming growth factor–β1 (TGF-β1). We found that TSP1 also affects collagen fibril formation directly. Compared to skin from wild-type mice, skin from <i>Thbs1</i><sup><i>−/−</i></sup> mice had reduced collagen cross-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">link</span></strong>ing and reduced prolysyl oxidase (proLOX) abundance with increased conversion to catalytically active LOX. In vitro, TSP1 bound to both the C-propeptide domain of collagen I and the highly conserved KGHR sequences of the collagen triple-helical domain that participate in cross-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">link</span></strong>ing. TSP1 also bound to proLOX and inhibited proLOX processing by bone morphogenetic protein-1. In human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs), TSP1 and collagen I colocalized in intracellular vesicles and on extracellular collagen fibrils, whereas TSP1 and proLOX colocalized only in intracellular vesicles. Inhibition of LOX-mediated collagen cross-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">link</span></strong>ing did not prevent the extracellular association between collagen and TSP1; however, treatment of HDFs with KGHR-containing, TSP1-binding, triple-helical peptides disrupted the collagen-TSP1 association, perturbed the collagen extracellular matrix, and increased myofibroblastic differentiation in a manner that depended on TGF-β receptor 1. Thus, the extracellular KGHR-dependent interaction of TSP1 with fibrillar collagens contributes to fibroblast homeostasis.</p>

Aurora B opposes PP1 function in mitosis by phosphorylating the conserved PP1-binding RVxF motif in PP1 regulatory proteins
<p>Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) is a highly conserved protein phosphatase that performs most of the serine- and threonine-dephosphorylation reactions in eukaryotes and opposes the actions of a diverse set of serine and threonine (Ser-Thr) protein kinases. PP1 gains substrate specificity through binding to a large number (>200) of regulatory proteins that control PP1 localization, activity, and interactions with substrates. PP1 recognizes the well-characterized RVxF binding motif that is present in many of these regulatory proteins, thus generating a multitude of distinct PP1 holoenzymes. We showed that a subset of the RVxF binding motifs, in which x is a phosphorylatable amino acid (RV[S/T]F), was phosphorylated specifically during mitosis and that this phosphorylation event abrogated the interaction of PP1 with the regulatory protein. We determined that this phosphorylation was primarily governed by the mitotic protein kinase Aurora B and that high phosphorylation site stoichiometry of these sites maintained the phosphorylation of PP1 substrates during mitosis by disrupting the assembly of PP1 holoenzymes. We generated an antibody that recognizes the phosphorylated form of the RV[S/T]F motif (RVp[S/T]F) and used it to identify known PP1 regulatory proteins (KNL1, CDCA2, and RIF1) and multiple proteins that could potentially act as PP1 binding partners (UBR5, ASPM, SEH1, and ELYS) governed by this mechanism. Together, these data suggest a general regulatory mechanism by which the coordinated activities of Aurora B and PP1 control mitotic progression.</p>

De novo design of self-assembling helical protein filaments

Cryo–electron microscopy structures of six designs are close to the computational design models. The filament building blocks are idealized repeat proteins, and thus the diameter of the filaments can be systematically tuned by varying the number of repeat units. The assembly and disassembly of the filaments can be controlled by engineered anchor and capping units built from monomers lacking one of the interaction surfaces. The ability to generate dynamic, highly ordered structures that span micrometers from protein monomers opens up possibilities for the fabrication of new multiscale metamaterials.</p>

Crystallizing a memory
<p>What is the physical basis of memory? What does it take to retrieve a memory in the brain? What would it take to activate or erase memories? In the early 20th century, the German zoologist Richard Semon coined the term “engram” to denote the physical manifestation of a memory in the brain (<i>1</i>). Two decades later, Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb posited a physiological correlate for learning and recollection: The process of learning strengthens the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">connect</span></strong>ions, or synapses, between neurons, which leads to the development of brain-wide cell assemblies that undergo changes in their structural and functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">connect</span></strong>ivity (<i>2</i>). The coordinated activity of these assemblies—called ensembles, traces, or engrams—that occurs during learning (memory formation) is thought to be reengaged during recall and thereby forms a stable neuronal correlate of memory (<i>2</i>). As subsequent memories are formed, the dynamics of these assemblies evolve and provide preexisting scaffolds to influence how the brain processes the variety of memories an organism forms. Studies by Abdou <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) on page 1227 of this issue and by Choi <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) develop new technologies to visualize discrete engrams in the brain and modulate them in a synapse-specific manner to understand memory strength and memory restoration from an amnestic state. This improved understanding could eventually be translated to modulate memories to alleviate maladaptive memory states.</p>

By comparing these with two long-read de novo human genome assemblies and a gorilla genome assembly, we characterized lineage-specific and shared great ape genetic variation ranging from single– to mega–base pair–sized variants. We identified ~17,000 fixed human-specific structural variants identifying genic and putative regulatory changes that have emerged in humans since divergence from nonhuman apes. Interestingly, these variants are enriched near genes that are down-regulated in human compared to chimpanzee cerebral organoids, particularly in cells analogous to radial glial neural progenitors.</p>

Molecular structure of human P-glycoprotein in the ATP-bound, outward-facing conformation
<p>The multidrug transporter permeability (P)–glycoprotein is an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)–binding cassette exporter responsible for clinical resistance to chemotherapy. P-glycoprotein extrudes toxic molecules and drugs from cells through ATP-powered conformational changes. Despite decades of effort, only the structures of the inward-facing conformation of P-glycoprotein are available. Here we present the structure of human P-glycoprotein in the outward-facing conformation, determined by cryo–electron microscopy at 3.4-angstrom resolution. The two nucleotide-binding domains form a closed dimer occluding two ATP molecules. The drug-binding cavity observed in the inward-facing structures is reorientated toward the extracellular space and compressed to preclude substrate binding. This observation indicates that ATP binding, not hydrolysis, promotes substrate release. The structure evokes a model in which the dynamic nature of P-glycoprotein enables translocation of a large variety of substrates.</p>

Mechanically robust, readily repairable polymers via tailored noncovalent cross-linking
<p>Expanding the range of healable materials is an important challenge for sustainable societies.

Another key was to incorporate a structural element for activating the exchange of hydrogen-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>ed pairs, which enables the fractured portions to re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">join</span></strong> readily upon compression.</p>

Mitotic chromosome assembly despite nucleosome depletion in <i>Xenopus</i> egg extracts
<p>The nucleosome is the fundamental structural unit of eukaryotic chromatin.

However, it remains unclear whether nucleosome assembly is indeed an essential prerequisite for mitotic chromosome assembly. We combined mouse sperm nuclei and <i>Xenopus</i> cell-free egg extracts depleted of the histone chaperone Asf1 and found that chromatid-like structures could be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assemble</span></strong>d even in the near absence of nucleosomes. The resultant “nucleosome-depleted” chromatids contained discrete central axes positive for condensins, although they were more fragile than normal nucleosome-containing chromatids.

<p>Windmills, cars, and dental restoration demand polymer materials and composites that are easy to process, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assemble</span></strong>, and recycle while exhibiting outstanding mechanical, thermal, and chemical resistance. Vitrimers, which are polymer networks able to shuffle chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>s through exchange reactions, could address these demands if they were prepared from existing plastics and processed with fast production rates and current equipment. We report the metathesis of dioxaborolanes, which is rapid and thermally robust, and use it to prepare vitrimers from polymers as different as poly(methyl methacrylate), polystyrene, and high-density polyethylene that, although permanently cross-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">link</span></strong>ed, can be processed multiple times by means of extrusion or injection molding. They show superior chemical resistance and dimensional stability and can be efficiently <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assemble</span></strong>d. The strategy is applicable to polymers with backbones made of carbon-carbon single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>s.</p>

Clathrate colloidal crystals
<p>DNA-programmable assembly has been used to deliberately synthesize hundreds of different colloidal crystals spanning dozens of symmetries, but the complexity of the achieved structures has so far been limited to small unit cells. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assemble</span></strong>d DNA-modified triangular bipyramids (~250-nanometer long edge, 177-nanometer short edge) into clathrate architectures. Electron microscopy images revealed that at least three different structures form as large single-domain architectures or as multidomain materials. Ordered assemblies, isostructural to clathrates, were identified with the help of molecular simulations and geometric analysis. These structures are the most sophisticated architectures made via programmable assembly, and their formation can be understood based on the shape of the nanoparticle building blocks and mode of DNA functionalization.</p>

DNA-PKcs structure suggests an allosteric mechanism modulating DNA double-strand break repair
<p>DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) is a central component of nonhomologous end <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">join</span></strong>ing (NHEJ), repairing DNA double-strand breaks that would otherwise lead to apoptosis or cancer. We have solved its structure in complex with the C-terminal peptide of Ku80 at 4.3 angstrom resolution using x-ray crystallography. We show that the 4128–amino acid structure comprises three large structural units: the N-terminal unit, the Circular Cradle, and the Head. Conformational differences between the two molecules in the asymmetric unit are correlated with changes in accessibility of the kinase active site, which are consistent with an allosteric mechanism to bring about kinase activation. The location of KU80ct<sub>194</sub> in the vicinity of the breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) binding site suggests competition with BRCA1, leading to pathway selection between NHEJ and homologous recombination.</p>

A global genetic interaction network maps a wiring diagram of cellular function
<p>We generated a global genetic interaction network for <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, constructing more than 23 million double mutants, identifying about 550,000 negative and about 350,000 positive genetic interactions. This comprehensive network maps genetic interactions for essential gene pairs, highlighting essential genes as densely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">connect</span></strong>ed hubs. Genetic interaction profiles enabled assembly of a hierarchical model of cell function, including modules corresponding to protein complexes and pathways, biological processes, and cellular compartments. Negative interactions <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">connect</span></strong>ed functionally related genes, mapped core bioprocesses, and identified pleiotropic genes, whereas positive interactions often mapped general regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">connect</span></strong>ions among gene pairs, rather than shared functionality. The global network illustrates how coherent sets of genetic interactions <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">connect</span></strong> protein complex and pathway modules to map a functional wiring diagram of the cell.</p>

Targeted Endoplasmic Reticulum Localization of Storage Protein mRNAs Requires the RNA-Binding Protein RBP-L
<p>The transport and targeting of glutelin and prolamine mRNAs to distinct subdomains of the cortical endoplasmic reticulum is a model for mRNA localization in plants. This process requires a number of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that recognize and bind to mRNA cis-localization (zipcode) elements to form messenger ribonucleoprotein complexes, which then transport the RNAs to their destination sites at the cortical endoplasmic reticulum. Here, we present evidence that the rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) RNA-binding protein, RBP-L, like its interacting RBP-P partner, specifically binds to glutelin and prolamine zipcode RNA sequences and is required for proper mRNA localization in rice endosperm cells. A transfer DNA insertion in the 3′ untranslated region resulted in reduced expression of the <i>RBP</i>-<i>L</i> gene to 10% to 25% of that in the wild-type. Reduced amounts of RBP-L caused partial mislocalization of glutelin and prolamine RNAs and conferred other general growth defects, including dwarfism, late flowering, and smaller seeds. Transcriptome analysis showed that RBP-L knockdown greatly affected the expression of prolamine family genes and several classes of transcription factors. Collectively, these results indicate that RBP-L, like RBP-P, is a key RBP involved in mRNA localization in rice endosperm cells. Moreover, distinct from RBP-P, RBP-L exhibits additional regulatory roles in development, either directly through its binding to corresponding RNAs or indirectly through its effect on transcription factors.</p>

A Connection between Lysine and Serotonin Metabolism in Rice Endosperm
<p>Cereal endosperms produce a vast array of metabolites, including the essential amino acid lysine (Lys). Enhanced accumulation of Lys has been achieved via metabolic engineering in cereals, but the potential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">connect</span></strong>ion between metabolic engineering and Lys fortification is unclear. In mature seeds of engineered High Free Lysine (HFL) rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), the endosperm takes on a characteristic dark-brown appearance. In this study, we use an integrated metabolomic and transcriptomic approach combined with functional validation to elucidate the key metabolites responsible for the dark-brown phenotype. Importantly, we found that serotonin biosynthesis was elevated dramatically and closely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">link</span></strong>ed with dark-brown endosperm color in HFL rice. A functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">connect</span></strong>ion between serotonin and endosperm color was confirmed via overexpression of TDC3, a key enzyme of serotonin biosynthesis. Furthermore, we show that both the jasmonate signaling pathway and <i>TDC</i> expression were strongly induced in the late stage of endosperm development of HFL rice, coinciding with serotonin accumulation and dark-brown pigmentation. We propose a model for the metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">connect</span></strong>ion between Lys and serotonin metabolism in which elevated 2-aminoadipate from Lys catabolism may play a key role in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">connect</span></strong>ion between the jasmonate signaling pathway, serotonin accumulation, and the brown phenotype in rice endosperm. Our data provide a deeper understanding of amino acid metabolism in rice. In addition, the finding that both Lys and serotonin accumulate in HFL rice grains should promote efforts to create a nutritionally favorable crop.</p>

Simultaneous high-resolution pH and spectrophotometric recordings of oxygen binding in blood microvolumes
<p>Oxygen equilibrium curves have been widely used to understand oxygen transport in numerous organisms. A major challenge has been to monitor oxygen binding characteristics and concomitant pH changes as they occur <i>in vivo</i>, in limited sample volumes. Here we report a technique allowing highly resolved and simultaneous monitoring of pH and blood pigment saturation in minute blood volumes. We equipped a gas diffusion chamber with a broad-range fibre-optic spectrophotometer and a micro-pH optode and recorded changes of pigment oxygenation along oxygen partial pressure (<i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>) and pH gradients to test the setup. Oxygen binding parameters derived from measurements in only 15 μl of haemolymph from the cephalopod <i>Octopus vulgaris</i> showed low instrumental error (0.93%) and good agreement with published data. Broad-range spectra, each resolving 2048 data points, provided detailed insight into the complex absorbance characteristics of diverse blood types. After consideration of photobleaching and intrinsic fluorescence, pH optodes yielded accurate recordings and resolved a sigmoidal shift of 0.03 pH units in response to changing <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> from 0 to 21 kPa. Highly resolved continuous recordings along pH gradients conformed to stepwise measurements at low rates of pH changes. In this study we showed that a diffusion chamber upgraded with a broad-range spectrophotometer and an optical pH sensor accurately characterizes oxygen binding with minimal sample consumption and manipulation. We conclude that the modified diffusion chamber is highly suitable for experimental biologists who demand high flexibility, detailed insight into oxygen binding as well as experimental and biological accuracy combined in a single setup.</p>

Functional Characterization of the <i>GUCY1A3</i> Coronary Artery Disease Risk Locus
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>A chromosomal locus at 4q32.1 has been genome-wide significantly associated with coronary artery disease risk. The locus encompasses <i>GUCY1A3</i>, which encodes the α<sub>1</sub> subunit of the soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC), a key enzyme in the nitric oxide/cGMP signaling pathway. The mechanism <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">link</span></strong>ing common variants in this region with coronary risk is not known.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Gene expression and protein expression were analyzed with quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting, respectively. Putative allele-specific transcription factors were identified with in silico analyses and validated via allele-specific quantification of antibody-precipitated chromatin fractions. Regulatory properties of the lead risk variant region were analyzed with reporter gene assays. To assess the effect of zinc finger E box-binding homeobox 1 transcription factor (ZEB1), siRNA-mediated knockdown and overexpression experiments were performed. Association of <i>GUCY1A3</i> genotype and cellular phenotypes was analyzed with vascular smooth muscle cell migration assays and platelet aggregation analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Whole-blood <i>GUCY1A3</i> mRNA levels were significantly lower in individuals homozygous for the lead (rs7692387) risk variant. Likewise, reporter gene assays demonstrated significantly lower <i>GUCY1A3</i> promoter activity for constructs carrying this allele. In silico analyses located a DNase I hypersensitivity site to rs7692387 and predicted binding of the transcription factor ZEB1 rather to the nonrisk allele, which was confirmed experimentally. Knockdown of <i>ZEB1</i> resulted in more profound reduction of nonrisk allele promoter activity and a significant reduction of endogenous <i>GUCY1A3</i> expression. Ex vivo–studied platelets from homozygous nonrisk allele carriers displayed enhanced inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation by the nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside and the phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor sildenafil compared with homozygous risk allele carriers. Moreover, pharmacological stimulation of sGC led to reduced migration only in vascular smooth muscle cells homozygous for the nonrisk allele. In the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel, higher levels of <i>GUCY1A3</i> expression correlated with less atherosclerosis in the aorta.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Rs7692387 is located in an intronic site that modulates <i>GUCY1A3</i> promoter activity. The transcription factor ZEB1 binds preferentially to the nonrisk allele, leading to an increase in <i>GUCY1A3</i> expression, higher sGC levels, and higher sGC activity after stimulation. Finally, human and mouse data <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">link</span></strong> augmented sGC expression to lower risk of atherosclerosis.</p></sec>

Upregulation of Human Endogenous Retrovirus-K Is Linked to Immunity and Inflammation in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Immune dysregulation has been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">link</span></strong>ed to occlusive vascular remodeling in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) that is hereditary, idiopathic, or associated with other conditions. Circulating autoantibodies, lung perivascular lymphoid tissue, and elevated cytokines have been related to PAH pathogenesis but without a clear understanding of how these abnormalities are initiated, perpetuated, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">connect</span></strong>ed in the progression of disease. We therefore set out to identify specific target antigens in PAH lung immune complexes as a starting point toward resolving these issues to better inform future application of immunomodulatory therapies.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Lung immune complexes were isolated and PAH target antigens were identified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, confirmed by enzyme-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">link</span></strong>ed immunosorbent assay, and localized by confocal microscopy. One PAH antigen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">link</span></strong>ed to immunity and inflammation was pursued and a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">link</span></strong> to PAH pathophysiology was investigated by next-generation sequencing, functional studies in cultured monocytes and endothelial cells, and hemodynamic and lung studies in a rat.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>SAM domain and HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1), an innate immune factor that suppresses HIV replication, was identified and confirmed as highly expressed in immune complexes from 16 hereditary and idiopathic PAH versus 12 control lungs. Elevated SAMHD1 was localized to endothelial cells, perivascular dendritic cells, and macrophages, and SAMHD1 antibodies were prevalent in tertiary lymphoid tissue. An unbiased screen using metagenomic sequencing related SAMHD1 to increased expression of human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K) in PAH versus control lungs (n=4). HERV-K envelope and deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase mRNAs were elevated in PAH versus control lungs (n=10), and proteins were localized to macrophages. HERV-K deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase induced SAMHD1 and proinflammatory cytokines (eg, interleukin 6, interleukin 1β, and tumor necrosis factor α) in circulating monocytes, pulmonary arterial endothelial cells, and also activated B cells. Vulnerability of pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (PAEC) to apoptosis was increased by HERV-K deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase in an interleukin 6-independent manner. Furthermore, 3 weekly injections of HERV-K deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase induced hemodynamic and vascular changes of pulmonary hypertension in rats (n=8) and elevated interleukin 6.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our study reveals that upregulation of the endogenous retrovirus HERV-K could both initiate and sustain activation of the immune system and cause vascular changes associated with PAH.</p></sec>

Opposing Roles of Wnt Inhibitors IGFBP-4 and Dkk1 in Cardiac Ischemia by Differential Targeting of LRP5/6 and β-catenin
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Myocardial infarction is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, triggering irreversible myocardial cell damage and heart failure. The role of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins 5 and 6 (LRP5/6) as coreceptors of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in the adult heart remain unknown. Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 4 and dickkopf-related protein 1 (Dkk1) are 2 secreted LRP5/6 binding proteins that play a crucial role in heart development through preventing Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation. However, their roles in the adult heart remain unexplored.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To understand the role of LRP5/6 and β-catenin in the adult heart, we constructed conditional cardiomyocyte-specific LRP5/6 and β-catenin knockout mice and induced surgical myocardial infarction. We also directly injected recombinant proteins of insulin-like growth factor binding protein 4 and Dkk1 into the heart immediately following myocardial infarction to further examine the mechanisms through which these proteins regulate LRP5/6 and β-catenin.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Deletion of LRP5/6 promoted cardiac ischemic insults. Conversely, deficiency of β-catenin, a downstream target of LRP5/6, was beneficial in ischemic injury. It is interesting to note that although both insulin-like growth factor binding protein 4 and Dkk1 are secreted Wnt/β-catenin pathway inhibitors, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 4 protected the ischemic heart by inhibiting β-catenin, whereas Dkk1 enhanced the injury response mainly through inducing LRP5/6 endocytosis and degradation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings reveal previously unidentified dual roles of LRP5/6 involved in the cardiomyocyte response to ischemic injury. These findings suggest new therapeutic strategies in ischemic heart disease by fine-tuning LRP5/6 and β-catenin signaling within the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.</p></sec>

Pathological α-synuclein transmission initiated by binding lymphocyte-activation gene 3
<p>Emerging evidence indicates that the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD) may be due to cell-to-cell transmission of misfolded preformed fibrils (PFF) of α-synuclein (α-syn). The mechanism by which α-syn PFF spreads from neuron to neuron is not known. Here, we show that LAG3 (lymphocyte-activation gene 3) binds α-syn PFF with high affinity (dissociation constant = 77 nanomolar), whereas the α-syn monomer exhibited minimal binding. α-Syn-biotin PFF binding to LAG3 initiated α-syn PFF endocytosis, transmission, and toxicity. Lack of LAG3 substantially delayed α-syn PFF–induced loss of dopamine neurons, as well as biochemical and behavioral deficits in vivo. The identification of LAG3 as a receptor that binds α-syn PFF provides a target for developing therapeutics designed to slow the progression of PD and related α-synucleinopathies.</p>

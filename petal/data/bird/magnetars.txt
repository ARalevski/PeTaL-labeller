Extended gamma-ray sources around pulsars constrain the origin of the positron flux at Earth
<p>The unexpectedly high flux of cosmic-ray positrons detected at Earth may originate from nearby astrophysical sources, dark matter, or unknown processes of cosmic-ray secondary production. We report the detection, using the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov Observatory (HAWC), of extended tera–electron volt gamma-ray emission coincident with the locations of two nearby middle-aged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pulsar</span></strong>s (Geminga and PSR B0656+14). The HAWC observations demonstrate that these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pulsar</span></strong>s are indeed local sources of accelerated leptons, but the measured tera–electron volt emission profile constrains the diffusion of particles away from these sources to be much slower than previously assumed. We demonstrate that the leptons emitted by these objects are therefore unlikely to be the origin of the excess positrons, which may have a more exotic origin.</p>

A Massive Pulsar in a Compact Relativistic Binary
<sec><title><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pulsar</span></strong> Tests Gravity</title><p>Because of their extremely high densities, massive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron star</span></strong>s can be used to test gravity. Based on spectroscopy of its white dwarf companion, <bold>Antoniadis <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. <ext-link>448</ext-link>) identified a millisecond <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pulsar</span></strong> as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron star</span></strong> twice as heavy as the Sun. The observed binary's orbital decay is consistent with that predicted by general relativity, ruling out previously untested strong-field phenomena predicted by alternative theories. The binary system has a peculiar combination of properties and poses a challenge to our understanding of stellar evolution.</p></sec>

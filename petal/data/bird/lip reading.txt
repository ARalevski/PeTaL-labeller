RNA Polymerase II Read-Through Promotes Expression of Neighboring Genes in SAL1-PAP-XRN Retrograde Signaling
<p>In plants, the molecular function(s) of the nucleus-localized 5′-3′ EXORIBONUCLEASES (XRNs) are unclear; however, their activity is reported to have a significant effect on gene expression and SAL1-mediated retrograde signaling. Using parallel analysis of RNA ends, we documented a dramatic increase in uncapped RNA substrates of the XRNs in both <i>sal1</i> and <i>xrn2xrn3</i> mutants. We found that a major consequence of reducing SAL1 or XRN activity was RNA Polymerase II 3′ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">read</span></strong>-through. This occurred at 72% of expressed genes, demonstrating a major genome-wide role for the XRN-torpedo model of transcription termination in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">read</span></strong>-through is speculated to have a negative effect on transcript abundance; however, we did not observe this. Rather, we identified a strong association between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">read</span></strong>-through and increased transcript abundance of tandemly orientated downstream genes, strongly correlated with the proximity (less than 1,000 bp) and expression of the upstream gene. We observed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">read</span></strong>-through in the proximity of 903 genes up-regulated in the <i>sal1-8</i> retrograde signaling mutant; thus, this phenomenon may account directly for up to 23% of genes up-regulated in <i>sal1-8</i>. Using <i>APX2</i> and <i>AT5G43770</i> as exemplars, we genetically uncoupled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">read</span></strong>-through loci from downstream genes to validate the principle of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">read</span></strong>-through-mediated mRNA regulation, providing one mechanism by which an ostensibly posttranscriptional exoribonuclease that targets uncapped RNAs could modulate gene expression.</p>

Prior experience with conspecific signals enhances auditory midbrain responsiveness to conspecific vocalizations
<p>There is a long history in neuroethology of investigating how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ation signals influence the brain and behavior. It has become increasingly clear that brain areas associated with sensory processing are plastic in adults and that this plasticity is related to reproductive condition. However, the role of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ation signal reception in adult auditory plasticity has received relatively little attention. Here, we investigated whether the reception of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ation signals (a frog chorus) could enhance the responsiveness of the auditory system to future reception of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ation signals (a single male call). We found that animals that had been exposed to 10 days of a male chorus had stronger auditory midbrain immediate early gene expression than animals that had been exposed to 10 days of random tones when tested with 30 min of male calls or 30 min of tones. Our results suggest that exposure to dynamic social stimuli, like frog choruses, may play an important role in shaping the neural and behavioral responses to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ation signals.</p>

Endothelial Dab1 signaling orchestrates neuro-glia-vessel communication in the central nervous system
<p>The architecture of the neurovascular unit (NVU) is controlled by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ation of neurons, glia, and vascular cells. We found that the neuronal guidance cue reelin possesses proangiogenic activities that ensure the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ation of endothelial cells (ECs) with the glia to control neuronal migration and the establishment of the blood-brain barrier in the mouse brain. Apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2) and Disabled1 (Dab1) expressed in ECs are required for vascularization of the retina and the cerebral cortex. Deletion of Dab1 in ECs leads to a reduced secretion of laminin-α4 and decreased activation of integrin-β1 in glial cells, which in turn control neuronal migration and barrier properties of the NVU. Thus, reelin signaling in the endothelium is an instructive and integrative cue essential for neuro-glia-vascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ation.</p>

Intercellular communication and conjugation are mediated by ESX secretion systems in mycobacteria
<p>Communal bacterial processes require intercellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ation mediated by secretion systems to coordinate appropriate molecular responses. Intercellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ation has not been described previously in mycobacteria. Here we show that the ESX secretion-system family member ESX-4 is essential for conjugal recipient activity in <i>Mycobacterium smegmatis</i>. Transcription of <i>esx4</i> genes in the recipient requires coculture with a donor strain and a functional ESX-1 apparatus in the recipient. Conversely, mutation of the donor ESX-1 apparatus amplifies the <i>esx4</i> transcriptional response in the recipient. The effect of ESX-1 on <i>esx4</i> transcription correlates with conjugal DNA transfer efficiencies. Our data show that intercellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ation via ESX-1 controls the expression of its evolutionary progenitor, ESX-4, to promote conjugation between mycobacteria.</p>

Boron-Dependent Translational Suppression of the Borate Exporter <i>BOR1</i> Contributes to the Avoidance of Boron Toxicity
<p>Boron (B) is an essential element for plants; however, as high B concentrations are toxic, B transport must be tightly regulated. BOR1 is a borate exporter in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) that facilitates B translocation into shoots under B deficiency conditions. When the B supply is sufficient, <i>BOR1</i> expression is down-regulated by selective degradation of BOR1 protein, while additional <i>BOR1</i> regulatory mechanisms are proposed to exist. In this study, we identified a novel B-dependent <i>BOR1</i> translational suppression mechanism. In vivo and in vitro reporter assays demonstrated that <i>BOR1</i> translation was reduced in a B-dependent manner and that the 5′-untranslated region was both necessary and sufficient for this process. Mutational analysis revealed that multiple upstream open <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">read</span></strong>ing frames in the 5′-untranslated region were required for <i>BOR1</i> translational suppression, and this process depended on the efficiency of translational reinitiation at the <i>BOR1</i> open <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">read</span></strong>ing frame after translation of the upstream open <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">read</span></strong>ing frames. To understand the physiological significance of <i>BOR1</i> regulation, we characterized transgenic plants defective in either one or both of the <i>BOR1</i> regulation mechanisms. <i>BOR1</i> translational suppression was induced at higher B concentrations than those triggering BOR1 degradation. Plants lacking both regulation mechanisms exhibited more severe shoot growth reduction under high-B conditions than did plants lacking BOR1 degradation alone, thus demonstrating the importance of <i>BOR1</i> translational suppression. This study demonstrates that two mechanisms of posttranscriptional <i>BOR1</i> regulation, each induced under different B concentrations, contribute to the avoidance of B toxicity in plants.</p>

Astrocyte-shed extracellular vesicles regulate the peripheral leukocyte response to inflammatory brain lesions
<p>Brain injury induces a peripheral acute cytokine response that directs the transmigration of leukocytes into the brain. Because this brain-to-peripheral immune <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ation affects patient recovery, understanding its regulation is important. Using a mouse model of inflammatory brain injury, we set out to find a soluble mediator for this phenomenon. We found that extracellular vesicles (EVs) shed from astrocytes in response to intracerebral injection of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) rapidly entered into peripheral circulation and promoted the transmigration of leukocytes through modulation of the peripheral acute cytokine response. Bioinformatic analysis of the protein and microRNA cargo of EVs identified peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor α (PPARα) as a primary molecular target of astrocyte-shed EVs. We confirmed in mice that astrocytic EVs promoted the transmigration of leukocytes into the brain by inhibiting PPARα, resulting in the increase of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activity that triggered the production of cytokines in liver. These findings expand our understanding of the mechanisms regulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ation between the brain and peripheral immune system and identify astrocytic EVs as a molecular regulator of the immunological response to inflammatory brain damage.</p>

Lipid-filled vesicles modulate macrophages
<p>Adipose (fat) tissue is a major site of energy storage that responds to fluctuations in nutrient availability to maintain systemic metabolic homeostasis (<i>1</i>). Adipocytes take up circulating free fatty acids (FFAs) from the blood and store them in lipid droplets in response to increased insulin concentrations (which occur after feeding); they then hydrolyze lipids to release FFAs under conditions of nutrient deprivation. A variety of other cell types are present within adipose tissue, including fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs). In addition to their roles in immune surveillance and clearance of cellular debris, ATMs are important for lipid buffering and regulate adipose tissue function in both healthy and diseased states (<i>2</i>). Owing to the rising global incidence of chronic obesity and associated health issues, there is renewed interest in understanding how adipose tissue functions in physiological and pathological settings. On page 989 of this issue, Flaherty <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) report that adipocytes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ate with ATMs by releasing a distinct class of extracellular vesicles (EVs) called adipocyte-derived exosomes (AdExos), which are loaded with fat and appear to be derived directly from adipocyte lipid droplets.

We identified ~17,000 fixed human-specific structural variants identifying genic and putative regulatory changes that have emerged in humans since divergence from nonhuman apes. Interestingly, these variants are enriched near genes that are down-regulated in human compared to chimpanzee cerebral organoids, particularly in cells analogous to radial glial neural progenitors.</p>

Photoperiodic control of seasonal growth is mediated by ABA acting on cell-cell communication
<p>In temperate and boreal ecosystems, seasonal cycles of growth and dormancy allow perennial plants to adapt to winter conditions. We show, in hybrid aspen trees, that photoperiodic regulation of dormancy is mechanistically distinct from autumnal growth cessation. Dormancy sets in when symplastic intercellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ation through plasmodesmata is blocked by a process dependent on the phytohormone abscisic acid. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ation blockage prevents growth-promoting signals from accessing the meristem. Thus, precocious growth is disallowed during dormancy. The dormant period, which supports robust survival of the aspen tree in winter, is due to loss of access to growth-promoting signals.</p>

RALF4/19 peptides interact with LRX proteins to control pollen tube growth in <i>Arabidopsis</i>
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ation of changes in the extracellular matrix to the interior of the cell is crucial for a cell’s function.

Behavioral learning and neuronal coding of temporal gap structure resisted song tutoring from other species: Zebra finches fostered by Bengalese finch parents learned Bengalese finch song morphology transposed onto zebra finch temporal gaps. During the vocal learning period, temporal gap neurons fired selectively to zebra finch song.

LTR_retriever: A Highly Accurate and Sensitive Program for Identification of Long Terminal Repeat Retrotransposons
<p>Long terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTR-RTs) are prevalent in plant genomes. The identification of LTR-RTs is critical for achieving high-quality gene annotation. Based on the well-conserved structure, multiple programs were developed for the de novo identification of LTR-RTs; however, these programs are associated with low specificity and high false discovery rates. Here, we report LTR_retriever, a multith<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">read</span></strong>ing-empowered Perl program that identifies LTR-RTs and generates high-quality LTR libraries from genomic sequences. LTR_retriever demonstrated significant improvements by achieving high levels of sensitivity (91%), specificity (97%), accuracy (96%), and precision (90%) in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). LTR_retriever is also compatible with long sequencing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">read</span></strong>s. With 40k self-corrected PacBio <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">read</span></strong>s equivalent to 4.5× genome coverage in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the constructed LTR library showed excellent sensitivity and specificity. In addition to canonical LTR-RTs with 5′-TG…CA-3′ termini, LTR_retriever also identifies noncanonical LTR-RTs (non-TGCA), which have been largely ignored in genome-wide studies. We identified seven types of noncanonical LTRs from 42 out of 50 plant genomes. The majority of noncanonical LTRs are <i>Copia</i> elements, with which the LTR is four times shorter than that of other <i>Copia</i> elements, which may be a result of their target specificity. Strikingly, non-TGCA <i>Copia</i> elements are often located in genic regions and preferentially insert nearby or within genes, indicating their impact on the evolution of genes and their potential as mutagenesis tools.</p>

A uORF Represses the Transcription Factor AtHB1 in Aerial Tissues to Avoid a Deleterious Phenotype
<p>AtHB1 is an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) homeodomain-leucine zipper transcription factor that participates in hypocotyl elongation under short-day conditions. Here, we show that its expression is posttranscriptionally regulated by an upstream open <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">read</span></strong>ing frame (uORF) located in its 5′ untranslated region. This uORF encodes a highly conserved peptide (CPuORF) that is present in varied monocot and dicot species. The Arabidopsis uORF and its maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) homolog repressed the translation of the main open <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">read</span></strong>ing frame in cis, independent of the sequence of the latter. Published ribosome footprinting results and the analysis of a frame-shifted uORF, in which the repression capability was lost, indicated that the uORF causes ribosome stalling. The regulation exerted by the CPuORF was tissue specific and did not act in the absence of light. Moreover, a photosynthetic signal is needed for the CPuORF action, since plants with uncoupled chloroplasts did not show uORF-dependent repression. Plants transformed with the native <i>AtHB1</i> promoter driving <i>AtHB1</i> expression did not show differential phenotypes, whereas those transformed with a construct in which the uORF was mutated exhibited serrated leaves, compact rosettes, and, most significantly, short nondehiscent anthers and siliques containing fewer or no seeds. Thus, we propose that the uncontrolled expression of <i>AtHB1</i> is deleterious for the plant and, hence, finely repressed by a translational mechanism.</p>

MILDEW RESISTANCE LOCUS O Function in Pollen Tube Reception Is Linked to Its Oligomerization and Subcellular Distribution
<p>Sexual reproduction in flowering plants requires <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ation between synergid cells and a tip-elongating pollen tube (PT) for the successful delivery of sperm cells to the embryo sac. The reception of the PT relies on signaling within the synergid cell that ultimately leads to the degeneration of the receptive synergid and PT rupture, releasing the sperm cells for double fertilization. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), NORTIA, a member of the MILDEW RESISTANCE LOCUS O (MLO) family of proteins, plays a critical role in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ation processes regulating PT reception. In this study, we determined that MLO function in PT reception is dependent on MLO protein localization into a Golgi-associated compartment before PT arrival, indicating that PT-triggered regulation of the synergid secretory system is important for synergid function during pollination. Additionally, a structure-function analysis revealed that MLO homooligomerization, mediated by the amino-terminal region of the protein, and carboxyl-terminal tail identity both contribute to MLO activity during PT reception.</p>

Similarities between Reproductive and Immune Pistil Transcriptomes of <i>Arabidopsis</i> Species

Here, we report a large-scale analysis to investigate the extent of overlap between these processes by comparing differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the pistil transcriptomes of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> and <i>Arabidopsis halleri</i> during self-pollination and interspecific pollination and during infection with <i>Fusarium graminearum</i>. In both <i>Arabidopsis</i> species, the largest number of DEGs was identified in infected pistils, where genes encoding regulators of cell division and development were most frequently down-regulated. Comparison of DEGs between infection and various pollination conditions showed that up to 79% of down-regulated genes are shared between conditions and include especially defensin-like genes. Interspecific pollination of <i>A.</i> <i>thaliana</i> significantly up-regulated thionins and defensins. The significant overrepresentation of similar groups of DEGs in the transcriptomes of reproductive and immune responses of the pistil makes it a prime system in which to study the consequences of plant-pathogen interactions on fertility and the evolution of intercellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ation in pollination.</p>

Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Frequencies of Known Haplotypes from Pooled Sequence Data

The metabolic cost of communicative sound production in bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>)
<p>Bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>) produce various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ative sounds that are important for social behavior, maintaining group cohesion and coordinating foraging. For example, whistle production increases during disturbances, such as separations of mother–calf pairs and vessel approaches. It is clear that acoustic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ation is important to the survival of these marine mammals, yet the metabolic cost of producing whistles and other socials sounds and the energetic consequences of modifying these sounds in response to both natural and anthropogenic disturbance are unknown. We used flow-through respirometry to determine whether the metabolic cost of sound production could be quantified in two captive dolphins producing social sounds (whistles and squawks). On average, we found that metabolic rates measured during 2 min periods of sound production were 1.2 times resting values. Up to 7 min were required for metabolism to return to resting values following vocal periods. The total metabolic cost (over resting values) of the 2 min vocal period plus the required recovery period (163.3 to 2995.9 ml O<sub>2</sub> or 3279.6 to 60,166.7 J) varied by individual as well as by mean duration of sounds produced within the vocal period. Observed variation in received cumulative sound energy levels of vocalizations was not related to total metabolic costs. Furthermore, our empirical findings did not agree with previous theoretical estimates of the metabolic cost of whistles. This study provides the first empirical data on the metabolic cost of sound production in dolphins, which can be used to estimate metabolic costs of vocal responses to environmental perturbations in wild dolphins.</p>

Cylindrical Inclusion Protein of Turnip Mosaic Virus Serves as a Docking Point for the Intercellular Movement of Viral Replication Vesicles
<p>Plant viruses move from the initially infected cell to adjacent cells through plasmodesmata (PDs). To do so, viruses encode dedicated protein(s) that facilitate this process. How viral proteins act together to support the intercellular movement of viruses is poorly defined. Here, by using an infection-free intercellular vesicle movement assay, we investigate the action of CI (cylindrical inclusion) and P3N-PIPO (amino-terminal half of P3 fused to Pretty Interesting Potyviridae open <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">read</span></strong>ing frame), the two PD-localized potyviral proteins encoded by <i>Turnip mosaic virus</i> (TuMV), in the intercellular movement of the viral replication vesicles. We provide evidence that CI and P3N-PIPO are sufficient to support the PD targeting and intercellular movement of TuMV replication vesicles induced by 6K2, a viral protein responsible for the generation of replication vesicles. 6K2 interacts with CI but not P3N-PIPO. When this interaction is impaired, the intercellular movement of TuMV replication vesicles is inhibited. Furthermore, in transmission electron microscopy, vesicular structures are observed in connection with the cylindrical inclusion bodies at structurally modified PDs in cells coexpressing 6K2, CI, and P3N-PIPO. CI is directed to PDs through its interaction with P3N-PIPO. We hypothesize that CI serves as a docking point for PD targeting and the intercellular movement of TuMV replication vesicles. This work contributes to a better understanding of the roles of different viral proteins in coordinating the intercellular movement of viral replication vesicles.</p>

Cytological and Transcriptomic Analyses Reveal Important Roles of <i>CLE19</i> in Pollen Exine Formation
<p>The CLAVATA3/ESR-RELATED (CLE) peptide signals are required for cell-cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ation in several plant growth and developmental processes. However, little is known regarding the possible functions of the CLEs in the anther. Here, we show that a T-DNA insertional mutant, and dominant-negative (DN) and overexpression (OX) transgenic plants of the <i>CLE19</i> gene, exhibited significantly reduced anther size and pollen grain number and abnormal pollen wall formation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Interestingly, the <i>DN</i>-<i>CLE19</i> pollen grains showed a more extensively covered surface, but <i>CLE19-OX</i> pollen exine exhibited clearly missing connections in the network and lacked separation between areas that normally form the lacunae. With a combination of cell biological, genetic, and transcriptomic analyses on <i>cle19</i>, <i>DN</i>-<i>CLE19</i>, and <i>CLE19-OX</i> plants, we demonstrated that <i>CLE19-OX</i> plants produced highly vacuolated and swollen <i>aborted microspores</i> (<i>ams</i>)-like tapetal cells, lacked lipidic tapetosomes and elaioplasts, and had abnormal pollen primexine without obvious accumulation of sporopollenin precursors. Moreover, <i>CLE19</i> is important for the normal expression of more than 1,000 genes, including the transcription factor gene <i>AMS</i>, 280 <i>AMS</i>-downstream genes, and other genes involved in pollen coat and pollen exine formation, lipid metabolism, pollen germination, and hormone metabolism. In addition, the <i>DN-CLE19(+/+) ams(−/−)</i> plants exhibited the <i>ams</i> anther phenotype and <i>ams(+/−)</i> partially suppressed the <i>DN-CLE19</i> transgene-induced pollen exine defects. These findings demonstrate that the proper amount of CLE19 signal is essential for the normal expression of <i>AMS</i> and its downstream gene networks in the regulation of anther development and pollen exine formation.</p>

A Histone Code Reader and a Transcriptional Activator Interact to Regulate Genes for Salt Tolerance
<p>Plant homeodomain (PHD) finger proteins are involved in various developmental processes and stress responses. They recognize and bind to epigenetically modified histone H3 tail and function as histone code <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">read</span></strong>ers. Here we report that GmPHD6 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">read</span></strong>s low methylated histone H3K4me0/1/2 but not H3K4me3 with its N-terminal domain instead of the PHD finger. GmPHD6 does not possess transcriptional regulatory ability but has DNA-binding ability. Through the PHD finger, GmPHD6 interacts with its coactivator, LHP1-1/2, to form a transcriptional activation complex. Using a transgenic hairy root system, we demonstrate that overexpression of <i>GmPHD6</i> improves stress tolerance in soybean (<i>Glycine</i> <i>max</i>) plants. Knocking down the <i>LHP1</i> expression disrupts this role of <i>GmPHD6</i>, indicating that GmPHD6 requires LHP1 functions during stress response. GmPHD6 influences expression of dozens of stress-related genes. Among these, we identified three targets of GmPHD6, including ABA-stress-ripening-induced <i>CYP75B1</i> and <i>CYP82C4</i>. Overexpression of each gene confers stress tolerance in soybean plants. GmPHD6 is recruited to H3K4me0/1/2 marks and recognizes the G-rich elements in target gene promoters, whereas LHP1 activates expression of these targets. Our study reveals a mechanism involving two partners in a complex. Manipulation of the genes in this pathway should improve stress tolerance in soybean or other legumes/crops.</p>

Cell-Fate Specification in Arabidopsis Roots Requires Coordinative Action of Lineage Instruction and Positional Reprogramming
<p>Tissue organization and pattern formation within a multicellular organism rely on coordinated cell division and cell-fate determination. In animals, cell fates are mainly determined by a cell lineage-dependent mechanism, whereas in plants, positional information is thought to be the primary determinant of cell fates. However, our understanding of cell-fate regulation in plants mostly relies on the histological and anatomical studies on Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) roots, which contain a single layer of each cell type in nonvascular tissues. Here, we investigate the dynamic cell-fate acquisition in modified Arabidopsis roots with additional cell layers that are artificially generated by the misexpression of <i>SHORT-ROOT</i> (<i>SHR</i>). We found that cell-fate determination in Arabidopsis roots is a dimorphic cascade with lineage inheritance dominant in the early stage of pattern formation. The inherited cell identity can subsequently be removed or modified by positional information. The instruction of cell-fate conversion is not a fast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">read</span></strong>out during root development. The final identity of a cell type is determined by the synergistic contribution from multiple layers of regulation, including symplastic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ation across tissues. Our findings underline the collaborative inputs during cell-fate instruction.</p>

Efficient Plastid Transformation in Arabidopsis
<p>Plastid transformation is routine in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) but 100-fold less frequent in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), preventing its use in plastid biology. A recent study revealed that null mutations in <i>ACC2</i>, encoding a plastid-targeted acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase, cause hypersensitivity to spectinomycin. We hypothesized that plastid transformation efficiency should increase in the <i>acc2</i> background, because when ACC2 is absent, fatty acid biosynthesis becomes dependent on translation of the plastid-encoded ACC β-carboxylase subunit. We bombarded <i>ACC2</i>-defective Arabidopsis leaves with a vector carrying a selectable spectinomycin resistance (<i>aadA</i>) gene and <i>gfp</i>, encoding the green fluorescence protein GFP. Spectinomycin-resistant clones were identified as green cell clusters on a spectinomycin medium. Plastid transformation was confirmed by GFP accumulation from the second open <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">read</span></strong>ing frame of a polycistronic messenger RNA, which would not be translated in the cytoplasm. We obtained one to two plastid transformation events per bombarded sample in spectinomycin-hypersensitive Slavice and Columbia <i>acc2</i> knockout backgrounds, an approximately 100-fold enhanced plastid transformation frequency. Slavice and Columbia are accessions in which plant regeneration is uncharacterized or difficult to obtain. A practical system for Arabidopsis plastid transformation will be obtained by creating an <i>ACC2</i> null background in a regenerable Arabidopsis accession. The recognition that the duplicated ACCase in Arabidopsis is an impediment to plastid transformation provides a rational template to implement plastid transformation in related recalcitrant crops.</p>

Drought-Enhanced Xylem Sap Sulfate Closes Stomata by Affecting ALMT12 and Guard Cell ABA Synthesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Water limitation of plants causes stomatal closure to prevent water loss by transpiration. For this purpose, progressing soil water deficit is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ated from roots to shoots. Abscisic acid (ABA) is the key signal in stress-induced stomatal closure, but ABA as an early xylem-delivered signal is still a matter of debate. In this study, poplar plants (<i>Populus × canescens</i>) were exposed to water stress to investigate xylem sap sulfate and ABA, stomatal conductance, and sulfate transporter (<i>SULTR</i>) expression. In addition, stomatal behavior and expression of ABA receptors, drought-responsive genes, transcription factors, and <i>NCED3</i> were studied after feeding sulfate and ABA to detached poplar leaves and epidermal peels of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The results show that increased xylem sap sulfate is achieved upon drought by reduced xylem unloading by PtaSULTR3;3a and PtaSULTR1;1, and by enhanced loading from parenchyma cells into the xylem via PtaALMT3b. Sulfate application caused stomatal closure in excised leaves and peeled epidermis. In the loss of sulfate-channel function mutant, At<i>almt12</i>, sulfate-triggered stomatal closure was impaired. The QUAC1/ALMT12 anion channel heterologous expressed in oocytes was gated open by extracellular sulfate. Sulfate up-regulated the expression of <i>NCED3</i>, a key step of ABA synthesis, in guard cells. In conclusion, xylem-derived sulfate seems to be a chemical signal of drought that induces stomatal closure via QUAC1/ALMT12 and/or guard cell ABA synthesis.</p>

ZRF1 Chromatin Regulators Have Polycomb Silencing and Independent Roles in Development
<p>Histone H2A monoubiquitination (H2Aub1), catalyzed by Polycomb-Repressive Complex1 (PRC1), is a key epigenetic mark in Polycomb silencing. However, little is known about how H2Aub1 is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">read</span></strong> to exert downstream physiological functions. The animal ZUOTIN-RELATED FACTOR1 (ZRF1) has been reported to bind H2Aub1 to promote or repress the expression of varied target genes. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) ZRF1 homologs, AtZRF1a and AtZRF1b, are key regulators of multiple processes during plant growth and development. Loss of function of both <i>AtZRF1a</i> and <i>AtZRF1b</i> in <i>atzrf1a atzrf1b</i> mutants causes seed germination delay, small plant size, abnormal meristem activity, abnormal flower development, as well as gametophyte transmission and embryogenesis defects. Some of these defects overlap with those described previously in the PRC1-defective mutants <i>atbmi1a atbmi1b</i> and <i>atring1a atring1b</i>, but others are specific to <i>atzrf1a atzrf1b</i>. In line with this, 4,519 genes (representing more than 14% of all genes) within the Arabidopsis genome are found differentially expressed in <i>atzrf1a atzrf1b</i> seedlings, and among them, 114 genes are commonly up-regulated in <i>atring1a atring1b</i> and <i>atbmi1a atbmi1b</i>. Finally, we show that in both <i>atzrf1a atzrf1b</i> and <i>atbmi1a atbmi1b</i> seedlings, the seed developmental genes <i>ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE3</i>, <i>CRUCIFERIN3</i>, and <i>CHOTTO1</i> are derepressed, in association with the reduced levels of H2Aub1 and histone H3 lysine-27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). Collectively, our results indicate that <i>AtZRF1a/b</i> play both PRC1-related and PRC1-unrelated functions in regulating plant growth and development and that <i>AtZRF1a/b</i> promote H2Aub1 and H3K27me3 deposition in gene suppression. Our work provides novel insight into the mechanisms of function of this family of evolutionarily conserved chromatin regulators.</p>

Rapid Functional and Sequence Differentiation of a Tandemly Repeated Species-Specific Multigene Family in <i>Drosophila</i>
<p>Gene clusters of recently duplicated genes are hotbeds for evolutionary change. However, our understanding of how mutational mechanisms and evolutionary forces shape the structural and functional evolution of these clusters is hindered by the high sequence identity among the copies, which typically results in their inaccurate representation in genome assemblies. The presumed testis-specific, chimeric gene <i>Sdic</i> originated, and tandemly expanded in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, contributing to increased male-male competition. Using various types of massively parallel sequencing data, we studied the organization, sequence evolution, and functional attributes of the different <i>Sdic</i> copies. By leveraging long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">read</span></strong> sequencing data, we uncovered both copy number and order differences from the currently accepted annotation for the <i>Sdic</i> region. Despite evidence for pervasive gene conversion affecting the <i>Sdic</i> copies, we also detected signatures of two episodes of diversifying selection, which have contributed to the evolution of a variety of C-termini and miRNA binding site compositions. Expression analyses involving RNA-seq datasets from 59 different biological conditions revealed distinctive expression b<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">read</span></strong>ths among the copies, with three copies being transcribed in females, opening the possibility to a sexually antagonistic effect. Phenotypic assays using <i>Sdic</i> knock-out strains indicated that should this antagonistic effect exist, it does not compromise female fertility. Our results strongly suggest that the genome consolidation of the <i>Sdic</i> gene cluster is more the result of a quick exploration of different paths of molecular tinkering by different copies than a mere dosage increase, which could be a recurrent evolutionary outcome in the presence of persistent sexual selection.</p>

Reconstruction of Haplotype-Blocks Selected during Experimental Evolution
<p>The genetic analysis of experimentally evolving populations typically relies on short <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">read</span></strong>s from pooled individuals (Pool-Seq). While this method provides reliable allele frequency estimates, the underlying haplotype structure remains poorly characterized. With small population sizes and adaptive variants that start from low frequencies, the interpretation of selection signatures in most Evolve and Resequencing studies remains challenging. To facilitate the characterization of selection targets, we propose a new approach that reconstructs selected haplotypes from replicated time series, using Pool-Seq data. We identify selected haplotypes through the correlated frequencies of alleles carried by them. Computer simulations indicate that selected haplotype-blocks of several Mb can be reconstructed with high confidence and low error rates, even when allele frequencies change only by 20% across three replicates. Applying this method to real data from <i>D. melanogaster</i> populations adapting to a hot environment, we identify a selected haplotype-block of 6.93 Mb. We confirm the presence of this haplotype-block in evolved populations by experimental haplotyping, demonstrating the power and accuracy of our haplotype reconstruction from Pool-Seq data. We propose that the combination of allele frequency estimates with haplotype information will provide the key to understanding the dynamics of adaptive alleles.</p>

Genome-Wide Analysis of Selection on the Malaria Parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> in West African Populations of Differing Infection Endemicity
<p>Locally varying selection on pathogens may be due to differences in drug pressure, host immunity, transmission opportunities between hosts, or the intensity of between-genotype competition within hosts. Highly recombining populations of the human malaria parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> throughout West Africa are closely related, as gene flow is relatively unrestricted in this endemic region, but markedly varying ecology and transmission intensity should cause distinct local selective pressures. Genome-wide analysis of sequence variation was undertaken on a sample of 100 <i>P. falciparum</i> clinical isolates from a highly endemic region of the Republic of Guinea where transmission occurs for most of each year and compared with data from 52 clinical isolates from a previously sampled population from The Gambia, where there is relatively limited seasonal malaria transmission. Paired-end short-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">read</span></strong> sequences were mapped against the 3D7 <i>P. falciparum</i> reference genome sequence, and data on 136,144 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were obtained. Within-population analyses identifying loci showing evidence of recent positive directional selection and balancing selection confirm that antimalarial drugs and host immunity have been major selective agents. Many of the signatures of recent directional selection reflected by standardized integrated haplotype scores were population specific, including differences at drug resistance loci due to historically different antimalarial use between the countries. In contrast, both populations showed a similar set of loci likely to be under balancing selection as indicated by very high Tajima’s <i>D</i> values, including a significant overrepresentation of genes expressed at the merozoite stage that invades erythrocytes and several previously validated targets of acquired immunity. Between-population <i>F</i><sub>ST</sub> analysis identified exceptional differentiation of allele frequencies at a small number of loci, most markedly for five SNPs covering a 15-kb region within and flanking the <i>gdv1</i> gene that regulates the early stages of gametocyte development, which is likely related to the extreme differences in mosquito vector abundance and seasonality that determine the transmission opportunities for the sexual stage of the parasite.</p>

The Evolution of Genes within Genes and the Control of DNA Replication in Microviruses
<p>Single-stranded DNA(ssDNA) viral life cycles must balance double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and ssDNA biosynthesis. Previously published in vitro results suggest that microvirus C and host cell SSB proteins play antagonistic roles to achieve this balance. To investigate this in vivo, microvirus DNA replication was characterized in cells expressing cloned C or <i>ssb</i> genes, which would presumably alter the C:SSB protein ratios. Representatives of each microvirus clade (φX174, G4, and α3) were used in these studies. α3 DNA replication was significantly more complex. Results suggested that the recognized α3 C gene (C<sub>S</sub>: small) is one of two C genes. A larger 5′ extended gene could be translated from an upstream GTG start codon (C<sub>B</sub>: big). Wild-type α3 acquired resistance to elevated SSB levels by mutations that exclusively frameshifted the C<sub>B</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">read</span></strong>ing frame, whereas mutations in the origin of replication conferred resistance to elevated C protein levels. Expression of either the cloned C<sub>B</sub> or C<sub>S</sub> gene complemented <i>am(C)</i> mutants, demonstrating functional redundancy. When the C<sub>S</sub> start codon was eliminated, strains were only viable if an additional amber mutation was placed in gene C and propagated in an informational suppressing host. Thus, C<sub>B</sub> protein likely reaches toxic levels in the absence of C<sub>S</sub> translation. This phenomenon may have driven the evolution of the C<sub>S</sub> gene within the larger C<sub>B</sub> gene and could constitute a unique mechanism of regulation. Furthermore, cross-complementation data suggested that interactions between the α3 C and other viral proteins have evolved enough specificity to biochemically isolate its DNA replication from G4 and φX174.</p>

Moving without a purpose: an experimental study of swarm guidance in the Western honey bee, <i>Apis mellifera</i>
<p>During reproductive swarming, honey bee scouts perform two very important functions. Firstly, they find new nesting locations and return to the swarm cluster to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ate their discoveries. Secondly, once the swarm is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">read</span></strong>y to depart, informed scout bees act as guides, leading the swarm to its final destination. We have previously hypothesised that the two processes, selecting a new nest site and swarm guidance, are tightly linked in honey bees. When swarms can be <i>laissez faire</i> about where they nest, reaching directional consensus prior to lift off seems unnecessary. If, in contrast, it is essential that the swarm reaches a precise location, either directional consensus must be near unanimous prior to swarm departure or only a select subgroup of the scouts guide the swarm. Here, we tested experimentally whether directional consensus is necessary for the successful guidance of swarms of the Western honey bee <i>Apis mellifera</i> by forcing swarms into the air prior to the completion of the decision-making process. Our results show that swarms were unable to guide themselves prior to the swarm reaching the pre-flight buzzing phase of the decision-making process, even when directional consensus was high. We therefore suggest that not all scouts involved in the decision-making process attempt to guide the swarm.</p>

Vocal production complexity correlates with neural instructions in the oyster toadfish (<i>Opsanus tau</i>)
<p>Sound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ation is fundamental to many social interactions and essential to courtship and agonistic behaviours in many vertebrates. The swimbladder and associated muscles in batrachoidid fishes (midshipman and toadfish) is a unique vertebrate sound production system, wherein fundamental frequencies are determined directly by the firing rate of a vocal-acoustic neural network that drives the contraction frequency of superfast swimbladder muscles. The oyster toadfish boatwhistle call starts with an irregular sound waveform that could be an emergent property of the peripheral nonlinear sound-producing system or reflect complex encoding in the central nervous system. Here, we demonstrate that the start of the boatwhistle is indicative of a chaotic strange attractor, and tested whether its origin lies in the peripheral sound-producing system or in the vocal motor network. We recorded sound and swimbladder muscle activity in awake, freely behaving toadfish during motor nerve stimulation, and recorded sound, motor nerve and muscle activity during spontaneous grunts. The results show that rhythmic motor volleys do not cause complex sound signals. However, arrhythmic recruitment of swimbladder muscle during spontaneous grunts correlates with complex sounds. This supports the hypothesis that the irregular start of the boatwhistle is encoded in the vocal pre-motor neural network, and not caused by peripheral interactions with the sound-producing system. We suggest that sound production system demands across vocal tetrapods have selected for muscles and motorneurons adapted for speed, which can execute complex neural instructions into equivalently complex vocalisations.</p>

There were five men with a mean age of 50.2 years (33   to 68) and a mean follow-up of 3.8 years (0.8 to 6). Case history,   physical examination, imaging, and intraoperative findings were   reviewed. The outcomes of interest were ultrasound and/or MRI features   of mICG, as well as the clinical outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The five intraneural cysts followed the principles of the unifying   articular theory. Connection to the posterior subtalar joint (pSTJ)   was identified or suspected in four patients. Re-evaluation of preoperative   MRI demonstrated a degenerative pSTJ and denervation changes in   the abductor hallucis in all patients. Cyst excision with resection   of the articular branch (four), cyst incision and drainage (one),   and percutaneous aspiration/steroid injection (two) were performed.   Removing the connection to the pSTJ prevented recurrence of mIGC,   whereas medial plantar nerves remained cystic and symptomatic when   resection of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ating articular branch was not performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our findings support a standardized treatment algorithm for mIGC   in the presence of degenerative disease at the pSTJ. By understanding   the pathoanatomic mechanism for every cyst, we can improve treatment   that must address the articular branch to avoid the recurrence of   intraneural ganglion cysts, as well as the degenerative pSTJ to   avoid extraneural cyst formation or recurrence.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:183–9.</p></sec>

Ultra-deep sequencing of ribosome-associated poly-adenylated RNA in early <i>Drosophila</i> embryos reveals hundreds of conserved translated sORFs
<p>There is growing recognition that small open <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">read</span></strong>ing frames (sORFs) encoding peptides shorter than 100 amino acids are an important class of functional elements in the eukaryotic genome, with several al<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">read</span></strong>y identified to play critical roles in growth, development, and disease. However, our understanding of their biological importance has been hindered owing to the significant technical challenges limiting their annotation. Here we combined ultra-deep sequencing of ribosome-associated poly-adenylated RNAs with rigorous conservation analysis to identify a comprehensive population of translated sORFs during early <i>Drosophila</i> embryogenesis. In total, we identify 399 sORFs, including those previously annotated but without evidence of translational capacity, those found within transcripts previously classified as non-coding, and those not previously known to be transcribed. Further, we find, for the first time, evidence for translation of many sORFs with different isoforms, suggesting their regulation is as complex as longer ORFs. Furthermore, many sORFs are found not associated with ribosomes in late-stage <i>Drosophila</i> S2 cells, suggesting that many of the translated sORFs may have stage-specific functions during embryogenesis. These results thus provide the first comprehensive annotation of the sORFs present during early <i>Drosophila</i> embryogenesis, a necessary basis for a detailed delineation of their function in embryogenesis and other biological processes.</p>

Functional and histopathological identification of the respiratory failure in a DMSXL transgenic mouse model of myotonic dystrophy
<p>Acute and chronic respiratory failure is one of the major and potentially life-threatening features in individuals with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). Despite several clinical demonstrations showing respiratory problems in DM1 patients, the mechanisms are still not completely understood. This study was designed to investigate whether the DMSXL transgenic mouse model for DM1 exhibits respiratory disorders and, if so, to identify the pathological changes underlying these respiratory problems. Using pressure plethysmography, we assessed the breathing function in control mice and DMSXL mice generated after large expansions of the CTG repeat in successive generations of DM1 transgenic mice. Statistical analysis of breathing function measurements revealed a significant decrease in the most relevant respiratory parameters in DMSXL mice, indicating impaired respiratory function. Histological and morphometric analysis showed pathological changes in diaphragmatic muscle of DMSXL mice, characterized by an increase in the percentage of type I muscle fibers, the presence of central nuclei, partial denervation of end-plates (EPs) and a significant reduction in their size, shape complexity and density of acetylcholine receptors, all of which reflect a possible breakdown in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ation between the diaphragmatic muscles fibers and the nerve terminals. Diaphragm muscle abnormalities were accompanied by an accumulation of mutant DMPK RNA foci in muscle fiber nuclei. Moreover, in DMSXL mice, the unmyelinated phrenic afferents are significantly lower. Also in these mice, significant neuronopathy was not detected in either cervical phrenic motor neurons or brainstem respiratory neurons. Because EPs are involved in the transmission of action potentials and the unmyelinated phrenic afferents exert a modulating influence on the respiratory drive, the pathological alterations affecting these structures might underlie the respiratory impairment detected in DMSXL mice. Understanding mechanisms of respiratory deficiency should guide pharmaceutical and clinical research towards better therapy for the respiratory deficits associated with DM1.</p>

VPS13A is closely associated with mitochondria and is required for efficient lysosomal degradation
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> VPS13A, which is implicated in chorea-acanthocytosis, is essential for efficient lysosomal degradation, while localized in close association with mitochondria. We propose that inter-organelle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ation may be relevant in the pathogenesis of the disease.</p>

Seismic constraints on caldera dynamics from the 2015 Axial Seamount eruption
<p>Seismic observations in volcanically active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caldera</span></strong>s are challenging. A new cabled observatory atop Axial Seamount on the Juan de Fuca ridge allows unprecedented real-time monitoring of a submarine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caldera</span></strong>. Beginning on 24 April 2015, the seismic network captured an eruption that culminated in explosive acoustic signals where <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lava</span></strong> erupted on the seafloor. Extensive seismic activity preceding the eruption shows that inflation is accommodated by the reactivation of an outward-dipping <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caldera</span></strong> ring fault, with strong tidal triggering indicating a critically stressed system. The ring fault accommodated deflation during the eruption and provided a pathway for a dike that propagated south and north beneath the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caldera</span></strong>’s east wall. Once north of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caldera</span></strong>, the eruption stepped westward, and a dike propagated along the extensional north rift.</p>

Ecophysiological responses of <i>Betula pendula</i>, <i>Pinus uncinata</i> and <i>Rhododendron ferrugineum</i> in the Catalan Pyrenees to low summer rainfall
<p>Climate change is producing modifications in the intensity and frequency of rainfall in some regions of the planet. According to predictions, annual rainfall distribution in Western Europe will result in an increase in episodes of drought, thereby negatively affecting nutrient availability. Since high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mountain</span></strong> systems will be particularly vulnerable, the physiological and nutritional responses to changes in summer rainfall were monitored over the course of two consecutive summers on three species, which are representative of subalpine forests: birch (<i>Betula pendula</i> Roth.), rhododendron (<i>Rhododendron ferrugineum</i> L.) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mountain</span></strong> pine (<i>Pinus uncinata</i> Mill.). Birch was especially susceptible to scarce precipitation showing alterations in leaf morphology and a decline in net photosynthesis (<i>A</i>) due to stomatal closure, which led to photoinhibition and to early leaf senescence as shown by the photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency (PNUE), carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio, foliar N and <sup>13</sup>C isotope discrimination (Δ<sup>13</sup>C) results. The Δ<sup>13</sup>C of the soluble fraction is a good estimator of intrinsic water-use efficiency in this species. Rhododendron and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mountain</span></strong> pine had sclerophyllous leaves, as indicated by leaf mass per area, Δ<sup>13</sup>C, PNUE and C/N results. Rhododendron was particularly affected by short periods of scarce rainfall, which negatively affected gas exchange and photochemistry, and reduced the remobilization of leaf N and P. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mountain</span></strong> pine was the most tolerant species since alterations of gas exchange, photochemistry and Δ<sup>13</sup>C were not observed. Its highest investment of N in RuBisCo and highest potassium, iron and magnesium leaf concentration contributed to the highest <i>A</i> rates observed.</p>

The 2018 rift eruption and summit collapse of Kīlauea Volcano
<p>In 2018, Kīlauea Volcano experienced its largest lower East Rift Zone (LERZ) eruption and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caldera</span></strong> collapse in at least 200 years. After collapse of the Pu‘u ‘Ō‘ō vent on 30 April, magma propagated downrift. Eruptive fissures opened in the LERZ on 3 May, eventually extending ~6.8 kilometers. A 4 May earthquake [moment magnitude (<i>M</i><sub>w</sub>) 6.9] produced ~5 meters of fault slip. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lava</span></strong> erupted at rates exceeding 100 cubic meters per second, eventually covering 35.5 square kilometers. The summit magma system partially drained, producing minor explosions and near-daily collapses releasing energy equivalent to <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> 4.7 to 5.4 earthquakes. Activity declined rapidly on 4 August. Summit collapse and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lava</span></strong> flow volume estimates are roughly equivalent—about 0.8 cubic kilometers. Careful historical observation and monitoring of Kīlauea enabled successful forecasting of hazardous events.</p>

Coseismic rupturing stopped by Aso volcano during the 2016 <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> 7.1 Kumamoto earthquake, Japan
<p>Field investigations and seismic data show that the 16 April 2016 moment magnitude (<i>M</i><sub>w</sub>) 7.1 Kumamoto earthquake produced a ~40-kilometer-long surface rupture zone along the northeast-southwest–striking Hinagu-Futagawa strike-slip fault zone and newly identified faults on the western side of Aso <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caldera</span></strong>, Kyushu Island, Japan. The coseismic surface ruptures cut Aso <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caldera</span></strong>, including two volcanic cones inside it, but terminate therein. The data show that northeastward propagation of coseismic rupturing terminated in Aso <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caldera</span></strong> because of the presence of magma beneath the Aso volcanic cluster. The seismogenic faults of the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake may require reassessment of the volcanic hazard in the vicinity of Aso <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volcano</span></strong>.</p>

Microbial oxidation of lithospheric organic carbon in rapidly eroding tropical mountain soils
<p>Lithospheric organic carbon (“petrogenic”; OC<sub>petro</sub>) is oxidized during exhumation and subsequent erosion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mountain</span></strong> ranges. This process is a considerable source of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) to the atmosphere over geologic time scales, but the mechanisms that govern oxidation rates in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mountain</span></strong> landscapes are poorly constrained. We demonstrate that, on average, 67 ± 11% of the OC<sub>petro</sub> initially present in bedrock exhumed from the tropical, rapidly eroding Central Range of Taiwan is oxidized in soils, leading to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of 6.1 to 18.6 metric tons of carbon per square kilometer per year. The molecular and isotopic evolution of bulk OC and lipid biomarkers during soil formation reveals that OC<sub>petro</sub> remineralization is microbially mediated. Rapid oxidation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mountain</span></strong> soils drives CO<sub>2</sub> emission fluxes that increase with erosion rate, thereby counteracting CO<sub>2</sub> drawdown by silicate weathering and biospheric OC burial.</p>

U-Pb constraints on pulsed eruption of the Deccan Traps across the end-Cretaceous mass extinction
<p>Temporal correlation between some continental flood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">basalt</span></strong> eruptions and mass extinctions has been proposed to indicate causality, with eruptive volatile release driving environmental degradation and extinction. We tested this model for the Deccan Traps flood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">basalt</span></strong> province, which, along with the Chicxulub bolide impact, is implicated in the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) extinction approximately 66 million years ago. We estimated Deccan eruption rates with uranium-lead (U-Pb) zircon geochronology and resolved four high-volume eruptive periods. According to this model, maximum eruption rates occurred before and after the K-Pg extinction, with one such pulse initiating tens of thousands of years prior to both the bolide impact and extinction. These findings support extinction models that incorporate both catastrophic events as drivers of environmental deterioration associated with the K-Pg extinction and its aftermath.</p>

Volcanic tremor and plume height hysteresis from Pavlof Volcano, Alaska
<p>The March 2016 eruption of Pavlof <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volcano</span></strong>, Alaska, produced an ash plume that caused the cancellation of more than 100 flights in North America. The eruption generated strong tremor that was recorded by seismic and remote low-frequency acoustic (infrasound) stations, including the EarthScope Transportable Array. The relationship between the tremor amplitudes and plume height changes considerably between the waxing and waning portions of the eruption. Similar hysteresis has been observed between seismic river noise and discharge during storms, suggesting that flow and erosional processes in both rivers and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volcano</span></strong>es can produce irreversible structural changes that are detectable in geophysical data. We propose that the time-varying relationship at Pavlof arose from changes in the tremor source related to volcanic vent erosion. This relationship may improve estimates of volcanic emissions and characterization of eruption size and intensity.</p>

Inflation-predictable behavior and co-eruption deformation at Axial Seamount
<p>Deformation of the ground surface at active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volcano</span></strong>es provides information about magma movements at depth. Improved seafloor deformation measurements between 2011 and 2015 documented a fourfold increase in magma supply and confirmed that Axial Seamount’s eruptive behavior is inflation-predictable, probably triggered by a critical level of magmatic pressure. A 2015 eruption was successfully forecast on the basis of this deformation pattern and marked the first time that deflation and tilt were captured in real time by a new seafloor cabled observatory, revealing the timing, location, and volume of eruption-related magma movements. Improved modeling of the deformation suggests a steeply dipping prolate-spheroid pressure source beneath the eastern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caldera</span></strong> that is consistent with the location of the zone of highest melt within the sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caldera</span></strong> magma reservoir determined from multichannel seismic results.</p>

The analysis of synovial fluid in total knee arthroplasties with flexion instability
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Patients with flexion instability after total knee arthroplasty   (TKA) often present with a recurrent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effus</span></strong>ion, which may be a haemarthrosis.

A 90,000-year record of Afromontane forest responses to climate change
<p>Pollen records from African highlands are scarce; hence, the paleoecology of the Afromontane forest and its responses to glacial cycles are poorly known. Lake Bambili (Cameroon) provides a record of vegetation changes in the tropical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mountain</span></strong>s of Africa over the past 90,000 years, with high temporal resolution. Pollen data and biome reconstructions show a diverging response of forests to climate changes; the upper tree line was extremely unstable, shifting substantially in response to glacial-interglacial climate alternation, whereas the transition between the montane and lowland forests remained remarkably stable. Such ecological instability may have had a critical influence on species richness in the Afromontane forests.</p>

Friction at the bed does not control fast glacier flow
<p>The largest uncertainty in the ice sheet models used to predict future sea level rise originates from our limited understanding of processes at the ice/bed interface. Near glacier termini, where basal sliding controls ice flow, most predictive ice sheet models use a parameterization of sliding that has been theoretically derived for glacier flow over a hard bed. We find that this sliding relation does not apply to the 140 Greenland glaciers that we analyzed. There is no relationship between basal sliding and frictional stress at the glacier bed, contrary to theoretical predictions. There is a strong relationship between sliding speed and net pressure at the glacier bed. This latter finding is in agreement with earlier observations of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mountain</span></strong> glaciers that have been largely overlooked by the glaciological community.</p>

Dunes on Pluto
<p>The surface of Pluto is more geologically diverse and dynamic than had been expected, but the role of its tenuous atmosphere in shaping the landscape remains unclear. We describe observations from the New Horizons spacecraft of regularly spaced, linear ridges whose morphology, distribution, and orientation are consistent with being transverse dunes. These are located close to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mountain</span></strong>ous regions and are orthogonal to nearby wind streaks. We demonstrate that the wavelength of the dunes (~0.4 to 1 kilometer) is best explained by the deposition of sand-sized (~200 to ~300 micrometer) particles of methane ice in moderate winds (<10 meters per second). The undisturbed morphology of the dunes, and relationships with the underlying convective glacial ice, imply that the dunes have formed in the very recent geological past.</p>

Spaceborne detection of localized carbon dioxide sources
<p>Spaceborne measurements by NASA’s Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) at the kilometer scale reveal distinct structures of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) caused by known anthropogenic and natural point sources. OCO-2 transects across the Los Angeles megacity (USA) show that anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> enhancements peak over the urban core and decrease through suburban areas to rural background values more than ~100 kilometers away, varying seasonally from ~4.4 to 6.1 parts per million. A transect passing directly downwind of the persistent isolated natural CO<sub>2</sub> plume from Yasur <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volcano</span></strong> (Vanuatu) shows a narrow filament of enhanced CO<sub>2</sub> values (~3.4 parts per million), consistent with a CO<sub>2</sub> point source emitting 41.6 kilotons per day.

‘Supergenes’ drive evolution
<p>Male ruffs, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mountain</span></strong> honey bees, zebra finches, and several other organisms have a secret weapon to help them be successful—a flipped piece of DNA known as a "supergene" that has enabled them to quickly evolve a winning set of qualities. Biologists are beginning to recognize the power of these DNA hiccups to drive evolution by freeing whole segments of the genome, containing multiple genes, from certain evolutionary constraints. As researchers discussed last month at the 16th Congress of the European Society of Evolutionary Biology in Groningen, the Netherlands, these evolutionary drivers have diverse and far-reaching roles in adaptation and evolution across many groups of organisms. </p>

Remobilization of crustal carbon may dominate volcanic arc emissions
<p>The flux of carbon into and out of Earth’s surface environment has implications for Earth’s climate and habitability. We compiled a global data set for carbon and helium isotopes from volcanic arcs and demonstrated that the carbon isotope composition of mean global volcanic gas is considerably heavier, at –3.8 to –4.6 per mil (‰), than the canonical mid-ocean ridge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">basalt</span></strong> value of –6.0‰. The largest volcanic emitters outgas carbon with higher δ<sup>13</sup>C and are located in mature continental arcs that have accreted carbonate platforms, indicating that reworking of crustal limestone is an important source of volcanic carbon. The fractional burial of organic carbon is lower than traditionally determined from a global carbon isotope mass balance and may have varied over geological time, modulated by supercontinent formation and breakup.</p>

Imaging the distribution of transient viscosity after the 2016 <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> 7.1 Kumamoto earthquake
<p>The deformation of mantle and crustal rocks in response to stress plays a crucial role in the distribution of seismic and volcanic hazards, controlling tectonic processes ranging from continental drift to earthquake triggering. However, the spatial variation of these dynamic properties is poorly understood as they are difficult to measure. We exploited the large stress perturbation incurred by the 2016 earthquake sequence in Kumamoto, Japan, to directly image localized and distributed deformation. The earthquakes illuminated distinct regions of low effective viscosity in the lower crust, notably beneath the Mount Aso and Mount Kuju <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volcano</span></strong>es, surrounded by larger-scale variations of viscosity across the back-arc. This study demonstrates a new potential for geodesy to directly probe rock rheology in situ across many spatial and temporal scales.</p>

Tungsten-182 heterogeneity in modern ocean island basalts
<p>New tungsten isotope data for modern ocean island <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">basalt</span></strong>s (OIB) from Hawaii, Samoa, and Iceland reveal variable <sup>182</sup>W/<sup>184</sup>W, ranging from that of the ambient upper mantle to ratios as much as 18 parts per million lower. The tungsten isotopic data negatively correlate with <sup>3</sup>He/<sup>4</sup>He. These data indicate that each OIB system accesses domains within Earth that formed within the first 60 million years of solar system history. Combined isotopic and chemical characteristics projected for these ancient domains indicate that they contain metal and are repositories of noble gases. We suggest that the most likely source candidates are mega–ultralow-velocity zones, which lie beneath Hawaii, Samoa, and Iceland but not beneath hot spots whose OIB yield normal <sup>182</sup>W and homogeneously low <sup>3</sup>He/<sup>4</sup>He.</p>

Experimental constraints on the damp peridotite solidus and oceanic mantle potential temperature
<p>Decompression of hot mantle rock upwelling beneath oceanic spreading centers causes it to exceed the melting point (solidus), producing magmas that ascend to form <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">basalt</span></strong>ic crust ~6 to 7 kilometers thick. The oceanic upper mantle contains ~50 to 200 micrograms per gram of water (H<sub>2</sub>O) dissolved in nominally anhydrous minerals, which—relative to its low concentration—has a disproportionate effect on the solidus that has not been quantified experimentally. Here, we present results from an experimental determination of the peridotite solidus containing known amounts of dissolved hydrogen. Our data reveal that the H<sub>2</sub>O-undersaturated peridotite solidus is hotter than previously thought. Reconciling geophysical observations of the melting regime beneath the East Pacific Rise with our experimental results requires that existing estimates for the oceanic upper mantle potential temperature be adjusted upward by about 60°C.</p>

Lifetime of the solar nebula constrained by meteorite paleomagnetism

We present <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">paleomagnet</span></strong>ic analyses of volcanic angrites demonstrating that they formed in a near-zero magnetic field (<0.6 microtesla) at 4563.5 ± 0.1 million years ago, ~3.8 million years after solar system formation. This indicates that the solar nebula field, and likely the nebular gas, had dispersed by this time. This sets the time scale for formation of the gas giants and planet migration. Furthermore, it supports formation of chondrules after 4563.5 million years ago by non-nebular processes like planetesimal collisions. The core dynamo on the angrite parent body did not initiate until about 4 to 11 million years after solar system formation.</p>

On the deep-mantle origin of the Deccan Traps

The unknown mantle structure under the Indian Ocean at the start of the Cenozoic presents a challenge for connecting the event to a deep mantle origin. We used a back-and-forth iterative method for time-reversed convection modeling, which incorporates tomography-based, present-day mantle heterogeneity to reconstruct mantle structure at the start of the Cenozoic. We show a very low-density, deep-seated upwelling that ascends beneath the Ršćééàéééšćéunion hot spot at the time of the Deccan eruptions. We found a second active upwelling below the Comores hot spot that likely contributed to the region of partial melt feeding the massive eruption.</p>

Large gem diamonds from metallic liquid in Earth’s deep mantle

Here we report that large, exceptional gem diamonds like the Cullinan, Constellation, and Koh-i-Noor carry direct evidence of crystallization from a redox-sensitive metallic liquid phase in the deep mantle. These sublithospheric diamonds contain inclusions of solidified iron-nickel-carbon-sulfur melt, accompanied by a thin fluid layer of methane ± hydrogen, and sometimes majoritic garnet or former calcium silicate perovskite. The metal-dominated mineral assemblages and reduced volatiles in large gem diamonds indicate formation under metal-saturated conditions. We verify previous predictions that Earth has highly reducing deep mantle regions capable of precipitating a metallic iron phase that contains dissolved carbon and hydrogen.</p>

Melting of subducted basalt at the core-mantle boundary
<p>The geological materials in Earth's lowermost mantle control the characteristics and interpretation of seismic ultra–low velocity zones at the base of the core-mantle boundary. Partial melting of the bulk lower mantle is often advocated as the cause, but this does not explain the nonubiquitous character of these regional seismic features. We explored the melting properties of mid-oceanic ridge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">basalt</span></strong> (MORB), which can reach the lowermost mantle after subduction of oceanic crust. At a pressure representative of the core-mantle boundary (135 gigapascals), the onset of melting occurs at ~3800 kelvin, which is ~350 kelvin below the mantle solidus. The SiO<sub>2</sub>-rich liquid generated either remains trapped in the MORB material or solidifies after reacting with the surrounding MgO-rich mantle, remixing subducted MORB with the lowermost mantle.</p>

Photosynthetic Efficiency as Bioindicator of Environmental Pressure in <i>A. halleri</i>
<p>In earlier ecophysiological studies that were conducted on <i>Arabidopsis halleri</i> plants, scientists focused on the mechanisms of Cd and Zn hyperaccumulation but did not take into consideration the environmental factors that can significantly affect the physiological responses of plants in situ. In this study, we investigated <i>A. halleri</i> that was growing on two nonmetalliferous and three metalliferous sites, which were characterized by different environmental conditions. We compared these populations in order to find differences within the metallicolous and nonmetallicolous groups that have not yet been investigated. The concentrations of several elements in the plant and soil samples also were investigated. To our knowledge, the concentration and fluorescence of chlorophyll were measured for <i>A. halleri</i> in situ for the first time. Our study confirmed the hyperaccumulation of Cd and Zn for each metallicolous population. For the metallicolous populations, the inhibition of parameters that describe the efficiency of the photosynthetic apparatus with increasing accumulations of heavy metals in the shoots also was observed. It was found that the nonmetallicolous plant populations from the summit of Ciemniak Mountain had larger antenna dimensions and chlorophyll content but a lower percentage of active reaction centers. To our knowledge, in this study, the internal high physiological diversity within the populations that inhabit metalliferous and nonmetalliferous sites is presented for the first time.</p>

Comparative Genomics of the Pine Pathogens and Beetle Symbionts in the Genus <i>Grosmannia</i>
<p>Studies on beetle/tree fungal symbionts typically characterize the ecological and geographic distributions of the fungal populations. There is limited understanding of the genome-wide evolutionary processes that act within and between species as such fungi adapt to different environments, leading to physiological differences and reproductive isolation. Here, we assess genomic evidence for such evolutionary processes by extending our recent work on <i>Grosmannia clavigera</i>, which is vectored by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mountain</span></strong> pine beetle and jeffrey pine beetle. We report the genome sequences of an additional 11 <i>G. clavigera</i> (Gc) sensu lato strains from the two known sibling species, <i>Grosmannia</i> sp. (Gs) and Gc. The 12 fungal genomes are structurally similar, showing large-scale synteny within and between species. We identified 103,430 single-nucleotide variations that separated the <i>Grosmannia</i> strains into divergent Gs and Gc clades, and further divided each of these clades into two subclades, one of which may represent an additional species. Comparing variable genes between these lineages, we identified truncated genes and potential pseudogenes, as well as seven genes that show evidence of positive selection. As these variable genes are involved in secondary metabolism and in detoxifying or utilizing host-tree defense chemicals (e.g., polyketide synthases, oxidoreductases, and mono-oxygenases), their variants may reflect adaptation to the specific chemistries of the host trees <i>Pinus contorta</i>, <i>P. ponderosa</i>, and <i>P. jeffreyi</i>. This work provides a comprehensive resource for developing informative markers for landscape population genomics of these ecologically and economically important fungi, and an approach that could be extended to other beetle–tree-associated fungi.</p>

The aim of this   study was to investigate the five-year outcomes in a consecutive   series of UKAs used in patients with partial thickness cartilage   loss in the medial compartment of the knee.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between 2002 and 2014, 94 consecutive UKAs were undertaken in   90 patients with partial thickness cartilage loss and followed up   independently for a mean of six years (1 to 13). These patients   had partial thickness cartilage loss either on both femur and tibia   (13 knees), or on either the femur or the tibia, with full thickness   loss on the other surface of the joint (18 and 63 knees respectively).   Using propensity score analysis, these patients were matched 1:2 based   on age, gender and pre-operative Oxford Knee Score (OKS) with knees   with full thickness loss on both the femur and tibia. The functional   outcomes, implant survival and incidence of re-operations were assessed   at one, two and five years post-operatively. A subgroup of 36 knees   in 36 patients with partial thickness cartilage loss, who had pre-operative   MRI scans, was assessed to identify whether there were any factors   identified on MRI that predicted the outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Knees with partial thickness cartilage loss had significantly   worse functional outcomes at one, two and five years post-operatively   compared with those with full thickness loss. A quarter of knees   with partial thickness loss had a fair or poor result and a fifth   failed to achieve a clinically significant improvement in OKS from   a baseline of four points or more; double that seen in knees with   full thickness loss. Whilst there was no difference in implant survival between   the groups, the rate of re-operation in knees with partial thickness   loss was three times higher. Most of the re-operations (three-quarters),   were arthroscopies for persistent pain.</p><p>Compared with those achieving good or excellent outcomes, patients   with partial thickness cartilage loss who achieved fair or poor   outcomes were younger and had worse pre-operative functional scores.   However, there were no other differences in the baseline demographics.   MRI findings of full thickness cartilage loss, subchondral oedema,   synovitis or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effus</span></strong>ion did not provide additional prognostic information.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Medial UKA should be reserved for patients with full thickness   cartilage loss on both the femur and tibia. Whilst some patients   with partial thickness loss achieve a good result we cannot currently   identify which these will be and in this situation MRI is unhelpful   and misleading.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:475–82.</p></sec>

Predictors of Death in Contemporary Adult Patients With Eisenmenger Syndrome
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Eisenmenger syndrome is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. There is no consensus, however, on mortality risk stratification. We aimed to investigate survival and predictors of death in a large, contemporary cohort of Eisenmenger syndrome patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a multicenter approach, we identified adults with Eisenmenger syndrome under follow-up between 2000 and 2015. We examined survival and its association with clinical, electrocardiographic, echocardiographic, and laboratory parameters.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We studied 1098 patients (median age, 34.4 years; range, 16.1–84.4 years; 65.1% female; 31.9% with Down syndrome). The majority had a posttricuspid defect (n=643, 58.6%), followed by patients with a complex (n=315, 28.7%) and pretricuspid lesion (n=140, 12.7%). Over a median follow-up of 3.1 years (interquartile range, 1.4–5.9), allowing for 4361.6 patient-years observation, 278 patients died and 6 underwent transplantation. Twelve parameters emerged as significant predictors of death on univariable analysis. On multivariable Cox regression analysis, only age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.41/10 years; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24–1.59; <i>P</i><0.001), pretricuspid shunt (HR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.02–2.39; <i>P</i>=0.041), oxygen saturation at rest (HR, 0.53/10%; 95% CI, 0.43–0.65; <i>P</i><0.001), presence of sinus rhythm (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.32–0.88; <i>P</i>=0.013), and presence of pericardial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effus</span></strong>ion (HR, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.59–3.66; <i>P</i><0.001) remained significant predictors of death.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>There is significant premature mortality among contemporary adults with Eisenmenger syndrome. We report, herewith, a multivariable mortality risk stratification model based on 5 simple, noninvasive predictors of death in this population.</p></sec>

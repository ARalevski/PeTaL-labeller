Human mutation rate a legacy from our past
<p>Humans should be more like paramecia. That's because their mutation rate is orders of magnitude lower than a human's. Those rates increase when genes involved in copying or repairing DNA stop working correctly. Although some mutations are good for generating variety that allows organisms to adapt to changing environments, too many can cause disease and birth defects. At a meeting in Tempe, Arizona, researchers documented mutation rates in dozens of species and found that the species's specific rate is inversely related to the so-called "effective population" size. Small populations are less able to get rid of or compensate for genetic changes that increase mutation rate. In the past, mutation rates were thought to be so stable that they were "molecular clocks" useful for dating species' divergences. But researchers are now recognizing that mutation rates vary from species to species.</p>

Early-career researchers: an interview with Marianne Porter
<p>Marianne Porter is an Assistant Professor at Florida Atlantic University, USA, where she studies biomechanics, functional morphology, and bioinspired robotics. She received her Bachelor's degrees in Zoology from Northern Arizona University, USA, in 2000 before completing her PhD with Adam Summers at the University of California, Irvine, USA in 2007. She then completed a postdoctoral fellowship with John Long at Vassar College, USA, before rejoining Summers at Friday Harbor Laboratories, University of Washington, USA.</p>

Optimizing a Drone Network to Deliver Automated External Defibrillators
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Public access defibrillation programs can improve survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, but automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are rarely available for bystander use at the scene. Drones are an emerging technology that can deliver an AED to the scene of an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest for bystander use. We hypothesize that a drone network designed with the aid of a mathematical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> combining both optimization and queuing can reduce the time to AED arrival.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We applied our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> to 53 702 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests that occurred in the 8 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong>s of the Toronto <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong>al RescuNET between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2014. Our primary analysis quantified the drone network size required to deliver an AED 1, 2, or 3 minutes faster than historical median 911 response times for each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong> independently. A secondary analysis quantified the reduction in drone resources required if RescuNET was treated as a large coordinated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong>-specific analysis determined that 81 bases and 100 drones would be required to deliver an AED ahead of median 911 response times by 3 minutes. In the most urban <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong>, the 90th percentile of the AED arrival time was reduced by 6 minutes and 43 seconds relative to historical 911 response times in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong>. In the most rural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong>, the 90th percentile was reduced by 10 minutes and 34 seconds. A single coordinated drone network across all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong>s required 39.5% fewer bases and 30.0% fewer drones to achieve similar AED delivery times.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>An optimized drone network designed with the aid of a novel mathematical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> can substantially reduce the AED delivery time to an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest event.</p></sec>

Tree Physiology
Nitrogen uptake over entire root systems of tree seedlings
<p>Uptake of nitrogen (N) by sequential root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong>s in six tree species was measured in roots of 16- to 26-month-old seedlings at 50 and 1500 µM NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> concentration, at the cell level using oscillating microelectrodes and at the root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong> level using enriched <sup>15</sup>N application. Our objective was to determine the root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong>s making the greatest contribution to total N uptake in each species as measured by the two contrasting techniques. White and condensed tannin zones were the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong>s with the smallest surface area in all species, but these zones often had the highest net flux of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>. For most species, little variation was found among root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong>s in N flux calculated using a <sup>15</sup>N mass balance approach, but where significant differences existed, high N flux was observed in white, cork or woody zones. When N fluxes measured by each of the two methods were multiplied by the estimated surface area or biomass of each root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong>, the effect of root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong> size had the greatest influence on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong>al N uptake. Root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong>s of greatest overall N uptake were the cork and woody zones, on average. Total N uptake may thus be greatest in older <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong>s of tree seedling roots, despite low rates of uptake per unit area.</p>

Systematic Biology
Statistical Inference of Allopolyploid Species Networks in the Presence of Incomplete Lineage Sorting
<p>Polyploidy is an important speciation mechanism, particularly in land plants. Allopolyploid species are formed after hybridization between otherwise intersterile parental species. Recent theoretical progress has led to successful implementation of species tree <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s that take population genetic parameters into account. However, these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s have not included allopolyploid hybridization and the special problems imposed when species trees of allopolyploids are inferred. Here, 2 new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s for the statistical inference of the evolutionary history of allopolyploids are evaluated using simulations and demonstrated on 2 empirical data sets. It is assumed that there has been a single hybridization event between 2 diploid species resulting in a genomic allotetraploid. The evolutionary history can be represented as a species network or as a multilabeled species tree, in which some pairs of tips are labeled with the same species. In one of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s (AlloppMUL), the multilabeled species tree is inferred directly. This is the simplest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> and the most widely applicable, since fewer assumptions are made. The second <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> (AlloppNET) incorporates the hybridization event explicitly which means that fewer parameters need to be estimated. Both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s are implemented in the BEAST framework. Simulations show that both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s are useful and that AlloppNET is more accurate if the assumptions it is based on are valid. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s are demonstrated on previously analyzed data from the genera <i>Pachycladon</i> (Brassicaceae) and <i>Silene</i> (Caryophyllaceae).

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Genome-Wide Analysis of the Arabidopsis Replication Timing Program
<p>Eukaryotes use a temporally regulated process, known as the replication timing program, to ensure that their genomes are fully and accurately duplicated during S phase. Replication timing programs are predictive of genomic features and activity and are considered to be functional readouts of chromatin organization. Although replication timing programs have been described for yeast and animal systems, much less is known about the temporal regulation of plant DNA replication or its relationship to genome sequence and chromatin structure. We used the thymidine analog, 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine, in combination with flow sorting and Repli-Seq to describe, at high-resolution, the genome-wide replication timing program for Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) Col-0 suspension cells. We identified genomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong>s that replicate predominantly during early, mid, and late S phase, and correlated these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong>s with genomic features and with data for chromatin state, accessibility, and long-distance interaction. Arabidopsis chromosome arms tend to replicate early while pericentromeric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong>s replicate late. Early and mid-replicating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong>s are gene-rich and predominantly euchromatic, while late <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong>s are rich in transposable elements and primarily heterochromatic. However, the distribution of chromatin states across the different times is complex, with each replication time corresponding to a mixture of states. Early and mid-replicating sequences interact with each other and not with late sequences, but early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong>s are more accessible than mid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong>s. The replication timing program in Arabidopsis reflects a bipartite genomic organization with early/mid-replicating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong>s and late <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong>s forming separate, noninteracting compartments. The temporal order of DNA replication within the early/mid compartment may be modulated largely by chromatin accessibility.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
A Dynamic Hydro-Mechanical and Biochemical Model of Stomatal Conductance for C<sub>4</sub> Photosynthesis
<p>C<sub>4</sub> plants are major grain (maize [<i>Zea mays</i>] and sorghum [<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>]), sugar (sugarcane [<i>Saccharum officinarum</i>]), and biofuel (<i>Miscanthus</i> spp.) producers and contribute ∼20% to global productivity. Plants lose water through stomatal pores in order to acquire CO<sub>2</sub> (assimilation [<i>A</i>]) and control their carbon-for-water balance by regulating stomatal conductance (<i>g</i><sub>S</sub>). The ability to mechanistically predict <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> and <i>A</i> in response to atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, water availability, and time is critical for simulating stomatal control of plant-atmospheric carbon and water exchange under current, past, or future environmental conditions. Yet, dynamic mechanistic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s for <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> are lacking, especially for C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. We developed and coupled a hydromechanical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> of stomatal behavior with a biochemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis, calibrated using gas-exchange measurements in maize, and extended the coupled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> with time-explicit functions to predict dynamic responses. We demonstrated the wider applicability of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> with three additional C<sub>4</sub> grass species in which interspecific differences in stomatal behavior could be accounted for by fitting a single parameter. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> accurately predicted steady-state responses of <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> to light, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and oxygen, soil drying, and evaporative demand as well as dynamic responses to light intensity. Further analyses suggest that the effect of variable leaf hydraulic conductance is negligible. Based on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>, we derived a set of equations suitable for incorporation in land surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s. Our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> illuminates the processes underpinning stomatal control in C<sub>4</sub> plants and suggests that the hydraulic benefits associated with fast stomatal responses of C<sub>4</sub> grasses may have supported the evolution of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Distinct Functions of STARCH SYNTHASE 4 Domains in Starch Granule Formation
<p>The formation of normal starch granules in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaf chloroplasts requires STARCH SYNTHASE 4 (SS4). In plants lacking SS4, chloroplasts typically produce only one round granule rather than multiple lenticular granules. The mechanisms by which SS4 determines granule number and morphology are not understood. The N-terminal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong> of SS4 is unique among SS isoforms and contains several long coiled-coil motifs, typically implicated in protein-protein interactions. The C-terminal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong> contains the catalytic glucosyltransferase domains, which are widely conserved in plant SS and bacterial glycogen synthase (GS) isoforms. We investigated the specific roles of the N- and C-terminal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong>s of SS4 by expressing truncated versions of SS4 and a fusion between the N-terminal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong> of SS4 and GS in the Arabidopsis <i>ss4</i> mutant. Expression of the N-terminal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong> of SS4 alone did not alter the <i>ss4</i> mutant phenotype. Expression of the C-terminal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong> of SS4 alone increased granule initiation but did not rescue their aberrant round morphology. Expression of a self-priming GS from <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i> also increased the number of round granules. Remarkably, fusion of the N-terminal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong> of SS4 to <i>A. tumefaciens</i> GS restored the development of wild-type-like lenticular starch granules. Interestingly, the N-terminal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong> of SS4 alone or when fused to GS conferred a patchy subchloroplastic localization similar to that of the full-length SS4 protein. Considered together, these data suggest that, while the glucosyltransferase activity of SS4 is important for granule initiation, the N-terminal part of SS4 serves to establish the correct granule morphology by properly localizing this activity.</p>

Geographic Variation in Cardiac Rehabilitation Participation in Medicare and Veterans Affairs Populations
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac rehabilitation is strongly recommended after myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention, or coronary artery bypass surgery, but it is historically underused.

After excluding patients who died in ≤30 days of hospitalization, we calculated the percentage of patients who participated in ≥1 outpatient visits for cardiac rehabilitation during the 12 months after hospitalization. We estimated adjusted and standardized rates of participation in cardiac rehabilitation by state using hierarchical logistic regression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, participation in cardiac rehabilitation was 16.3% (23 403/143 756) in Medicare and 10.3% (9123/88 826) in VA.

A Model of Leaf Coordination to Scale-Up Leaf Expansion from the Organ to the Canopy
<p>Process-based crop growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s are popular tools with which to analyze and understand the impact of crop management, genotype-by-environment interactions, or climate change. The ability to predict leaf area development is critical to predict crop growth, particularly under conditions of limited resources. Here, we aimed at deciphering growth coordination rules between wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) plant organs (i.e. between leaves within a stem, between laminae and sheaths, and between the mainstem and axillary tillers) to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> the dynamics of canopy development. We found a unique relationship between laminae area and leaf rank for the mainstem and its tillers, which was robust across a range of sowing dates and plant densities. Robust relationships between laminae and sheath areas also were found, highlighting the tight control of organ growth within and between phytomers. These relationships identified at the phytomer scale were used to develop a simulation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> of leaf area dynamics at the canopy level that was integrated in the wheat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> SiriusQuality. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> was then evaluated using several independent experiments. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> accurately predicts leaf area dynamics under different scenarios of nitrogen and water limitations. It accounted for 85%, 64%, and 73% of the variability of the surface area of leaf cohorts, total leaf area index, and total green area index, respectively. The process-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> of the dynamics of leaf area described here is a key element to quantify the value of candidate traits for use in plant breeding and to project the impact of climate change on wheat growth.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Detecting Adaptation in Protein-Coding Genes Using a Bayesian Site-Heterogeneous Mutation-Selection Codon Substitution Model
<p>Codon substitution <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s have traditionally attempted to uncover signatures of adaptation within protein-coding genes by contrasting the rates of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions. Another <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>ing approach, known as the mutation–selection framework, attempts to explicitly account for selective patterns at the amino acid level, with some approaches allowing for heterogeneity in these patterns across codon sites. Under such a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>, substitutions at a given position occur at the neutral or nearly neutral rate when they are synonymous, or when they correspond to replacements between amino acids of similar fitness; substitutions from high to low (low to high) fitness amino acids have comparatively low (high) rates. Here, we study the use of such a mutation–selection framework as a null <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> for the detection of adaptation. Following previous works in this direction, we include a deviation parameter that has the effect of capturing the surplus, or deficit, in non-synonymous rates, relative to what would be expected under a mutation–selection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>ing framework that includes a Dirichlet process approach to account for across-codon-site variation in amino acid fitness profiles. We use simulations, along with a few real data sets, to study the behavior of the approach, and find it to have good power with a low false-positive rate. Altogether, we emphasize the potential of recent mutation–selection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s in the detection of adaptation, calling for further <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> refinements as well as large-scale applications.</p>

The role of the olfactory recess in olfactory airflow
<p>The olfactory recess – a blind pocket at the back of the nasal airway – is thought to play an important role in mammalian olfaction by sequestering air outside of the main airstream, thus giving odorants time to re-circulate. Several studies have shown that species with large olfactory recesses tend to have a well-developed sense of smell. However, no study has investigated how the size of the olfactory recess relates to air circulation near the olfactory epithelium. Here we used a computer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> of the nasal cavity from a bat (<i>Carollia perspicillata</i>) to test the hypothesis that a larger olfactory recess improves olfactory airflow. We predicted that during inhalation, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s with an enlarged olfactory recess would have slower rates of flow through the olfactory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong> (i.e. the olfactory recess plus airspace around the olfactory epithelium), while during exhalation these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s would have little to no flow through the olfactory recess. To test these predictions, we experimentally modified the size of the olfactory recess while holding the rest of the morphology constant. During inhalation, we found that an enlarged olfactory recess resulted in lower rates of flow in the olfactory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong>. Upon exhalation, air flowed through the olfactory recess at a lower rate in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> with an enlarged olfactory recess. Taken together, these results indicate that an enlarged olfactory recess improves olfactory airflow during both inhalation and exhalation. These findings add to our growing understanding of how the morphology of the nasal cavity may relate to function in this understudied <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong> of the skull.</p>

Enhancer-Promoter Interaction of <i>SELF PRUNING 5G</i> Shapes Photoperiod Adaptation
<p>Tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) is a major vegetable fruit grown and consumed worldwide. Modern cultivated tomatoes are derived from their wild relative, <i>Solanum pimpinellifolium</i>, a short-day plant that originated from the Andean <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong> of South America. The molecular underpinnings of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong>al adaptation and expansion of domesticated tomato remain largely unclear. In this study, we examined flowering time in wild and cultivated tomatoes under both long-day and short-day conditions. Using quantitative trait locus mapping in a recombinant inbred line population, we identified <i>SELF PRUNING 5G</i> (<i>SP5G</i>) as a major locus influencing daylength adaptation in tomato. Genetic diversity analysis revealed that the genomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong> harboring <i>SP5G</i> shows signatures of a domestication sweep. We found that a 52-bp sequence within the 3′ untranslated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong> of <i>SP5G</i> is essential for the enhanced expression of this gene, leading to delayed flowering time in tomatoes through a promoter-enhancer interaction that occurs only under long-day conditions. We further demonstrate that the absence of the 52-bp sequence attenuates the promoter-enhancer interaction and reduces <i>SP5G</i> expression in cultivated tomatoes, making their flowering time insensitive to daylength. Our findings demonstrate that cis-regulatory variation at the enhancer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong> of the <i>SP5G</i> 3′ untranslated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong> confers reduced photoperiodic response in cultivated tomatoes, uncovering a regulatory mechanism that could potentially be used to manipulate flowering time in tomato through novel biotechnological approaches.</p>

Tight junction protein gene expression patterns and changes in transcript abundance during development of model fish gill epithelia
<p>In vertebrates, tight junction (TJ) proteins play an important role in epithelium formation and development, the maintenance of tissue integrity and regulation of TJ permeability. In this study, primary cultured <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> gill epithelia composed of pavement cells (PVCs) were used to examine TJ protein transcript abundance during the development of epithelium confluence and epithelium resistive properties. Differences in TJ protein expression patterns and transcript abundance between gill <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s composed of PVCs and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s composed of PVCs and mitochondrion-rich cells (MRCs) were also examined. Marked alterations in TJ protein transcript abundance were observed as cells developed to confluence in flask-cultured <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> gill epithelia. In contrast, during the formation of tissue resistance in insert-cultured epithelia (i.e. epithelia cultured on a permeable substrate), changes in TJ protein mRNA abundance were conservative, despite paracellular marker flux decreasing by orders of magnitude. In both cases significant changes in <i>claudin-8b, -8d, -27b, -28b</i> and -<i>32a</i> transcript abundance were observed, suggesting that temporal alterations in the abundance of these genes are important end points of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> gill epithelium integrity. When MRCs were present in cultured gill <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s, the mRNA abundance of several TJ proteins significantly altered and <i>claudin-10c, -10d</i> and -<i>33b</i> were only detected in preparations that included MRCs. These data provide insight into the role of select TJ proteins in the formation and development of gill epithelia and the maintenance of gill barrier properties. In addition, observations reveal a heterogeneous distribution of claudin TJ proteins in the gill epithelial cells of rainbow trout.</p>

Antibody-Mediated Inhibition of Tspan12 Ameliorates Vasoproliferative Retinopathy Through Suppression of β-Catenin Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Anti-angiogenic biologicals represent an important concept for the treatment of vasoproliferative diseases. However, the need for continued treatment, the presence of nonresponders, and the risk of long-term side effects limit the success of existing therapeutic agents. Although Tspan12 has been shown to regulate retinal vascular development, nothing is known about its involvement in neovascular disease and its potential as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of vasoproliferative diseases.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Rodent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s of retinal neovascular disease, including the mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> of oxygen-induced retinopathy and the very low density lipoprotein receptor knockout mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> were analyzed for Tspan/β-catenin regulation. Screening of a phage display of a human combinatorial antibody (Ab) library was used for the development of a high-affinity Ab against Tspan12. Therapeutic effects of the newly developed Ab on vascular endothelial cells were tested in vitro and in vivo in the oxygen-induced retinopathy and very low density lipoprotein receptor knockout mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The newly developed anti-Tspan12 Ab exhibited potent inhibitory effects on endothelial cell migration and tube formation. Mechanistic studies confirmed that the Ab inhibited the interaction between Tspan12 and Frizzled-4 and effectively modulates β-catenin levels and target genes in vascular endothelial cells. Tspan12/β-catenin signaling was activated in response to acute and chronic stress in the oxygen-induced retinopathy and very low density lipoprotein receptor mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> of proliferative retinopathy. Intravitreal application of the Ab showed significant therapeutic effects in both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s without inducing negative side effects on retina function. Moreover, combined intravitreal injection of the Ab with a known vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor, Aflibercept, resulted in significant enhancement of the therapeutic efficacy of each monotherapy. Combination therapy with the Tspan12 blocking antibody can be used to reduce anti-vascular endothelial growth factor doses, thus decreasing the risk of long-term off-target effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Tspan12/β-catenin signaling is critical for the progression of vasoproliferative disease. The newly developed anti-Tspan12 antibody has therapeutic effects in vasoproliferative retinopathy and can enhance the potency of existing anti- vascular endothelial growth factor agents.</p></sec>

Fossils reveal the complex evolutionary history of the mammalian regionalized spine
<p>A unique characteristic of mammals is a vertebral column with anatomically distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong>s, but when and how this trait evolved remains unknown. We reconstructed vertebral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong>s and their morphological disparity in the extinct forerunners of mammals, the nonmammalian synapsids, to elucidate the evolution of mammalian axial differentiation. Mapping patterns of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong>alization and disparity (heterogeneity) across amniotes reveals that both traits increased during synapsid evolution. However, the onset of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong>alization predates increased heterogeneity. On the basis of inferred homology patterns, we propose a “pectoral-first” hypothesis for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong> acquisition, whereby evolutionary shifts in forelimb function in nonmammalian therapsids drove increasing vertebral modularity prior to differentiation of the vertebral column for specialized functions in mammals.</p>

Scaling of human brain size
<p>What makes humans unique as a species and as individuals? Our uniqueness stems from language, tool use, reasoning, and other cognitive abilities that are largely mediated by specialized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong>s of the cerebral cortex. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong>s of higher cognitive function have expanded disproportionately during human evolution (compared with nonhuman primates) and during postnatal maturation, when cortical surface area expands threefold between infancy and adulthood (<i>1</i>). Our uniqueness as individuals reflects countless differences in brain structure, function, and connectivity. One basic anatomical difference between similarly aged individuals is a more than 1.5-fold variation in total brain size (and total cortical volume) (<i>2</i>). On page 1222 of this issue, Reardon <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) bring this aspect of individual variability under the umbrella of “differential scaling” by showing that human brains of different sizes do not scale uniformly across all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong>s. Rather, larger brains show greater expansion in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong>s associated with higher cognition and less expansion in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong>s associated with sensory, motor, and limbic (emotion- and affect-related) functions.</p>

Atomic model for the dimeric F<sub>O</sub> region of mitochondrial ATP synthase
<p>Mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase produces the majority of ATP in eukaryotic cells, and its dimerization is necessary to create the inner membrane folds, or cristae, characteristic of mitochondria. Proton translocation through the membrane-embedded F<sub>O</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong> turns the rotor that drives ATP synthesis in the soluble F<sub>1</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong>. Although crystal structures of the F<sub>1</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong> have illustrated how this rotation leads to ATP synthesis, understanding how proton translocation produces the rotation has been impeded by the lack of an experimental atomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> for the F<sub>O</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong>. Using cryo–electron microscopy, we determined the structure of the dimeric F<sub>O</sub> complex from <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> at a resolution of 3.6 angstroms. The structure clarifies how the protons travel through the complex, how the complex dimerizes, and how the dimers bend the membrane to produce cristae.</p>

Plant Phenotyping: An Active Vision Cell for Three-Dimensional Plant Shoot Reconstruction
<p>Three-dimensional (3D) computer-generated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s of plants are urgently needed to support both phenotyping and simulation-based studies such as photosynthesis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>ing. However, the construction of accurate 3D plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s is challenging, as plants are complex objects with an intricate leaf structure, often consisting of thin and highly reflective surfaces that vary in shape and size, forming dense, complex, crowded scenes. We address these issues within an image-based method by taking an active vision approach, one that investigates the scene to intelligently capture images, to image acquisition. Rather than use the same camera positions for all plants, our technique is to acquire the images needed to reconstruct the target plant, tuning camera placement to match the plant’s individual structure. Our method also combines volumetric- and surface-based reconstruction methods and determines the necessary images based on the analysis of voxel clusters. We describe a fully automatic plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>ing/phenotyping cell (or module) comprising a six-axis robot and a high-precision turntable. By using a standard color camera, we overcome the difficulties associated with laser-based plant reconstruction methods. The 3D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s produced are compared with those obtained from fixed cameras and evaluated by comparison with data obtained by x-ray microcomputed tomography across different plant structures. Our results show that our method is successful in improving the accuracy and quality of data obtained from a variety of plant types.</p>

Network Modeling Unravels Mechanisms of Crosstalk between Ethylene and Salicylate Signaling in Potato
<p>To develop novel crop breeding strategies, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms underlying the interaction between plants and their pathogens. Network <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>ing represents a powerful tool that can unravel properties of complex biological systems. In this study, we aimed to use network <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>ing to better understand immune signaling in potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>). For this, we first built on a reliable Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) immune signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>, extending it with the information from diverse publicly available resources. Next, we translated the resulting prior knowledge network (20,012 nodes and 70,091 connections) to potato and superimposed it with an ensemble network inferred from time-resolved transcriptomics data for potato. We used different network <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>ing approaches to generate specific hypotheses of potato immune signaling mechanisms. An interesting finding was the identification of a string of molecular events illuminating the ethylene pathway modulation of the salicylic acid pathway through Nonexpressor of PR Genes1 gene expression. Functional validations confirmed this modulation, thus supporting the potential of our integrative network <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>ing approach for unraveling molecular mechanisms in complex systems. In addition, this approach can ultimately result in improved breeding strategies for potato and other sensitive crops.</p>

In Silico Analysis of the Regulation of the Photosynthetic Electron Transport Chain in C3 Plants<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>We present a new simulation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> of the reactions in the photosynthetic electron transport chain of C3 species. We show that including recent insights about the regulation of the thylakoid proton motive force, ATP/NADPH balancing mechanisms (cyclic and noncyclic alternative electron transport), and regulation of Rubisco activity leads to emergent behaviors that may affect the operation and regulation of photosynthesis under different dynamic environmental conditions. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> was parameterized with experimental results in the literature, with a focus on Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). A dataset was constructed from multiple sources, including measurements of steady-state and dynamic gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, and absorbance spectroscopy under different light intensities and CO<sub>2</sub>, to test predictions of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> under different experimental conditions. Simulations suggested that there are strong interactions between cyclic and noncyclic alternative electron transport and that an excess capacity for alternative electron transport is required to ensure adequate redox state and lumen pH. Furthermore, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> predicted that, under specific conditions, reduction of ferredoxin by plastoquinol is possible after a rapid increase in light intensity. Further analysis also revealed that the relationship between ATP synthesis and proton motive force was highly regulated by the concentrations of ATP, ADP, and inorganic phosphate, and this facilitated an increase in nonphotochemical quenching and proton motive force under conditions where metabolism was limiting, such as low CO<sub>2</sub>, high light intensity, or combined high CO<sub>2</sub> and high light intensity. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> may be used as an in silico platform for future research on the regulation of photosynthetic electron transport.</p>

F-Actin Mediated Focusing of Vesicles at the Cell Tip Is Essential for Polarized Growth
<p>F-actin has been shown to be essential for tip growth in an array of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s, including <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. One hypothesis is that diffusion can transport secretory vesicles, while actin plays a regulatory role during secretion. Alternatively, it is possible that actin-based transport is necessary to overcome vesicle transport limitations to sustain secretion. Therefore, a quantitative analysis of diffusion, secretion kinetics, and cell geometry is necessary to clarify the role of actin in polarized growth. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis, we first show that secretory vesicles move toward and accumulate at the tip in an actin-dependent manner. We then depolymerized F-actin to decouple vesicle diffusion from actin-mediated transport and measured the diffusion coefficient and concentration of vesicles. Using these values, we constructed a theoretical diffusion-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> for growth, demonstrating that with fast-enough vesicle fusion kinetics, diffusion could support normal cell growth rates. We further refined our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> to explore how experimentally extrapolated vesicle fusion kinetics and the size of the secretion zone limit diffusion-based growth. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> predicts that diffusion-mediated growth is dependent on the size of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong> of exocytosis at the tip and that diffusion-based growth would be significantly slower than normal cell growth. To further explore the size of the secretion zone, we used a cell wall degradation enzyme cocktail and determined that the secretion zone is smaller than 6 μm in diameter at the tip. Taken together, our results highlight the requirement for active transport in polarized growth and provide important insight into vesicle secretion during tip growth.</p>

Predictive Models of Spatial Transcriptional Response to High Salinity
<p>Plants are exposed to a variety of environmental conditions, and their ability to respond to environmental variation depends on the proper regulation of gene expression in an organ-, tissue-, and cell type-specific manner. Although our knowledge of how stress responses are regulated is accumulating, a genome-wide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> of how plant transcription factors (TFs) and cis-regulatory elements control spatially specific stress response has yet to emerge. Using Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>, we identified a set of 1,894 putative cis-regulatory elements (pCREs) that are associated with high-salinity (salt) up-regulated genes in the root or the shoot. We used these pCREs to develop computational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s that can better predict salt up-regulated genes in the root and shoot compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s based on known TF binding motifs. In addition, we incorporated TF binding sites identified via large-scale in vitro assays, chromatin accessibility, evolutionary conservation, and pCRE combinatorial relationships in machine learning <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s and found that only consideration of pCRE combinations led to better performance in salt up-regulation prediction in the root and shoot. Our results suggest that the plant organ transcriptional response to high salinity is regulated by a core set of pCREs and provide a genome-wide view of the cis-regulatory code of plant spatial transcriptional responses to environmental stress.</p>

Efficient Inference of Recombination Hot Regions in Bacterial Genomes
<p>In eukaryotes, detailed surveys of recombination rates have shown variation at multiple genomic scales and the presence of “hotspots” of highly elevated recombination. In bacteria, studies of recombination rate variation are less developed, in part because there are few analysis methods that take into account the clonal context within which bacterial evolution occurs. Here, we focus in particular on identifying “hot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong>s” of the genome where DNA is transferred frequently between isolates. We present a computationally efficient algorithm based on the recently developed “chromosome painting” algorithm, which characterizes patterns of haplotype sharing across a genome. We compare the average genome wide painting, which principally reflects clonal descent, with the painting for each site which additionally reflects the specific deviations at the site due to recombination. Using simulated data, we show that hot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong>s have consistently higher deviations from the genome wide average than normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong>s. We applied our approach to previously analyzed <i>Escherichia coli</i> genomes and revealed that the new method is highly correlated with the number of recombination events affecting each site inferred by ClonalOrigin, a method that is only applicable to small numbers of genomes. Furthermore, we analyzed recombination hot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong>s in <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i> by using 200 genomes. We identified three recombination hot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong>s, which are enriched for genes related to membrane proteins. Our approach and its implementation, which is downloadable from <ext-link>https://github.com/bioprojects/orderedPainting</ext-link>, will help to develop a new phase of population genomic studies of recombination in prokaryotes.</p>

A new and clinically relevant murine model of solid-organ transplant aspergillosis
<p>Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are a major cause of death in organ transplant patients. The murine hydrocortisone-mediated immunosuppression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> of pulmonary aspergillosis is commonly used to characterise IFIs in these patients. However, this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> does not take into account the effects of calcineurin inhibitors on transplant immunity to IFIs or the fungal calcineurin pathway, which is required for both virulence and antifungal drug resistance. To address these two issues, a new and clinically relevant transplant immunosuppression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> of tacrolimus (FK506) and hydrocortisone-associated pulmonary aspergillosis was developed. We first characterised IFIs in 406 patients with a lung transplant. This showed that all of the patients with pulmonary aspergillosis were immunosuppressed with calcineurin inhibitors and steroids. Murine pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that an ideal dose of 1 mg/kg/day of FK506 intraperitoneally produced blood trough levels in the human therapeutic range (5–12 ng/ml). There was increased mortality from pulmonary aspergillosis in a transplant-relevant immunosuppression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> using both FK506 and hydrocortisone as compared with immunosuppression using hydrocortisone only. Lung histopathology showed neutrophil invasion and tracheobronchitis that was associated with reduced lung tumour necrosis factor-α (TNFα), JE (homologue of human MCP-1) and KC (homologue of human IL-8) at 24 hours, but increased lung TNFα, JE and KC at 48 hours when fungal burden was high. Furthermore, FK506 directly impaired fungal killing in alveolar macrophages <i>in vitro</i>, with FK506-mediated inhibition of the radial growth of <i>Aspergillus fumigatus in vitro</i> occurring at the low concentration of 5 ng/ml. Taken together, these findings show that the immunosuppressive activity of FK506 outweighs its antifungal activity <i>in vivo</i>. These observations demonstrate that FK506 impairs innate immune responses and leads to an incremental increase in susceptibility to IFIs when it is combined with steroids. This new and clinically relevant mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> of invasive aspergillosis is a valuable addition to the further study of both fungal immunity and antifungal therapy in organ transplantation.</p>

Targeting Chondroitin Sulfate Glycosaminoglycans to Treat Cardiac Fibrosis in Pathological Remodeling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Heart failure is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity, and the search for novel therapeutic approaches continues. In the monogenic disease mucopolysaccharidosis VI, loss-of-function mutations in arylsulfatase B lead to myocardial accumulation of chondroitin sulfate (CS) glycosaminoglycans, manifesting as myriad cardiac symptoms. Here, we studied changes in myocardial CS in nonmucopolysaccharidosis failing hearts and assessed its generic role in pathological cardiac re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>ing.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Healthy and diseased human and rat left ventricles were subjected to histological and immunostaining methods to analyze glycosaminoglycan distribution. Glycosaminoglycans were extracted and analyzed for quantitative and compositional changes with Alcian blue assay and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry. Expression changes in 20 CS-related genes were studied in 3 primary human cardiac cell types and THP-1–derived macrophages under each of 9 in vitro stimulatory conditions. In 2 rat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s of pathological re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>ing induced by transverse aortic constriction or isoprenaline infusion, recombinant human arylsulfatase B (rhASB), clinically used as enzyme replacement therapy in mucopolysaccharidosis VI, was administered intravenously for 7 or 5 weeks, respectively. Cardiac function, myocardial fibrosis, and inflammation were assessed by echocardiography and histology. CS-interacting molecules were assessed with surface plasmon resonance, and a mechanism of action was verified in vitro.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Failing human hearts displayed significant perivascular and interstitial CS accumulation, particularly in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong>s of intense fibrosis. Relative composition of CS disaccharides remained unchanged. Transforming growth factor–β induced CS upregulation in cardiac fibroblasts. CS accumulation was also observed in both the pressure-overload and the isoprenaline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s of pathological re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>ing in rats. Early treatment with rhASB in the transverse aortic constriction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> and delayed treatment in the isoprenaline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> proved rhASB to be effective at preventing cardiac deterioration and augmenting functional recovery.

<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Elabela/toddler (ELA) is a critical cardiac developmental peptide that acts through the G-protein–coupled apelin receptor, despite lack of sequence similarity to the established ligand apelin. Our aim was to investigate the receptor pharmacology, expression pattern, and in vivo function of ELA peptides in the adult cardiovascular system, to seek evidence for alteration in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in which apelin signaling is downregulated, and to demonstrate attenuation of PAH severity with exogenous administration of ELA in a rat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p><i>In silico</i> docking analysis, competition binding experiments, and downstream assays were used to characterize ELA receptor binding in human heart and signaling in cells expressing the apelin receptor.

Acute cardiac effects of ELA-32 and [Pyr<sup>1</sup>]apelin-13 were assessed by MRI and cardiac catheterization in anesthetized rats.

Modeling the ecology and evolution of biodiversity: Biogeographical cradles, museums, and graves
<p>Individual processes shaping geographical patterns of biodiversity are increasingly understood, but their complex interactions on broad spatial and temporal scales remain beyond the reach of analytical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s and traditional experiments. To meet this challenge, we built a spatially explicit, mechanistic simulation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> implementing adaptation, range shifts, fragmentation, speciation, dispersal, competition, and extinction, driven by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>ed climates of the past 800,000 years in South America. Experimental topographic smoothing confirmed the impact of climate heterogeneity on diversification. The simulations identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong>s and episodes of speciation (cradles), persistence (museums), and extinction (graves). Although the simulations had no target pattern and were not parameterized with empirical data, emerging richness maps closely resembled contemporary maps for major taxa, confirming powerful roles for evolution and diversification driven by topography and climate.</p>

Microstructural proliferation in human cortex is coupled with the development of face processing
<p>How does cortical tissue change as brain function and behavior improve from childhood to adulthood? By combining quantitative and functional magnetic resonance imaging in children and adults, we find differential development of high-level visual areas that are involved in face and place recognition. Development of face-selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong>s, but not place-selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong>s, is dominated by microstructural proliferation. This tissue development is correlated with specific increases in functional selectivity to faces, as well as improvements in face recognition, and ultimately leads to differentiated tissue properties between face- and place-selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong>s in adulthood, which we validate with postmortem cytoarchitectonic measurements. These data suggest a new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> by which emergent brain function and behavior result from cortical tissue proliferation rather than from pruning exclusively.</p>

Observed Arctic sea-ice loss directly follows anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emission
<p>Arctic sea ice is retreating rapidly, raising prospects of a future ice-free Arctic Ocean during summer. Because climate-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> simulations of the sea-ice loss differ substantially, we used a robust linear relationship between monthly-mean September sea-ice area and cumulative carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions to infer the future evolution of Arctic summer sea ice directly from the observational record. The observed linear relationship implies a sustained loss of 3 ± 0.3 square meters of September sea-ice area per metric ton of CO<sub>2</sub> emission. On the basis of this sensitivity, Arctic sea ice will be lost throughout September for an additional 1000 gigatons of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s show a lower sensitivity, which is possibly linked to an underestimation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>ed increase in incoming longwave radiation and of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>ed transient climate response.</p>

RNA G-quadruplexes are globally unfolded in eukaryotic cells and depleted in bacteria
<p>In vitro, some RNAs can form stable four-stranded structures known as G-quadruplexes.

Here, we identified thousands of mammalian RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong>s that can fold into G-quadruplexes in vitro, but in contrast to previous assumptions, these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong>s were overwhelmingly unfolded in cells.

Our results suggest that eukaryotes have a robust machinery that globally unfolds RNA G-quadruplexes, whereas some bacteria have instead undergone evolutionary depletion of G-quadruplex–forming sequences.</p>

Predicting Dynamic Metabolic Demands in the Photosynthetic Eukaryote <i>Chlorella vulgaris</i>
<p>Phototrophic organisms exhibit a highly dynamic proteome, adapting their biomass composition in response to diurnal light/dark cycles and nutrient availability. Here, we used experimentally determined biomass compositions over the course of growth to determine and constrain the biomass objective function (BOF) in a genome-scale metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> of <i>Chlorella vulgaris</i> UTEX 395 over time. Changes in the BOF, which encompasses all metabolites necessary to produce biomass, influence the state of the metabolic network thus directly affecting predictions. Simulations using dynamic BOFs predicted distinct proteome demands during heterotrophic or photoautotrophic growth. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>-driven analysis of extracellular nitrogen concentrations and predicted nitrogen uptake rates revealed an intracellular nitrogen pool, which contains 38% of the total nitrogen provided in the medium for photoautotrophic and 13% for heterotrophic growth. Agreement between flux and gene expression trends was determined by statistical comparison. Accordance between predicted flux trends and gene expression trends was found for 65% of multisubunit enzymes and 75% of allosteric reactions. Reactions with the highest agreement between simulations and experimental data were associated with energy metabolism, terpenoid biosynthesis, fatty acids, nucleotides, and amino acid metabolism. Furthermore, predicted flux distributions at each time point were compared with gene expression data to gain new insights into intracellular compartmentalization, specifically for transporters. A total of 103 genes related to internal transport reactions were identified and added to the updated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> of <i>C. vulgaris</i>, <i>i</i>CZ946, thus increasing our knowledgebase by 10% for this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> green alga.</p>

Diacylglycerol Acyltransferase 1 Is Regulated by Its N-Terminal Domain in Response to Allosteric Effectors
<p>Diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) is an integral membrane enzyme catalyzing the final and committed step in the acyl-coenzyme A (CoA)-dependent biosynthesis of triacylglycerol (TAG). The biochemical regulation of TAG assembly remains one of the least understood areas of primary metabolism to date. Here, we report that the hydrophilic N-terminal domain of <i>Brassica napus</i> DGAT1 (BnaDGAT1<sub>1-113</sub>) regulates activity based on acyl-CoA/CoA levels. The N-terminal domain is not necessary for acyltransferase activity and is composed of an intrinsically disordered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong> and a folded segment. We show that the disordered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong> has an autoinhibitory function and a dimerization interface, which appears to mediate positive cooperativity, whereas the folded segment of the cytosolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong> was found to have an allosteric site for acyl-CoA/CoA. Under increasing acyl-CoA levels, the binding of acyl-CoA with this noncatalytic site facilitates homotropic allosteric activation. Enzyme activation, on the other hand, is prevented under limiting acyl-CoA conditions (low acyl-CoA-to-CoA ratio), whereby CoA acts as a noncompetitive feedback inhibitor through interaction with the same folded segment. The three-dimensional NMR solution structure of the allosteric site revealed an α-helix with a loop connecting a coil fragment. The conserved amino acid residues in the loop interacting with CoA were identified, revealing details of this important regulatory element for allosteric regulation. Based on these results, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> is proposed illustrating the role of the N-terminal domain of BnaDGAT1 as a positive and negative modulator of TAG biosynthesis.</p>

Chloroplast Preproteins Bind to the Dimer Interface of the Toc159 Receptor during Import
<p>Most chloroplast proteins are synthesized in the cytosol as higher molecular weight preproteins and imported via the translocons in the outer (TOC) and inner (TIC) envelope membranes of chloroplasts. Toc159 functions as a primary receptor and directly binds preproteins through its dimeric GTPase domain. As a first step toward a molecular understanding of how Toc159 mediates preprotein import, we mapped the preprotein-binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong>s on the Toc159 GTPase domain (Toc159G) of pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) using cleavage by bound preproteins conjugated with the artificial protease FeBABE and cysteine-cysteine cross-linking. Our results show that residues at the dimer interface and the switch II <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong> of Toc159G are in close proximity to preproteins. The mature portion of preproteins was observed preferentially at the dimer interface, whereas the transit peptide was found at both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong>s equally. Chloroplasts from transgenic plants expressing engineered Toc159 with a cysteine placed at the dimer interface showed increased cross-linking to bound preproteins. Our data suggest that, during preprotein import, the Toc159G dimer disengages and the dimer interface contacts translocating preproteins, which is consistent with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> in which conformational changes induced by dimer-monomer conversion in Toc159 play a direct role in facilitating preprotein import.</p>

A Comprehensively Curated Genome-Scale Two-Cell Model for the Heterocystous Cyanobacterium <i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120
<p><i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120 is a nitrogen-fixing filamentous cyanobacterium. Under nitrogen-limiting conditions, a fraction of the vegetative cells in each filament terminally differentiate to nongrowing heterocysts. Heterocysts are metabolically and structurally specialized to enable O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive nitrogen fixation. The functionality of the filament, as an association of vegetative cells and heterocysts, is postulated to depend on metabolic exchange of electrons, carbon, and fixed nitrogen. In this study, we compile and evaluate a comprehensive curated stoichiometric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> of this two-cell system, with the objective function based on the growth of the filament under diazotrophic conditions. The predicted growth rate under nitrogen-replete and -deplete conditions, as well as the effect of external carbon and nitrogen sources, was thereafter verified. Furthermore, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> was utilized to comprehensively evaluate the optimality of putative metabolic exchange reactions between heterocysts and vegetative cells. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> suggested that optimal growth requires at least four exchange metabolites. Several combinations of exchange metabolites resulted in predicted growth rates that are higher than growth rates achieved by only considering exchange of metabolites previously suggested in the literature. The curated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> of the metabolic network of <i>Anabaena</i> sp.

Two antiparallel α-helices form a coiled-coil domain linked by a large extended connector loop containing a conserved trio of aromatic residues. The P-CR structure was fit into a molecular envelope for the P-CR domain derived from small-angle X-ray scattering data.

Progressive Recombination Suppression and Differentiation in Recently Evolved Neo-sex Chromosomes
<p>Recombination suppression leads to the structural and functional differentiation of sex chromosomes and is thus a crucial step in the process of sex chromosome evolution. Despite extensive theoretical work, the exact processes and mechanisms of recombination suppression and differentiation are not well understood. In threespine sticklebacks (<i>Gasterosteus aculeatus</i>), a different sex chromosome system has recently evolved by a fusion between the Y chromosome and an autosome in the Japan Sea lineage, which diverged from the ancestor of other lineages approximately 2 Ma. We investigated the evolutionary dynamics and differentiation processes of sex chromosomes based on comparative analyses of these divergent lineages using 63 microsatellite loci. Both chromosome-wide differentiation patterns and phylogenetic inferences with X and Y alleles indicated that the ancestral sex chromosomes were extensively differentiated before the divergence of these lineages. In contrast, genetic differentiation appeared to have proceeded only in a small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong> of the neo-sex chromosomes. The recombination maps constructed for the Japan Sea lineage indicated that recombination has been suppressed or reduced over a large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong> spanning the ancestral and neo-sex chromosomes. Chromosomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong>s exhibiting genetic differentiation and suppressed or reduced recombination were detected continuously and sequentially in the neo-sex chromosomes, suggesting that differentiation has gradually spread from the fusion point following the extension of recombination suppression. Our study illustrates an ongoing process of sex chromosome differentiation, providing empirical support for the theoretical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> postulating that recombination suppression and differentiation proceed in a gradual manner in the very early stage of sex chromosome evolution.</p>

Biomimetic shark skin: design, fabrication and hydrodynamic function
<p>Although the functional properties of shark skin have been of considerable interest to both biologists and engineers because of the complex hydrodynamic effects of surface roughness, no study to date has successfully fabricated a flexible biomimetic shark skin that allows detailed study of hydrodynamic function. We present the first study of the design, fabrication and hydrodynamic testing of a synthetic, flexible, shark skin membrane. A three-dimensional (3D) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> of shark skin denticles was constructed using micro-CT imaging of the skin of the shortfin mako (<i>Isurus oxyrinchus</i>). Using 3D printing, thousands of rigid synthetic shark denticles were placed on flexible membranes in a controlled, linear-arrayed pattern. This flexible 3D printed shark skin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> was then tested in water using a robotic flapping device that allowed us to either hold the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s in a stationary position or move them dynamically at their self-propelled swimming speed. Compared with a smooth control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> without denticles, the 3D printed shark skin showed increased swimming speed with reduced energy consumption under certain motion programs. For example, at a heave frequency of 1.5 Hz and an amplitude of ±1 cm, swimming speed increased by 6.6% and the energy cost-of-transport was reduced by 5.9%. In addition, a leading-edge vortex with greater vorticity than the smooth control was generated by the 3D printed shark skin, which may explain the increased swimming speeds. The ability to fabricate synthetic biomimetic shark skin opens up a wide array of possible manipulations of surface roughness parameters, and the ability to examine the hydrodynamic consequences of diverse skin denticle shapes present in different shark species.</p>

An inducible knockout mouse to model the cell-autonomous role of PTEN in initiating endometrial, prostate and thyroid neoplasias
<p><i>PTEN</i> is one of the most frequently mutated tumor suppressor genes in human cancers. The role of PTEN in carcinogenesis has been validated by knockout mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s. <i>PTEN</i> heterozygous mice develop neoplasms in multiple organs. Unfortunately, the embryonic lethality of biallelic excision of <i>PTEN</i> has inhibited the study of complete <i>PTEN</i> deletion in the development and progression of cancer. By crossing PTEN conditional knockout mice with transgenic mice expressing a tamoxifen-inducible Cre-ER<sup>T</sup> under the control of a chicken actin promoter, we have generated a tamoxifen-inducible mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> that allows temporal control of <i>PTEN</i> deletion. Interestingly, administration of a single dose of tamoxifen resulted in <i>PTEN</i> deletion mainly in epithelial cells, but not in stromal, mesenchymal or hematopoietic cells. Using the mT/mG double-fluorescent Cre reporter mice, we demonstrate that epithelial-specific <i>PTEN</i> excision was caused by differential Cre activity among tissues and cells types. Tamoxifen-induced deletion of <i>PTEN</i> resulted in extremely rapid and consistent formation of endometrial <i>in situ</i> adenocarcinoma, prostate intraepithelial neoplasia and thyroid hyperplasia. We also analyzed the role of PTEN ablation in other epithelial cells, such as the tubular cells of the kidney, hepatocytes, colonic epithelial cells or bronchiolar epithelium, but those tissues did not exhibit neoplastic growth. Finally, to validate this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> as a tool to assay the efficacy of anti-tumor drugs in PTEN deficiency, we administered the mTOR inhibitor everolimus to mice with induced <i>PTEN</i> deletion. Everolimus dramatically reduced the progression of endometrial proliferations and significantly reduced thyroid hyperplasia. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> could be a valuable tool to study the cell-autonomous mechanisms involved in PTEN-loss-induced carcinogenesis and provides a good platform to study the effect of anti-neoplastic drugs on PTEN-negative tumors.</p>

Development
Anteroposterior and dorsoventral patterning are coordinated by an identical patterning clock
<p>Establishment of the body plan in vertebrates depends on the temporally coordinated patterning of tissues along the body axes. We have previously shown that dorsoventral (DV) tissues are temporally patterned progressively from anterior to posterior by a BMP signaling pathway. Here we report that DV patterning along the zebrafish anteroposterior (AP) axis is temporally coordinated with AP patterning by an identical patterning clock. We altered AP patterning by inhibiting or activating FGF, Wnt or retinoic acid signaling combined with inhibition of BMP signaling at a series of developmental time points, which revealed that the temporal progression of DV patterning is directly coordinated with AP patterning. We investigated how these signaling pathways are integrated and suggest a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> for how DV and AP patterning are temporally coordinated. It has been shown that in <i>Xenopus</i> dorsal tissues FGF and Wnt signaling quell BMP signaling by degrading phosphorylated (P) Smad1/5, the BMP pathway signal transducer, via phosphorylation of the Smad1/5 linker <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong>. We show that in zebrafish FGF/MAPK, but not Wnt/GSK3, phosphorylation of the Smad1/5 linker <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong> localizes to a ventral vegetal gastrula <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">region</span></strong> that could coordinate DV patterning with AP patterning ventrally without degrading P-Smad1/5. Furthermore, we demonstrate that alteration of the MAPK phosphorylation sites in the Smad5 linker causes precocious patterning of DV tissues along the AP axis during gastrulation. Thus, DV and AP patterning are intimately coordinated to allow cells to acquire both positional and temporal information simultaneously.</p>

Vascular Smooth Muscle–Specific Progerin Expression Accelerates Atherosclerosis and Death in a Mouse Model of Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Progerin, an aberrant protein that accumulates with age, causes the rare genetic disease Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS). Patients who have HGPS exhibit ubiquitous progerin expression, accelerated aging and atherosclerosis, and die in their early teens, mainly of myocardial infarction or stroke. The mechanisms underlying progerin-induced atherosclerosis remain unexplored, in part, because of the lack of appropriate animal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We generated an atherosclerosis-prone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> of HGPS by crossing apolipoprotein E–deficient (<i>Apoe</i><sup>–/–</sup>) mice with <i>Lmna</i><sup><i>G609G/G609G</i></sup> mice ubiquitously expressing progerin. To induce progerin expression specifically in macrophages or vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), we crossed <i>Apoe</i><sup>–/–</sup><i>Lmna</i><sup><i>LCS/LCS</i></sup> mice with <i>LysMCre</i> and <i>SM22αCre</i> mice, respectively. Progerin expression was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence. Cardiovascular alterations were determined by immunofluorescence and histology in male mice fed normal chow or a high-fat diet. In vivo low-density lipoprotein retention was assessed by intravenous injection of fluorescently labeled human low-density lipoprotein. Cardiac electric defects were evaluated by electrocardiography.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p><i>Apoe</i><sup>–/–</sup><i>Lmna</i><sup><i>G609G/G609G</i></sup> mice with ubiquitous progerin expression exhibited a premature aging phenotype that included failure to thrive and shortened survival. In addition, high-fat diet–fed <i>Apoe</i><sup>–/–</sup><i>Lmna</i><sup><i>G609G/G609G</i></sup> mice developed a severe vascular pathology, including medial VSMC loss and lipid retention, adventitial fibrosis, and accelerated atherosclerosis, thus resembling most aspects of cardiovascular disease observed in patients with HGPS. The same vascular alterations were also observed in <i>Apoe</i><sup>–/–</sup><i>Lmna</i><sup><i>LCS/LCS</i></sup><i>SM22αCre</i> mice expressing progerin specifically in VSMCs, but not in <i>Apoe</i><sup>–/–</sup><i>Lmna</i><sup><i>LCS/LCS</i></sup><i>LysMCre</i> mice with macrophage-specific progerin expression. Moreover, <i>Apoe</i><sup>–/–</sup><i>Lmna</i><sup><i>LCS/LCS</i></sup><i>SM22αCre</i> mice had a shortened lifespan despite the lack of any overt aging phenotype. Aortas of ubiquitously and VSMC-specific progerin-expressing mice exhibited increased retention of fluorescently labeled human low-density lipoprotein, and atheromata in both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s showed vulnerable plaque features. Immunohistopathological examination indicated that <i>Apoe</i><sup>–/–</sup><i>Lmna</i><sup><i>LCS/LCS</i></sup><i>SM22αCre</i> mice, unlike <i>Apoe</i><sup>–/–</sup><i>Lmna</i><sup><i>G609G/G609G</i></sup> mice, die of atherosclerosis-related causes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We have generated the first mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> of progerin-induced atherosclerosis acceleration, and demonstrate that restricting progerin expression to VSMCs is sufficient to accelerate atherosclerosis, trigger plaque vulnerability, and reduce lifespan. Our results identify progerin-induced VSMC death as a major factor triggering atherosclerosis and premature death in HGPS.</p></sec>

Complement Receptor C5aR1 Plays an Evolutionarily Conserved Role in Successful Cardiac Regeneration
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Defining conserved molecular pathways in animal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s of successful cardiac regeneration could yield insight into why adult mammals have inadequate cardiac regeneration after injury. Insight into the transcriptomic landscape of early cardiac regeneration from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> organisms will shed light on evolutionarily conserved pathways in successful cardiac regeneration.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Here we describe a cross-species transcriptomic screen in 3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> organisms for cardiac regeneration: axolotl, neonatal mice, and zebrafish. Apical resection to remove ≈10% to 20% of ventricular mass was carried out in these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> organisms. RNA-sequencing analysis was performed on the hearts harvested at 3 time points: 12, 24, and 48 hours after resection. Sham surgery was used as internal control.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Genes associated with inflammatory processes were found to be upregulated in a conserved manner. Complement receptors (activated by complement components, part of the innate immune system) were found to be highly upregulated in all 3 species. This approach revealed induction of gene expression for complement 5a receptor 1 in the regenerating hearts of zebrafish, axolotls, and mice. Inhibition of complement 5a receptor 1 significantly attenuated the cardiomyocyte proliferative response to heart injury in all 3 species. Furthermore, after left ventricular apical resection, the cardiomyocyte proliferative response was diminished in mice with genetic deletion of complement 5a receptor 1.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These data reveal that activation of complement 5a receptor 1 mediates an evolutionarily conserved response that promotes cardiomyocyte proliferation after cardiac injury and identify complement pathway activation as a common pathway of successful heart regeneration.</p></sec>

A Novel α-Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide Analogue Protects Against End-Organ Damage in Experimental Hypertension, Cardiac Hypertrophy, and Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Research into the therapeutic potential of α-calcitonin gene–related peptide (α-CGRP) has been limited because of its peptide nature and short half-life. Here, we evaluate whether a novel potent and long-lasting (<i>t</i><sub>½</sub> ≥7 hours) acylated α-CGRP analogue (αAnalogue) could alleviate and reverse cardiovascular disease in 2 distinct murine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s of hypertension and heart failure in vivo.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The ability of the αAnalogue to act selectively via the CGRP pathway was shown in skin by using a CGRP receptor antagonist. The effect of the αAnalogue on angiotensin II–induced hypertension was investigated over 14 days. Blood pressure was measured by radiotelemetry. The ability of the αAnalogue to modulate heart failure was studied in an abdominal aortic constriction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> of murine cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure over 5 weeks. Extensive ex vivo analysis was performed via RNA analysis, Western blot, and histology.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The angiotensin II–induced hypertension was attenuated by cotreatment with the αAnalogue (50 nmol·kg<sup>–1</sup>·d<sup>–1</sup>, SC, at a dose selected for lack of long-term hypotensive effects at baseline). The αAnalogue protected against vascular, renal, and cardiac dysfunction, characterized by reduced hypertrophy and biomarkers of fibrosis, re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>ing, inflammation, and oxidative stress. In a separate study, the αAnalogue reversed angiotensin II–induced hypertension and associated vascular and cardiac damage. The αAnalogue was effective over 5 weeks in a murine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. It preserved heart function, assessed by echocardiography, while protecting against adverse cardiac re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>ing and apoptosis. Moreover, treatment with the αAnalogue was well tolerated with neither signs of desensitization nor behavioral changes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These findings, in 2 distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s, provide the first evidence for the therapeutic potential of a stabilized αAnalogue, by mediating (1) antihypertensive effects, (2) attenuating cardiac re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>ing, and (3) increasing angiogenesis and cell survival to protect against and limit damage associated with the progression of cardiovascular diseases. This indicates the therapeutic potential of the CGRP pathway and the possibility that this injectable CGRP analogue may be effective in cardiac disease.</p></sec>

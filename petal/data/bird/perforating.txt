A systematic review of Vancouver B2 and B3 periprosthetic femoral fractures
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the outcomes of Vancouver   type B2 and B3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perfor</span></strong>ming a systematic review of the   methods of surgical treatment which have been reported.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A systematic search was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perfor</span></strong>med in Ovid MEDLINE, Embase and   the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. For inclusion,   studies required a minimum of ten patients with a Vancouver type   B2 and/or ten patients with a Vancouver type B3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e, a minimum   mean follow-up of two years and outcomes which were matched to the type   of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e. Studies were also required to report the rate of re-operation   as an outcome measure. The protocol was registered in the PROSPERO   database. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 22 studies were included based on the eligibility   criteria, including 343 B2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es and 167 B3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es. The mean   follow-up ranged from 32 months to 74 months. </p><p>Of 343 Vancouver B2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es, the treatment in 298 (86.8%) involved   revision arthroplasty and 45 (12.6%) were treated with internal   fixation alone.

The management of open tibial fractures in children
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Following the introduction of national standards in 2009, most   major paediatric trauma is now triaged to specialist units offering   combined orthopaedic and plastic surgical expertise. We investigated   the management of open tibia <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es at a paediatric trauma centre,   primarily reporting the risk of infection and rate of union.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A retrospective review was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perfor</span></strong>med on 61 children who between   2007 and 2015 presented with an open tibia <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e. Their mean   age was nine years (2 to 16) and the median follow-up was ten months   (interquartile range 5 to 18). Management involved IV antibiotics,   early debridement and combined treatment of the skeletal and soft-tissue injuries   in line with standards proposed by the British Orthopaedic Association.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were 36 diaphyseal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es and 25 distal tibial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es.   Of the distal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es, eight involved the physis. Motor vehicle   collisions accounted for two thirds of the injuries and 38 patients   (62%) arrived outside of normal working hours. The initial method   of stabilisation comprised: casting in nine cases (15%); elastic   nailing in 19 (31%); Kirschner (K)-wiring in 13 (21%); intramedullary   nailing in one (2%); open reduction and plate fixation in four (7%); and   external fixation in 15 (25%). Wound management comprised: primary   wound closure in 24 (39%), delayed primary closure in 11 (18%),   split skin graft (SSG) in eight (13%), local flap with SSG in 17   (28%) and a free flap in one. A total of 43 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es (70%) were   Gustilo-Anderson grade III. There were four superficial (6.6%) and   three (4.9%) deep infections. Two deep infections occurred following   open reduction and plate fixation and the third after    K-wire fixation of a distal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e. No patient who underwent primary   wound closure developed an infection. All the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es united,   although nine patients required revision of a mono-lateral to circular   frame for delayed union (two) or for altered alignment or length   (seven). The mean time to union was two weeks longer in diaphyseal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es   than in distal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es (13 weeks <i>versus</i> 10.8   weeks, p<i> = </i>0.016). Children aged > 12 years had   a significantly longer time to union than those aged < 12 years   (16.3 weeks <i>versus</i> 11.4 weeks, p<i> = </i>0.045).   The length of stay in hospital for patients with a Gustilo-Anderson   grade IIIB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e was twice as long as for less severe injuries. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es in children heal better than those in adults. Based   on our experience of deep infection we discourage the use of internal   fixation with a plate for open tibial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es in children. We   advocate aggressive initial wound debridement in theatre with early   definitive combined orthopaedic and plastic surgery in order to   obtain skeletal stabilisation and soft-tissue cover.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:544–53.</p></sec>

Ceramic-on-ceramic bearing fractures in total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Ceramic-on-ceramic (CoC) bearings in total hip arthroplasty (THA)   are commonly used, but concerns exist regarding ceramic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e.   This study aims to report the risk of revision for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e of modern   CoC bearings and identify factors that might influence this risk,   using data from the National Joint Registry (NJR) for England, Wales, Northern   Ireland and the Isle of Man.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We analysed data on 223 362 bearings from 111 681 primary CoC   THAs and 182 linked revisions for bearing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e recorded in the   NJR. We used implant codes to identify ceramic bearing composition   and generated Kaplan-Meier estimates for implant survivorship. Logistic   regression analyses were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perfor</span></strong>med for implant size and patient specific   variables to determine any associated risks for revision.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 222 852 bearings (99.8%) were CeramTec Biolox products.   Revisions for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e were linked to seven of 79 442 (0.009%) Biolox   Delta heads, 38 of 31 982 (0.119%) Biolox Forte heads, 101 of 80   170 (0.126%) Biolox Delta liners and 35 of 31 258 (0.112%) Biolox   Forte liners. Regression analysis of implant size revealed smaller   heads had significantly higher odds of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e (chi-squared 68.0,   p < 0.001). The highest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e risk was observed in the 28 mm   Biolox Forte subgroup (0.382%). There were no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es in the 40   mm head group for either ceramic type. Liner thickness was not predictive   of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e (p = 0.67). Body mass index (BMI) was independently   associated with revision for both head <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es (odds ratio (OR)   1.09 per unit increase, p = 0.031) and liner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es (OR 1.06   per unit increase, p = 0.006). </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We report the largest independent study of CoC bearing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es   to date. The risk of revision for CoC bearing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e is very low   but previous studies have underestimated this risk. There is good   evidence that the latest generation of ceramic has greatly reduced   the odds of head <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e but not of liner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e.

A new and reliable classification system for fractures of the navicular and associated injuries to the midfoot
<sec><title>Aims</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es of the navicular can occur in isolation but, owing   to the intimate anatomical and biomechanical relationships, are   often associated with other injuries to the neighbouring bones and   joints in the foot. As a result, they can lead to long-term morbidity   and poor function. Our aim in this study was to identify patterns   of injury in a new classification system of traumatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es   of the navicular, with consideration being given to the commonly associated   injuries to the midfoot.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We undertook a retrospective review of 285 conse<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong>ive patients   presenting over an eight- year period with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e of the navicular.   Five common patterns of injury were identified and classified according   to the radiological features. Type 1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es are dorsal avulsion   injuries related to the capsule of the talonavicular joint. Type   2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es are isolated avulsion injuries to the tuberosity of   the navicular. Type 3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es are a variant of tarsometatarsal   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e/dislocations creating instability of the medial ray. Type   4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es involve the body of the navicular with no associated   injury to the lateral column and type 5 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es occur in conjunction   with disruption of the midtarsal joint with crushing of the medial   or lateral, or both, columns of the foot.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In order to test the reliability and reproducibility of this   new classification, a cohort of 30 patients with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e of the   navicular were classified by six independent assessors at two separate   times, six months apart. Interobserver reliability and intraobserver   reproducibility both had substantial agreement, with kappa values   of 0.80 and 0.72, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We propose a logical, all-inclusive, and mutually exclusive classification   system for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es of the navicular that gives associated injuries   involving the lateral column due consideration.

Tree Physiology
An empirical study of the wound effect on sap flux density measured with thermal dissipation probes
<p>The insertion of thermal dissipation (TD) sensors on tree stems for sap flux density (SFD) measurements can lead to SFD underestimations due to a wound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion close to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drill</span></strong> hole. However, the wound effect has not been assessed experimentally for this method yet. Here, we propose an empirical approach to investigate the effect of the wound healing on measured sap flux with TD probes. The approach was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perfor</span></strong>med for both, diffuse-porous (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i> (Linnaeus)) and ring-porous (<i>Quercus petraea</i> (Lieblein)) species. Thermal dissipation probes were installed on different dates along the growing season to document the effects of the dynamic wound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. The trees were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong> in autumn and additional sensors were installed in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong> stems, therefore, without potential effects of wound development. A range of water pressures was applied to the stem segments and SFDs were simultaneously measured by TD sensors as well as gravimetrically in the laboratory. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of wounds around sensors installed in living tree stems led to underestimation of SFD by 21.4 ± 3 and 47.5 ± 3.8% in beech and oak, respectively. The differences between SFD underestimations of diffuse-porous beech and ring-porous oak were, however, not statistically significant. Sensors with 5-, 11- and 22-week-old wounds also showed no significant differences, which implies that the influence of wound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion on SFD estimates was completed within the first few weeks after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perfor</span></strong>ation. These results were confirmed by time courses of SFD measurements in the field. Field SFD values decreased immediately after sensor installation and reached stable values after ~2 weeks with similar underestimations to the ones observed in the laboratory. We therefore propose a feasible approach to correct directly field observations of SFD for potential underestimations due to the wound effect.</p>

The prevention of a lateral hinge fracture as a complication of a medial opening wedge high tibial osteotomy
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We aimed to investigate factors related to the technique of medial   opening wedge high tibial osteotomy which might predispose to the   development of a lateral hinge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 71 patients with 82 osteotomies were included in the   study. Their mean age was 62.9 years (37 to 80). The classification   of the type of osteotomy was based on whether it extended beyond   the fibular head.

A sufficient osteotomy,   in which both anterior and posterior tibial cortices were involved   with extension into the lateral aspect of the plateau in relation   to an anteroposterior line tangential to the medial edge of the   fibular head in the CT axial plane, was seen in 48 knees (71.6%)   in those without a lateral hinge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e and in seven (46.7%) in   those with a lateral hinge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e.

Interferon Regulatory Factor 4 Inhibits Neointima Formation by Engaging Krüppel-Like Factor 4 Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The mechanisms underlying neointima <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion remain unclear. Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), which are key innate immune regulators, play important roles in cardiometabolic diseases. However, the function of IRF4 in arterial restenosis is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>IRF4 expression was first detected in human and mouse restenotic arteries. Then, the effects of IRF4 on neointima <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion were evaluated with universal IRF4-deficient mouse and rat carotid artery injury models. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perfor</span></strong>med immunostaining to identify IRF4-expressing cells in the lesions. Smooth muscle cell (SMC)–specific IRF4-knockout (KO) and -transgenic (TG) mice were generated to evaluate the effects of SMC-IRF4 on neointima <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. We used microarray, bioin<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ics analysis, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay to identify the downstream signals of IRF4 and to verify the targets in vitro. We compared SMC-IRF4-KO/Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4)–TG mice with SMC-IRF4-KO mice and SMC-specific IRF4-TG/KLF4-KO mice with SMC-specific IRF4-TG mice to investigate whether the effect of IRF4 on neointima <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion is KLF4-dependent. The effect of IRF4 on SMC phenotype switching was also evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>IRF4 expression in both the human and mouse restenotic arteries is eventually downregulated. Universal IRF4 ablation potentiates neointima <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion in both mice and rats. Immunostaining indicated that IRF4 was expressed primarily in SMCs in restenotic arteries. After injury, SMC-IRF4-KO mice developed a thicker neointima than control mice. This change was accompanied by increased SMC proliferation and migration. However, SMC-specific IRF4-TG mice exhibited the opposite phenotype, demonstrating that IRF4 exerts protective effects against neointima <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. The mechanistic study indicated that IRF4 promotes KLF4 expression by directly binding to its promoter. Genetic overexpression of KLF4 in SMCs largely reversed the neointima-promoting effect of IRF4 ablation, whereas ablation of KLF4 abolished the protective function of IRF4, indicating that the protective effects of IRF4 against neointima <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion are KLF4-dependent. In addition, IRF4 promoted SMC dedifferentiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>IRF4 protects arteries against neointima <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion by promoting the expression of KLF4 by directly binding to its promoter. Our findings suggest that this previously undiscovered IRF4-KLF4 axis plays a key role in vasculoproliferative pathology and may be a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of arterial restenosis.</p></sec>

Fault activation by hydraulic fracturing in western Canada
<p>Hydraulic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>ing has been inferred to trigger the majority of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inject</span></strong>ion-induced earthquakes in western Canada, in contrast to the Midwestern United States, where massive saltwater disposal is the dominant triggering mechanism. A template-based earthquake catalog from a seismically active Canadian shale play, combined with comprehensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inject</span></strong>ion data during a 4-month interval, shows that earthquakes are tightly clustered in space and time near hydraulic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>ing sites. The largest event [moment magnitude (<i>M</i><sub>W</sub>) 3.9] occurred several weeks after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inject</span></strong>ion along a fault that appears to extend from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inject</span></strong>ion zone into crystalline basement. Patterns of seismicity indicate that stress changes during operations can activate fault slip to an offset distance of >1 km, whereas pressurization by hydraulic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>ing into a fault yields episodic seismicity that can persist for months.</p>

A total of 38 had undergone   surgical fixation and 11 had been treated non-operatively; 13 patients   died at a mean of 10.2 years after THA (0.6 to 19). Patients were   assessed pre-operatively, at one year and at final follow-up (mean   9.1 years, 0.5 to 23) using the Oxford Hip Score (OHS). Implant   survivorship was assessed. An age and gender-matched cohort of THAs   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perfor</span></strong>med for non-traumatic osteoarthritis (OA) or avascular necrosis   (AVN) (n = 98) were used to compare complications and patient-reported outcome   measures (PROMs).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean time from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e to THA was significantly shorter   for patients with AVN    (2.2 years) or protrusio (2.2 years) than those with post-traumatic   OA (9.4 years) or infection (8.0 years) (p = 0.03).

Development
Development of the prethalamus is crucial for thalamocortical projection formation and is regulated by Olig2
<p>Thalamocortical axons (TCAs) pass through the prethalamus in the first step of their neural circuit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. Although it has been supposed that the prethalamus is an intermediate target for thalamocortical projection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion, much less is known about the molecular mechanisms of this targeting. Here, we demonstrated the functional implications of the prethalamus in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of this neural circuit. We show that Olig2 transcription factor, which is expressed in the ventricular zone (VZ) of prosomere 3, regulates prethalamus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion, and loss of Olig2 results in reduced prethalamus size in early development, which is accompanied by expansion of the thalamic eminence (TE). Extension of TCAs is disorganized in the <i>Olig2-KO</i> dorsal thalamus, and initial elongation of TCAs is retarded in the <i>Olig2-KO</i> forebrain. Microarray analysis demonstrated upregulation of several axon guidance molecules, including <i>Epha3</i> and <i>Epha5</i>, in the <i>Olig2-KO</i> basal forebrain. <i>In situ</i> hybridization showed that the prethalamus in the wild type excluded the expression of <i>Epha3</i> and <i>Epha5</i>, whereas loss of Olig2 resulted in reduction of this Ephas-negative area and the corresponding expansion of the Ephas-positive TE. Dissociated cultures of thalamic progenitor cells demonstrated that substrate-bound EphA3 suppresses neurite extension from dorsal thalamic neurons. These results indicate that Olig2 is involved in correct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of the prethalamus, which leads to exclusion of the EphA3-expressing region and is crucial for proper TCA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. Our observation is the first report showing the molecular mechanisms underlying how the prethalamus acts on initial thalamocortical projection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion.</p>

Hydraulic fracturing volume is associated with induced earthquake productivity in the Duvernay play
<p>A sharp increase in the frequency of earthquakes near Fox Creek, Alberta, began in December 2013 in response to hydraulic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>ing. Using a hydraulic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>ing database, we explore relationships between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inject</span></strong>ion parameters and seismicity response. We show that induced earthquakes are associated with completions that used larger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inject</span></strong>ion volumes (10<sup>4</sup> to 10<sup>5</sup> cubic meters) and that seismic productivity scales linearly with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inject</span></strong>ion volume. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inject</span></strong>ion pressure and rate have an insignificant association with seismic response. Further findings suggest that geological factors play a prominent role in seismic productivity, as evidenced by spatial correlations. Together, volume and geological factors account for ~96% of the variability in the induced earthquake rate near Fox Creek. This result is quantified by a seismogenic index–modified frequency-magnitude distribution, providing a framework to forecast induced seismicity.</p>

Surface uplift and time-dependent seismic hazard due to fluid injection in eastern Texas
<p>Observations that unequivocally link seismicity and wastewater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inject</span></strong>ion are scarce. Here we show that wastewater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inject</span></strong>ion in eastern Texas causes uplift, detectable in radar interferometric data up to >8 kilometers from the wells. Using measurements of uplift, reported <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inject</span></strong>ion data, and a poroelastic model, we computed the crustal strain and pore pressure. We infer that an increase of >1 megapascal in pore pressure in rocks with low compressibility triggers earthquakes, including the 4.8–moment magnitude event that occurred on 17 May 2012, the largest earthquake recorded in eastern Texas. Seismic activity increased even while <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inject</span></strong>ion rates declined, owing to diffusion of pore pressure from earlier periods with higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inject</span></strong>ion rates. Induced seismicity potential is suppressed where tight confining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ions prevent pore pressure from propagating into crystalline basement rocks.</p>

BZR1 Mediates Brassinosteroid-Induced Autophagy and Nitrogen Starvation in Tomato
<p>Autophagy, an innate cellular destructive mechanism, plays crucial roles in plant development and responses to stress. Autophagy is known to be stimulated or suppressed by multiple molecular processes, but the role of phytohormone signaling in autophagy is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the transcripts of autophagy-related genes (<i>ATGs</i>) and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of autophagosomes are triggered by enhanced levels of brassinosteroid (BR). Furthermore, the BR-activated transcription factor brassinazole-resistant1 (BZR1), a positive regulator of the BR signaling pathway, is involved in BR-induced autophagy. Treatment with BR enhanced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of autophagosomes and the transcripts of <i>ATGs</i> in <i>BZR1</i>-overexpressing plants, while the effects of BR were compromised in <i>BZR1</i>-silenced plants. Yeast one-hybrid analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with quantitative polymerase chain reaction revealed that BZR1 bound to the promoters of <i>ATG2</i> and <i>ATG6</i>. The BR-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of autophagosomes decreased in <i>ATG2</i>- and <i>ATG6</i>-silenced plants. Moreover, exogenous application of BR enhanced chlorophyll content and autophagosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion and decreased the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins under nitrogen starvation. Leaf chlorosis and chlorophyll degradation were exacerbated in <i>BZR1</i>-silenced plants and the BR biosynthetic mutant <i>d<sup>^im</sup></i> but were alleviated in <i>BZR1</i>- and <i>BZR1-1D</i>-overexpressing plants under nitrogen starvation. Meanwhile, nitrogen starvation-induced expression of <i>ATGs</i> and autophagosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion were compromised in both <i>BZR1</i>-silenced and <i>d<sup>^im</sup></i> plants but were increased in <i>BZR1</i>- and <i>BZR1-1D</i>-overexpressing plants. Taken together, our results suggest that BZR1-dependent BR signaling up-regulates the expression of <i>ATGs</i> and autophagosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion, which plays a critical role in the plant response to nitrogen starvation in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>).</p>

Wounding Triggers Callus Formation via Dynamic Hormonal and Transcriptional Changes
<p>Wounding is a primary trigger of organ regeneration, but how wound stress reactivates cell proliferation and promotes cellular reprogramming remains elusive. In this study, we combined transcriptome analysis with quantitative hormonal analysis to investigate how wounding induces callus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Our time course RNA-seq analysis revealed that wounding induces dynamic transcriptional changes, starting from rapid stress responses followed by the activation of metabolic processes and protein synthesis and subsequent activation of cell cycle regulators. Gene ontology analyses further uncovered that wounding modifies the expression of hormone biosynthesis and response genes, and quantitative analysis of endogenous plant hormones revealed accumulation of cytokinin prior to callus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. Mutants defective in cytokinin synthesis and signaling display reduced efficiency in callus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion, indicating that de novo synthesis of cytokinin is critical for wound-induced callus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. We further demonstrate that type-B ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR-mediated cytokinin signaling regulates the expression of <i>CYCLIN D3;1</i> (<i>CYCD3;1</i>) and that mutations in <i>CYCD3;1</i> and its homologs <i>CYCD3;2</i> and <i>3</i> cause defects in callus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. In addition to these hormone-mediated changes, our transcriptome data uncovered that wounding activates multiple developmental regulators, and we found novel roles of ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR 115 and PLETHORA3 (PLT3), PLT5, and PLT7 in callus generation. All together, these results provide novel mechanistic insights into how wounding reactivates cell proliferation during callus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion.</p>

Monogalactosyldiacylglycerol Facilitates Synthesis of Photoactive Protochlorophyllide in Etioplasts
<p>Cotyledon cells of dark-germinated angiosperms develop etioplasts that are plastids containing unique internal membranes called prolamellar bodies (PLBs). Protochlorophyllide (Pchlide), a precursor of chlorophyll, accumulates in PLBs and forms a ternary complex with NADPH and light-dependent NADPH:protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (LPOR), which allows for the rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of chlorophyll after illumination while avoiding photodamage. PLBs are 3D lattice structures formed by the lipid bilayer rich in monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG). Although MGDG was found to be required for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion and function of the thylakoid membrane in chloroplasts in various plants, the roles of MGDG in PLB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion and etioplast development are largely unknown. To analyze the roles of MGDG in etioplast development, we suppressed <i>MGD1</i> encoding the major isoform of MGDG synthase by using a dexamethasone-inducible artificial microRNA in etiolated Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings. Strong <i>MGD1</i> suppression caused a 36% loss of MGDG in etiolated seedlings, together with a 41% decrease in total Pchlide content. The loss of MGDG perturbed etioplast membrane structures and impaired the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of the photoactive Pchlide-LPOR-NADPH complex and its oligomerization, without affecting LPOR accumulation. The <i>MGD1</i> suppression also impaired the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of Pchlide from protoporphyrin IX via multiple enzymatic reactions in etioplast membranes, which suggests that MGDG is required for the membrane-associated processes in the Pchlide biosynthesis pathway. Suppressing <i>MGD1</i> at several germination stages revealed that MGDG biosynthesis at an early germination stage is particularly important for Pchlide accumulation. MGDG biosynthesis may provide a lipid matrix for Pchlide biosynthesis and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of Pchlide-LPOR complexes as an initial step of etioplast development.</p>

The incidence of nerve root injury by high-speed drill can be reduced by chilled saline irrigation in a rabbit model
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We aimed to evaluate the temperature around the nerve root during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drill</span></strong>ing of the lamina and to   determine whether irrigation during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drill</span></strong>ing can reduce the chance of nerve root injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Lumbar nerve roots were exposed to frictional heat by high-speed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drill</span></strong>ing of the lamina in a live   rabbit model, with saline (room temperature (RT) or chilled saline) or without saline (control)   irrigation. We measured temperatures surrounding the nerve root and made histological   evaluations.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In the control group, the mean temperature around the nerve root was 52.0°C (38.0°C to   75.5°C) after 60 seconds of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drill</span></strong>ing, and nerve root injuries were found in one out of 13   (7.7%) immediately, three out of 14 (21.4%) at three days, and 11 out of 25 (44.0%) at seven days   post-operatively. While the RT group showed a significantly lower temperature around the nerve root   compared with the control group (mean 46.5°C; 34.5°C to 66.9°C, p < 0.001), RT   saline failed to significantly reduce the incidence of nerve root injury (ten out of 26; 38.5%; odds   ratio (OR) 0.96; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.516 to 1.785; p = 0.563).

A new morphological classification for greater tuberosity fractures of the proximal humerus
<p>In this study, we describe a morphological classification   for greater tuberosity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es of the proximal humerus. We divided   these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es into three types: avulsion, split and depression.   We retrospectively reviewed all shoulder radiographs showing isolated   greater tuberosity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es in a Level I trauma centre between   July 2007 and July 2012. We identified 199 cases where records and   radiographs were reviewed and included 79 men and 120 women with   a mean age of 58 years (23 to 96). The morphological classification   was applied to the first 139 cases by three reviewers on two occasions   using the Kappa statistic and compared with the AO and Neer classifications.   The inter- and intra-observer reliability of the morphological classification   was 0.73 to 0.77 and 0.69 to 0.86, respectively. This was superior   to the Neer (0.31 to 0.35/0.54 to 0.63) and AO (0.30 to 0.32/0.59   to 0.65) classifications. The distribution of avulsion, split and   depression type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es was 39%, 41%, and 20%, respectively. This   classification of greater tuberosity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es is more reliable   than the Neer or AO classifications. These distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e morphologies   are likely to have implications in terms of pathophysiology and   surgical technique.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014;96-B:646–51.</p>

Microstructural Impact of Ischemia and Bone Marrow–Derived Cell Therapy Revealed With Diffusion Tensor Magnetic Resonance Imaging Tractography of the Heart In Vivo
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>The arrangement of myofibers in the heart is highly complex and must be replicated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inject</span></strong>ed cells to produce functional myocardium. A novel approach to characterize the microstructural response of the myocardium to ischemia and cell therapy, with the use of serial diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging tractography of the heart in vivo, is presented.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Validation of the approach was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perfor</span></strong>med in normal (n=6) and infarcted mice (n=6) as well as healthy human volunteers. Mice (n=12) were then <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inject</span></strong>ed with bone marrow mononuclear cells 3 weeks after coronary ligation. In half of the mice the donor and recipient strains were identical, and in half the strains were different. A positive response to cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inject</span></strong>ion was defined by a decrease in mean diffusivity, an increase in fractional anisotropy, and the appearance of new myofiber tracts with the correct orientation.

Oklahoma's induced seismicity strongly linked to wastewater injection depth
<p>The sharp rise in Oklahoma seismicity since 2009 is due to wastewater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inject</span></strong>ion. The role of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inject</span></strong>ion depth is an open, complex issue, yet critical for hazard assessment and regulation. We developed an advanced Bayesian network to model joint conditional dependencies between spatial, operational, and seismicity parameters. We found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inject</span></strong>ion depth relative to crystalline basement most strongly correlates with seismic moment release. The joint effects of depth and volume are critical, as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inject</span></strong>ion rate becomes more influential near the basement interface. Restricting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inject</span></strong>ion depths to 200 to 500 meters above basement could reduce annual seismic moment release by a factor of 1.4 to 2.8. Our approach enables identification of subregions where targeted regulation may mitigate effects of induced earthquakes, aiding operators and regulators in wastewater disposal regions.</p>

Increase in predator-prey size ratios throughout the Phanerozoic history of marine ecosystems
<p>The escalation hypothesis posits that predation by increasingly powerful and metabolically active carnivores has been a major driver of metazoan evolution. We test a key tenet of this hypothesis by analyzing predatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drill</span></strong> holes in fossil marine shells, which provide a ~500-million-year record of individual predator-prey interactions. We show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drill</span></strong>-hole size is a robust predictor of body size among modern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drill</span></strong>ing predators and that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drill</span></strong>-hole size (and thus inferred predator size and power) rose substantially from the Ordovician to the Quaternary period, whereas the size of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drill</span></strong>ed prey remained stable. Together, these trends indicate a directional increase in predator-prey size ratios. We hypothesize that increasing predator-prey size ratios reflect increases in prey abundance, prey nutrient content, and predation among predators.</p>

The formation of peak rings in large impact craters
<p>Large impacts provide a mechanism for resurfacing planets through mixing near-surface rocks with deeper material. Central peaks are formed from the dynamic uplift of rocks during crater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. As crater size increases, central peaks transition to peak rings. Without samples, debate surrounds the mechanics of peak-ring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion and their depth of origin. Chicxulub is the only known impact structure on Earth with an unequivocal peak ring, but it is buried and only accessible through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drill</span></strong>ing. Expedition 364 sampled the Chicxulub peak ring, which we found was formed from uplifted, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>ed, shocked, felsic basement rocks. The peak-ring rocks are cross-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong> by dikes and shear zones and have an unusually low density and seismic velocity. Large impacts therefore generate vertical fluxes and increase porosity in planetary crust.</p>

Synergistic Pectin Degradation and Guard Cell Pressurization Underlie Stomatal Pore Formation
<p>Stomatal pores are vital for the diffusion of gasses into and out of land plants and are, therefore, gatekeepers for photosynthesis and transpiration. Although much published literature has described the intercellular signaling and transcriptional regulators involved in early stomatal development, little is known about the cellular details of the local separation between sister guard cells that give rise to the stomatal pore or how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of this pore is achieved. Using three-dimensional (3D) time-lapse imaging, we found that stomatal pore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) is a highly dynamic process involving pore initiation and enlargement and traverses a set of morphological milestones in 3D. Confocal imaging data revealed an enrichment of exocytic machinery, de-methyl-esterified pectic homogalacturonan (HG), and an HG-degrading enzyme at future pore sites, suggesting that both localized HG deposition and degradation might function in pore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. By manipulating HG modification via enzymatic, chemical, and genetic perturbations in seedling cotyledons, we found that augmenting HG modification promotes pore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion, whereas preventing HG de-methyl-esterification delays pore initiation and inhibits pore enlargement. Through mechanical modeling and experimentation, we tested whether pore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion is an outcome of sister guard cells being pulled away from each other upon turgor increase. Osmotic treatment to reduce turgor pressure did not prevent pore initiation but did lessen pore enlargement. Together, these data provide evidence that HG delivery and modification, and guard cell pressurization, make functional contributions to stomatal pore initiation and enlargement.</p>

Transcriptional Roadmap to Seasonal Variation in Wood Formation of Norway Spruce
<p>Seasonal cues influence several aspects of the secondary growth of tree stems, including cambial activity, wood chemistry, and transition to latewood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. We investigated seasonal changes in cambial activity, secondary cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion, and tracheid cell death in woody tissues of Norway spruce (<i>Picea abies</i>) throughout one seasonal cycle. RNA sequencing was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perfor</span></strong>med simultaneously in both the xylem and cambium/phloem tissues of the stem. Principal component analysis revealed gradual shifts in the transcriptomes that followed a chronological order throughout the season. A notable remodeling of the transcriptome was observed in the winter, with many genes having maximal expression during the coldest months of the year. A highly coexpressed set of monolignol biosynthesis genes showed high expression during the period of secondary cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion as well as a second peak in midwinter. This midwinter peak in expression did not trigger lignin deposition, as determined by pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Coexpression consensus network analyses suggested the involvement of transcription factors belonging to the ASYMMETRIC LEAVES2/LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES and MYELOBLASTOSIS-HOMEOBOX families in the seasonal control of secondary cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of tracheids. Interestingly, the lifetime of the latewood tracheids stretched beyond the winter dormancy period, correlating with a lack of cell death-related gene expression. Our transcriptomic analyses combined with phylogenetic and microscopic analyses also identified the cellulose and lignin biosynthetic genes and putative regulators for latewood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion and tracheid cell death in Norway spruce, providing a toolbox for further physiological and functional assays of these important phase transitions.</p>

A Putative Protein <i>O</i>-Fucosyltransferase Facilitates Pollen Tube Penetration through the Stigma<i>–</i>Style Interface
<p>During pollen-pistil interactions in angiosperms, the male gametophyte (pollen) germinates to produce a pollen tube. To fertilize ovules located within the female pistil, the pollen tube must physically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">penetr</span></strong>ate specialized tissues. Whereas the process of pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">penetr</span></strong>ation through the pistil has been anatomically well described, the genetic regulation remains poorly understood. In this study, we identify a novel Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) gene, <i>O-FUCOSYLTRANSFERASE1</i> (<i>AtOFT1</i>), which plays a key role in pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">penetr</span></strong>ation through the stigma-style interface. Semi-in vivo growth assays demonstrate that <i>oft1</i> mutant pollen tubes have a reduced ability to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">penetr</span></strong>ate the stigma-style interface, leading to a nearly 2,000-fold decrease in <i>oft1</i> pollen transmission efficiency and a 5- to 10-fold decreased seed set. We also demonstrate that AtOFT1 is localized to the Golgi apparatus, indicating its potential role in cellular glycosylation events. Finally, we demonstrate that <i>AtOFT1</i> and other similar Arabidopsis genes represent a novel clade of sequences related to metazoan protein <i>O</i>-fucosyltransferases and that mutation of residues that are important for <i>O</i>-fucosyltransferase activity compromises AtOFT1 function in vivo. The results of this study elucidate a physiological function for AtOFT1 in pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">penetr</span></strong>ation through the stigma-style interface and highlight the potential importance of protein <i>O</i>-glycosylation events in pollen-pistil interactions.</p>

Regulation of Hormonal Control, Cell Reprogramming, and Patterning during De Novo Root Organogenesis
<p>Body regeneration through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of new organs is a major question in developmental biology. We investigated de novo root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion using whole leaves of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Our results show that local cytokinin biosynthesis and auxin biosynthesis in the leaf blade followed by auxin long-distance transport to the petiole leads to proliferation of J0121-marked xylem-associated tissues and others through signaling of INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID INDUCIBLE28 (IAA28), CRANE (IAA18), WOODEN LEG, and ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATORS1 (ARR1), ARR10, and ARR12. Vasculature proliferation also involves the cell cycle regulator KIP-RELATED PROTEIN2 and ABERRANT LATERAL ROOT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ION4, resulting in a mass of cells with rooting competence that resembles callus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. Endogenous callus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion precedes specification of postembryonic root founder cells, from which roots are initiated through the activity of SHORT-ROOT, PLETHORA1 (PLT1), and PLT2. Primordia initiation is blocked in <i>shr plt1 plt2</i> mutant. Stem cell regulators SCHIZORIZA, JACKDAW, BLUEJAY, and SCARECROW also participate in root initiation and are required to pattern the new organ, as mutants show disorganized and reduced number of layers and tissue initials resulting in reduced rooting. Our work provides an organ regeneration model through de novo root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion, stating key stages and the primary pathways involved.</p>

Here, we present the genetic evidence of the involvement of the <i>MIR319</i> and <i>TCP</i> gene families in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaf development. Single mutations in <i>MIR319A</i> and <i>MIR319B</i> genes moderately inhibited the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of leaf serrations, whereas double mutations increased the extent of this inhibition and resulted in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of smooth leaves. Mutations in <i>MIR319</i> and gain-of-function mutations in the <i>TCP4</i> gene conferred resistance against miR319 and impaired the cotyledon boundary and leaf serration <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. These mutations functionally associated with <i>CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON</i> genes, which regulate the cotyledon boundary and leaf serration <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. In contrast, loss-of-function mutations in miR319-targeted and nontargeted <i>TCP</i> genes cooperatively induced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of serrated leaves in addition to changes in the levels of their downstream gene transcript. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the <i>MIR319</i> and <i>TCP</i> gene families underlie robust and multilayer control of leaf development. This study also provides a framework toward future researches on redundant miRNAs and transcription factors in Arabidopsis and crop plants.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Cuticle Biosynthesis in Tomato Leaves Is Developmentally Regulated by Abscisic Acid
<p>The expansion of aerial organs in plants is coupled with the synthesis and deposition of a hydrophobic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong>icle, composed of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong>in and waxes, which is critically important in limiting water loss. While the abiotic stress-related hormone abscisic acid (ABA) is known to up-regulate wax accumulation in response to drought, the hormonal regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong>icle biosynthesis during organ ontogeny is poorly understood. To address the hypothesis that ABA also mediates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong>icle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion during organ development, we assessed the effect of ABA deficiency on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong>icle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion in three ABA biosynthesis-impaired tomato mutants. The mutant leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong>icles were thinner, had structural abnormalities, and had a substantial reduction in levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong>in. ABA deficiency also consistently resulted in differences in the composition of leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong>in and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong>icular waxes. Exogenous application of ABA partially rescued these phenotypes, confirming that they were a consequence of reduced ABA levels. The ABA mutants also showed reduced expression of genes involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong>in or wax <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. This difference was again countered by exogenous ABA, further indicating regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong>icle biosynthesis by ABA. The fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong>icles were affected differently by the ABA-associated mutations, but in general were thicker. However, no structural abnormalities were observed, and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong>in and wax compositions were less affected than in leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong>icles, suggesting that ABA action influences <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong>icle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion in an organ-dependent manner. These results suggest dual roles for ABA in regulating leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong>icle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion: one that is fundamentally associated with leaf expansion, independent of abiotic stress, and another that is drought induced.</p>

Prediction of the pre-morbid 3D anatomy of the proximal humerus based on statistical shape modelling
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Restoring the pre-morbid anatomy of the proximal humerus is a   goal of anatomical shoulder arthroplasty, but reliance is placed   on the surgeon’s experience and on anatomical estimations. The purpose   of this study was to present a novel method, ‘Statistical Shape   Modelling’, which accurately predicts the pre-morbid proximal humeral anatomy   and calculates the 3D geometric parameters needed to restore normal   anatomy in patients with severe degenerative osteoarthritis or a   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e of the proximal humerus.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>From a database of 57 humeral CT scans 3D humeral reconstructions   were manually created. The reconstructions were used to construct   a statistical shape model (SSM), which was then tested on a second   set of 52 scans. For each humerus in the second set, 3D reconstructions   of four diaphyseal segments of varying lengths were created. These   reconstructions were chosen to mimic severe osteoarthritis, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e   of the surgical neck of the humerus and a proximal humeral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e   with diaphyseal extension. The SSM was then applied to the diaphyseal   segments to see how well it predicted proximal morphology, using   the actual proximal humeral morphology for comparison.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>With the metaphysis included, mimicking osteoarthritis, the errors   of prediction for retroversion, inclination, height, radius of curvature   and posterior and medial offset of the head of the humerus were   2.9° (± 2.3°), 4.0° (± 3.3°), 1.0 mm (± 0.8 mm), 0.8 mm (± 0.6 mm),   0.7 mm (± 0.5 mm) and 1.0 mm (± 0.7 mm), respectively. With the   metaphysis excluded, mimicking a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e of the surgical neck,   the errors of prediction for retroversion, inclination, height, radius   of curvature and posterior and medial offset of the head of the   humerus were 3.8° (± 2.9°), 3.9° (± 3.4°), 2.4 mm (± 1.9 mm), 1.3   mm (± 0.9 mm), 0.8 mm    (± 0.5 mm) and 0.9 mm (± 0.6 mm), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study reports a novel, computerised method that accurately   predicts the pre-morbid proximal humeral anatomy even in challenging   situations. This in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion can be used in the surgical planning   and operative reconstruction of patients with severe degenerative   osteoarthritis or with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e of the proximal humerus.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:927–33.</p></sec>

Here, we aimed to develop a fully defined and clinically compatible system to differentiate hPSCs into ECs. Furthermore, we aimed to enhance cell survival, vessel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion, and therapeutic potential by encapsulating hPSC-ECs with a peptide amphiphile (PA) nanomatrix gel.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We induced differentiation of hPSCs into the mesodermal lineage by culturing on collagen-coated plates with a glycogen synthase kinase 3β inhibitor. Next, vascular endothelial growth factor, endothelial growth factor, and basic fibroblast growth factor were added for endothelial lineage differentiation, followed by sorting for CDH5 (VE-cadherin). We constructed an extracellular matrix–mimicking PA nanomatrix gel (PA-RGDS) by incorporating the cell adhesive ligand Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS) and a matrix metalloproteinase-2–degradable sequence. We then evaluated whether the encapsulation of hPSC-CDH5<sup>+</sup> cells in PA-RGDS could enhance long-term cell survival and vascular regenerative effects in a hind-limb ischemia model with laser Doppler perfusion imaging, bioluminescence imaging, real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction, and histological analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The resultant hPSC-derived CDH5<sup>+</sup> cells (hPSC-ECs) showed highly enriched and genuine EC characteristics and proangiogenic activities. When <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inject</span></strong>ed into ischemic hind limbs, hPSC-ECs showed better perfusion recovery and higher vessel-forming capacity compared with media-, PA-RGDS–, or human umbilical vein EC–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inject</span></strong>ed groups. However, the group receiving the PA-RGDS–encapsulated hPSC-ECs showed better perfusion recovery, more robust and longer cell survival (> 10 months), and higher and prolonged angiogenic and vascular incorporation capabilities than the bare hPSC-EC–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inject</span></strong>ed group. Surprisingly, the engrafted hPSC-ECs demonstrated previously unknown sustained and dynamic vessel-forming behavior: initial perivascular concentration, a guiding role for new vessel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion, and progressive incorporation into the vessels over 10 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We generated highly enriched hPSC-ECs via a clinically compatible system. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that a biocompatible PA-RGDS nanomatrix gel substantially improved long-term survival of hPSC-ECs in an ischemic environment and improved neovascularization effects of hPSC-ECs via prolonged and unique angiogenic and vessel-forming properties. This PA-RGDS–mediated transplantation of hPSC-ECs can serve as a novel platform for cell-based therapy and investigation of long-term behavior of hPSC-ECs.</p></sec>

Root Tip Shape Governs Root Elongation Rate under Increased Soil Strength
<p>Increased soil strength due to soil compaction or soil drying is a major limitation to root growth and crop productivity. Roots need to exert higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">penetr</span></strong>ation force, resulting in increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">penetr</span></strong>ation stress when elongating in soils of greater strength. This study aimed to quantify how the genotypic diversity of root tip geometry and root diameter influences root elongation under different levels of soil strength and to determine the extent to which roots adjust to increased soil strength. Fourteen wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) varieties were grown in soil columns packed to three bulk densities representing low, moderate, and high soil strength. Under moderate and high soil strength, smaller root tip radius-to-length ratio was correlated with higher genotypic root elongation rate, whereas root diameter was not related to genotypic root elongation. Based on cavity expansion theory, it was found that smaller root tip radius-to-length ratio reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">penetr</span></strong>ation stress, thus enabling higher root elongation rates in soils with greater strength. Furthermore, it was observed that roots could only partially adjust to increased soil strength. Root thickening was bounded by a maximum diameter, and root tips did not become more a<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong>e in response to increased soil strength. The obtained results demonstrated that root tip geometry is a pivotal trait governing root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">penetr</span></strong>ation stress and root elongation rate in soils of greater strength. Hence, root tip shape needs to be taken into account when selecting for crop varieties that may tolerate high soil strength.</p>

A Rice Ca<sup>2+</sup> Binding Protein Is Required for Tapetum Function and Pollen Formation
<p>In flowering plants, successful male reproduction requires the sophisticated interaction between somatic anther wall layers and reproductive cells. Timely degradation of the innermost tissue of the anther wall layer, the tapetal layer, is critical for pollen development. Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a well-known stimulus for plant development, but whether it plays a role in affecting male reproduction remains elusive. Here we report a role of Defective in Exine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion 1 (OsDEX1) in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), a Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding protein, in regulating rice tapetal cell degradation and pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. In <i>osdex1</i> anthers, tapetal cell degeneration is delayed and degradation of the callose wall surrounding the microspores is compromised, leading to aborted pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion and complete male sterility. <i>OsDEX1</i> is expressed in tapetal cells and microspores during early anther development. Recombinant OsDEX1 is able to bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> and regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in vitro, and <i>osdex1</i> exhibited disturbed Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in tapetal cells. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that OsDEX1 may have a conserved function in binding Ca<sup>2+</sup> in flowering plants, and genetic complementation of pollen wall defects of an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>dex1</i> mutant confirmed its evolutionary conservation in pollen development. Collectively, these findings suggest that OsDEX1 plays a fundamental role in the development of tapetal cells and pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion, possibly via modulating the Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis during pollen development.</p>

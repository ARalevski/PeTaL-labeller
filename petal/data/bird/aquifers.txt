Gastrointestinal and renal responses to variable water intake in whitebellied sunbirds and New Holland honeyeaters
<p>Nectarivores face a constant challenge in terms of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> balance, experiencing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> loading or dehydration when switching between food plants or between feeding and fasting. To understand how whitebellied sunbirds and New Holland honeyeaters meet the challenges of varying preformed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> load, we used the elimination of intramuscular-injected [<sup>14</sup>C]-<sc>l</sc>-glucose and <sup>3</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O to quantify intestinal and renal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> handling on diets varying in sugar concentration. Both sunbirds and honeyeaters showed significant modulation of intestinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> absorption, allowing excess <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> to be shunted through the intestine when on dilute diets. Despite reducing their fractional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> absorption, both species showed linear increases in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> flux and fractional body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> turnover as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> intake increased (both afternoon and morning), suggesting that the modulation of fractional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> absorption was not sufficient to completely offset dietary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> loads. In both species, glomerular filtration rate was independent of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> gain (but was higher for the afternoon), as was renal fractional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> reabsorption (measured in the afternoon). During the natural overnight fast, both sunbirds and honeyeaters arrested whole kidney function. Evaporative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> loss in sunbirds was variable but correlated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> gain. Both sunbirds and honeyeaters appear to modulate intestinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> absorption as an important component of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> regulation to help deal with massive preformed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> loads. Shutting down glomerular filtration rate during the overnight fast is another way of saving energy for osmoregulatory function. Birds maintain osmotic balance on diets varying markedly in preformed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> load by varying both intestinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> absorption and excretion through the intestine and kidneys.</p>

Components of Water Use Efficiency Have Unique Genetic Signatures in the Model C<sub>4</sub> Grass <i>Setaria</i>
<p>Plant growth and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> use are interrelated processes influenced by genetically controlled morphological and biochemical characteristics. Improving plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> use efficiency (WUE) to sustain growth in different environments is an important breeding objective that can improve crop yields and enhance agricultural sustainability. However, genetic improvement of WUE using traditional methods has proven difficult due to the low throughput and environmental heterogeneity of field settings. To overcome these limitations, this study utilizes a high-throughput phenotyping platform to quantify plant size and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> use of an interspecific <i>Setaria italica</i> × <i>Setaria viridis</i> recombinant inbred line population at daily intervals in both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>ed and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-limited conditions. Our findings indicate that measurements of plant size and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> use are correlated strongly in this system; therefore, a linear modeling approach was used to partition this relationship into predicted values of plant size given <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> use and deviations from this relationship at the genotype level. The resulting traits describing plant size, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> use, and WUE all were heritable and responsive to soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> availability, allowing for a genetic dissection of the components of plant WUE under different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>ing treatments. Linkage mapping identified major loci underlying two different pleiotropic components of WUE. This study indicates that alleles controlling WUE derived from both wild and domesticated accessions can be utilized to predictably modulate trait values given a specified precipitation regime in the model C<sub>4</sub> genus <i>Setaria</i>.</p>

Spatiotemporal Coupling of Vessel Cavitation and Discharge of Stored Xylem Water in a Tree Sapling
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> discharge from stem internal storage compartments is thought to minimize the risk of vessel cavitation. Based on this concept, one would expect that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> storage compartments involved in the buffering of xylem tensions empty before the onset of vessel cavitation under drought stress, and potentially refill after soil saturation. However, scant in vivo data exist that elucidate this localized spatiotemporal coupling. In this study on intact saplings of American chestnut (<i>Castanea dentata</i>), x-ray computed microtomography (microCT) showed that the xylem matrix surrounding vessels releases stored <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> and becomes air-filled either concurrent to or after vessel cavitation under progressive drought stress. Among annual growth rings, the xylem matrix of the current year remained largely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-filled even under severe drought stress. In comparison, microtomography images collected on excised stems showed that applied pressures of much greater than 0 MPa were required to induce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> release from the xylem matrix. Viability staining highlighted that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> release from the xylem matrix was associated primarily with emptying of dead fibers. Refilling of the xylem matrix and vessels was detected in intact saplings when the canopy was bagged and stem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> potential was close to 0 MPa, and in leafless saplings over the winter period. In conclusion, this study indicates that the bulk of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> stored in the xylem matrix is released after the onset of vessel cavitation, and suggests that capillary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> contributes to overall stem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> storage under drought but is not used primarily for the prevention of drought-induced vessel cavitation in this species.</p>

Comparison of Micropore Distribution in Cell Walls of Softwood and Hardwood Xylem
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">poros</span></strong>ity of wood cell walls is of interest for both understanding xylem functionality and from a wood materials perspective. The movement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> in xylem generally occurs through the macroporous networks formed in softwood by bordered pits and in hardwood by the intervessel pits and open conduits created by vessels and perforation plates. In some situations, such as cavitated xylem, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> can only move through the micropores that occur in lignified tracheid and fiber cell walls; however, these micropore networks are poorly understood. Here, we used molecular microscopy analysis of radiata pine (<i>Pinus radiata</i>) and red beech (<i>Nothofagus fusca</i>) to determine the distribution of micropores in the secondary walls and middle lamellae of tracheids and fibers in relation to cell wall composition. Using two different types of probe, we identified a greater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">poros</span></strong>ity of secondary cell walls and a reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">poros</span></strong>ity of the middle lamella. Areas of reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">poros</span></strong>ity were observed in the outer regions of the secondary cell wall of both tracheids and fibers that appear unrelated to lignification or the distribution of cellulose, mannan, and xylan. Hardwood fiber cell walls were less lignified than those of softwood tracheids and showed greater accessibility to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">poros</span></strong>ity probes. Vessel cell walls were comparable to those of fibers in terms of both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">poros</span></strong>ity and lignification. Lignification is probably the primary determinant of cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">poros</span></strong>ity in xylem. The highly lignified middle lamella, and lumen surface, act as a barrier to probe movement and, therefore, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> movement in both softwood and hardwood.</p>

Factoring stream turbulence into global assessments of nitrogen pollution
<p>The discharge of excess nitrogen to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stream</span></strong>s and rivers poses an existential threat to both humans and ecosystems. A seminal study of head<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stream</span></strong>s across the United States concluded that in-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stream</span></strong> removal of nitrate is controlled primarily by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stream</span></strong> chemistry and biology. Reanalysis of these data reveals that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stream</span></strong> turbulence (in particular, turbulent mass transfer across the concentration boundary layer) imposes a previously unrecognized upper limit on the rate at which nitrate is removed from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stream</span></strong>s. The upper limit closely approximates measured nitrate removal rates in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stream</span></strong>s with low concentrations of this pollutant, a discovery that should inform <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stream</span></strong> restoration designs and efforts to assess the effects of nitrogen pollution on receiving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> quality and the global nitrogen cycle.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Storage Compartments for Capillary Water Rarely Refill in an Intact Woody Plant
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> storage is thought to play an integral role in the maintenance of whole-plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> balance. The contribution of both living and dead cells to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> storage can be derived from rehydration and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-release curves on excised plant material, but the underlying tissue-specific emptying/refilling dynamics remain unclear. Here, we used x-ray computed microtomography to characterize the refilling of xylem fibers, pith cells, and vessels under both excised and in vivo conditions in <i>Laurus nobilis</i>. In excised stems supplied with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> uptake exhibited a biphasic response curve, and x-ray computed microtomography images showed that high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> storage capacitance was associated with fiber and pith refilling as driven by capillary forces: fibers refilled more rapidly than pith cells, while vessel refilling was minimal. In excised stems that were sealed, fiber and pith refilling was associated with vessel emptying, indicating a link between tissue connectivity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> storage. In contrast, refilling of fibers, pith cells, and vessels was negligible in intact saplings over two time scales, 24 h and 3 weeks. However, those compartments did refill slowly when the shoot was covered to prevent transpiration. Collectively, our data (1) provide direct evidence that storage compartments for capillary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> refill in excised stems but rarely under in vivo conditions, (2) highlight that estimates of capacitance from excised samples should be interpreted with caution, as certain storage compartments may not be utilized in the intact plant, and (3) question the paradigm that fibers play a substantial role in daily discharge/recharge of stem capacitance in an intact tree.</p>

Tree Physiology
Temperate tree species show identical response in tree water deficit but different sensitivities in sap flow to summer soil drying
<p>Temperate forests are expected to be particularly vulnerable to drought and soil drying because they are not adapted to such conditions and perform best in mesic environments. Here we ask (i) how sensitively four common temperate tree species (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i>, <i>Picea abies</i>, <i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i> and <i>Fraxinus excelsior</i>) res<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pond</span></strong> in their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> relations to summer soil drying and seek to determine (ii) if species-specific responses to summer soil drying are related to the onset of declining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> status across the four species. Throughout 2012 and 2013 we determined tree <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit (TWD) as a proxy for tree <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> status from recorded stem radius changes and monitored sap flow rates with sensors on 16 mature trees studied in the field at Lageren, Switzerland. All tree species res<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pond</span></strong>ed equally in their relative maximum TWD to the onset of declining soil moisture. This implies that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> supply of all tree species was affected by declining soil moisture and that none of the four species was able to fully maintain its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> status, e.g., by access to alternative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> sources in the soil. In contrast we found strong and highly species-specific responses of sap flow to declining soil moisture with the strongest decline in <i>P. abies</i> (92%), followed by <i>F. sylvatica</i> (53%) and <i>A. pseudoplatanus</i> (48%). <i>F. excelsior</i> did not significantly reduce sap flow. We hypothesize the species-specific responses in sap flow to declining soil moisture that occur despite a simultaneous increase in relative TWD in all species reflect how fast these species approach critical levels of their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> status, which is most likely influenced by species-specific traits determining the hydraulic properties of the species tree.</p>

Organ-coordinated response of early post-germination mahogany seedlings to drought
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit tolerance during post-germination stages is critical for seedling recruitment. In this work, we studied the effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit on morphological and biochemical responses in different organs of newly germinated mahogany (<i>Swietenia macrophylla</i> King) seedlings, a woody species that occurs in the Amazon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rain</span></strong>forest. The root : shoot ratio increased under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit. The leaf number and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> potential were not altered, although reductions in leaf area and stomatal conductance were observed. Osmotic potential became more negative in leaves of seedlings under severe stress. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit increased fructose, glucose, sucrose and myo-inositol levels in leaves. Stems accumulated fructose, glucose and <sc>l</sc>-proline. Nitric oxide (NO) levels increased in the vascular cylinder of roots under severe stress while superoxide anion levels decreased due to augmented superoxide dismutase activity in this organ. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit induced glutathione reductase activity in both roots and stems. Upon moderate or severe stress, catalase activity decreased in leaves and remained unaffected in the other seedling organs, allowing for an increase of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) levels in leaves. Overall, the increase of signaling molecules in distinct organs—NO in roots, <sc>l</sc>-proline in stems and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and myo-inositol in leaves—contributed to the response of mahogany seedlings to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit by triggering biochemical processes that resulted in the attenuation of oxidative stress and the establishment of osmotic adjustment. Therefore, this body of evidence reveals that the development of newly germinated mahogany seedlings may occur in both natural habitats and crop fields even when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> availability is greatly limited.</p>

Going with the Flow: Multiscale Insights into the Composite Nature of Water Transport in Roots
<p>As <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> often limits crop production, a more complete understanding of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> capture and transport is necessary. Here, we developed MECHA, a mathematical model that computes the flow of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> across the root at the scale of walls, membranes, and plasmodesmata of individual cells, and used it to test hypotheses related to root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> transport in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). The model uses detailed root anatomical descriptions and a minimal set of experimental cell properties, including the conductivity of plasma membranes, cell walls, and plasmodesmata, which yield quantitative and scale-consistent estimations of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> pathways and root radial hydraulic conductivity (<i>k</i><sub>r</sub>). MECHA revealed that the main<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stream</span></strong> hydraulic theories derived independently at the cell and root segment scales are compatible only if osmotic potentials within the apoplastic domains are uniform. The results suggested that the convection-diffusion of apoplastic solutes explained most of the offset between estimated <i>k</i><sub>r</sub> in pressure clamp and osmotic experiments, while the contribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-filled intercellular spaces was limited. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses quantified the relative impact of cortex and endodermis cell conductivity of plasma membranes on root <i>k</i><sub>r</sub> and suggested that only the latter contributed substantially to <i>k</i><sub>r</sub> due to the composite nature of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> flow across roots. The explicit root hydraulic anatomy framework brings insights into contradictory interpretations of experiments from the literature and suggests experiments to efficiently address questions pertaining to root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> relations. Its scale consistency opens avenues for cross-scale communication in the world of root hydraulics.</p>

Acclimation of <i>Betula alleghaniensis</i> Britton to moderate soil water deficit: small morphological changes make for important consequences in crown display
<p>In the context of the predicted increasing frequency of summer droughts in the northeastern deciduous forest of North America due to climate change, we investigated the acclimation capacity of yellow birch, an economically important native tree species, to soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit. We carried out an integrated examination of allocation of biomass, leaf physiology, branching pattern and in situ 3D crown display. Potted seedlings were subjected to moderate soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit for four consecutive months during their second growing season. Individuals under soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit showed a 40% decrease in biomass accumulation but no change in the relative allocation of biomass to the different plant compartments. Net CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rates at leaf level decreased under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit (~15%) but could not alone explain the total reduction in growth, excluding the carbon starvation hypothesis. The observed reduction in net CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rates was related to a decrease in stomatal conductance and chlorophyll content. <i>STAR</i><sub>zen</sub> (in situ silhouette to total leaf area ratio; a proxy for light interception efficiency) decreased under soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit due to shifts in biomass allocation within the branch compartment from long upper axes to short bottom axes. Despite the fact that the understanding of the processes involved in growth reduction and branching pattern alteration will need more attention in future research, we conclude that under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit yellow birch at young stages will: (i) experience a substantial loss of growth and biomass; and (ii) acclimate through architectural plasticity rather than through changes in the relative allocation of root biomass to enhance its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> management.</p>

Quantification of drought during the collapse of the classic Maya civilization
<p>The demise of Lowland Classic Maya civilization during the Terminal Classic Period (~800 to 1000 CE) is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong>-cited example of how past climate may have affected ancient societies. Attempts to estimate the magnitude of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrolog</span></strong>ic change, however, have met with equivocal success because of the qualitative and indirect nature of available climate proxy data. We reconstructed the past isotopic composition (δ<sup>18</sup>O, δD, <sup>17</sup>O-excess, and d-excess) of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lake</span></strong> Chichancanab, Mexico, using a technique that involves isotopic analysis of the structurally bound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> in sedimentary gypsum, which was deposited under drought conditions. The triple oxygen and hydrogen isotope data provide a direct measure of past changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lake</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrolog</span></strong>y. We modeled the data and conclude that annual precipitation decreased between 41 and 54% (with intervals of up to 70% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rain</span></strong>fall reduction during peak drought conditions) and that relative humidity declined by 2 to 7% compared to present-day conditions.</p>

Enhanced water permeability and tunable ion selectivity in subnanometer carbon nanotube porins

We report that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> permeability in 0.8-nanometer-diameter carbon nanotube porins (CNTPs), which confine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> down to a single-file chain, exceeds that of biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> transporters and of wider CNT pores by an order of magnitude. Intermolecular hydrogen-bond rearrangement, required for entry into the nanotube, dominates the energy barrier and can be manipulated to enhance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> transport rates. CNTPs block anion transport, even at salinities that exceed sea<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> levels, and their ion selectivity can be tuned to configure them into switchable ionic diodes. These properties make CNTPs a promising material for developing membrane separation technologies.</p>

Measuring gill paracellular permeability with polyethylene glycol-4000 in freely swimming trout: proof of principle
<p>The influence of swimming activity on gill paracellular permeability has not been measured previously in fishes. We critically assessed the use of tritium-labeled polyethylene glycol ([<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000) for this purpose, a substance that is also a classic marker for extracellular fluid volume, glomerular filtration rate and drinking rate. Tests (8 h) on resting fresh<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> trout showed that when measuring [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance from the plasma in the efflux direction, correction for a large excretion via glomerular filtration was essential, necessitating urinary catheterization. When measuring [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> in the influx direction, correction for a significant uptake by drinking was essential, necessitating terminal gut removal, whereas glomerular filtration losses were minimal. After correction for these alternate routes of loss and uptake, [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance rates by efflux from the plasma and by influx from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> were identical, showing that gill paracellular permeability is not rectified, and can be measured in either direction. The influx technique with terminal gut removal was used to assess gill paracellular permeability in trout without urinary catheters freely swimming at 1.2 body lengths s<sup>−1</sup> for 8 h. Branchial [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance rate (by influx from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>) increased significantly by ~80% in accord with a similar measured increase in O<sub>2</sub> consumption rate. Thus in trout, gill paracellular permeability does increase during exercise, in accord with the traditional concept of the osmorespiratory compromise.</p>

Combined effects of defoliation and water stress on pine growth and non-structural carbohydrates
<p>Climate change is expected to increase both pest insect damage and the occurrence of severe drought. There is therefore a need to better understand the combined effects of biotic and abiotic damage on tree growth in order to predict the multi-factorial effect of climate change on forest ecosystem productivity. Indeed, the effect of stress interactions on tree growth is an increasingly important topic that greatly lacks experiments and data, and it is unlikely that the impact of combined stresses can be extrapolated from the outcomes of studies that focused on a single stress. We developed an original manipulative study under real field conditions where we applied artificial defoliation and induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> stress on 10-year-old (∼10 m high) maritime pine trees (<i>Pinus pinaster</i> Ait.). Tree response to combined stresses was quantitatively assessed following tree secondary growth and carbohydrate pools. Such a design allowed us to address the crucial question of combined stresses on trees under stand conditions, sharing soil supplies with neighboring trees. Our initial hypotheses were that (i) moderate defoliation can limit the impact of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> stress on tree growth through reduced transpiration demand by a tree canopy partly defoliated and that (ii) defoliation results in reduced non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) pools, affecting tree tolerance to drought. Our results showed additive effects of defoliation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> stress on tree growth and contradict our initial hypothesis. Indeed, under stand conditions, we found that partial defoliation does not limit the impact of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> stress through reduced transpiration. Our study also highlighted that, even if NSC in all organs were affected by defoliation, tree response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> stress was not triggered. We found that stem NSC were maintained or increased during the entire growing season, supporting literature-based hypotheses such as an active maintenance of the hydraulic system or another limiting resource for tree growth under defoliation. We also observed a significant decrease in root carbohydrates, which suggests a shift in the root carbon balance under defoliation. The decrease in carbohydrate supply under defoliation may not counterbalance the carbon use for mineral and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> uptakes or a translocation to other tissues.</p>

Anomalously low dielectric constant of confined water

A liquid-liquid transition in supercooled aqueous solution related to the HDA-LDA transition
<p>Simulations and theory suggest that the thermodynamic anomalies of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> may be related to a phase transition between two supercooled liquid states, but so far this phase transition has not been observed experimentally because of preemptive ice crystallization. We used calorimetry, infrared spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-rich hydrazinium trifluoroacetate solution in which the local hydrogen bond structure surrounding a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> molecule resembles that in neat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> at elevated pressure, but which does not crystallize upon cooling. Instead, this solution underwent a sharp, reversible phase transition between two homogeneous liquid states. The hydrogen-bond structures of these two states are similar to those established for high- and low-density amorphous (HDA and LDA) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>. Such structural similarity supports theories that predict a similar sharp transition in pure <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> under pressure if ice crystallization could be suppressed.</p>

Water harvesting from air with metal-organic frameworks powered by natural sunlight

Vibrationally Promoted Dissociation of Water on Ni(111)

Carbonic Anhydrase Mutants in <i>Zea mays</i> Have Altered Stomatal Responses to Environmental Signals
<p>Stomata regulate transpirational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> loss and CO<sub>2</sub> uptake for photosynthesis in response to changing environmental conditions. Research investigating stomatal movement has mostly been conducted in C<sub>3</sub> eudicot species, which have very different CO<sub>2</sub> requirements for photosynthesis relative to C<sub>4</sub> grasses. Carbonic anhydrase (CA) catalyzes the hydration of CO<sub>2</sub>, and its activity has been linked to stomatal aperture regulation in eudicots. The number of <i>Ca</i> genes and their evolutionary history differ between monocots and dicots, and many questions remain unanswered about potential neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization of grass <i>Ca</i> paralogs and their roles in photosynthesis and stomatal conductance. To investigate the roles of different <i>Ca</i> genes in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), we examined stomatal responses in <i>ca1</i> and <i>ca2</i> single mutants as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> as a <i>ca1ca2</i> double mutant. The <i>ca1</i> and <i>ca2</i> single mutants had 10% and 87% of the CA activity exhibited by the wild type, respectively, while <i>ca1ca2</i> had less than 5% of wild-type CA activity. The <i>ca</i> mutants had higher stomatal conductance than the wild type and slower stomatal closure in response to increases in CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure. Contrary to previous reports in eudicots, <i>ca</i> mutants showed slowed stomatal closure in response to the light-dark transition and did not show differences in stomatal density compared with the wild type. These results implicate CA-mediated signaling in the control of stomatal movement but not stomatal development. Drought experiments with <i>ca1ca2</i> mutant plants suggest a role for CA in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-use efficiency and reveal that <i>Z. mays</i> is not optimized for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-use efficiency under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>ed conditions.</p>

Genetic Control of Plasticity in Root Morphology and Anatomy of Rice in Response to Water Deficit
<p>Elucidating the genetic control of rooting behavior under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-deficit stress is essential to breed climate-robust rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) cultivars. Using a diverse panel of 274 <i>indica</i> genotypes grown under control and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-deficit conditions during vegetative growth, we phenotyped 35 traits, mostly related to root morphology and anatomy, involving 45,000 root-scanning images and nearly 25,000 cross sections from the root-shoot junction. The phenotypic plasticity of these traits was quantified as the relative change in trait value under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-deficit compared with control conditions. We then carried out a genome-wide association analysis on these traits and their plasticity, using 45,608 high-quality single-nucleotide polymorphisms. One hundred four significant loci were detected for these traits under control conditions, 106 were detected under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-deficit stress, and 76 were detected for trait plasticity. We predicted 296 (control), 284 (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-deficit stress), and 233 (plasticity) a priori candidate genes within linkage disequilibrium blocks for these loci. We identified key a priori candidate genes regulating root growth and development and relevant alleles that, upon validation, can help improve rice adaptation to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-deficit stress.</p>

Stress-Related Gene Expression Reflects Morphophysiological Responses to Water Deficit
<p>Acclimation to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit (WD) enables plants to maintain growth under unfavorable environmental conditions, although the mechanisms are not completely understood. In this study, the natural variation of long-term acclimation to moderate and severe soil WD was investigated in 18 Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) accessions using PHENOPSIS, an automated phenotyping platform. Soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> content was adjusted at an early stage of plant development and maintained at a constant level until reproductive age was achieved. The accessions were selected based on the expression levels of <i>ANNEXIN1</i>, a drought-related marker. Severe WD conditions had a greater effect on most of the measured morphophysiological traits than moderate WD conditions. Multivariate analyses indicated that trait responses associated with plant size and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> management drove most of the variation. Accessions with similar responses at these two levels were grouped in clusters that displayed different response strategies to WD. The expression levels of selected stress-response genes revealed large natural variation under WD conditions. Responses of morphophysiological traits, such as projected rosette area, transpiration rate, and rosette <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> content, were correlated with changes in the expression of stress-related genes, such as <i>NINE-CIS-EPOXYCAROTENOID DIOXYGENASE3</i> and <i>N-MYC DOWNREGULATED-LIKE1</i> (<i>NDL1</i>), in response to WD. Interestingly, the morphophysiological acclimation response to WD also was reflected in the gene expression levels (most notably those of <i>NDL1</i>, <i>CHALCONE SYNTHASE</i>, and <i>MYB DOMAIN PROTEIN44</i>) in plants cultivated under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>ed conditions. Our results may lead to the development of biomarkers and predictors of plant morphophysiological responses based on gene expression patterns.</p>

Limited acclimation in leaf anatomy to experimental drought in tropical rainforest trees
<p>Dry periods are predicted to become more frequent and severe in the future in some parts of the tropics, including Amazonia, potentially causing reduced productivity, higher tree mortality and increased emissions of stored carbon. Using a long-term (12 year) through-fall exclusion (TFE) experiment in the tropics, we test the hypothesis that trees produce leaves adapted to cope with higher levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> stress, by examining the following leaf characteristics: area, thickness, leaf mass per area, vein density, stomatal density, the thickness of palisade mesophyll, spongy mesophyll and both of the epidermal layers, internal cavity volume and the average cell sizes of the palisade and spongy mesophyll. We also test whether differences in leaf anatomy are consistent with observed differential drought-induced mortality responses among taxa, and look for relationships between leaf anatomy, and leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> relations and gas exchange parameters. Our data show that trees do not produce leaves that are more xeromorphic in response to 12 years of soil moisture deficit. However, the drought treatment did result in increases in the thickness of the adaxial epidermis (TFE: 20.5 ± 1.5 µm, control: 16.7 ± 1.0 µm) and the internal cavity volume (TFE: 2.43 ± 0.50 mm<sup>3</sup> cm<sup>−2</sup>, control: 1.77 ± 0.30 mm<sup>3 </sup>cm<sup>−2</sup>). No consistent differences were detected between drought-resistant and drought-sensitive taxa, although interactions occurred between drought-sensitivity status and drought treatment for the palisade mesophyll thickness (<i>P</i> = 0.034) and the cavity volume of the leaves (<i>P</i> = 0.025). The limited response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit probably reflects a tight co-ordination between leaf morphology, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> relations and photosynthetic properties. This suggests that there is little plasticity in these aspects of plant anatomy in these taxa, and that phenotypic plasticity in leaf traits may not facilitate the acclimation of Amazonian trees to the predicted future reductions in dry season <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> availability.</p>

Temporal and spatial patterns of internal and external stem CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes in a sub-Mediterranean oak
<p>To accurately estimate stem respiration (<i>R</i><sub>S</sub>), measurements of both carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) efflux to the atmosphere (<i>E</i><sub>A</sub>) and internal CO<sub>2</sub> flux through xylem (<i>F</i><sub>T</sub>) are needed because xylem sap transports respired CO<sub>2</sub> upward. However, reports of seasonal dynamics of <i>F</i><sub>T</sub> and <i>E</i><sub>A</sub> are scarce and no studies exist in Mediterranean species under drought stress conditions. Internal and external CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes at three stem heights, together with radial stem growth, temperature, sap flow and shoot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> potential, were measured in <i>Quercus pyrenaica</i> Willd. in four measurement campaigns during one growing season. Substantial daytime depressions in temperature-normalized <i>E</i><sub>A</sub> were observed throughout the experiment, including prior to budburst, indicating that diel hysteresis between stem temperature and <i>E</i><sub>A</sub> cannot be uniquely ascribed to diversion of CO<sub>2</sub> in the transpiration <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stream</span></strong>. Low internal [CO<sub>2</sub>] (<0.5%) resulted in low contributions of <i>F</i><sub>T</sub> to <i>R</i><sub>S</sub> throughout the growing season, and <i>R</i><sub>S</sub> was mainly explained by <i>E</i><sub>A</sub> (>90%). Internal [CO<sub>2</sub>] was found to vary vertically along the stems. Seasonality in resistance to radial CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion was related to shoot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> potential. The low internal [CO<sub>2</sub>] and <i>F</i><sub>T</sub> observed in our study may result from the downregulation of xylem respiration in response to a legacy of coppicing as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> as high radial diffusion of CO<sub>2</sub> through cambium, phloem and bark tissues, which was related to low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> content of stems. Long-term studies analyzing temporal and spatial variation in internal and external CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes and their interactions are needed to mechanistically understand and model respiration of woody tissues.</p>

Atmospheric blocking as a traffic jam in the jet stream
<p>Atmospheric blocking due to anomalous, persistent meandering of the jet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stream</span></strong> often causes weather extremes in the mid-latitudes. Despite the ubiquity of blocking, the onset mechanism is not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> understood. Here we demonstrate a close analogy between blocking and traffic congestion on a highway by using meteorological data and show that blocking and traffic congestion can be described by a common mathematical theory. The theory predicts that the jet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stream</span></strong> has a capacity for the flux of wave activity (a measure of meandering), just as the highway has traffic capacity, and when the capacity is exceeded, blocking manifests as congestion. Stationary waves modulate the jet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stream</span></strong>’s capacity for transient waves and localize block formation. Climate change likely affects blocking frequency by modifying the jet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stream</span></strong>’s proximity to capacity.</p>

Thirst-associated preoptic neurons encode an aversive motivational drive
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deprivation produces a drive to seek and consume <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>. How neural activity creates this motivation remains poorly understood. We used activity-dependent genetic labeling to characterize neurons activated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deprivation in the hypothalamic median preoptic nucleus (MnPO). Single-cell transcriptional profiling revealed that dehydration-activated MnPO neurons consist of a single excitatory cell type. After optogenetic activation of these neurons, mice drank <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> and performed an operant lever-pressing task for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> reward with rates that scaled with stimulation frequency. This stimulation was aversive, and instrumentally pausing stimulation could reinforce lever-pressing. Activity of these neurons gradually decreased over the course of an operant session. Thus, the activity of dehydration-activated MnPO neurons establishes a scalable, persistent, and aversive internal state that dynamically controls thirst-motivated behavior.</p>

Hydrolytically stable fluorinated metal-organic frameworks for energy-efficient dehydration

The Hydrogen Isotope Composition δ<sup>2</sup>H Reflects Plant Performance
<p>The stable carbon (δ<sup>13</sup>C) and oxygen (δ<sup>18</sup>O) isotope compositions in plant matter reflect photosynthetic and transpirative conditions in plants, respectively. However, the nature of hydrogen isotope composition (δ<sup>2</sup>H) and what it reflects of plant performance is poorly understood. Using durum wheat (<i>Triticum turgidum</i> var <i>durum</i>), this study evaluated the effect of different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> and nitrogen growing field conditions on transpiration and how this effect influenced the performance of δ<sup>2</sup>H in autotrophic (flag leaf), mixotrophic (ears), and heterotrophic (g<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rain</span></strong>s and roots) organs. Moreover, δ<sup>2</sup>H was compared with the δ<sup>13</sup>C and δ<sup>18</sup>O in the same organs. Isotope compositions were analyzed in dry matter, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-soluble fraction, and in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> from different tissues of a set of genotypes. Similar to δ<sup>13</sup>C, the δ<sup>2</sup>H correlated negatively with stomatal conductance, whereas no correlation was observed for δ<sup>18</sup>O. Moreover, δ<sup>2</sup>H was not only affected by changes in transpiration but also by photosynthetic reactions, probably as a consequence of NADPH formation in autotrophic organs. Compared with the δ<sup>2</sup>H of stem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>, plant δ<sup>2</sup>H was strongly diminished in photosynthetic organs such as the flag leaves, whereas it strongly increased in heterotrophic organs such as g<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rain</span></strong>s and roots. In heterotrophic organs, δ<sup>2</sup>H was associated with postphotosynthetic effects because there are several processes that lead to <sup>2</sup>H-enrichment of carbohydrates. In summary, δ<sup>2</sup>H exhibited specific features that inform about the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> conditions of the wheat crop, together with the photosynthetic characteristics of the plant part considered. Moreover, correlations of δ<sup>2</sup>H with g<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rain</span></strong> yield illustrate that this isotope can be used to assess plant performance under different growing conditions.</p>

Hydraulics Regulate Stomatal Responses to Changes in Leaf Water Status in the Fern <i>Athyrium filix</i>-<i>femina</i>
<p>Stomatal responses to changes in leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> status are important for the diurnal regulation of gas exchange and the survival of plants during drought. These stomatal responses in angiosperm species are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> characterized, yet in species of nonseed plants, an ongoing debate surrounds the role of metabolism, particularly the role of the hormone abscisic acid (ABA), in functionally regulating stomatal responses to changes in leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> status. Here, we measured the stomatal response to changes in vapor pressure difference (VPD) in two natural forms of the fern species <i>Athyrium filix</i>-<i>femina</i>, recently suggested to have stomata that are regulated by ABA. The two forms measured had considerable differences in key hydraulic traits, including leaf hydraulic conductance and capacitance, as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> as the kinetics of stomatal response to changes in VPD. In both forms, the stomatal responses to VPD could be accurately predicted by a dynamic, mechanistic model that assumes guard cell turgor changes in concert with leaf turgor in the light, and not via metabolic processes including the level of ABA. During drought, endogenous ABA did not play a role in stomatal closure, and exogenous ABA applied to live, intact leaves did not induce stomatal closure. Our results indicate that functional stomatal responses to changes in leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> status in ferns are regulated by leaf hydraulics and not metabolism. With ferns being sister to seed plants, this result has implications for the evolutionary reconstruction of functional stomatal responses across vascular land plant lineages.</p>

Abscisic Acid Down-Regulates Hydraulic Conductance of Grapevine Leaves in Isohydric Genotypes Only<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plants evolved different strategies to cope with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> stress. While isohydric species maintain their midday leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> potential (Ψ<sub>M</sub>) under soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit by closing their stomata, anisohydric species maintain higher stomatal aperture and exhibit substantial reductions in Ψ<sub>M</sub>. It was hypothesized that isohydry is related to a locally higher sensitivity of stomata to the drought-hormone abscisic acid (ABA). Interestingly, recent lines of evidence in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) suggested that stomatal responsiveness is also controlled by an ABA action on leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> supply up<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stream</span></strong> from stomata. Here, we tested the possibility in grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) that different genotypes ranging from near isohydric to more anisohydric may have different sensitivities in these ABA responses. Measurements on whole plants in drought conditions were combined with assays on detached leaves fed with ABA. Two different methods consistently showed that leaf hydraulic conductance (K<sub>leaf</sub>) was down-regulated by exogenous ABA, with strong variations depending on the genotype. Importantly, variation between isohydry and anisohydry correlated with K<sub>leaf</sub> sensitivity to ABA, with K<sub>leaf</sub> in the most anisohydric genotypes being unresponsive to the hormone. We propose that the observed response of K<sub>leaf</sub> to ABA may be part of the overall ABA regulation of leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> status.</p>

A Dynamic Hydro-Mechanical and Biochemical Model of Stomatal Conductance for C<sub>4</sub> Photosynthesis

Plants lose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> through stomatal pores in order to acquire CO<sub>2</sub> (assimilation [<i>A</i>]) and control their carbon-for-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> balance by regulating stomatal conductance (<i>g</i><sub>S</sub>). The ability to mechanistically predict <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> and <i>A</i> in response to atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> availability, and time is critical for simulating stomatal control of plant-atmospheric carbon and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> exchange under current, past, or future environmental conditions. Yet, dynamic mechanistic models for <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> are lacking, especially for C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. We developed and coupled a hydromechanical model of stomatal behavior with a biochemical model of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis, calibrated using gas-exchange measurements in maize, and extended the coupled model with time-explicit functions to predict dynamic responses. We demonstrated the wider applicability of the model with three additional C<sub>4</sub> grass species in which interspecific differences in stomatal behavior could be accounted for by fitting a single parameter. The model accurately predicted steady-state responses of <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> to light, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and oxygen, soil drying, and evaporative demand as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> as dynamic responses to light intensity. Further analyses suggest that the effect of variable leaf hydraulic conductance is negligible. Based on the model, we derived a set of equations suitable for incorporation in land surface models. Our model illuminates the processes underpinning stomatal control in C<sub>4</sub> plants and suggests that the hydraulic benefits associated with fast stomatal responses of C<sub>4</sub> grasses may have supported the evolution of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis.</p>

Diurnal Variation in Gas Exchange: The Balance between Carbon Fixation and Water Loss
<p>Stomatal control of transpiration is critical for maintaining important processes, such as plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> status, leaf temperature, as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> as permitting sufficient CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion into the leaf to maintain photosynthetic rates (<i>A</i>). Stomatal conductance often closely correlates with <i>A</i> and is thought to control the balance between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> loss and carbon gain. It has been suggested that a mesophyll-driven signal coordinates <i>A</i> and stomatal conductance responses to maintain this relationship; however, the signal has yet to be fully elucidated. Despite this correlation under stable environmental conditions, the responses of both parameters vary spatially and temporally and are dependent on species, environment, and plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> status. Most current models neglect these aspects of gas exchange, although it is clear that they play a vital role in the balance of carbon fixation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> loss. Future efforts should consider the dynamic nature of whole-plant gas exchange and how it represents much more than the sum of its individual leaf-level components, and they should take into consideration the long-term effect on gas exchange over time.</p>

Variable Mesophyll Conductance among Soybean Cultivars Sets a Tradeoff between Photosynthesis and Water-Use-Efficiency
<p>Photosynthetic efficiency is a critical determinant of crop yield potential, although it remains below the theoretical optimum in modern crop varieties. Enhancing mesophyll conductance (i.e. the rate of carbon dioxide diffusion from substomatal cavities to the sites of carboxylation) may increase photosynthetic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> use efficiencies. To improve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> use efficiency, mesophyll conductance should be increased without concomitantly increasing stomatal conductance. Here, we partition the variance in mesophyll conductance to within- and among-cultivar components across soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) grown under both controlled and field conditions and examine the covariation of mesophyll conductance with photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> use efficiency, and leaf mass per area. We demonstrate that mesophyll conductance varies more than 2-fold and that 38% of this variation is due to cultivar identity. As expected, mesophyll conductance is positively correlated with photosynthetic rates. However, a strong positive correlation between mesophyll and stomatal conductance among cultivars apparently impedes positive scaling between mesophyll conductance and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> use efficiency in soybean. Contrary to expectations, photosynthetic rates and mesophyll conductance both increased with increasing leaf mass per area. The presence of genetic variation for mesophyll conductance suggests that there is potential to increase photosynthesis and mesophyll conductance by selecting for greater leaf mass per area. Increasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> use efficiency, though, is unlikely unless there is simultaneous stabilizing selection on stomatal conductance.</p>

Outside-Xylem Vulnerability, Not Xylem Embolism, Controls Leaf Hydraulic Decline during Dehydration<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[CC-BY]</sup></xref>
<p>Leaf hydraulic supply is crucial to maintaining open stomata for CO<sub>2</sub> capture and plant growth. During drought-induced dehydration, the leaf hydraulic conductance (<i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub>) declines, which contributes to stomatal closure and, eventually, to leaf death. Previous studies have tended to attribute the decline of <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> to embolism in the leaf vein xylem. We visualized at high resolution and quantified experimentally the hydraulic vulnerability of xylem and outside-xylem pathways and modeled their respective influences on plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> transport. Evidence from all approaches indicated that the decline of <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> during dehydration arose first and foremost due to the vulnerability of outside-xylem tissues. In vivo x-ray microcomputed tomography of dehydrating leaves of four diverse angiosperm species showed that, at the turgor loss point, only small fractions of leaf vein xylem conduits were embolized, and substantial xylem embolism arose only under severe dehydration. Experiments on an expanded set of eight angiosperm species showed that outside-xylem hydraulic vulnerability explained 75% to 100% of <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> decline across the range of dehydration from mild <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> stress to beyond turgor loss point. Spatially explicit modeling of leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> transport pointed to a role for reduced membrane conductivity consistent with published data for cells and tissues. Plant-scale modeling suggested that outside-xylem hydraulic vulnerability can protect the xylem from tensions that would induce embolism and disruption of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> transport under mild to moderate soil and atmospheric droughts. These findings pinpoint outside-xylem tissues as a central locus for the control of leaf and plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> transport during progressive drought.</p>

Stability of Single-Parent Gene Expression Complementation in Maize Hybrids upon Water Deficit Stress
<p>Heterosis is the superior performance of F1 hybrids compared with their homozygous, genetically distinct parents. In this study, we monitored the transcriptomic divergence of the maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) inbred lines B73 and Mo17 and their reciprocal F1 hybrid progeny in primary roots under control and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit conditions simulated by polyethylene glycol treatment. Single-parent expression (SPE) of genes is an extreme instance of gene expression complementation, in which genes are active in only one of two parents but are expressed in both reciprocal hybrids. In this study, 1,997 genes only expressed in B73 and 2,024 genes only expressed in Mo17 displayed SPE complementation under control and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit conditions. As a consequence, the number of active genes in hybrids exceeded the number of active genes in the parental inbred lines significantly independent of treatment. SPE patterns were substantially more stable to expression changes by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit treatment than other genotype-specific expression profiles. While, on average, 75% of all SPE patterns were not altered in response to polyethylene glycol treatment, only 17% of the remaining genotype-specific expression patterns were not changed by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit. Nonsyntenic genes that lack syntenic orthologs in other grass species, and thus evolved late in the grass lineage, were significantly overrepresented among SPE genes. Hence, the significant overrepresentation of nonsyntenic genes among SPE patterns and their stability under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> limitation might suggest a function of these genes during the early developmental manifestation of heterosis under fluctuating environmental conditions in hybrid progeny of the inbred lines B73 and Mo17.</p>

Xylem Surfactants Introduce a New Element to the Cohesion-Tension Theory
<p>Vascular plants transport <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> under negative pressure without constantly creating gas bubbles that would disable their hydraulic systems. Attempts to replicate this feat in artificial systems almost invariably result in bubble formation, except under highly controlled conditions with pure <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> and only hydrophilic surfaces present. In theory, conditions in the xylem should favor bubble nucleation even more: there are millions of conduits with at least some hydrophobic surfaces, and xylem sap is saturated or sometimes supersaturated with atmospheric gas and may contain surface-active molecules that can lower surface tension. So how do plants transport <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> under negative pressure? Here, we show that angiosperm xylem contains abundant hydrophobic surfaces as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> as insoluble lipid surfactants, including phospholipids, and proteins, a composition similar to pulmonary surfactants. Lipid surfactants were found in xylem sap and as nanoparticles under transmission electron microscopy in pores of intervessel pit membranes and deposited on vessel wall surfaces. Nanoparticles observed in xylem sap via nanoparticle-tracking analysis included surfactant-coated nanobubbles when examined by freeze-fracture electron microscopy. Based on their fracture behavior, this technique is able to distinguish between dense-core particles, liquid-filled, bilayer-coated vesicles/liposomes, and gas-filled bubbles. Xylem surfactants showed strong surface activity that reduces surface tension to low values when concentrated as they are in pit membrane pores. We hypothesize that xylem surfactants support <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> transport under negative pressure as explained by the cohesion-tension theory by coating hydrophobic surfaces and nanobubbles, thereby keeping the latter below the critical size at which bubbles would expand to form embolisms.</p>

The Chinese soft-shelled turtle, <i>Pelodiscus sinensis</i>, decreases nitrogenous excretion, reduces urea synthesis and suppresses ammonia production during emersion
<p>The objective of this study was to examine the effects of 6 days of emersion on nitrogen metabolism and excretion in the Chinese soft-shelled turtle, <i>Pelodiscus sinensis</i>. Despite having a soft shell with a cutaneous surface that is known to be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">permeabl</span></strong>e, <i>P. sinensis</i> lost only ~2% of body mass and was able to maintain its hematocrit and plasma osmolality, [Na<sup>+</sup>] and [Cl<sup>−</sup>] during 6 days of emersion. During emersion, it ameliorated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> loss by reducing urine output, which led to a reduction (by 29–76%) in ammonia excretion. In comparison, there was a more prominent reduction (by 82–99%) in urea excretion during emersion due to a lack of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> to flush the buccopharyngeal epithelium, which is known to be the major route of urea excretion. Consequently, emersion resulted in an apparent shift from ureotely to ammonotely in <i>P. sinensis</i>. Although urea concentration increased in several tissues, the excess urea accumulated could only account for 13–22% of the deficit in urea excretion. Hence, it can be concluded that a decrease (~80%) in urea synthesis occurred in <i>P. sinensis</i> during the 6 days of emersion. Indeed, emersion led to significant decreases in the activity of some ornithine–urea cycle enzymes (argininosuccinate synthetase/argininosuccinate lyase and arginase) from the liver of <i>P. sinensis</i>. As a decrease in urea synthesis occurred without the accumulation of ammonia and total free amino acids, it can be deduced that ammonia production through amino acid catabolism was suppressed with a proportional reduction in proteolysis in <i>P. sinensis</i> during emersion. Indeed, calculated results revealed that there could be a prominent decrease (~88%) in ammonia production in turtles after 6 days of emersion. In summary, despite being ureogenic and ureotelic in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>, <i>P. sinensis</i> adopted a reduction in ammonia production, instead of increased urea synthesis, as the major strategy to ameliorate ammonia toxicity and problems associated with dehydration during terrestrial exposure.</p>

Breakup of last glacial deep stratification in the South Pacific
<p>Stratification of the deep Southern Ocean during the Last Glacial Maximum is thought to have facilitated carbon storage and subsequent release during the deglaciation as stratification broke down, contributing to atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> rise.

Atomic-layered Au clusters on α-MoC as catalysts for the low-temperature water-gas shift reaction
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-gas shift (WGS) reaction (where carbon monoxide plus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> yields dihydrogen and carbon dioxide) is an essential process for hydrogen generation and carbon monoxide removal in various energy-related chemical operations.

Selective anaerobic oxidation of methane enables direct synthesis of methanol

The activation in helium at 673 kelvin (K), followed by consecutive catalyst exposures to 7 bars of methane and then <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> at 473 K, consistently produced 0.204 mole of CH<sub>3</sub>OH per mole of copper in zeolite.

Low Water Potential and At14a-Like1 (AFL1) Effects on Endocytosis and Actin Filament Organization
<p>At14a-Like1 (AFL1) is a stress-induced protein of unknown function that promotes growth during low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> potential stress and drought. Previous analysis indicated that AFL1 may have functions related to endocytosis and regulation of actin filament organization, processes for which the effects of low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> potential are little known. We found that low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> potential led to a decrease in endocytosis, as measured by uptake of the membrane-im<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">permeabl</span></strong>e dye FM4-64. Ectopic expression of AFL1 reversed the decrease in FM4-64 uptake seen in wild type, while reduced AFL1 expression led to further inhibition of FM4-64 uptake. Increased AFL1 also made FM4-64 uptake less sensitive to the actin filament disruptor Latrunculin B (LatB). LatB decreased AFL1-Clathrin Light Chain colocalization, further indicating that effects of AFL1 on endocytosis may be related to actin filament organization or stability. Consistent with this hypothesis, ectopic AFL1 expression made actin filaments less sensitive to disruption by LatB or Cytochalasin D and led to increased actin filament skewness and decreased occupancy, indicative of more bundled actin filaments. This latter effect could be partially mimicked by the actin filament stabilizer Jasplakinolide (JASP). However, AFL1 did not substantially inhibit actin filament dynamics, indicating that AFL1 acts via a different mechanism than JASP-induced stabilization. AFL1 partially colocalized with actin filaments but not with microtubules, further indicating actin-filament–related function of AFL1. These data provide insight into endocytosis and actin filament responses to low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> potential stress and demonstrate an involvement of AFL1 in these key cellular processes.</p>

The Causes of Leaf Hydraulic Vulnerability and Its Influence on Gas Exchange in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>The influence of the dynamics of leaf hydraulic conductance (<i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub>) diurnally and during dehydration on stomatal conductance and photosynthesis remains unclear. Using the model species Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> ecotype Columbia-0), we applied a multitiered approach including physiological measurements, high-resolution x-ray microcomputed tomography, and modeling at a range of scales to characterize (1) <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> decline during dehydration; (2) its basis in the hydraulic conductances of leaf xylem and outside-xylem pathways (<i>K</i><sub>ox</sub>); (3) the dependence of its dynamics on irradiance; (4) its impact on diurnal patterns of stomatal conductance and photosynthetic rate; and (5) its influence on gas exchange and survival under simulated drought regimes. Arabidopsis leaves showed strong vulnerability to dehydration diurnally in both gas exchange and hydraulic conductance, despite lack of xylem embolism or conduit collapse above the turgor loss point, indicating a pronounced sensitivity of <i>K</i><sub>ox</sub> to dehydration. <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> increased under higher irradiance in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong>-hydrated leaves across the full range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> potential, but no shift in <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> vulnerability was observed.

These findings for Columbia-0 provide a baseline for assessing variation across genotypes in hydraulic traits and their influence on gas exchange during dehydration.</p>

An in Vivo Imaging Assay Detects Spatial Variability in Glucose Release from Plant Roots
<p>Plants secrete a plethora of metabolites into the rhizosphere that allow them to obtain nutrients necessary for growth and modify microbial communities around the roots. Plants release considerable amounts of photosynthetically fixed carbon into the rhizosphere; hence, it is important to understand how carbon moves from the roots into the rhizosphere. Approaches used previously to address this question involved radioactive tracers, fluorescent probes, and biosensors to study sugar movement in the roots and into the rhizosphere. Although quite effective for studying sugar movement, it has been challenging to obtain data on spatial and temporal variability in sugar exudation using these techniques. In this study, we developed a gel-based enzyme-coupled colorimetric and fluorometric assay to image glucose (Glc) in vivo and used this assay to show that there is spatial variability in Glc release from plant roots. We found that the primary roots of maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) released more Glc from the base of the root than from the root tip and that the Glc release rate is reduced in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> stress. These findings were confirmed independently by quantifying Glc release in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>ed and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-stressed maize primary roots using high-performance anion-exchange chromatography. Additionally, we demonstrated differential patterns of Glc exudation in different monocot and eudicot plant species. These findings and their implications on root-rhizosphere interactions are discussed.</p>

Estimating Mesophyll Conductance from Measurements of C<sup>18</sup>OO Photosynthetic Discrimination and Carbonic Anhydrase Activity
<p>Carbonic anhydrase (CA) activity in leaves catalyzes the <sup>18</sup>O exchange between CO<sub>2</sub> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> during photosynthesis. This feature has been used to estimate the mesophyll conductance to CO<sub>2</sub> (<i>g</i><sub>m</sub>) from measurements of online C<sup>18</sup>OO photosynthetic discrimination (<sup>18</sup>O). Based on CA assays on leaf extracts, it has been argued that CO<sub>2</sub> in mesophyll cells should be in isotopic equilibrium with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> in most C<sub>3</sub> species as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">well</span></strong> as many C<sub>4</sub> dicot species. However, this seems incompatible with <sup>18</sup>O data that would indicate a much lower degree of equilibration, especially in C<sub>4</sub> plants under high light intensity. This apparent contradiction is resolved here using a new model of C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic discrimination that includes competition between CO<sub>2</sub> hydration and carboxylation and the contribution of respiratory fluxes. This new modeling framework is used to revisit previously published data sets on C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> species, including CA-deficient plants. We conclude that (1) newly <sup>18</sup>O-derived <i>g</i><sub>m</sub> values are usually close but significantly higher (typically 20% and up to 50%) than those derived assuming full equilibration and (2) despite the uncertainty associated with the respiration rate in light, or the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> isotope gradient between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells, robust estimates of <sup>18</sup>O-derived <i>g</i><sub>m</sub> can be achieved in both C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> plants.</p>

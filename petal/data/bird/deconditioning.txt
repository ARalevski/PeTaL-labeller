β-Arrestin–biased β-adrenergic signaling promotes extinction learning of cocaine reward memory
<p>Extinction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing of cocaine-associated contextual cues can help prevent cocaine addicts from relapsing. Pharmacological manipulation of β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) during extinction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing is being developed as a potential strategy to treat drug addiction. We demonstrated that the extinction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing of cocaine-associated memory was mediated by β-arrestin2–biased but not heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide–binding protein (G protein)–dependent β-adrenergic signaling. We found that administration of the nonbiased β-AR antagonist propranolol, but not the G protein–biased β-AR antagonist carvedilol, blocked extinction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing of cocaine-conditioned place preference and the associated ERK activation in the infralimbic prefrontal cortex. Overexpression of β-arrestin2 in the infralimbic prefrontal cortex promoted extinction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing, which was blocked by propranolol. Knockout of β-arrestin2 in the infralimbic prefrontal cortex, specifically in excitatory neurons, impaired extinction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing of cocaine-conditioned place preference, which was not rescued by carvedilol. β-Arrestin2 signaling in infralimbic excitatory neurons was also required for the extinction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing in the cocaine self-administration model. Our results suggest that β-arrestin–biased β-adrenergic signaling in the infralimbic prefrontal cortex regulates extinction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing of cocaine-associated memories and could be therapeutically targeted to treat addiction.</p>

Dynamic salience processing in paraventricular thalamus gates associative learning
<p>The salience of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>ally relevant stimuli is dynamic and influenced by internal state and external environment. Monitoring such changes is critical for effective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing and flexible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>, but the neuronal substrate for tracking the dynamics of stimulus salience is obscure. We found that neurons in the paraventricular thalamus (PVT) are robustly activated by a variety of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>ally relevant events, including novel (“unfamiliar”) stimuli, reinforcing stimuli and their predicting cues, as well as omission of the expected reward. PVT responses are scaled with stimulus intensity and modulated by changes in homeostatic state or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>al context. Inhibition of the PVT responses suppresses appetitive or aversive associative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing and reward extinction. Our findings demonstrate that the PVT gates associative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing by providing a dynamic representation of stimulus salience.</p>

Predator-driven natural selection on risk-taking behavior in anole lizards
<p>Biologists have long debated the role of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> in evolution, yet understanding of its role as a driver of adaptation is hampered by the scarcity of experimental studies of natural selection on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> in nature. After showing that individual <i>Anolis sagrei</i> lizards vary consistently in risk-taking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>s, we experimentally established populations on eight small islands either with or without <i>Leiocephalus carinatus</i>, a major ground predator. We found that selection predictably favors different risk-taking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>s under different treatments: Exploratory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> is favored in the absence of predators, whereas avoidance of the ground is favored in their presence. On predator islands, selection on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> is stronger than selection on morphology, whereas the opposite holds on islands without predators. Our field experiment demonstrates that selection can shape <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>al traits, paving the way toward adaptation to varying environmental contexts.</p>

Mind the gap: Neural coding of species identity in birdsong prosody
<p>Juvenile songbirds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong> vocal communication from adult tutors of the same species but not from adults of other species. How species-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing emerges from the basic features of song prosody remains unknown. In the zebra finch auditory cortex, we discovered a class of neurons that register the silent temporal gaps between song syllables and are distinct from neurons encoding syllable morphology. Behavioral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing and neuronal coding of temporal gap structure resisted song tutoring from other species: Zebra finches fostered by Bengalese finch parents <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ed Bengalese finch song morphology transposed onto zebra finch temporal gaps. During the vocal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing period, temporal gap neurons fired selectively to zebra finch song.

Epigenetics and the evolution of instincts

Intra- and interspecific challenges modulate cortisol but not androgen levels in a year-round territorial damselfish
<p>Interactions between individuals of different species are commonplace in animal communities. Some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>s displayed during these interspecific social interactions may be very similar to those displayed during intraspecific social interactions. However, whether functional analogies between intra- and interspecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>s translate at the proximate level into an overlap in their underlying endocrine mechanisms remains largely unknown. Because steroids both mediate social <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>s and respond to them, we approached this question by comparing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>al and steroid response of free-living dusky gregories (<i>Stegastes nigricans</i>) to standardized territorial intrusions (sTI) of either conspecific or heterospecific food competitors. <i>Stegastes nigricans</i> is a year-round territorial fish that ‘cultivates’ the algae on which it feeds and is highly aggressive to both intra- and interspecific intruders. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>al differences between intra- and interspecific aggressive responses to sTI were marginal, and sTI tests caused an increase in cortisol levels that was positively related with the levels of aggression. In contrast, androgen levels did not increase in response to sTI, yet they showed a positive relationship with agonistic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>. These results parallel a pattern that was first described for year-round territorial bird species. Furthermore, they suggest that changes in endocrine-hormone levels during territoriality might be independent of the species that induces the territorial response.</p>

Role of insulin signaling impairment, adiponectin and dyslipidemia in peripheral and central neuropathy in mice
<p>One of the tissues or organs affected by diabetes is the nervous system, predominantly the peripheral system (peripheral polyneuropathy and/or painful peripheral neuropathy) but also the central system with impaired <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing, memory and mental flexibility. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the pre-diabetic or diabetic condition caused by a high-fat diet (HFD) can damage both the peripheral and central nervous systems. Groups of C57BL6 and Swiss Webster mice were fed a diet containing 60% fat for 8 months and compared to control and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic groups that were fed a standard diet containing 10% fat. Aspects of peripheral nerve function (conduction velocity, thermal sensitivity) and central nervous system function (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing ability, memory) were measured at assorted times during the study. Both strains of mice on HFD developed impaired glucose tolerance, indicative of insulin resistance, but only the C57BL6 mice showed statistically significant hyperglycemia. STZ-diabetic C57BL6 mice developed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing deficits in the Barnes maze after 8 weeks of diabetes, whereas neither C57BL6 nor Swiss Webster mice fed a HFD showed signs of defects at that time point. By 6 months on HFD, Swiss Webster mice developed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing and memory deficits in the Barnes maze test, whereas their peripheral nervous system remained normal. In contrast, C57BL6 mice fed the HFD developed peripheral nerve dysfunction, as indicated by nerve conduction slowing and thermal hyperalgesia, but showed normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing and memory functions. Our data indicate that STZ-induced diabetes or a HFD can damage both peripheral and central nervous systems, but <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing deficits develop more rapidly in insulin-deficient than in insulin-resistant conditions and only in Swiss Webster mice. In addition to insulin impairment, dyslipidemia or adiponectinemia might determine the neuropathy phenotype.</p>

Insular cortex processes aversive somatosensory information and is crucial for threat learning
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing about threats is essential for survival. During threat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing, an innocuous sensory percept such as a tone acquires an emotional meaning when paired with an aversive stimulus such as a mild footshock. The amygdala is critical for threat memory formation, but little is known about upstream brain areas that process aversive somatosensory information. Using optogenetic techniques in mice, we found that silencing of the posterior insula during footshock reduced acute fear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> and impaired 1-day threat memory. Insular cortex neurons respond to footshocks, acquire responses to tones during threat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing, and project to distinct amygdala divisions to drive acute fear versus threat memory formation. Thus, the posterior insula conveys aversive footshock information to the amygdala and is crucial for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing about potential dangers in the environment.</p>

Sustained rescue of prefrontal circuit dysfunction by antidepressant-induced spine formation
<p>The neurobiological mechanisms underlying the induction and remission of depressive episodes over time are not well understood.

Depression-related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> was associated with targeted, branch-specific elimination of postsynaptic dendritic spines on prefrontal projection neurons. Antidepressant-dose ketamine reversed these effects by selectively rescuing eliminated spines and restoring coordinated activity in multicellular ensembles that predict motivated escape <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>. Prefrontal spinogenesis was required for the long-term maintenance of antidepressant effects on motivated escape <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> but not for their initial induction.</p>

Dopamine neurons encode performance error in singing birds
<p>Many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>s are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ed through trial and error by matching performance to internal goals. Yet neural mechanisms of performance evaluation remain poorly understood. We recorded basal ganglia–projecting dopamine neurons in singing zebra finches as we controlled perceived song quality with distorted auditory feedback. Dopamine activity was phasically suppressed after distorted syllables, consistent with a worse-than-predicted outcome, and was phasically activated at the precise moment of the song when a predicted distortion did not occur, consistent with a better-than-predicted outcome. Error response magnitude depended on distortion probability. Thus, dopaminergic error signals can evaluate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>s that are not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ed for reward and are instead <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ed by matching performance outcomes to internal goals.</p>

Neurohormonal changes associated with ritualized combat and the formation of a reproductive hierarchy in the ant <i>Harpegnathos saltator</i>
<p>Dominance rank in animal societies is correlated with changes in both reproductive physiology and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>. In some social insects, dominance status is used to determine a reproductive division of labor, where a few colony members reproduce while most remain functionally sterile. Changes in reproduction and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> in this context must be coordinated through crosstalk between the brain and the reproductive system. We investigated a role for biogenic amines in forming this connection in the ant <i>Harpegnathos saltator</i>. In this species, workers engage in an elaborate dominance tournament to establish a group of reproductive workers termed gamergates. We analyzed biogenic amine content in the brains of gamergates, inside-workers and foragers under stable colony conditions and found that gamergates had the highest levels of dopamine. Dopamine levels were also positively correlated with increased ovarian activity among gamergates. Next, we experimentally induced workers to compete in a reproductive tournament to determine how dopamine may be involved in the establishment of a new hierarchy. Dopamine levels rose in aggressive workers at the start of a tournament, while workers that were policed by their nestmates (a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> that inhibits ovarian activity) showed a rapid decline in dopamine. In addition to dopamine, levels of serotonin and tyramine differed among castes, and these changes could contribute to differences in caste-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>al patterns observed among non-reproductive workers. Overall, these results provide support that biogenic amines link changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> and dominance with reproductive activity in <i>H. saltator</i> as well as drive differences in worker task performance.</p>

Learning-dependent chromatin remodeling highlights noncoding regulatory regions linked to autism
<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder that is associated with genetic risk factors. Most human disease-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are not located in genes but rather are in regulatory regions that control gene expression. The function of regulatory regions is determined through epigenetic mechanisms. Parallels between the cellular basis of development and the formation of long-term memory have long been recognized, particularly the role of epigenetic mechanisms in both processes. We analyzed how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing alters chromatin accessibility in the mouse hippocampus using a new high-throughput sequencing bioinformatics strategy we call DEScan (differential enrichment scan). DEScan, which enabled the analysis of data from epigenomic experiments containing multiple replicates, revealed changes in chromatin accessibility at 2365 regulatory regions—most of which were promoters. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing-regulated promoters were active during forebrain development in mice and were enriched in epigenetic modifications indicative of bivalent promoters. These promoters were disproportionally intronic, showed a complex relationship with gene expression and alternative splicing during memory consolidation and retrieval, and were enriched in the data set relative to known ASD risk genes. Genotyping in a clinical cohort within one of these promoters (<i>SHANK3</i> promoter 6) revealed that the SNP rs6010065 was associated with ASD. Our data support the idea that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing recapitulates development at the epigenetic level and demonstrate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>ally induced epigenetic changes in mice can highlight regulatory regions relevant to brain disorders in patients.</p>

Motor cortical control of vocal interaction in neotropical singing mice

We identify an orofacial motor cortical region and, via a series of perturbation experiments, demonstrate a hierarchical control of vocal production, with the motor cortex influencing the pacing of singing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> on a moment-by-moment basis, enabling precise vocal interactions. These results suggest a systems-level framework for understanding the sensorimotor transformations that underlie natural social interactions.</p>

Intense threat switches dorsal raphe serotonin neurons to a paradoxical operational mode
<p>Survival depends on the selection of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>s adaptive for the current environment. For example, a mouse should run from a rapidly looming hawk but should freeze if the hawk is coasting across the sky. Although serotonin has been implicated in adaptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>, environmental regulation of its functional role remains poorly understood. In mice, we found that stimulation of dorsal raphe serotonin neurons suppressed movement in low- and moderate-threat environments but induced escape <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> in high-threat environments, and that movement-related dorsal raphe serotonin neural dynamics inverted in high-threat environments. Stimulation of dorsal raphe γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons promoted movement in negative but not positive environments, and movement-related GABA neural dynamics inverted between positive and negative environments. Thus, dorsal raphe circuits switch between distinct operational modes to promote environment-specific adaptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>s.</p>

Cell-autonomous clock of astrocytes drives circadian behavior in mammals

We describe cell type–specific, functionally distinct TTFLs in neurons and astrocytes of the SCN and show that, in the absence of other cellular clocks, the cell-autonomous astrocytic TTFL alone can drive molecular oscillations in the SCN and circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> in mice. Astrocytic clocks achieve this by reinstating clock gene expression and circadian function of SCN neurons via glutamatergic signals.

In the field, imidacloprid impairs colony thermoregulation, including the construction of an insulating wax canopy.

The hidden simplicity of subduction megathrust earthquakes

Here we use three source time function (STF) data sets for subduction zone earthquakes, with moment magnitude <i>M</i><sub>w </sub>≥ 7, and show that such large ruptures share a typical universal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>. The median STF is scalable between events with different sizes, grows linearly, and is nearly triangular. The deviations from the median <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> are multiplicative and Gaussian—that is, they are proportionally larger for larger events. Our observations suggest that earthquake magnitudes cannot be predicted from the characteristics of rupture onsets.</p>

Wire together, fire apart
<p>The ability to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong> and remember new experiences lies at the heart of our existence. After all, we are our memories. It has been widely accepted that memories are formed and stored via strengthening of neural connections due to the correlated activities of neurons, where presumably one neuron is causing or at least contributing to the activity of another connecting neuron and hence becomes associated with it. This principle is known as the Hebbian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing rule (<i>1</i>): i.e., if interconnected neurons become active very close in time during a particular event, their connection strengthens and “a memory” of this event is formed (<i>1</i>). In other words, “neurons wire together, if they fire together” (<i>2</i>). Thus, neural connection must show some sort of plasticity—i.e., an ability to be modified based on the mutual firing patterns of interconnected neurons—in order to form memories and associations. Indeed, it has been shown that brief (hundreds of milliseconds) stimulations of interconnected neurons significantly improve signal transmission between the two, a phenomenon known as long-term potentiation (LTP). On page 1033 of this issue, Bittner <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) describe a different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing mechanism called <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>al time scale synaptic plasticity (BTSP), which spans a considerably longer time course of several seconds, implying that no causal relationship of interconnected neurons may be necessary to form long-lasting associations between them.</p>

Conversion of object identity to object-general semantic value in the primate temporal cortex
<p>At the final stage of the ventral visual stream, perirhinal neurons encode the identity of memorized objects through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing. However, it remains elusive whether and how object percepts alone, or concomitantly a nonphysical attribute of the objects (“<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ed”), are decoded from perirhinal activities. By combining monkey psychophysics with optogenetic and electrical stimulations, we found a focal spot of memory neurons where both stimulations led monkeys to preferentially judge presented objects as “already seen.” In an adjacent fringe area, where neurons did not exhibit selective responses to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ed objects, electrical stimulation induced the opposite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>al bias toward “never seen before,” whereas optogenetic stimulation still induced bias toward “already seen.” These results suggest that mnemonic judgment of objects emerges via the decoding of their nonphysical attributes encoded by perirhinal neurons.</p>

Coupling between distant biofilms and emergence of nutrient time-sharing
<p>Bacteria within communities can interact to organize their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>. It has been unclear whether such interactions can extend beyond a single community to coordinate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> of distant populations. We discovered that two <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> biofilm communities undergoing metabolic oscillations can become coupled through electrical signaling and synchronize their growth dynamics. Coupling increases competition by also synchronizing demand for limited nutrients. As predicted by mathematical modeling, we confirm that biofilms resolve this conflict by switching from in-phase to antiphase oscillations. This results in time-sharing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>, where each community takes turns consuming nutrients. Time-sharing enables biofilms to counterintuitively increase growth under reduced nutrient supply. Distant biofilms can thus coordinate their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> to resolve nutrient competition through time-sharing, a strategy used in engineered systems to allocate limited resources.</p>

Molecular and neural basis of contagious itch behavior in mice
<p>Socially contagious itch is ubiquitous in human society, but whether it exists in rodents is unclear. Using a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>al paradigm that does not entail prior training or reward, we found that mice scratched after observing a conspecific scratching. Molecular mapping showed increased neuronal activity in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus of mice that displayed contagious scratching. Ablation of gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) or GRPR neurons in the SCN abolished contagious scratching <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>, which was recapitulated by chemogenetic inhibition of SCN GRP neurons. Activation of SCN GRP/GRPR neurons evoked scratching <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>. These data demonstrate that GRP-GRPR signaling is necessary and sufficient for transmitting contagious itch information in the SCN. The findings may have implications for our understanding of neural circuits that control socially contagious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>s.</p>

Instead of copying demonstrators moving balls over long distances, observers solved the task more efficiently, using the ball positioned closest to the target, even if it was of a different color than the one previously observed.

Why does time seem to fly when we're having fun?

Retrieval practice protects memory against acute stress

We aimed to determine whether a highly effective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing technique could strengthen memory against the negative effects of stress. To bolster memory, we used retrieval practice, or the act of taking practice tests. Participants first <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ed stimuli by either restudying or engaging in retrieval practice. Twenty-four hours later, we induced stress in half of the participants and assessed subsequent memory performance. Participants who <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ed by restudying demonstrated the typical stress-related memory impairment, whereas those who <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ed by retrieval practice were immune to the deleterious effects of stress.

The olfactory neuron AWC promotes avoidance of normally palatable food following chronic dietary restriction
<p>Changes in metabolic state alter foraging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> and food preference in animals. Here, I show that normally attractive food becomes repulsive to <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> if animals are chronically undernourished as a result of alimentary tract defects. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>al plasticity is achieved in two ways: increased food leaving and induction of aversive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> towards food. A particularly strong food avoider is defective in the chitin synthase that makes the pharyngeal lining. Food avoidance induced by underfeeding is mediated by cGMP signaling in the olfactory neurons AWC and AWB, and the gustatory neurons ASJ and ASK. Food avoidance is enhanced by increased population density and is reduced if the animals are unable to correctly interpret their nutritional state as a result of defects in the AMP kinase or TOR/S6kinase pathways. The TGF-β/DBL-1 pathway suppresses food avoidance and the cellular basis for this is distinct from its role in aversive olfactory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing of harmful food. This study suggests that nutritional state feedback via nutrient sensors, population size and olfactory neurons guides food preference in <i>C. elegans</i>.</p>

Aging and its modulation in a long-lived worker caste of the honey bee
<p>Highly social animals provide alternative aging models in which vastly different lifespan patterns are flexible, and linked to social caste. Research in these species aims to reveal how environment, including social cues, can shape the transition between short-lived and extremely long-lived phenotypes with negligible senescence. Among honey bee workers, short to intermediate lifespans are typical for summer castes, while the winter caste can live up to 10 times longer. For summer castes, experimental interventions could predictably accelerate, slow or revert functional senescence. In contrast, little is known about the partic ular conditions under which periods of negligible senescence in winter castes can be disrupted or sustained. We asked how manipulation of social environment in colonies with long-lived winter bees might alter the pace of functional senescence, measured as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing performance, as well as of cellular senescence, measured as lipofuscin accumulation. We show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>al senescence becomes rapidly detectable when the winter state is disrupted, and changes in social task <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>s and social environment (brood) are induced. Likewise, we found that cellular senescence was induced by such social intervention. However, cellular senescence showed marked regional differences, suggesting that particular brain regions age slower than others. Finally, by preventing post-winter colonies from brood rearing, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>al senescence became undetectable, even after transition to the usually short-lived phenotypes had occurred. We envision that social regulation of negligible functional senescence and highly dynamic accumulation of a universal symptom of cellular aging (lipofuscin) offers rewarding perspectives to target proximate mechanisms of slowed aging.</p>

Remembered reward locations restructure entorhinal spatial maps

Many paths to preserve the body clock
<p>Robust daily oscillations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>, physiology, and biochemistry are driven by endogenous timekeeping machinery called the circadian clocks. Circadian clocks in mammals were originally considered properties of the nervous system, and the anatomical locus of this clock was determined to be the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus. The neurons that make up this structure are highly interconnected (coupled) and exhibit robust and coordinated rhythms of activity, and loss of rhythmicity results in loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>al rhythms such as daily activity. On page 187 of this issue, Brancaccio <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) reveal that SCNs that have been rendered “clockless” through genetic perturbation in mice can be restored to rhythmicity by rescuing the clocks in only the astrocytes, a type of glial cell. The idea that rhythmic astrocytes are sufficient to generate a functional circadian clock that can control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>al rhythms is surprising and suggests that the SCN can produce rhythms by means of more than one mechanism.</p>

Bioenergetics through thick and thin
<p>The cells in all biological systems are composed of a limited number of molecular constituents, mainly proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and lipids. Of these, lipids tend to receive the shortest shrift, as they are typically considered to be merely the building blocks of membranes that provide a scaffold in which the “important” molecules, such as enzymes or signaling proteins, reside. In recent years, and with the advent of advanced lipidomics techniques, we have <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ed that “a lipid is a lipid is a lipid” is simply not true, and that the lipid composition of membranes can have profound effects on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> and activity of its resident macromolecules. For example, some lipids, such as members of the phosphatidylinositol family, are important signaling molecules. However, what is less appreciated is that the physical composition of lipid membranes can have profound effects on cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> as well. On page 1186 of this issue, Budin <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) use the Gram-negative bacterium <i>Escherichia coli</i> and the budding yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> as model systems to show that the fluidity of a membrane, as determined by its lipid composition, can have huge effects on the efficiency of aerobic energy production (respiration) by the highly hydrophobic, membrane-embedded, oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) system.</p>

Connecting neuronal circuits for movement
<p>Movement is the most common final output of nervous system activity and is essential for survival. But what makes this seemingly trivial statement so scientifically challenging? Neurons that contribute to when and how our body moves are distributed throughout the nervous system. Thus, even a simple movement such as arm flexion requires the coordinated activation of many different neuronal populations across multiple brain regions. A key question is how the nervous system produces diverse and precise actions aligned with the organisms' <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>al needs. These processes are affected in diseases such as Parkinson's or Huntington's, in which aberrant motor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> dominates. Recent studies are transformative in how we think about the control of movement. A common denominator of these studies is that brain regions that contribute to motor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> can no longer be considered as interacting boxes. Instead, deep circuit-level insight based on specific neuronal populations emerges as being critical to revealing motor system organization and understanding its function. It is likely that insights at this level can also help to design more specific and direct interventions for diseases of the motor system and neuroprosthetics applied after injuries.</p>

Crystallizing a memory
<p>What is the physical basis of memory? What does it take to retrieve a memory in the brain? What would it take to activate or erase memories? In the early 20th century, the German zoologist Richard Semon coined the term “engram” to denote the physical manifestation of a memory in the brain (<i>1</i>). Two decades later, Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb posited a physiological correlate for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing and recollection: The process of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing strengthens the connections, or synapses, between neurons, which leads to the development of brain-wide cell assemblies that undergo changes in their structural and functional connectivity (<i>2</i>). The coordinated activity of these assemblies—called ensembles, traces, or engrams—that occurs during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing (memory formation) is thought to be reengaged during recall and thereby forms a stable neuronal correlate of memory (<i>2</i>). As subsequent memories are formed, the dynamics of these assemblies evolve and provide preexisting scaffolds to influence how the brain processes the variety of memories an organism forms. Studies by Abdou <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) on page 1227 of this issue and by Choi <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) develop new technologies to visualize discrete engrams in the brain and modulate them in a synapse-specific manner to understand memory strength and memory restoration from an amnestic state. This improved understanding could eventually be translated to modulate memories to alleviate maladaptive memory states.</p>

Evidence for a neural law of effect
<p>Thorndike’s law of effect states that actions that lead to reinforcements tend to be repeated more often. Accordingly, neural activity patterns leading to reinforcement are also reentered more frequently. Reinforcement relies on dopaminergic activity in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), and animals shape their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> to receive dopaminergic stimulation. Seeking evidence for a neural law of effect, we found that mice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong> to reenter more frequently motor cortical activity patterns that trigger optogenetic VTA self-stimulation. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing was accompanied by gradual shaping of these patterns, with participating neurons progressively increasing and aligning their covariance to that of the target pattern. Motor cortex patterns that lead to phasic dopaminergic VTA activity are progressively reinforced and shaped, suggesting a mechanism by which animals select and shape actions to reliably achieve reinforcement.</p>

Direct activation of these neurons in the PVN or their terminals in the VTA enhanced prosocial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>s. Conversely, inhibition of PVN OXT axon terminals in the VTA decreased social interactions. OXT increased excitatory drive onto reward-specific VTA dopamine (DA) neurons.

Behavioral time scale synaptic plasticity underlies CA1 place fields
<p>Learning is primarily mediated by activity-dependent modifications of synaptic strength within neuronal circuits. We discovered that place fields in hippocampal area CA1 are produced by a synaptic potentiation notably different from Hebbian plasticity. Place fields could be produced in vivo in a single trial by potentiation of input that arrived seconds before and after complex spiking. The potentiated synaptic input was not initially coincident with action potentials or depolarization. This rule, named <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>al time scale synaptic plasticity, abruptly modifies inputs that were neither causal nor close in time to postsynaptic activation. In slices, five pairings of subthreshold presynaptic activity and calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) plateau potentials produced a large potentiation with an asymmetric seconds-long time course. This plasticity efficiently stores entire <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>al sequences within synaptic weights to produce predictive place cell activity.</p>

A central neural circuit for itch sensation

Itch-mediating spinal neurons, which express the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor, are disynaptically connected to the parabrachial nucleus via glutamatergic spinal projection neurons.

Breathing to inspire and arouse

Plasticity in the Neurotransmitter Repertoire
<p>In the earliest days of neuroscience, it was thought that a neuron made and released only a single chemical, known as a neurotransmitter, to send a signal across a synapse to an adjacent neuron (<i>1</i>). At the same time, it was deeply mysterious why so many signaling molecules were used in nervous systems. Subsequently, it became clear that many, if not most, neurons (including those in mammals) make and release two or more neurotransmitters including small-molecules and neuropeptides (<i>2</i>–<i>4</i>). As the list of these potential cotransmitters and their receptors has increased, we are faced with understanding the functional relevance of this embarrassment of riches for neural circuits and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>. Neurotransmitters and neuromodulators (substances often released with small-molecule neurotransmitters) can elicit a variety of different actions on their neuron targets, including directly opening ion channels or acting through signal transduction pathways to alter neuronal excitability or synaptic transmission. Thus, characterizing the mixture of cotransmitters released by a neuron is important for understanding how neuronal circuits operate. The mechanisms that change the profile of neurotransmitter release provide opportunities for plastic changes in circuit function, and consequently in organism <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>. On page 449 of this issue, Dulcis <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) report changes in the neurotransmitter profile of neurons that underlie photoperiod-triggered changes in animal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>. The findings argue that neurotransmitter switching is a new mechanism for neuroplasticity (<i>6</i>) in adult nervous systems.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Developmental Programming of Thermonastic Leaf Movement
<p>Plants exhibit diverse polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>s in response to directional and nondirectional environmental signals, termed tropic and nastic movements, respectively. The ways in which plants incorporate directional information into tropic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>s is well understood, but it is less well understood how nondirectional stimuli, such as ambient temperatures, specify the polarity of nastic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>s. Here, we demonstrate that a developmentally programmed polarity of auxin flow underlies thermo-induced leaf hyponasty in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). In warm environments, PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR4 (PIF4) stimulates auxin production in the leaf. This results in the accumulation of auxin in leaf petioles, where PIF4 directly activates a gene encoding the PINOID (PID) protein kinase. PID is involved in polarization of the auxin transporter PIN-FORMED3 to the outer membranes of petiole cells. Notably, the leaf polarity-determining ASYMMETRIC LEAVES1 (AS1) directs the induction of <i>PID</i> to occur predominantly in the abaxial petiole region. These observations indicate that the integration of PIF4-mediated auxin biosynthesis and polar transport, and the AS1-mediated developmental shaping of polar auxin flow, coordinate leaf thermonasty, which facilitates leaf cooling in warm environments. We believe that leaf thermonasty is a suitable model system for studying the developmental programming of environmental adaptation in plants.</p>

Enhanced transport of nutrients powered by microscale flows of the self-spinning dinoflagellate <i>Symbiodinium</i> sp.
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> Many studies suggest that complex and crowded environments slow transport from normal diffusive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> to subdiffusive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>, but our findings reveal that diffusivity is still enhanced with a power-law <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> in active microscale flows.</p>

Aperture effects in squid jet propulsion
<p>Squid are the largest jet propellers in nature as adults, but as paralarvae they are some of the smallest, faced with the inherent inefficiency of jet propulsion at a low Reynolds number. In this study we describe the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> and kinematics of locomotion in 1 mm paralarvae of <i>Dosidicus gigas</i>, the smallest squid yet studied. They swim with hop-and-sink <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> and can engage in fast jets by reducing the size of the mantle aperture during the contraction phase of a jetting cycle. We go on to explore the general effects of a variable mantle and funnel aperture in a theoretical model of jet propulsion scaled from the smallest (1 mm mantle length) to the largest (3 m) squid. Aperture reduction during mantle contraction increases propulsive efficiency at all squid sizes, although 1 mm squid still suffer from low efficiency (20%) because of a limited speed of contraction. Efficiency increases to a peak of 40% for 1 cm squid, then slowly declines. Squid larger than 6 cm must either reduce contraction speed or increase aperture size to maintain stress within maximal muscle tolerance. Ecological pressure to maintain maximum velocity may lead them to increase aperture size, which reduces efficiency. This effect might be ameliorated by nonaxial flow during the refill phase of the cycle. Our model's predictions highlight areas for future empirical work, and emphasize the existence of complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>al options for maximizing efficiency at both very small and large sizes.</p>

Illuminating gravitational waves: A concordant picture of photons from a neutron star merger
<p>Merging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong> stars offer an excellent laboratory for simultaneously studying strong-field gravity and matter in extreme environments. We establish the physical associat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of an electromagnetic counterpart (EM170817) with gravitat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al waves (GW170817) detected from merging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong> stars. By synthesizing a panchromatic data set, we demonstrate that merging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong> stars are a long-sought product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> site forging heavy elements by r-process nucleosynthesis. The weak gamma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ray</span></strong>s seen in EM170817 are dissimilar to classical short gamma-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ray</span></strong> bursts with ultrarelativistic jets. Instead, we suggest that breakout of a wide-angle, mildly relativistic cocoon engulfing the jet explains the low-luminosity gamma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ray</span></strong>s, the high-luminosity ultraviolet-optical-infrared, and the delayed radio and x-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ray</span></strong> emiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. We posit that all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong> star mergers may lead to a wide-angle cocoon breakout, sometimes accompanied by a successful jet and sometimes by a choked jet.</p>

Direct measurements of two-way wave-particle energy transfer in a collisionless space plasma
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e accelerat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> by plasma waves and spontaneous wave generat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> are fundamental energy and momentum exchange processes in collis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>less plasmas. Such wave-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s occur ubiquitously in space. We present ultrafast measurements in Earth’s magnetosphere by the Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft that enabled quantitative evaluat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of energy transfer in interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s associated with electromagnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> cyclotron waves. The observed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> distribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s are not symmetric around the magnetic field direct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> but are in phase with the plasma wave fields. The wave-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> phase relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s demonstrate that a cyclotron resonance transferred energy from hot protons to waves, which in turn nonresonantly accelerated cold He<sup>+</sup> to energies up to ~2 kilo–electron volts. These observat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s provide direct quantitative evidence for collis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>less energy transfer in plasmas between distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e populat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s via wave-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s.</p>

Mid-term changes in blood metal ion levels after Articular Surface Replacement arthroplasty of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Our first aim was to determine whether there are significant   changes in the level of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in the blood at mid-term follow-up,   in patients with an Articular Surface Replacement (ASR) arthroplasty.   Secondly, we sought to identify risk factors for any increases.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The study involved 435 patients who underwent unilateral, metal-on-metal   (MoM) hip resurfacing (HRA) or total hip arthroplasty (THA). These   patients all had one measurement of the level of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in the   blood before seven years had passed post-operatively (early evaluat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>)   and one after seven years had passed post-operatively (mid-term evaluat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>).   Changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> levels were tested using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test.   We identified subgroups at the highest risk of increase using a   multivariable linear logistic regress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were significant increases in the levels of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s   for patients who underwent both MoM HRA (Chromium (Cr): 0.5 parts   per bill<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (ppb); Cobalt (Co): 1.1 ppb) and MoM THA (Cr: 0.5 ppb;   Co: 0.7 ppb). In a multivariable model considering MoM HRAs, the   change in the levels of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s was influenced by female gender   (Co: Odds Ratio (OR) 1.42; p = 0.002 and Cr: OR 1.08; p = 0.006).   The change was found to be irrespective of the initial level for   the MoM HRAs, whereas there was a negative relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship between   the initial level and the change in the level for those with a MoM   THA (Co: OR -0.43; p < 0.001 and Cr: OR -0.14; p = 0.033).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong></title><p>The levels of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in the blood increase significantly   over the period until mid-term follow-up in patients with both a   MoM HRA and those with a MoM THA. We recommend that the levels of   metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s be measured most frequently for women with a MoM HRA.   While those with a MoM THA appear to stabilise at a certain level,   the accuracy of this trend is not yet clear.

Room-temperature cycling of metal fluoride electrodes: Liquid electrolytes for high-energy fluoride ion cells
<p>Fluoride <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> batteries are potential “next-generat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>” electrochemical storage devices that offer high energy density. At present, such batteries are limited to operat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> at high temperatures because suitable fluoride <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>–conducting electrolytes are known only in the solid state. We report a liquid fluoride <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>–conducting electrolyte with high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ic conductivity, wide operating voltage, and robust chemical stability based on dry tetraalkylammonium fluoride salts in ether solvents. Pairing this liquid electrolyte with a copper–lanthanum trifluoride (Cu@LaF<sub>3</sub>) core-shell cathode, we demonstrate reversible fluorinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and defluorinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in a fluoride <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> electrochemical cell cycled at room temperature.

A radiation belt of energetic protons located between Saturn and its rings
<p>Saturn has a sufficiently strong dipole magnetic field to trap high-energy charged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es and form <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> belt</span></strong>s, which have been observed outside its rings. Whether stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> belt</span></strong>s exist near the planet and inward of the rings was previously unknown. The Cassini spacecraft’s Magnetosphere Imaging Instrument obtained measurements of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> belt</span></strong> that lies just above Saturn’s dense atmosphere and is decoupled from the rest of the magnetosphere by the planet’s A- to C-rings. The belt extends across the D-ring and comprises protons produced through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cosmic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ray</span></strong></span></strong> albedo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong> decay and multiple charge-exchange react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. These protons are lost to atmospheric neutrals and D-ring dust. Strong proton deplet<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s that map onto features on the D-ring indicate a highly structured and diverse dust environment near Saturn.</p>

Measurement of the neutron lifetime using a magneto-gravitational trap and in situ detection
<p>The precise value of the mean <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong> lifetime, τ<sub>n</sub>, plays an important role in nuclear and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e physics and cosmology. It is used to predict the ratio of protons to helium atoms in the primordial universe and to search for physics beyond the Standard Model of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e physics. We eliminated loss mechanisms present in previous trap experiments by levitating polarized ultracold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong>s above the surface of an asymmetric storage trap using a repulsive magnetic field gradient so that the stored <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong>s do not interact with material trap walls. As a result of this approach and the use of an in situ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong> detector, the lifetime reported here [877.7 ± 0.7 (stat) +0.4/–0.2 (sys) seconds] does not require correct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s larger than the quoted uncertainties.</p>

Entanglement between two spatially separated atomic modes
<p>Modern quantum technologies in the fields of quantum computing, quantum simulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, and quantum metrology require the creat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and control of large ensembles of entangled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es. In ultracold ensembles of neutral atoms, nonclassical states have been generated with mutual entanglement among thousands of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es. The entanglement generat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> relies on the fundamental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e-exchange symmetry in ensembles of identical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es, which lacks the standard not<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of entanglement between clearly definable subsystems.

Because the clouds can be addressed individually, our experiments open a path to exploit the available entangled states of indistinguishable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es for quantum informat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> applicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s.</p>

Dynamic multinuclear sites formed by mobilized copper ions in NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> selective catalytic reduction
<p>Copper <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s exchanged into zeolites are active for the selective catalytic reduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (SCR) of nitrogen oxides (NO<i><sub>x</sub></i>) with ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>), but the low-temperature rate dependence on copper (Cu) volumetric density is inconsistent with react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> at single sites. We combine steady-state and transient kinetic measurements, x-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ray</span></strong> absorpt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> spectroscopy, and first-principles calculat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s to demonstrate that under react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, mobilized Cu <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s can travel through zeolite windows and form transient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> pairs that participate in an oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>)–mediated Cu<sup>I</sup>→Cu<sup>II</sup> redox step integral to SCR. Electrostatic tethering to framework aluminum centers limits the volume that each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> can explore and thus its capacity to form an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> pair. The dynamic, reversible format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of multinuclear sites from mobilized single atoms represents a distinct phenomenon that falls outside the convent<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al boundaries of a heterogeneous or homogeneous catalyst.</p>

Scalable-manufactured randomized glass-polymer hybrid metamaterial for daytime radiative cooling
<p>Passive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ive cooling draws heat from surfaces and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>es it into space as infrared <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to which the atmosphere is transparent. However, the energy density mismatch between solar irradiance and the low infrared <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> flux from a near-ambient-temperature surface requires materials that strongly emit thermal energy and barely absorb sunlight. We embedded resonant polar dielectric microspheres randomly in a polymeric matrix, resulting in a metamaterial that is fully transparent to the solar spectrum while having an infrared emissivity greater than 0.93 across the atmospheric window. When backed with a silver coating, the metamaterial shows a noontime <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ive cooling power of 93 watts per square meter under direct sunshine. More critically, we demonstrated high-throughput, economical roll-to-roll manufacturing of the metamaterial, which is vital for promoting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ive cooling as a viable energy technology.</p>

Atmospheric new particle formation from sulfuric acid and amines in a Chinese megacity
<p>Atmospheric new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (NPF) is an important global phenomenon that is nevertheless sensitive to ambient condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. According to both observat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and theoretical arguments, NPF usually requires a relatively high sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to promote the format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es and a low preexisting aerosol loading to minimize the sink of new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es. We investigated NPF in Shanghai and were able to observe both precursor vapors (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) and initial clusters at a molecular level in a megacity. High NPF rates were observed to coincide with several familiar markers suggestive of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>–dimethylamine (DMA)–water (H<sub>2</sub>O) nucleat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, including sulfuric acid dimers and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>-DMA clusters. In a cluster kinetics simulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, the observed concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of sulfuric acid was high enough to explain the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e growth to ~3 nanometers under the very high condensat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> sink, whereas the subsequent higher growth rate beyond this size is believed to result from the added contribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of condensing organic species. These findings will help in understanding urban NPF and its air quality and climate effects, as well as in formulating policies to mitigate secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in China.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels form the basis for cellular electrical signaling. Despite the scores of genetically identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels selective for other monatomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, only one type of proton-selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel has been found in eukaryotic cells. By comparative transcriptome analysis of mouse taste receptor cells, we identified Otopetrin1 (OTOP1), a protein required for development of gravity-sensing otoconia in the vestibular system, as forming a proton-selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel. We found that murine OTOP1 is enriched in acid-detecting taste receptor cells and is required for their zinc-sensitive proton conductance. Two related murine genes, <i>Otop2</i> and <i>Otop3</i>, and a <i>Drosophila</i> ortholog also encode proton channels. Evolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ary conservat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the gene family and its widespread tissue distribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> suggest a broad role for proton channels in physiology and pathophysiology.</p>

Light curves of the neutron star merger GW170817/SSS17a: Implications for r-process nucleosynthesis
<p>On 17 August 2017, gravitat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al waves (GWs) were detected from a binary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong> star merger, GW170817, along with a coincident short gamma-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ray</span></strong> burst, GRB 170817A. An optical transient source, Swope Supernova Survey 17a (SSS17a), was subsequently identified as the counterpart of this event. We present ultraviolet, optical, and infrared light curves of SSS17a extending from 10.9 hours to 18 days postmerger. We constrain the radioactively powered transient resulting from the eject<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong>-rich material. The fast rise of the light curves, subsequent decay, and rapid color evolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> are consistent with multiple ejecta components of differing lanthanide abundance. The late-time light curve indicates that SSS17a produced at least ~0.05 solar masses of heavy elements, demonstrating that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong> star mergers play a role in rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong> capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis in the universe.</p>

A precise measurement of the magnetic field in the corona of the black hole binary V404 Cygni
<p>Observat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of binary stars containing an accreting black hole or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong> star often show x-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ray</span></strong> emiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> extending to high energies (>10 kilo­–electron volts), which is ascribed to an accret<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> disk corona of energetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es akin to those seen in the solar corona. Despite their ubiquity, the physical condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in accret<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> disk coronae remain poorly constrained. Using simultaneous infrared, optical, x-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ray</span></strong>, and radio observat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of the Galactic black hole system V404 Cygni, showing a rapid synchrotron cooling event in its 2015 outburst, we present a precise 461 ± 12 gauss magnetic field measurement in the corona. This measurement is substantially lower than previous estimates for such systems, providing constraints on physical models of accret<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> physics in black hole and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong> star binary systems.</p>

Jupiter’s magnetosphere and aurorae observed by the Juno spacecraft during its first polar orbits
<p>The Juno spacecraft acquired direct observat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of the jovian magnetosphere and auroral emiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s from a vantage point above the poles. Juno’s capture orbit spanned the jovian magnetosphere from bow shock to the planet, providing magnetic field, charged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e, and wave phenomena context for Juno’s passage over the poles and traverse of Jupiter’s hazardous inner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> belt</span></strong>s.

An accreting pulsar with extreme properties drives an ultraluminous x-ray source in NGC 5907
<p>Ultraluminous x-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ray</span></strong> sources (ULXs) in nearby galaxies shine brighter than any x-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ray</span></strong> source in our Galaxy. ULXs are usually modeled as stellar-mass black holes (BHs) accreting at very high rates or intermediate-mass BHs. We present observat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s showing that NGC 5907 ULX is instead an x-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ray</span></strong> accreting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong> star (NS) with a spin period evolving from 1.43 seconds in 2003 to 1.13 seconds in 2014. It has an isotropic peak luminosity of [Formula]1000 times the Eddington limit for a NS at 17.1 megaparsec. Standard accret<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> models fail to explain its luminosity, even assuming beamed emiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, but a strong multipolar magnetic field can describe its properties. These findings suggest that other extreme ULXs (x-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ray</span></strong> luminosity [Formula] 10<sup>41 </sup>erg second[Formula]) might harbor NSs.</p>

Global atmospheric particle formation from CERN CLOUD measurements
<p>Fundamental quest<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s remain about the origin of newly formed atmospheric aerosol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es because data from laboratory measurements have been insufficient to build global models. In contrast, gas-phase chemistry models have been based on laboratory kinetics measurements for decades. We built a global model of aerosol format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> by using extensive laboratory measurements of rates of nucleat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> involving sulfuric acid, ammonia, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, and organic compounds conducted in the CERN CLOUD (Cosmics Leaving Outdoor Droplets) chamber. The simulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and a comparison with atmospheric observat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s show that nearly all nucleat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> throughout the present-day atmosphere involves ammonia or biogenic organic compounds, in addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to sulfuric acid. A considerable fract<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of nucleat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> involves <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, but the relatively weak dependence on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s indicates that for the processes studied, variat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cosmic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ray</span></strong></span></strong> intensity do not appreciably affect climate through nucleat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in the present-day atmosphere.</p>

Using DNA, radiation therapy gets personal
<p>At most cancer hospitals today, medical oncologists routinely order genetic tests that help guide their drug treatment decis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. But down the hallway in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> ward, cancer patients typically get a one-size-fits-all course of radiotherapy, regardless of their genetics or those of their cancer.

At the annual meeting of the American Society for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> Oncology next week in Boston, researchers will describe their hunt for gene activity profiles in tumors that can help determine how susceptible the cancer will be to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>.

The ion channel TRPM7 is required for B cell lymphopoiesis
<p>The transient receptor potential (TRP) family is a large family of widely expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels that regulate the intracellular concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and metals and respond to various chemical and physical stimuli. TRP subfamily M member 7 (TRPM7) is unusual in that it contains both an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel and a kinase domain. TRPM7 is a divalent cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel with preference for Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>. It is required for the survival of DT40 cells, a B cell line; however, delet<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of TRPM7 in T cells does not impair their development. We found that express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of TRPM7 was required for B cell development in mice. Mice that lacked TRPM7 in B cells failed to generate peripheral B cells because of a developmental block at the pro-B cell stage. The loss of TRPM7 kinase activity alone did not affect the proport<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of peripheral mature B cells or the development of B cells in the bone marrow. However, supplementat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> with a high concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> partially rescued the development of TRPM7-deficient B cells in vitro. Thus, our findings identify a critical role for TRPM7 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel activity in B cell development.</p>

Spectral narrowing of x-ray pulses for precision spectroscopy with nuclear resonances
<p>Spectroscopy of nuclear resonances offers a wide range of applicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s due to the remarkable energy resolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> afforded by their narrow linewidths. However, progress toward higher resolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is inhibited at modern x-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ray</span></strong> sources because they deliver only a tiny fract<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the photons on resonance, with the remainder contributing to an off-resonant background. We devised an experimental setup that uses the fast mechanical mot<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of a resonant target to manipulate the spectrum of a given x-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ray</span></strong> pulse and to redistribute off-resonant spectral intensity onto the resonance. As a consequence, the resonant pulse brilliance is increased while the off-resonant background is reduced. Because our method is compatible with existing and upcoming pulsed x-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ray</span></strong> sources, we anticipate that this approach will find applicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s that require ultranarrow x-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ray</span></strong> resonances.</p>

Highly elastic binders integrating polyrotaxanes for silicon microparticle anodes in lithium ion batteries

The DNA-sensing AIM2 inflammasome controls radiation-induced cell death and tissue injury
<p>Acute exposure to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>izing radi</span></strong>at<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> induces massive cell death and severe damage to tissues containing actively proliferating cells, including bone marrow and the gastrointestinal tract. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this pathology remain controversial. Here, we show that mice deficient in the double-stranded DNA sensor AIM2 are protected from both subtotal body ir<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>–induced gastrointestinal syndrome and total body ir<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>–induced hematopoietic failure.

Simultaneous Femtosecond X-ray Spectroscopy and Diffraction of Photosystem II at Room Temperature
<sec><title>One Protein, Two Probes</title><p>A central challenge in the use of x-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ray</span></strong> diffract<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to characterize macromolecular structure is the propensity of the high-energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to damage the sample during data collect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>.

The B-Box-Containing MicroProtein miP1a/BBX31 Regulates Photomorphogenesis and UV-B Protection
<p>The bZIP transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> factor ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) represents a major hub in the light-signaling cascade both under visible and UV-B light. The mode of transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <i>HY5</i>, especially under UV-B light, is not well characterized. B-BOX (BBX) transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> factors regulate <i>HY5</i> transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and also posttranscript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ally modulate HY5 to control photomorphogenesis under white light. Here, we identify BBX31 as a key signaling intermediate in visible and UV-B light signal transduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). <i>BBX31</i> express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is induced by UV-B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in a fluence-dependent manner. HY5 directly binds to the promoter of <i>BBX31</i> and regulates its transcript levels. Loss- and gain-of-funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> mutants of <i>BBX31</i> indicate that it acts as a negative regulator of photomorphogenesis under white light but is a positive regulator of UV-B signaling. Genetic interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> studies suggest that <i>BBX31</i> regulates photomorphogenesis independent of <i>HY5</i>. We found no evidence for a direct BBX31-HY5 interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, and they primarily regulate different sets of genes in white light. Under high doses of UV-B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, BBX31 promotes the accumulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of UV-protective flavonoids and phenolic compounds. It enhances tolerance to UV-B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> by regulating genes involved in photoprotect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and DNA repair in a HY5-dependent manner. Under UV-B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, overexpress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <i>BBX31</i> enhances <i>HY5</i> transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al levels in a UV RESISTANCE LOCUS8-dependent manner, suggesting that BBX31 might regulate <i>HY5</i> transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>.</p>

Molecular Adaptation during a Rapid Adaptive Radiation
<p>“Explosive” adaptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s on islands remain one of the most puzzling evolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ary phenomena and the evolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ary genetic processes behind such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s remain unclear. Rapid morphological and ecological evolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> during island <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s suggests that many genes may be under fairly strong select<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, although this remains untested. Here, we report that during a rapid recent diversificat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in the Hawaiian endemic plant genus <i>Schiedea</i> (<i>Caryophyllaceae</i>), 5 in 36 studied genes evolved under positive select<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Positively selected genes are involved in defence mechanisms, photosynthesis, and reproduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Comparison with eight mainland plant groups demonstrates both the relaxat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of purifying select<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and more widespread positive select<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in Hawaiian <i>Schiedea</i>. This provides compelling evidence that adaptive evolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of protein-coding genes may play a significant role during island adaptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s.</p>

Rapid cold hardening improves recovery of ion homeostasis and chill coma recovery time in the migratory locust, <i>Locusta migratoria</i>
<p>Chill tolerance of insects is defined as the ability to tolerate low temperature under circumstances not involving freezing of intracellular or extracellular fluids. For many insects chill tolerance is crucial for their ability to persist in cold environments and mounting evidence indicates that chill tolerance is associated with the ability to maintain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and water homeostasis, thereby ensuring muscular funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and preventing chill injury at low temperature. The present study describes the relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship between muscle and haemolymph <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis and time to regain posture following cold shock (CS, 2 h at −4°C) in the chill-susceptible locust <i>Locusta migratoria</i>. This relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship was examined in animals with and without a prior rapid cold-hardening treatment (RCH, 2 h at 0°C) to investigate the physiological underpinnings of RCH. CS elicited a doubling of haemolymph [K<sup>+</sup>] and this disturbance was greater in locusts pre-exposed to RCH. Recovery of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis was, however, markedly faster in RCH-treated animals, which correlated well with whole-organism performance as hardened individuals regained posture faster than non-hardened individuals following CS. The present study indicates that loss and recovery of muscular funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> are associated with the resting membrane potential of excitable membranes as attested by the changes in the equilibrium potential for K<sup>+</sup> (<i>E</i><sub>K</sub>) following CS. Both hardened and non-hardened animals regained movement once K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis had recovered to a fixed level (<i>E</i><sub>K</sub>≈−41 mV). RCH is therefore not associated with altered sensitivity to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> disturbance but instead is correlated to a faster recovery of haemolymph [K<sup>+</sup>].</p>

Nanofluidic rocking Brownian motors
<p>Control and transport of nanoscale objects in fluids is challenging because of the unfavorable scaling of most interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> mechanisms to small length scales. We designed energy landscapes for nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es by accurately shaping the geometry of a nanofluidic slit and exploiting the electrostatic interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> between like-charged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es and walls. Directed transport was performed by combining asymmetric potentials with an oscillating electric field to achieve a rocking Brownian motor. Using gold spheres 60 nanometers in diameter, we investigated the physics of the motor with high spatiotemporal resolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, enabling a parameter-free comparison with theory. We fabricated a sorting device that separates 60- and 100-nanometer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es in opposing direct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s within seconds. Modeling suggests that the device separates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es with a radial difference of 1 nanometer.</p>

Toward an optically controlled brain
<p>Neurons can be modified with light-gated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels, which cause them to become excited upon illuminat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). This discovery has given rise to the field of optogenetics, with impressive examples such as triggering the beat of a heart with light (<i>3</i>). There is, however, one technical limitat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>: Light-gated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels are typically stimulated with blue-green light, which is heavily scattered by tissue. Thus, deep brain stimulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, focused on small reg<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, is a major challenge. On page 679 of this issue, Chen <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) use transgenic mice implanted with upconverting nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es (NPs) to locally activate light-gated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels and modulate neuronal activity, even deep inside the brain. This method might eventually lead the way for clinical applicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s to optically control neuronal dysfunct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, such as Parkinson's disease or even paralysis.</p>

Size effect in ion transport through angstrom-scale slits
<p>In the field of nanofluidics, it has been an ultimate but seemingly distant goal to controllably fabricate capillaries with dimens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s approaching the size of small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and water molecules. We report <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> transport through ultimately narrow slits that are fabricated by effectively removing a single atomic plane from a bulk crystal. The atomically flat angstrom-scale slits exhibit little surface charge, allowing elucidat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the role of steric effects. We find that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s with hydrated diameters larger than the slit size can still permeate through, albeit with reduced mobility. The confinement also leads to a notable asymmetry between an<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of the same diameter. Our results provide a platform for studying the effects of angstrom-scale confinement, which is important for the development of nanofluidics, molecular separat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, and other nanoscale technologies.</p>

A peptide hormone required for Casparian strip diffusion barrier formation in <i>Arabidopsis</i> roots
<p>Plants achieve mineral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis by means of a hydrophobic barrier on endodermal cells called the Casparian strip, which restricts lateral diffus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s between the root vascular bundles and the soil. We identified a family of sulfated peptides required for contiguous Casparian strip format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in <i>Arabidopsis</i> roots. These peptide hormones, which we named Casparian strip integrity factor 1 (CIF1) and CIF2, are expressed in the root stele and specifically bind the endodermis-expressed leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase GASSHO1 (GSO1)/SCHENGEN3 and its homolog, GSO2. A mutant devoid of CIF peptides is defective in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis in the xylem. <i>CIF</i> genes are environmentally responsive. Casparian strip regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is not merely a passive process driven by root developmental cues; it also serves as an active strategy to cope with adverse soil condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s.</p>

A Long-Lived Relativistic Electron Storage Ring Embedded in Earth’s Outer Van Allen Belt
<sec><title>Van Allen Variat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong></title><p>The two rings of relativistic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es called Van Allen Belts that encircle Earth were discovered during the space age, and are known to pose risks to satellites in geostat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ary orbit. NASA launched twin spacecraft, the Van Allen Probes, on 30 August 2012 to measure and characterize Earth's <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> belt</span></strong> reg<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. <bold>Baker <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 186, published online 28 February) have shown that a third, unexpected and temporary, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> belt</span></strong> formed on 2 September 2012 to disappear 4 weeks later in response to changes in the solar wind.</p></sec>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Dynamics of the Pollen Sequestrome Defined by Subcellular Coupled Omics
<p>Reproduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> success in angiosperm plants depends on robust pollen tube growth through the female pistil tissues to ensure successful fertilizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Accordingly, there is an apparent evolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ary trend to accumulate significant reserves during pollen maturat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, including a populat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of stored mRNAs, that are utilized later for a massive translat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of various proteins in growing pollen tubes. Here, we performed a thorough transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of stored and translated transcripts in three subcellular compartments of tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>), long-term storage EDTA/puromycin-resistant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es, translating polysomes, and free ribonuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es, throughout tobacco pollen development and in in vitro-growing pollen tubes. We demonstrated that the composit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the aforement<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ed complexes is not rigid and that numerous transcripts were redistributed among these complexes during pollen development, which may represent an important mechanism of translat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Therefore, we defined the pollen sequestrome as a distinct and highly dynamic compartment for the storage of stable, translat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ally repressed transcripts and demonstrated its dynamics. We propose that EDTA/puromycin-resistant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e complexes represent aggregated nontranslating monosomes as the primary mediators of messenger RNA sequestrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Such organizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is extremely useful in fast tip-growing pollen tubes, where rapid and orchestrated protein synthesis must take place in specific reg<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s.</p>

Unsatisfactory outcomes following unicompartmental knee arthroplasty in patients with partial thickness cartilage loss
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>While medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is indicated   for patients with full-thickness cartilage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong>, it is occasionally   used to treat those with partial-thickness <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong>. The aim of this   study was to investigate the five-year outcomes in a consecutive   series of UKAs used in patients with partial thickness cartilage   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> in the medial compartment of the knee.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between 2002 and 2014, 94 consecutive UKAs were undertaken in   90 patients with partial thickness cartilage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> and followed up   independently for a mean of six years (1 to 13). These patients   had partial thickness cartilage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> either on both femur and tibia   (13 knees), or on either the femur or the tibia, with full thickness   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> on the other surface of the joint (18 and 63 knees respectively).   Using propensity score analysis, these patients were matched 1:2 based   on age, gender and pre-operative Oxford Knee Score (OKS) with knees   with full thickness <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> on both the femur and tibia. The functional   outcomes, implant survival and incidence of re-operations were assessed   at one, two and five years post-operatively. A subgroup of 36 knees   in 36 patients with partial thickness cartilage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong>, who had pre-operative   MRI scans, was assessed to identify whether there were any factors   identified on MRI that predicted the outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Knees with partial thickness cartilage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> had significantly   worse functional outcomes at one, two and five years post-operatively   compared with those with full thickness <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong>. A quarter of knees   with partial thickness <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> had a fair or poor result and a fifth   failed to achieve a clinically significant improvement in OKS from   a baseline of four points or more; double that seen in knees with   full thickness <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong>. Whilst there was no difference in implant survival between   the groups, the rate of re-operation in knees with partial thickness   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> was three times higher. Most of the re-operations (three-quarters),   were arthroscopies for persistent pain.</p><p>Compared with those achieving good or excellent outcomes, patients   with partial thickness cartilage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> who achieved fair or poor   outcomes were younger and had worse pre-operative functional scores.   However, there were no other differences in the baseline demographics.   MRI findings of full thickness cartilage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong>, subchondral oedema,   synovitis or effusion did not provide additional prognostic information.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Medial UKA should be reserved for patients with full thickness   cartilage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> on both the femur and tibia. Whilst some patients   with partial thickness <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> achieve a good result we cannot currently   identify which these will be and in this situation MRI is unhelpful   and misleading.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:475–82.</p></sec>

Long-Term Risk of Cardiovascular Disease in Women Who Have Had Infants With Heart Defects
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The possibility that congenital heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s signal a familial predisposition to cardiovascular disease has not been investigated. We aimed to determine whether the risk of cardiovascular disorders later in life was higher for women who have had newborns with congenital heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied a cohort of 1 084 251 women who had delivered infants between 1989 and 2013 in Quebec, Canada. We identified women whose infants had critical, noncritical, or no heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s, and tracked the women over time for future hospitalizations for cardiovascular disease, with follow-up extending up to 25 years past pregnancy. We calculated the incidence of cardiovascular hospitalization per 1000 person-years, and used Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between infant heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s and risk of maternal cardiovascular hospitalization. Models were adjusted for age, parity, preeclampsia, comorbidity, material deprivation, and time period.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Women whose infants had heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s had a higher overall incidence of cardiovascular hospitalization. There were 3.38 cardiovascular hospitalizations per 1000 person-years for those with critical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s (95% CI, 2.67–4.27), 3.19 for noncritical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s (95% CI, 2.96–3.45), and 2.42 for no heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s (95% CI, 2.39–2.44). In comparison with no heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s, women whose infants had critical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s had a hazard ratio of 1.43 (95% CI, 1.13–1.82) for any cardiovascular hospitalization, and women whose infants had noncritical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s had a hazard ratio of 1.24 (95% CI, 1.15–1.34), in adjusted models. Risks of specific causes of cardiovascular hospitalization, including myocardial infarction, heart failure, and other atherosclerotic disorders, were also greater for mothers of infants with congenital heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s than with no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Women whose infants have congenital heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s have a greater risk of cardiovascular hospitalization later in life.

Exercise Intolerance in Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a common syndrome with a pressing shortage of therapies. Exercise intolerance is a cardinal symptom of HFpEF, yet its pathophysiology remains uncertain.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We investigated the mechanism of exercise intolerance in 134 patients referred for cardiopulmonary exercise testing: 79 with HFpEF and 55 controls. We performed cardiopulmonary exercise testing with invasive monitoring to measure hemodynamics, blood gases, and gas exchange during exercise. We used these measurements to quantify 6 steps of oxygen transport and utilization (the O<sub>2</sub> pathway) in each patient with HFpEF, identifying the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>ive steps that impair each one’s exercise capacity (peak Vo<sub>2</sub>). We then quantified the functional significance of each O<sub>2</sub> pathway <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong> by calculating the improvement in exercise capacity a patient could expect from correcting the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Peak Vo<sub>2</sub> was reduced by 34±2% (mean±SEM, <i>P</i><0.001) in HFpEF compared with controls of similar age, sex, and body mass index. The vast majority (97%) of patients with HFpEF harbored <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s at multiple steps of the O<sub>2</sub> pathway, the identity and magnitude of which varied widely. Two of these steps, cardiac output and skeletal muscle O<sub>2</sub> diffusion, were impaired relative to controls by an average of 27±3% and 36±2%, respectively (<i>P</i><0.001 for both). Due to interactions between a given patient’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s, the predicted benefit of correcting any single one was often minor; on average, correcting a patient’s cardiac output led to a 7±0.5% predicted improvement in exercise intolerance, whereas correcting a patient’s muscle diffusion capacity led to a 27±1% improvement. At the individual level, the impact of any given O<sub>2</sub> pathway <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong> on a patient’s exercise capacity was strongly influenced by comorbid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Systematic analysis of the O<sub>2</sub> pathway in HFpEF showed that exercise capacity was undermined by multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ions in cardiac output and skeletal muscle diffusion capacity. An important source of disease heterogeneity stemmed from variation in each patient’s personal profile of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s. Personalized O<sub>2</sub> pathway analysis could identify patients most likely to benefit from treating a specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>; however, the system properties of O<sub>2</sub> transport favor treating multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s at once, as with exercise training.</p></sec>

Association Between Fetal Congenital Heart Defects and Maternal Risk of Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy in the Same Pregnancy and Across Pregnancies
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Both pregnant women carrying fetuses with heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s and women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy often exhibit angiogenic imbalances, suggesting that the same mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of the former and the pathophysiology of the latter.

Association strengths were consistent across heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong> types.

Temperature-activated ion channels in neural crest cells confer maternal fever–associated birth defects
<p>Birth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s of the heart and face are common, and most have no known genetic cause, suggesting a role for environmental factors. Maternal fever during the first trimester is an environmental risk factor linked to these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s. Neural crest cells are precursor populations essential to the development of both at-risk tissues. We report that two heat-activated transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels, TRPV1 and TRPV4, were present in neural crest cells during critical windows of heart and face development. TRPV1 antagonists protected against the development of hyperthermia-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s in chick embryos. Treatment with chemical agonists of TRPV1 or TRPV4 replicated hyperthermia-induced birth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s in chick and zebrafish embryos. To test whether transient TRPV channel permeability in neural crest cells was sufficient to induce these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s, we engineered iron-binding modifications to TRPV1 and TRPV4 that enabled remote and noninvasive activation of these channels in specific cellular locations and at specific developmental times in chick embryos with radio-frequency electromagnetic fields. Transient stimulation of radio frequency–controlled TRP channels in neural crest cells replicated fever-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s in developing chick embryos. Our data provide a previously undescribed mechanism for congenital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s, whereby hyperthermia activates ion channels that negatively affect fetal development.</p>

Comparison of Micropore Distribution in Cell Walls of Softwood and Hardwood Xylem
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">poros</span></strong>ity of wood cell walls is of interest for both understanding xylem functionality and from a wood materials perspective. The movement of water in xylem generally occurs through the macroporous networks formed in softwood by bordered pits and in hardwood by the intervessel pits and open conduits created by vessels and perforation plates. In some situations, such as cavitated xylem, water can only move through the micropores that occur in lignified tracheid and fiber cell walls; however, these micropore networks are poorly understood. Here, we used molecular microscopy analysis of radiata pine (<i>Pinus radiata</i>) and red beech (<i>Nothofagus fusca</i>) to determine the distribution of micropores in the secondary walls and middle lamellae of tracheids and fibers in relation to cell wall composition. Using two different types of probe, we identified a greater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">poros</span></strong>ity of secondary cell walls and a reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">poros</span></strong>ity of the middle lamella. Areas of reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">poros</span></strong>ity were observed in the outer regions of the secondary cell wall of both tracheids and fibers that appear unrelated to lignification or the distribution of cellulose, mannan, and xylan. Hardwood fiber cell walls were less lignified than those of softwood tracheids and showed greater accessibility to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">poros</span></strong>ity probes. Vessel cell walls were comparable to those of fibers in terms of both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">poros</span></strong>ity and lignification. Lignification is probably the primary determinant of cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">poros</span></strong>ity in xylem. The highly lignified middle lamella, and lumen surface, act as a barrier to probe movement and, therefore, water movement in both softwood and hardwood.</p>

Developmental Defects Mediated by the P1/HC-Pro Potyviral Silencing Suppressor Are Not Due to Misregulation of <i>AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 8</i>
<p>Plant viral suppressors of RNA silencing induce developmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s similar to those caused by mutations in genes involved in the microRNA pathway. A recent report has attributed viral suppressor-mediated developmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s to up-regulation of <i>AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 8</i> (<i>ARF8</i>), a target of miR167. The key piece of evidence was that the developmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s in transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) expressing viral suppressors were greatly alleviated in the F1 progeny of a cross with plants carrying the <i>arf8-6</i> mutation. <i>Arf8-6</i> is a SALK line T-DNA insertion mutant, a class of mutations prone to inducing transcriptional silencing of transgenes expressed from the 35S promoter. We have reinvestigated the role of <i>ARF8</i> in viral suppressor-mediated developmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s, using two independent <i>arf8</i> mutations and the P1/HC-Pro potyviral suppressor of silencing. Progeny of a cross between <i>P1/HC-Pro</i> transgenic Arabidopsis and the <i>arf8-6</i> T-DNA insertion mutant showed little effect on the P1/HC-Pro phenotype in the F1 generation, but almost all <i>arf8-6</i>/<i>P1/HC-Pro</i> progeny had lost the phenotype in the F2 generation. However, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> of phenotype in the F2 generation was not correlated with the number of functional copies of the <i>ARF8</i> gene. Instead, it reflected transcriptional silencing of the <i>P1/HC-Pro</i> transgene, as evidenced by a pronounced decrease in P1/HC-Pro mRNA and the appearance of 35S promoter small interfering RNAs. Furthermore, an independent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong>-of-function point mutation, <i>Arf8-8</i>, had no detectable effects on P1/HC-Pro phenotype in either the F1 or F2 generations. Together, these data argue against the previously reported role of increased <i>ARF8</i> expression in developmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s caused by <i>P1/HC-Pro</i>.</p>

The secreted <i>AdamTS-A</i> metalloprotease is required for collective cell migration
<p>Members of the ADAMTS family of secreted metalloproteases play crucial roles in modulating the extracellular matrix (ECM) in development and disease. Here, we show that ADAMTS-A, the <i>Drosophila</i> ortholog of human ADAMTS 9 and ADAMTS 20, and of <i>C. elegans</i> GON-1, is required for cell migration during embryogenesis. <i>AdamTS-A</i> is expressed in multiple migratory cell types, including hemocytes, caudal visceral mesoderm (CVM), the visceral branch of the trachea (VBs) and the secretory portion of the salivary gland (SG). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> of <i>AdamTS-A</i> causes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s in germ cell, CVM and VB migration and, depending on the tissue, <i>AdamTS-A</i> functions both autonomously and non-autonomously. In the highly polarized collective of the SG epithelium, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> of <i>AdamTS-A</i> causes apical surface irregularities and cell elongation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s. We provide evidence that ADAMTS-A is secreted into the SG lumen where it functions to release cells from the apical ECM, consistent with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s observed in <i>AdamTS-A</i> mutant SGs. We show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> of the apically localized protocadherin <i>Cad99C</i> rescues the SG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s, suggesting that Cad99C serves as a link between the SG apical membrane and the secreted apical ECM component(s) cleaved by ADAMTS-A. Our analysis of <i>AdamTS-A</i> function in the SG suggests a novel role for ADAMTS proteins in detaching cells from the apical ECM, facilitating tube elongation during collective cell migration.</p>

Opposing Actions of Fibroblast and Cardiomyocyte Smad3 Signaling in the Infarcted Myocardium
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Transforming growth factor–βs regulate a wide range of cellular responses by activating Smad-dependent and Smad-independent cascades.

The effects of cell-specific Smad3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> on the infarcted heart were studied using histological studies, assessment of protein, and gene expression levels.

The consequences of fibroblast-specific Smad3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> were not a result of effects on acute infarct size but were associated with unrestrained fibroblast proliferation, impaired scar remodeling, reduced fibroblast-derived collagen synthesis, and perturbed alignment of myofibroblast arrays in the infarct. Polarized light microscopy in Sirius red–stained sections demonstrated that the changes in fibroblast morphology were associated with perturbed organization of the collagenous matrix in the infarcted area. In contrast, α-smooth muscle actin expression by infarct myofibroblasts was not affected by Smad3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong>.

Pin1 mediates Aβ<sub>42</sub>-induced dendritic spine loss
<p>Early-stage Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> of dendritic spines in the neocortex of the brain. This phenomenon precedes tau pathology, plaque formation, and neurodegeneration and likely contributes to synaptic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong>, memory impairment, and behavioral changes in patients. Studies suggest that dendritic spine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> is induced by soluble, multimeric amyloid-β (Aβ<sub>42</sub>), which, through postsynaptic signaling, activates the protein phosphatase calcineurin. We investigated how calcineurin caused spine pathology and found that the cis-trans prolyl isomerase Pin1 was a critical downstream target of Aβ<sub>42</sub>-calcineurin signaling. In dendritic spines, Pin1 interacted with and was dephosphorylated by calcineurin, which rapidly suppressed its isomerase activity. Knockout of Pin1 or exposure to Aβ<sub>42</sub> induced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> of mature dendritic spines, which was prevented by exogenous Pin1. The calcineurin inhibitor FK506 blocked dendritic spine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> in Aβ<sub>42</sub>-treated wild-type cells but had no effect on <i>Pin1</i>-null neurons. These data implicate Pin1 in dendritic spine maintenance and synaptic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> in early Alzheimer’s disease.</p>

Scalable and safe synthetic organic electroreduction inspired by Li-ion battery chemistry
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ive electrosynthesis has faced long-standing challenges in applications to complex organic substrates at scale.

We show how these conditions have a very high level of functional-group tolerance relative to classical electrochemical and chemical dissolving-metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ions. Finally, we demonstrate that the same electrochemical conditions can be applied to other dissolving metal–type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ive transformations, including McMurry couplings, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ive ketone deoxygenations, and epoxide openings.</p>

Ancient convergent losses of <i>Paraoxonase 1</i> yield potential risks for modern marine mammals
<p>Mammals diversified by colonizing drastically different environments, with each transition yielding numerous molecular changes, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong>es of protein function. Though not initially deleterious, these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong>es could subsequently carry deleterious pleiotropic consequences. We have used phylogenetic methods to identify convergent functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong>es across independent marine mammal lineages. In one extreme case, <i>Paraoxonase 1</i> (<i>PON1</i>) accrued lesions in all marine lineages, while remaining intact in all terrestrial mammals. These lesions coincide with PON1 enzymatic activity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> in marine species’ blood plasma. This convergent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> is likely explained by parallel shifts in marine ancestors’ lipid metabolism and/or bloodstream oxidative environment affecting PON1’s role in fatty acid oxidation. PON1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> also eliminates marine mammals’ main defense against neurotoxicity from specific man-made organophosphorus compounds, implying potential risks in modern environments.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
A Maternally Deposited Endosperm Cuticle Contributes to the Physiological Defects of <i>transparent testa</i> Seeds
<p>Mature dry seeds are highly resilient plant structures where the encapsulated embryo is kept protected and dormant to facilitate its ultimate dispersion. Seed viability is heavily dependent on the seed coat’s capacity to shield living tissues from mechanical and oxidative stress. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the seed coat, also called the testa, arises after the differentiation of maternal ovular integuments during seed development. We recently described a thick cuticle tightly embedded in the mature seed’s endosperm cell wall. We show here that it is produced by the maternal inner integument 1 layer and, remarkably, transferred to the developing endosperm. Arabidopsis <i>transparent testa</i> (<i>tt</i>) mutations cause maternally derived seed coat pigmentation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s. <i>TT</i> gene products encode proteins involved in flavonoid metabolism and regulators of seed coat development. <i>tt</i> mutants have abnormally high seed coat permeability, resulting in lower seed viability and dormancy. However, the biochemical basis of this high permeability is not fully understood. We show that the cuticles of developing <i>tt</i> mutant integuments have profound structural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s, which are associated with enhanced cuticle permeability. Genetic analysis indicates that a functional proanthocyanidin synthesis pathway is required to limit cuticle permeability, and our results suggest that proanthocyanidins could be intrinsic components of the cuticle. Together, these results show that the formation of a maternal cuticle is an intrinsic part of the normal integumental differentiation program leading to testa formation and is essential for the seed’s physiological properties.</p>

Measuring gill paracellular permeability with polyethylene glycol-4000 in freely swimming trout: proof of principle
<p>The influence of swimming activity on gill paracellular permeability has not been measured previously in fishes. We critically assessed the use of tritium-labeled polyethylene glycol ([<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000) for this purpose, a substance that is also a classic marker for extracellular fluid volume, glomerular filtration rate and drinking rate. Tests (8 h) on resting freshwater trout showed that when measuring [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance from the plasma in the efflux direction, correction for a large excretion via glomerular filtration was essential, necessitating urinary catheterization. When measuring [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance from the water in the influx direction, correction for a significant uptake by drinking was essential, necessitating terminal gut removal, whereas glomerular filtration <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong>es were minimal. After correction for these alternate routes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> and uptake, [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance rates by efflux from the plasma and by influx from the water were identical, showing that gill paracellular permeability is not rectified, and can be measured in either direction. The influx technique with terminal gut removal was used to assess gill paracellular permeability in trout without urinary catheters freely swimming at 1.2 body lengths s<sup>−1</sup> for 8 h. Branchial [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance rate (by influx from the water) increased significantly by ~80% in accord with a similar measured increase in O<sub>2</sub> consumption rate. Thus in trout, gill paracellular permeability does increase during exercise, in accord with the traditional concept of the osmorespiratory compromise.</p>

The Chinese soft-shelled turtle, <i>Pelodiscus sinensis</i>, decreases nitrogenous excretion, reduces urea synthesis and suppresses ammonia production during emersion
<p>The objective of this study was to examine the effects of 6 days of emersion on nitrogen metabolism and excretion in the Chinese soft-shelled turtle, <i>Pelodiscus sinensis</i>. Despite having a soft shell with a cutaneous surface that is known to be water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">permeabl</span></strong>e, <i>P. sinensis</i> lost only ~2% of body mass and was able to maintain its hematocrit and plasma osmolality, [Na<sup>+</sup>] and [Cl<sup>−</sup>] during 6 days of emersion. During emersion, it ameliorated water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> by reducing urine output, which led to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion (by 29–76%) in ammonia excretion. In comparison, there was a more prominent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion (by 82–99%) in urea excretion during emersion due to a lack of water to flush the buccopharyngeal epithelium, which is known to be the major route of urea excretion. Consequently, emersion resulted in an apparent shift from ureotely to ammonotely in <i>P. sinensis</i>. Although urea concentration increased in several tissues, the excess urea accumulated could only account for 13–22% of the deficit in urea excretion. Hence, it can be concluded that a decrease (~80%) in urea synthesis occurred in <i>P. sinensis</i> during the 6 days of emersion. Indeed, emersion led to significant decreases in the activity of some ornithine–urea cycle enzymes (argininosuccinate synthetase/argininosuccinate lyase and arginase) from the liver of <i>P. sinensis</i>. As a decrease in urea synthesis occurred without the accumulation of ammonia and total free amino acids, it can be deduced that ammonia production through amino acid catabolism was suppressed with a proportional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion in proteolysis in <i>P. sinensis</i> during emersion. Indeed, calculated results revealed that there could be a prominent decrease (~88%) in ammonia production in turtles after 6 days of emersion. In summary, despite being ureogenic and ureotelic in water, <i>P. sinensis</i> adopted a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion in ammonia production, instead of increased urea synthesis, as the major strategy to ameliorate ammonia toxicity and problems associated with dehydration during terrestrial exposure.</p>

Anterior knee pain and evidence of osteoarthritis of the patellofemoral joint should not be considered contraindications to mobile-bearing unicompartmental knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>It is not clear whether anterior knee pain and osteoarthritis   (OA) of the patellofemoral joint (PFJ) are contraindications to   medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA). Our aim was to   investigate the long-term outcome of a consecutive series of patients,   some of whom had anterior knee pain and PFJ OA managed with UKA.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We assessed the ten-year functional outcomes and 15-year implant   survival of 805 knees (677 patients) following medial mobile-bearing   UKA. The intra-operative status of the PFJ was documented and, with   the exception of bone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> with grooving to the lateral side, neither   the clinical or radiological state of the PFJ nor the presence of   anterior knee pain were considered a contraindication.

Reductions in Atherogenic Lipids and Major Cardiovascular Events
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>A continuous relationship between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) has been observed in statin and ezetimibe outcomes trials down to achieved levels of 54 mg/dL. However, it is uncertain whether this relationship extends to LDL-C levels <50 mg/dL. We assessed the relationship between additional LDL-C, non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B100 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ions and MACE among patients within the ODYSSEY trials that compared alirocumab with controls (placebo/ezetimibe), mainly as add-on therapy to maximally tolerated statin.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data were pooled from 10 double-blind trials (6699 patient-years of follow-up). Randomization was to alirocumab 75/150 mg every 2 weeks or control for 24 to 104 weeks, added to background statin therapy in 8 trials. This analysis included 4974 patients (3182 taking alirocumab, 1174 taking placebo, 618 taking ezetimibe). In a post hoc analysis, the relationship between average on-treatment lipid levels and percent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ions in lipids from baseline were correlated with MACE (coronary heart disease death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or unstable angina requiring hospitalization) in multivariable analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, 33.1% of the pooled cohort achieved average LDL-C <50 mg/dL (44.7%–52.6% allocated to alirocumab, 6.5% allocated to ezetimibe, and 0% allocated to placebo). In total, 104 patients experienced MACE (median time to event, 36 weeks). For every 39 mg/dL lower achieved LDL-C, the risk of MACE appeared to be 24% lower (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.63–0.91; <i>P</i>=0.0025). Percent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ions in LDL-C from baseline were inversely correlated with MACE rates (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% confidence interval, 0.57–0.89 per additional 50% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion from baseline; <i>P</i>=0.003).

Classifying drivers of global forest loss
<p>Global maps of forest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> depict the scale and magnitude of forest disturbance, yet companies, governments, and nongovernmental organizations need to distinguish permanent conversion (i.e., deforestation) from temporary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> from forestry or wildfire. Using satellite imagery, we developed a forest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> classification model to determine a spatial attribution of forest disturbance to the dominant drivers of land cover and land use change over the period 2001 to 2015. Our results indicate that 27% of global forest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> can be attributed to deforestation through permanent land use change for commodity production. The remaining areas maintained the same land use over 15 years; in those areas, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> was attributed to forestry (26%), shifting agriculture (24%), and wildfire (23%). Despite corporate commitments, the rate of commodity-driven deforestation has not declined. To end deforestation, companies must eliminate 5 million hectares of conversion from supply chains each year.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
A Nitrogen-Fixing Subunit Essential for Accumulating 4Fe-4S-Containing Photosystem I Core Proteins
<p>Nitrogen-fixation-subunit-U (NFU)-type proteins have been shown to be involved in the biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters. We investigated the molecular function of a chloroplastic NFU-type iron-sulfur scaffold protein, NFU3, in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) using genetics approaches. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong>-of-function mutations in the <i>NFU3</i> gene caused yellow pigmentation in leaves, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ions in plant size, leaf size, and growth rate, delay in flowering and seeding, and decreases in seed production. Biochemical and physiological analyses indicated that these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s are due to the substantial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ions in the abundances of 4Fe-4S-containing photosystem I (PSI) core subunits PsaA (where Psa stands for PSI), PsaB, and PsaC and a nearly complete <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> of PSI activity. In addition to the substantial decreases in the amounts of PSI core proteins, the content of 3Fe-4S-containing ferredoxin-dependent glutamine oxoglutarate aminotransferases declined significantly in the <i>nfu3</i> mutants. Furthermore, the absorption spectrum of the recombinant NFU3 protein showed features characteristic of 4Fe-4S and 3Fe-4S clusters, and the in vitro reconstitution experiment indicated an iron-sulfur scaffold function of NFU3. These data demonstrate that NFU3 is involved in the assembly and transfer of 4Fe-4S and 3Fe-4S clusters and that NFU3 is required for the accumulation of 4Fe-4S- and 3Fe-4S-containing proteins, especially 4Fe-4S-containing PSI core subunits, in the Arabidopsis chloroplast.</p>

Importance of Translocon Subunit Tic56 for rRNA Processing and Chloroplast Ribosome Assembly
<p>Toc159-containing complexes at the outer chloroplast envelope membrane form stable supercomplexes with a 1-MD translocon at the inner chloroplast envelope membrane of which Tic56 is one essential subunit. While the single mutants <i>tic56-1</i> and <i>ppi2</i> (<i>toc159</i>) have an albino phenotype and are able to grow heterotrophically, we find the double mutant to be embryo lethal. Comprehensive quantitative proteome profiling with both single mutants in combination with GeneChip analyses identified a posttranscriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong> in the accumulation of plastid ribosomal proteins and diminished expression of plastid encoded proteins. In the <i>tic56-1</i> mutant, the assembly of functional ribosomes is furthermore hampered by a processing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong> of the plastid 23S rRNA. Spectinomycin-treatment of wild-type plants phenocopies the molecular phenotype of plastid proteome accumulation in <i>tic56-1</i> and to a smaller degree also <i>ppi2</i> plastids, suggesting that a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong> in plastid translation is largely responsible for the phenotype of both import mutants. Import experiments with the <i>tic56-3</i> mutant revealed no significant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong> in the import of small ribosomal protein 16 in the absence of full-length Tic56, suggesting that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong> in ribosome assembly in <i>tic56-1</i> may be independent of a function of Tic56 in protein import. Our data establish a previously unknown link between plastid protein import, the processing of plastid rRNAs, and the assembly of plastid ribosomes and provide further knowledge on the function of the translocon components and the molecular basis for their albino phenotype.</p>

Analysis of Arabidopsis Accessions Hypersensitive to a Loss of Chloroplast Translation
<p>Natural accessions of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) differ in their ability to tolerate a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> of chloroplast translation. These differences can be attributed in part to variation in a duplicated nuclear gene (<i>ACC2</i>) that targets homomeric acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACCase) to plastids. This functional redundancy allows limited fatty acid biosynthesis to occur in the absence of heteromeric ACCase, which is encoded in part by the plastid genome. In the presence of functional <i>ACC2</i>, tolerant alleles of several nuclear genes, not yet identified, enhance the growth of seedlings and embryos disrupted in chloroplast translation. <i>ACC2</i> knockout mutants, by contrast, are hypersensitive. Here we describe an expanded search for hypersensitive accessions of Arabidopsis, evaluate whether all of these accessions are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>ive in <i>ACC2</i>, and characterize genotype-to-phenotype relationships for homomeric ACCase variants identified among 855 accessions with sequenced genomes. Null alleles with <i>ACC2</i> nonsense mutations, frameshift mutations, small deletions, genomic rearrangements, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s in RNA splicing are included among the most sensitive accessions examined. By contrast, most missense mutations affecting highly conserved residues failed to eliminate ACC2 function. Several accessions were identified where sensitivity could not be attributed to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong> in either ACC2 or Tic20-IV, the chloroplast membrane channel required for ACC2 uptake. Overall, these results underscore the central role of <i>ACC2</i> in mediating Arabidopsis response to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> of chloroplast translation, highlight future applications of this system to analyzing chloroplast protein import, and provide valuable insights into the mutational landscape of an important metabolic enzyme that is highly conserved throughout eukaryotes.</p>

Evidence for Hydraulic Vulnerability Segmentation and Lack of Xylem Refilling under Tension
<p>The vascular system of grapevine (<i>Vitis</i> spp.) has been reported as being highly vulnerable, even though grapevine regularly experiences seasonal drought. Consequently, stomata would remain open below water potentials that would generate a high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> of stem hydraulic conductivity via xylem embolism. This situation would necessitate daily cycles of embolism repair to restore hydraulic function. However, a more parsimonious explanation is that some hydraulic techniques are prone to artifacts in species with long vessels, leading to the overestimation of vulnerability. The aim of this study was to provide an unbiased assessment of (1) the vulnerability to drought-induced embolism in perennial and annual organs and (2) the ability to refill embolized vessels in two <i>Vitis</i> species X-ray micro-computed tomography observations of intact plants indicated that both <i>Vitis</i> <i>vinifera</i> and <i>Vitis</i> <i>riparia</i> were relatively vulnerable, with the pressure inducing 50% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> of stem hydraulic conductivity = −1.7 and −1.3 MPa, respectively. In <i>V. vinifera</i>, both the stem and petiole had similar sigmoidal vulnerability curves but differed in pressure inducing 50% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> of hydraulic conductivity (−1.7 and −1 MPa for stem and petiole, respectively). Refilling was not observed as long as bulk xylem pressure remained negative (e.g. at the apical part of the plants; −0.11 ± 0.02 MPa) and change in percentage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> of conductivity was 0.02% ± 0.01%. However, positive xylem pressure was observed at the basal part of the plant (0.04 ± 0.01 MPa), leading to a recovery of conductance (change in percentage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> of conductivity = −0.24% ± 0.12%). Our findings provide evidence that grapevine is unable to repair embolized xylem vessels under negative pressure, but its hydraulic vulnerability segmentation provides significant protection of the perennial stem.</p>

Reconstruction of non-contained acetabular defects with impaction grafting, a reinforcement mesh and a cemented polyethylene acetabular component
<p>This review summarises the technique of impaction   grafting with mesh augmentation for the treatment of uncontained   acetabular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s in revision hip arthroplasty.</p><p>The ideal acetabular revision should restore bone stock, use   a small socket in the near-anatomic position, and provide durable   fixation. Impaction bone grafting, which has been in use for over   40 years, offers the ability to achieve these goals in uncontained   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s. The precepts of modern, revision impaction grafting are   that the segmental or cavitary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s must be supported with a   mesh; the contained cavity is filled with vigorously impacted morselised   fresh-frozen allograft; and finally, acrylic cement is used to stabilise   the graft and provide rigid, long-lasting fixation of the revised   acetabular component.</p><p>Favourable results have been published with this technique.

Polygenic Risk Score Identifies Subgroup With Higher Burden of Atherosclerosis and Greater Relative Benefit From Statin Therapy in the Primary Prevention Setting
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Relative risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion with statin therapy has been consistent across nearly all subgroups studied to date. However, in analyses of 2 randomized controlled primary prevention trials (ASCOT [Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial–Lipid-Lowering Arm] and JUPITER [Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin]), statin therapy led to a greater relative risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion among a subgroup at high genetic risk. Here, we aimed to confirm this observation in a third primary prevention randomized controlled trial. In addition, we assessed whether those at high genetic risk had a greater burden of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied participants from a randomized controlled trial of primary prevention with statin therapy (WOSCOPS [West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study]; n=4910) and 2 observational cohort studies (CARDIA [Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults] and BioImage; n=1154 and 4392, respectively). For each participant, we calculated a polygenic risk score derived from up to 57 common DNA sequence variants previously associated with coronary heart disease. We compared the relative efficacy of statin therapy in those at high genetic risk (top quintile of polygenic risk score) versus all others (WOSCOPS), as well as the association between the polygenic risk score and coronary artery calcification (CARDIA) and carotid artery plaque burden (BioImage).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among WOSCOPS trial participants at high genetic risk, statin therapy was associated with a relative risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion of 44% (95% confidence interval [CI], 22–60; <i>P</i><0.001), whereas in all others, the relative risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion was 24% (95% CI, 8–37; <i>P</i>=0.004) despite similar low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering. In a study-level meta-analysis across the WOSCOPS, ASCOT, and JUPITER primary prevention, relative risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion in those at high genetic risk was 46% versus 26% in all others (<i>P</i> for heterogeneity=0.05). Across all 3 studies, the absolute risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion with statin therapy was 3.6% (95% CI, 2.0–5.1) among those in the high genetic risk group and 1.3% (95% CI, 0.6–1.9) in all others. Each 1-SD increase in the polygenic risk score was associated with 1.32-fold (95% CI, 1.04–1.68) greater likelihood of having coronary artery calcification and 9.7% higher (95% CI, 2.2–17.8) burden of carotid plaque.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Those at high genetic risk have a greater burden of subclinical atherosclerosis and derive greater relative and absolute benefit from statin therapy to prevent a first coronary heart disease event.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

PDZRN3 destabilizes endothelial cell-cell junctions through a PKCζ-containing polarity complex to increase vascular permeability
<p>Endothelial cells serve as a barrier between blood and tissues. Maintenance of the endothelial cell barrier depends on the integrity of intercellular junctions, which is regulated by a polarity complex that includes the ζ isoform of atypical protein kinase C (PKCζ) and partitioning <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>ive 3 (PAR3). We revealed that the E3 ubiquitin ligase PDZ domain–containing ring finger 3 (PDZRN3) regulated endothelial intercellular junction integrity. Endothelial cell–specific overexpression of <i>Pdzrn3</i> led to early embryonic lethality with severe hemorrhaging and altered organization of endothelial intercellular junctions. Conversely, endothelial-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> of <i>Pdzrn3</i> prevented vascular leakage in a mouse model of transient ischemic stroke, an effect that was mimicked by pharmacological inhibition of PKCζ. PDZRN3 regulated Wnt signaling and associated with a complex containing PAR3, PKCζ, and the multi-PDZ domain protein MUPP1 (Discs Lost–multi-PDZ domain protein 1) and targeted MUPP1 for proteasomal degradation in transfected cells. Transient ischemic stroke increased the ubiquitination of MUPP1, and deficiency of MUPP1 in endothelial cells was associated with decreased localization of PKCζ and PAR3 at intercellular junctions. In endothelial cells, <i>Pdzrn3</i> overexpression increased permeability through a PKCζ-dependent pathway. In contrast, <i>Pdzrn3</i> depletion enhanced PKCζ accumulation at cell-cell contacts and reinforced the cortical actin cytoskeleton under stress conditions. These findings reveal how PDZRN3 regulates vascular permeability through a PKCζ-containing complex.</p>

Electrical suppression of all nonradiative recombination pathways in monolayer semiconductors
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s in conventional semiconductors substantially lower the photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (QY), a key metric of optoelectronic performance that directly dictates the maximum device efficiency. Two-dimensional transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), such as monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub>, often exhibit low PL QY for as-processed samples, which has typically been attributed to a large native <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong> density. We show that the PL QY of as-processed MoS<sub>2</sub> and WS<sub>2</sub> monolayers reaches near-unity when they are made intrinsic through electrostatic doping, without any chemical passivation. Surprisingly, neutral exciton recombination is entirely radiative even in the presence of a high native <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong> density. This finding enables TMDC monolayers for optoelectronic device applications as the stringent requirement of low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong> density is eased.</p>

Ketyl radical reactivity via atom transfer catalysis
<p>Single-electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion of a carbonyl to a ketyl enables access to a polarity-reversed platform of reactivity for this cornerstone functional group. However, the synthetic utility of the ketyl radical is hindered by the strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ants necessary for its generation, which also limit its reactivity to net <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ive mechanisms. We report a strategy for net redox-neutral generation and reaction of ketyl radicals. The in situ conversion of aldehydes to α-acetoxy iodides lowers their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion potential by more than 1 volt, allowing for milder access to the corresponding ketyl radicals and an oxidative termination event. Upon subjecting these iodides to a dimanganese decacarbonyl precatalyst and visible light irradiation, an atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) mechanism affords a broad scope of vinyl iodide products with high <i>Z</i>-selectivity.</p>

Increase in crop losses to insect pests in a warming climate
<p>Insect pests substantially reduce yields of three staple grains—rice, maize, and wheat—but models assessing the agricultural impacts of global warming rarely consider crop <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong>es to insects. We use established relationships between temperature and the population growth and metabolic rates of insects to estimate how and where climate warming will augment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong>es of rice, maize, and wheat to insects. Global yield <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong>es of these grains are projected to increase by 10 to 25% per degree of global mean surface warming. Crop <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong>es will be most acute in areas where warming increases both population growth and metabolic rates of insects. These conditions are centered primarily in temperate regions, where most grain is produced.</p>

Plastic waste associated with disease on coral reefs
<p>Plastic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wast</span></strong>e can promote microbial colonization by pathogens implicated in outbreaks of disease in the ocean. We assessed the influence of plastic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wast</span></strong>e on disease risk in 124,000 reef-building corals from 159 reefs in the Asia-Pacific region. The likelihood of disease increases from 4% to 89% when corals are in contact with plastic. Structurally complex corals are eight times more likely to be affected by plastic, suggesting that microhabitats for reef-associated organisms and valuable fisheries will be disproportionately affected. Plastic levels on coral reefs correspond to estimates of terrestrial mismanaged plastic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wast</span></strong>e entering the ocean. We estimate that 11.1 billion plastic items are entangled on coral reefs across the Asia-Pacific and project this number to increase 40% by 2025.

Tropical forests are a net carbon source based on aboveground measurements of gain and loss
<p>The carbon balance of tropical ecosystems remains uncertain, with top-down atmospheric studies suggesting an overall sink and bottom-up ecological approaches indicating a modest net source. Here we use 12 years (2003 to 2014) of MODIS pantropical satellite data to quantify net annual changes in the aboveground carbon density of tropical woody live vegetation, providing direct, measurement-based evidence that the world’s tropical forests are a net carbon source of 425.2<bold> </bold>± 92.0 teragrams of carbon per year (Tg C year<sup>–1</sup>).

Long-term pattern and magnitude of soil carbon feedback to the climate system in a warming world
<p>In a 26-year soil warming experiment in a mid-latitude hardwood forest, we documented changes in soil carbon cycling to investigate the potential consequences for the climate system. We found that soil warming results in a four-phase pattern of soil organic matter decay and carbon dioxide fluxes to the atmosphere, with phases of substantial soil carbon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> alternating with phases of no detectable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong>.

These include depletion of microbially accessible carbon pools, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ions in microbial biomass, a shift in microbial carbon use efficiency, and changes in microbial community composition. Our results support projections of a long-term, self-reinforcing carbon feedback from mid-latitude forests to the climate system as the world warms.</p>

Greater role for Atlantic inflows on sea-ice loss in the Eurasian Basin of the Arctic Ocean
<p>Arctic sea-ice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> is a leading indicator of climate change and can be attributed, in large part, to atmospheric forcing. Here, we show that recent ice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ions, weakening of the halocline, and shoaling of the intermediate-depth Atlantic Water layer in the eastern Eurasian Basin have increased winter ventilation in the ocean interior, making this region structurally similar to that of the western Eurasian Basin. The associated enhanced release of oceanic heat has reduced winter sea-ice formation at a rate now comparable to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong>es from atmospheric thermodynamic forcing, thus explaining the recent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion in sea-ice cover in the eastern Eurasian Basin. This encroaching “atlantification” of the Eurasian Basin represents an essential step toward a new Arctic climate state, with a substantially greater role for Atlantic inflows.</p>

Mesophyll Abscisic Acid Restrains Early Growth and Flowering But Does Not Directly Suppress Photosynthesis
<p>Abscisic acid (ABA) levels increase significantly in plants under stress conditions, and ABA is thought to serve as a key stress-response regulator. However, the direct effect of ABA on photosynthesis and the effect of mesophyll ABA on yield under both well-watered and drought conditions are still the subject of debate. Here, we examined this issue using transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants carrying a dominant ABA-signaling inhibitor under the control of a mesophyll-specific promoter (<i>FBPase::abi1-1</i>, abbreviated to <i>fa</i>). Under normal conditions, <i>fa</i> plants displayed slightly higher stomatal conductance and carbon assimilation than wild-type plants; however, these parameters were comparable following ABA treatment. These observations suggest that ABA does not directly inhibit photosynthesis in the short term. The <i>fa</i> plants also exhibited a variety of altered phenotypes under optimal conditions, including more vigorous initial growth, earlier flowering, smaller flowers, and delayed chlorophyll degradation. Furthermore, under optimal conditions, <i>fa</i> plant seed production was less than a third of that observed for the wild type. However, under drought conditions, wild-type and <i>fa</i> seed yields were similar due to a significant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion in wild-type seed and no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion in <i>fa</i> seed. These findings suggest that endogenous basal ABA inhibits a stress-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">escap</span></strong>e response under nonstressed conditions, allowing plants to accumulate biomass and maximize yield. The lack of a correlation between flowering time and plant biomass combined with delayed chlorophyll degradation suggests that this stress-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">escap</span></strong>e behavior is regulated independently and upstream of other ABA-induced effects such as rapid growth and flowering.</p>

CLASP Facilitates Transitions between Cortical Microtubule Array Patterns
<p>Acentrosomal plant microtubule arrays form patterns at the cell cortex that influence cellular morphogenesis by templating the deposition of cell wall materials, but the molecular basis by which the microtubules form the cortical array patterns remains largely unknown. Loss of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) microtubule-associated protein, CYTOPLASMIC LINKER ASSOCIATED PROTEIN (AtCLASP), results in cellular growth anisotropy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s in hypocotyl cells. We examined the microtubule array patterning in <i>atclasp-1</i> null mutants and discovered a significant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong> in the timing of transitions between array patterns but no substantive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong> in the array patterns per se. Detailed analysis and computational modeling of the microtubule dynamics in two <i>atclasp-1</i> fluorescent tubulin marker lines revealed marker-dependent effects on depolymerization and catastrophe frequency predicted to alter the steady-state microtubule population. Quantitative in vivo analysis of the underlying microtubule array architecture showed that AtCLASP is required to maintain the number of growing microtubule plus ends during transitions between array patterns. We propose that AtCLASP plays a critical role in cellular morphogenesis through actions on new microtubules that facilitate array transitions.</p>

<i>MtNODULE ROOT1</i> and <i>MtNODULE ROOT2</i> Are Essential for Indeterminate Nodule Identity
<p>Symbiotic interactions between legume plants and rhizobia result in the formation of nitrogen-fixing nodules, but the molecular actors and the mechanisms allowing for the maintenance of nodule identity are poorly understood. <i>Medicago truncatula NODULE ROOT1</i> (<i>MtNOOT1</i>), <i>Pisum sativum COCHLEATA1</i> (<i>PsCOCH1</i>), and <i>Lotus japonicus NOOT-BOP-COCH-LIKE1</i> (<i>LjNBCL1</i>) are orthologs of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>AtBLADE-ON-PETIOLE1/2</i> and are members of the <i>NBCL</i> gene family, which has conserved roles in plant development and is essential for indeterminate and determinate nodule identity in legumes. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> of function of <i>MtNOOT1</i>, <i>PsCOCH1</i>, and <i>LjNBCL1</i> triggers a partial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> of nodule identity characterized by the development of ectopic roots arising from nodule vascular meristems. Here, we report the identification and characterization of a second gene involved in regulating indeterminate nodule identity in <i>M. truncatula</i>, <i>MtNOOT2</i>. <i>MtNOOT2</i> is the paralog of <i>MtNOOT1</i> and belongs to a second legume-specific <i>NBCL</i> subclade, the <i>NBCL2</i> clade. <i>MtNOOT2</i> expression was induced during early nodule formation, and it was expressed primarily in the nodule central meristem. <i>Mtnoot2</i> mutants did not present any particular symbiotic phenotype; however, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> of function of both <i>MtNOOT1</i> and <i>MtNOOT2</i> resulted in the complete <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> of nodule identity and was accompanied by drastic changes in the expression of symbiotic, defense, and root apical meristem marker genes. <i>Mtnoot1 noot2</i> double mutants developed only nonfixing root-like structures that were no longer able to host symbiotic rhizobia.

Arabidopsis <i>VAC14</i> Is Critical for Pollen Development through Mediating Vacuolar Organization
<p>Pollen viability depends on dynamic vacuolar changes during pollen development involving increases and decreases of vacuolar volume through water and osmolite accumulation and vacuolar fission. Mutations in <i>FAB1A</i> to <i>FAB1D</i>, the genes encoding phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate [PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>]-converting kinases, are male gametophyte lethal in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) due to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>ive vacuolar fission after pollen mitosis I, suggesting a key role of the phospholipid in dynamic vacuolar organization. However, other genetic components that regulate the production of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> and its involvement in pollen germination and tube growth are unknown. Here, we identified and characterized Arabidopsis VAC14, a homolog of the yeast and metazoan VAC14s that are crucial for the production of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>. <i>VAC14</i> is constitutively expressed and highly present in developing pollen. Loss of function of <i>VAC14</i> was male gametophyte lethal due to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>ive pollen development. Ultrastructural studies showed that vacuolar fission after pollen mitosis I was compromised in <i>vac14</i> mutant microspores, which led to pollen abortion. We further showed that inhibiting the production of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> or exogenous application of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> mimicked or rescued the pollen developmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong> of the <i>vac14</i> mutant, respectively. Genetic interference and pharmacological approaches suggested a role of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> in pollen germination and tube growth. Our results provide insights into the function of VAC14 and, by inference, that of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> in plant cells.</p>

The ADAPTOR PROTEIN-3 Complex Mediates Pollen Tube Growth by Coordinating Vacuolar Targeting and Organization
<p>Pollen tube growth is an essential step for successful plant reproduction. Vacuolar trafficking and dynamic organization are important for pollen tube growth; however, the key proteins involved in these processes are not well understood. Here, we report that the ADAPTOR PROTEIN-3 (AP-3) complex and its tonoplast cargo PROTEIN S-ACYL TRANSFERASE10 (PAT10) are critical for pollen tube growth in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). AP-3 is a heterotetrameric protein complex consisting of four subunits, δ, β, µ, and σ. AP-3 regulates tonoplast targeting of several cargoes, such as PAT10. We show that functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> of any of the four AP-3 subunits reduces plant fertility. In <i>ap-3</i> mutants, pollen development was normal but pollen tube growth was compromised, leading to reduced male transmission. Functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> of <i>PAT10</i> caused a similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion in pollen tube growth, suggesting that the tonoplast association of PAT10 mediated by AP-3 is crucial for this process. Indeed, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> gradient during pollen tube growth was reduced significantly due to <i>AP-3</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> of function, consistent with the abnormal targeting of CALCINUERIN B-LIKE2 (CBL2) and CBL3, whose tonoplast association depends on PAT10. Furthermore, we show that the pollen tubes of <i>ap-3</i> mutants have vacuoles with simplified tubules and bulbous structures, indicating that AP-3 affects vacuolar organization. Our results demonstrate a role for AP-3 in plant reproduction and provide insights into the role of vacuoles in polarized cell growth.</p>

Evidence That Isoprene Emission Is Not Limited by Cytosolic Metabolites. Exogenous Malate Does Not Invert the Reverse Sensitivity of Isoprene Emission to High [CO<sub>2</sub>]
<p>Isoprene is synthesized via the chloroplastic 2-<i>C</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-erythritol 4-phosphate/1-deoxy-<sc>d</sc>-xylulose 5-phosphate pathway (MEP/DOXP), and its synthesis is directly related to photosynthesis, except under high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, when the rate of photosynthesis increases but isoprene emission decreases. Suppression of MEP/DOXP pathway activity by high CO<sub>2</sub> has been explained either by limited supply of the cytosolic substrate precursor, phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate (PEP), into chloroplast as the result of enhanced activity of cytosolic PEP carboxylase or by limited supply of energetic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ive equivalents. We tested the PEP-limitation hypotheses by feeding leaves with the PEP carboxylase competitive inhibitors malate and diethyl oxalacetate (DOA) in the strong isoprene emitter hybrid aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus tremuloides</i>). Malate feeding resulted in the inhibition of net assimilation, photosynthetic electron transport, and isoprene emission rates, but DOA feeding did not affect any of these processes except at very high application concentrations. Both malate and DOA did not alter the sensitivity of isoprene emission to high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. Malate inhibition of isoprene emission was associated with enhanced chloroplastic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ive status that suppressed light reactions of photosynthesis, ultimately leading to reduced isoprene substrate dimethylallyl diphosphate pool size. Additional experiments with altered oxygen concentrations in conditions of feedback-limited and non-feedback-limited photosynthesis further indicated that changes in isoprene emission rate in control and malate-inhibited leaves were associated with changes in the share of ATP and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ive equivalent supply for isoprene synthesis. The results of this study collectively indicate that malate importantly controls the chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ive status and, thereby, affects isoprene emission, but they do not support the hypothesis that cytosolic metabolite availability alters the response of isoprene emission to changes in atmospheric composition.</p>

Clathrin Heavy Chain Subunits Coordinate Endo- and Exocytic Traffic and Affect Stomatal Movement
<p>The current model for vesicular traffic to and from the plasma membrane is accepted, but the molecular requirements for this coordination are not well defined. We have identified the <i>hot ABA-deficiency suppressor1</i> mutant, which has a stomatal function <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>, as a <i>clathrin heavy chain1</i> (<i>CHC1</i>) mutant allele and show that it has a decreased rate of endocytosis and growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s that are shared with other <i>chc1</i> mutant alleles. We used <i>chc1</i> alleles and the related <i>chc2</i> mutant as tools to investigate the effects that clathrin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s have on secretion pathways and plant growth. We show that secretion and endocytosis at the plasma membrane are sensitive to CHC1 and CHC2 function in seedling roots and that <i>chc</i> mutants have physiological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s in stomatal function and plant growth that have not been described previously. These findings suggest that clathrin supports specific functions in multiple cell types. Stomata movement and gas exchange are altered in <i>chc</i> mutants, indicating that clathrin is important for stomatal regulation. The aberrant function of <i>chc</i> mutant stomata is consistent with the growth phenotypes observed under different water and light conditions, which also are similar to those of the secretory SNARE mutant, <i>syp121</i>. The <i>syp121</i> and <i>chc</i> mutants have impaired endocytosis and exocytosis compared with the wild type, indicating a link between SYP121-dependent secretion and clathrin-dependent endocytosis at the plasma membrane. Our findings provide evidence that clathrin and SYP121 functions are important for the coordination of endocytosis and exocytosis and have an impact on stomatal function, gas exchange, and vegetative growth in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>).</p>

The Plastid Genome of <i>Polytoma uvella</i> Is the Largest Known among Colorless Algae and Plants and Reflects Contrasting Evolutionary Paths to Nonphotosynthetic Lifestyles
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> of photosynthesis is frequently associated with parasitic or pathogenic lifestyles, but it also can occur in free-living, plastid-bearing lineages. A common consequence of becoming nonphotosynthetic is the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion in size and gene content of the plastid genome. In exceptional circumstances, it can even result in the complete <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> of the plastid DNA (ptDNA) and its associated gene expression system, as reported recently in several lineages, including the nonphotosynthetic green algal genus <i>Polytomella</i>. Closely related to <i>Polytomella</i> is the polyphyletic genus <i>Polytoma</i>, the members of which lost photosynthesis independently of <i>Polytomella</i>. Species from both genera are free-living organisms that contain nonphotosynthetic plastids, but unlike <i>Polytomella</i>, <i>Polytoma</i> members have retained a genome in their colorless plastid. Here, we present the plastid genome of <i>Polytoma uvella</i>: to our knowledge, the first report of ptDNA from a nonphotosynthetic chlamydomonadalean alga. The <i>P. uvella</i> ptDNA contains 25 protein-coding genes, most of which are related to gene expression and none are connected to photosynthesis. However, despite its reduced coding capacity, the <i>P. uvella</i> ptDNA is inflated with short repeats and is tens of kilobases larger than the ptDNAs of its closest known photosynthetic relatives, <i>Chlamydomonas leiostraca</i> and <i>Chlamydomonas applanata</i>. In fact, at approximately 230 kb, the ptDNA of <i>P. uvella</i> represents the largest plastid genome currently reported from a nonphotosynthetic alga or plant. Overall, the <i>P. uvella</i> and <i>Polytomella</i> plastid genomes reveal two very different evolutionary paths following the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> of photosynthesis: expansion and complete deletion, respectively. We hypothesize that recombination-based DNA-repair mechanisms are at least partially responsible for the different evolutionary outcomes observed in such closely related nonphotosynthetic algae.</p>

ZRF1 Chromatin Regulators Have Polycomb Silencing and Independent Roles in Development
<p>Histone H2A monoubiquitination (H2Aub1), catalyzed by Polycomb-Repressive Complex1 (PRC1), is a key epigenetic mark in Polycomb silencing. However, little is known about how H2Aub1 is read to exert downstream physiological functions. The animal ZUOTIN-RELATED FACTOR1 (ZRF1) has been reported to bind H2Aub1 to promote or repress the expression of varied target genes. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) ZRF1 homologs, AtZRF1a and AtZRF1b, are key regulators of multiple processes during plant growth and development. Loss of function of both <i>AtZRF1a</i> and <i>AtZRF1b</i> in <i>atzrf1a atzrf1b</i> mutants causes seed germination delay, small plant size, abnormal meristem activity, abnormal flower development, as well as gametophyte transmission and embryogenesis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s. Some of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s overlap with those described previously in the PRC1-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>ive mutants <i>atbmi1a atbmi1b</i> and <i>atring1a atring1b</i>, but others are specific to <i>atzrf1a atzrf1b</i>. In line with this, 4,519 genes (representing more than 14% of all genes) within the Arabidopsis genome are found differentially expressed in <i>atzrf1a atzrf1b</i> seedlings, and among them, 114 genes are commonly up-regulated in <i>atring1a atring1b</i> and <i>atbmi1a atbmi1b</i>. Finally, we show that in both <i>atzrf1a atzrf1b</i> and <i>atbmi1a atbmi1b</i> seedlings, the seed developmental genes <i>ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE3</i>, <i>CRUCIFERIN3</i>, and <i>CHOTTO1</i> are derepressed, in association with the reduced levels of H2Aub1 and histone H3 lysine-27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). Collectively, our results indicate that <i>AtZRF1a/b</i> play both PRC1-related and PRC1-unrelated functions in regulating plant growth and development and that <i>AtZRF1a/b</i> promote H2Aub1 and H3K27me3 deposition in gene suppression. Our work provides novel insight into the mechanisms of function of this family of evolutionarily conserved chromatin regulators.</p>

The use of ultra-low-dose CT scans for the evaluation of limb fractures
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To evaluate whether an ultra-low-dose CT protocol can diagnose   selected limb fractures as well as conventional CT (C-CT).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We prospectively studied 40 consecutive patients with a limb   fracture in whom a CT scan was indicated. These were scanned using   an ultra-low-dose CT Reduced Effective Dose Using Computed Tomography   In Orthopaedic Injury (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ION) protocol. Studies from 16 selected   cases were compared with 16 C-CT scans matched for age, gender and   type of fracture. Studies were assessed for diagnosis and image   quality. Descriptive and reliability statistics were calculated.   The total effective radiation dose for each scanned site was compared.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean estimated effective dose (ED) for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ION protocol   was 0.03 milliSieverts (mSv) and 0.43 mSv (p < 0.005) for C-CT.   The sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value   (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ION protocol   to detect fractures were 0.98, 0.89, 0.98 and 0.89 respectively   when two occult fractures were excluded. Inter- and intra-observer   reliability for diagnosis using the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ION protocol (κ = 0.75, κ =   0.71) were similar to those of C-CT (κ = 0.85, κ = 0.82). Using   the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ION protocol, 3D CT reconstructions were equivalent in   quality and diagnostic information to those generated by C-CT (κ =   0.87, κ = 0.94).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>With a near 14-fold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion in estimated ED compared with C-CT,   the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ION protocol reduces the amount of CT radiation substantially   without significant diagnostic decay.

Complexes of Usher proteins preassemble at the endoplasmic reticulum and are required for trafficking and ER homeostasis
<p>Usher syndrome (USH), the leading cause of hereditary combined hearing and vision <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong>, is characterized by sensorineural deafness and progressive retinal degeneration. Mutations in several different genes produce USH, but the proximal cause of sensory cell death remains mysterious. We adapted a proximity ligation assay to analyze associations among three of the USH proteins, Cdh23, Harmonin and Myo7aa, and the microtubule-based transporter Ift88 in zebrafish inner ear mechanosensory hair cells. We found that the proteins are in close enough proximity to form complexes and that these complexes preassemble at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s in any one of the three USH proteins disrupt formation and trafficking of the complex and result in diminished levels of the other proteins, generalized trafficking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s and ER stress that triggers apoptosis. ER stress, thus, contributes to sensory hair cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loss</span></strong> and provides a new target to explore for protective therapies for USH.</p>

Mechanisms of <i>prickle1a</i> function in zebrafish epilepsy and retinal neurogenesis
<p>Epilepsy is a complex neurological disorder characterized by unprovoked seizures. The etiology is heterogeneous with both genetic and environmental causes. Genes that regulate neurotransmitters and ion channels in the central nervous system have been associated with epilepsy. However, a recent screening in human epilepsy patients identified mutations in the <i>PRICKLE1</i> (<i>PK1</i>) locus, highlighting a potentially novel mechanism underlying seizures. PK1 is a core component of the planar cell polarity network that regulates tissue polarity. Zebrafish studies have shown that Pk1 coordinates cell movement, neuronal migration and axonal outgrowth during embryonic development. Yet how dysfunction of Pk1 relates to epilepsy is unknown. To address the mechanism underlying epileptogenesis, we used zebrafish to characterize Pk1a function and epilepsy-related mutant forms. We show that knockdown of <i>pk1a</i> activity sensitizes zebrafish larva to a convulsant drug. To model <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s in the central nervous system, we used the retina and found that <i>pk1a</i> knockdown induces neurite outgrowth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s; yet visual function is maintained. Furthermore, we characterized the functional and biochemical properties of the PK1 mutant forms identified in human patients. Functional analyses demonstrate that the wild-type Pk1a partially suppresses the gene knockdown retinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s but not the mutant forms. Biochemical analysis reveals increased ubiquitylation of one mutant form and decreased translational efficiency of another mutant form compared with the wild-type Pk1a. Taken together, our results indicate that mutation of human PK1 could lead to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defect</span></strong>s in neurodevelopment and signal processing, providing insight into seizure predisposition in these patients.</p>

Inflammatory and Cholesterol Risk in the FOURIER Trial
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In the FOURIER trial (Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Patients With Elevated Risk), the PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitor evolocumab reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and cardiovascular risk. It is not known whether the efficacy of evolocumab is modified by baseline inflammatory risk. We explored the efficacy of evolocumab stratified by baseline high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). We also assessed the importance of inflammatory and residual cholesterol risk across the range of on-treatment LDL-C concentrations.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients (n=27 564) with stable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and LDL-C ≥70 mg/dL on a statin were randomly assigned to evolocumab versus placebo and followed for a median of 2.2 years (1.8–2.5). The effects of evolocumab on the primary end point of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina or coronary revascularization, and the key secondary end point of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke were compared across strata of baseline hsCRP (<1, 1–3, and >3 mg/dL). Outcomes were also assessed across values for baseline hsCRP and 1-month LDL-C in the entire trial population. Multivariable models adjusted for variables associated with hsCRP and 1-month LDL-C were evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 7981 (29%) patients had a baseline hsCRP<1 mg/L, 11 177 (41%) had a hsCRP 1 to 3 mg/L, and 8337 (30%) had a hsCRP >3 mg/L. Median (interquartile range) baseline hsCRP was 1.8 (0.9–3.6) mg/L and levels were not altered by evolocumab (change at 48 weeks of –0.2 mg/dL [–1.0 to 0.4] in both treatment arms). In the placebo arm, patients in higher baseline hsCRP categories experienced significantly higher 3-year Kaplan-Meier rates of the primary and key secondary end points: 12.0%, 13.7%, and 18.1% for the primary end point (<i>P</i><sub>trend</sub><0.0001) and 7.4%, 9.1%, and 13.2% for the key secondary end point (<i>P</i><sub>trend</sub><0.0001) for categories of <1, 1 to 3, and >3 mg/dL, respectively. The relative risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ions for the primary end point and key secondary end point with evolocumab were consistent across hsCRP strata (<i>P</i>-interactions>0.15 for both). In contrast, the absolute risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ions with evolocumab tended to be greater in patients with higher hsCRP: 1.6%, 1.8%, and 2.6% and 0.8%, 2.0%, and 3.0%, respectively, for the primary and key secondary end points across hsCRP strata. In adjusted analyses of the association between LDL-C and hsCRP levels and cardiovascular risk, both LDL-C and hsCRP were independently associated with the primary outcome (<i>P</i><0.0001 for each).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>LDL-C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion with evolocumab reduces cardiovascular events across hsCRP strata with greater absolute risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ions in patients with higher-baseline hsCRP.

Benefit of Adding Ezetimibe to Statin Therapy on Cardiovascular Outcomes and Safety in Patients With Versus Without Diabetes Mellitus
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Ezetimibe, when added to simvastatin, reduces cardiovascular events after acute coronary syndrome. We explored outcomes stratified by diabetes mellitus (DM).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In IMPROVE-IT (Improved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial), 18 144 patients after acute coronary syndrome with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 50 to 125 mg/dL were randomized to 40 mg ezetimibe/simvastatin (E/S) or 40 mg placebo/simvastatin. The primary composite end point was cardiovascular death, major coronary events, and stroke. DM was a prespecified subgroup.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The 4933 (27%) patients with DM were more often older and female, had had a prior myocardial infarction and revascularization, and presented more frequently with non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome compared with patients without DM (each <i>P</i><0.001). The median admission low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was lower among patients with DM (89 versus 97 mg/dL, <i>P</i><0.001). E/S achieved a significantly lower median time-weighted average low-density lipoprotein cholesterol compared with placebo/simvastatin, irrespective of DM (DM: 49 versus 67 mg/dL; no DM: 55 versus 71 mg/dL; both <i>P</i><0.001). In patients with DM, E/S reduced the 7-year Kaplan–Meier primary end point event rate by 5.5% absolute (hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.78-0.94); in patients without DM, the absolute difference was 0.7% (hazard ratio, 0.98; 95% confidence interval, 0.91–1.04; <i>P</i><sub>int</sub>=0.02). The largest relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ions in patients with DM were in myocardial infarction (24%) and ischemic stroke (39%). No differences in safety outcomes by treatment were present regardless of DM. When stratified further by age, patients ≥75 years of age had a 20% relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion in the primary end point regardless of DM (<i>P</i><sub>int</sub>=0.91), whereas patients <75 years of age with DM had greater benefit than those without (<i>P</i><sub>int</sub>=0.011). When stratified by the TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) Risk Score for Secondary Prevention, all patients with DM demonstrated benefit with E/S regardless of risk. In contrast, among patients without DM, those with a high risk score experienced a significant (18%) relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion in the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and ischemic stroke with E/S compared with placebo/simvastatin, whereas patients without DM at low or moderate risk demonstrated no benefit with the addition of ezetimibe to simvastatin (<i>P</i><sub>int</sub> =0.034).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In IMPROVE-IT, the benefit of adding ezetimibe to statin was enhanced in patients with DM and in high-risk patients without DM.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Fault-tolerant detection of a quantum error
<p>A critical component of any quantum error–correcting scheme is detection of errors by using an ancilla system. However, errors occurring in the ancilla can propagate onto the logical qubit, irreversibly corrupting the encoded information. We demonstrate a fault-tolerant error-detection scheme that suppresses spreading of ancilla errors by a factor of 5, while maintaining the assignment fidelity. The same method is used to prevent propagation of ancilla excitations, increasing the logical qubit dephasing time by an order of magnitude. Our approach is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hardwar</span></strong>e-efficient, as it uses a single multilevel transmon ancilla and a cavity-encoded logical qubit, whose interaction is engineered in situ by using an off-resonant sideband drive. The results demonstrate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hardwar</span></strong>e-efficient approaches that exploit system-specific error models can yield advances toward fault-tolerant quantum computation.</p>

Reconfigurable system for automated optimization of diverse chemical reactions
<p>Chemical synthesis generally requires labor-intensive, sometimes tedious trial-and-error optimization of reaction conditions. Here, we describe a plug-and-play, continuous-flow chemical synthesis system that mitigates this challenge with an integrated combination of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hardwar</span></strong>e, software, and analytics. The system software controls the user-selected reagents and unit operations (reactors and separators), processes reaction analytics (high-performance liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, vibrational spectroscopy), and conducts automated optimizations. The capabilities of this system are demonstrated in high-yielding implementations of C-C and C-N cross-coupling, olefination, reductive amination, nucleophilic aromatic substitution (S<sub>N</sub>Ar), photoredox catalysis, and a multistep sequence. The graphical user interface enables users to initiate optimizations, monitor progress remotely, and analyze results. Subsequent users of an optimized procedure need only download an electronic file, comparable to a smartphone application, to implement the protocol on their own apparatus.</p>

Neurotechnology to address big questions
<p>Emotions, cognition, and consciousness emerge with the processing of neuronal information provided by memory readouts and senses. How this actually works seemed for a long time to be a question too big to ask. Advances in neuroscience have always been driven by methodological inventions, and current efforts to develop neurotechnologies are motivated by experimental strategies, including analytical dissection (that is, inverse engineering), large-scale interrogation, and synthetic reconstruction of the mammalian cerebral cortex (which is important for higher cognitive functions) and connected brain structures (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). As part of this neurotechnological endeavor, mapping the transcriptome of neurons with single-cell resolution and with known three-dimensional tissue localization has been a long-sought enabling technology (<i>3</i>). On page 380 of this issue, Wang <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) present the technology and workflow to access transcriptional states of more than 100 genes from up to 30,000 cells in a cubic millimeter of cortical tissue. This advanced methodology will facilitate studies that improve our understanding of the neuronal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hardwar</span></strong>e and, when combined with other emerging neurotechnologies, will enable big questions in neuroscience to be addressed.</p>

Phase transitions in a programmable quantum spin glass simulator
<p>Understanding magnetic phases in quantum mechanical systems is one of the essential goals in condensed matter physics, and the advent of prototype quantum simulation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hardwar</span></strong>e has provided new tools for experimentally probing such systems. We report on the experimental realization of a quantum simulation of interacting Ising spins on three-dimensional cubic lattices up to dimensions 8 × 8 × 8 on a D-Wave processor (D-Wave Systems, Burnaby, Canada). The ability to control and read out the state of individual spins provides direct access to several order parameters, which we used to determine the lattice’s magnetic phases as well as critical disorder and one of its universal exponents. By tuning the degree of disorder and effective transverse magnetic field, we observed phase transitions between a paramagnetic, an antiferromagnetic, and a spin-glass phase.</p>

Mid-term follow-up of patients with hindfoot arthrodesis with retrograde compression intramedullary nail in Charcot neuroarthropathy of the hindfoot
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Hindfoot arthrodesis with retrograde intramedullary nailing has   been described as a surgical strategy to reconstruct deformities   of the ankle and hindfoot in patients with Charcot arthropathy.   This study presents case series of Charcot arthropathy patients   treated with two different retrograde intramedullary straight compression   nails in order to reconstruct the hindfoot and assess the results   over a mid-term follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We performed a retrospective analysis of 18 consecutive patients   and 19 operated feet with Charcot arthropathy who underwent a hindfoot   arthrodesis using a retrograde intramedullary compression nail.   Patients were ten men and eight women with a mean age of 63.43 years   (38.5 to 79.8). We report the rate of limb salvage, complications requiring   additional surgery, and fusion rate in both groups. The mean duration   of follow-up was 46.36 months (37 to 70).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The limb salvage rate was 16 of 19 limbs. Three patients had   to undergo below-knee amputation due to persistent infection followed   by osteomyelitis resistant to parenteral antibiotic therapy and   repeated debridement. Complications including infection, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hardwar</span></strong>e   removal, nonunion, and persistent ulcers requiring further intervention were   also observed. Postoperative functional scores revealed significant   improvement compared with preoperative scores on American Orthopaedic   Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) – Hindfoot scale, Foot Function Index   (FFI), visual analogue scale (VAS), and Foot and Ankle Outcome Score   (FAOS).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The use of retrograde intramedullary compression nail results   in good rates of limb salvage when used for hindfoot reconstruction   in patients with Charcot arthropathy.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:190–6.</p></sec>

Cardiac Implantable Electronic Device Interrogation at Forensic Autopsy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Postmortem interrogations of cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs), recommended at autopsy in suspected cases of sudden cardiac death, are rarely performed, and data on systematic postmortem CIED analysis in the forensic pathology are missing. The aim of the study was to determine whether nonselective postmortem CIED interrogations and data analysis are useful to the forensic pathologist to determine the cause, mechanism, and time of death and to detect potential CIED-related safety issues.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>From February 2012 to April 2017, all autopsy subjects in the department of forensic medicine at the University Hospital Charité who had a CIED underwent device removal and interrogation. Over the study period, 5368 autopsies were performed. One hundred fifty subjects had in total 151 CIEDs, including 109 pacemakers, 35 defibrillators, and 7 implantable loop recorders.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In 40 cases (26.7%) time of death and in 51 cases (34.0%) cause of death could not be determined by forensic autopsy. Of these, CIED interrogation facilitated the determination of time of death in 70.0% of the cases and clarified the cause of death in 60.8%. Device concerns were identified in 9 cases (6.0%), including 3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hardwar</span></strong>e, 4 programming, and 2 algorithm issues. One CIED was submitted to the manufacturer for a detailed technical analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our data demonstrate the necessity of systematic postmortem CIED interrogation in forensic medicine to determine the cause and timing of death more accurately. In addition, CIED analysis is an important tool to detect potential CIED-related safety issues.</p></sec>

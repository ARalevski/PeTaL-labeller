Double-heterojunction nanorod light-responsive LEDs for display applications
<p>Dual-functioning displays, which can simultaneously transmit and receive information and energy through visible light, would enable enhanced user interfaces and device-to-device interactivity. We demonstrate that double <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heterojunct</span></strong>ions designed into colloidal semiconductor nanorods allow both efficient photocurrent generation through a photovoltaic response and electroluminescence within a single device. These dual-functioning, all-solution-processed double-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heterojunct</span></strong>ion nanorod light-responsive light-emitting diodes open feasible routes to a variety of advanced applications, from touchless interactive screens to energy harvesting and scavenging displays and massively parallel display-to-display data communication.</p>

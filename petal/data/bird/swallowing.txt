Aberrant choice behavior in alcoholism
<p>More than 2 billion people worldwide regularly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drink</span></strong> alcohol. Alcohol is a component cause of more than 200 diseases and causes ∼3.3 million d<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eat</span></strong>hs per year globally (<i>1</i>). The major disease burden comes from harmful alcohol consumption and alcohol dependence. Not everyone who regularly consumes alcohol becomes dependent: ∼15% become engaged in harmful and compulsive alcohol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drink</span></strong>ing (<i>2</i>). Patients suffering from alcohol dependence no longer have the freedom to choose between alternative rewards because alcohol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drink</span></strong>ing dictates what should be done next, namely, shaping activities for the next <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drink</span></strong>. On page 1321 of this issue, Augier <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) demonstrate that aberrant choice behavior—that is, choosing alcohol over an alternative reward—is a key driver for the transition from controlled to compulsive alcohol use. They also provide a mechanistic understanding of this aberrant choice behavior that could lead to new tr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eat</span></strong>ment opportunities.</p>

Rapid binge-like eating and body weight gain driven by zona incerta GABA neuron activation
<p>The neuronal substrate for binge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eat</span></strong>ing, which can at times lead to obesity, is not clear. We find that optogenetic stimulation of mouse zona incerta (ZI) γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons or their axonal projections to paraventricular thalamus (PVT) excitatory neurons immediately (in 2 to 3 seconds) evoked binge-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eat</span></strong>ing. Minimal intermittent stimulation led to body weight gain; ZI GABA neuron ablation reduced weight. ZI stimulation generated 35% of normal 24-hour food intake in just 10 minutes. The ZI cells were excited by food deprivation and the gut hunger signal ghrelin. In contrast, stimulation of excitatory axons from the parasubthalamic nucleus to PVT or direct stimulation of PVT glutamate neurons reduced food intake. These data suggest an unexpected robust orexigenic potential for the ZI GABA neurons.</p>

A SWELL Channel Indeed
<p>Water constitutes about two-thirds of the mass of most living organisms. It serves as a solvent in the cell cytoplasm and exterior, and like other molecules, it moves down its concentration gradient by osmosis. Indeed, the diffusion of water is responsible for the dilemma in <i>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</i>, Samuel Taylor Coleridge's epic poem: “Water, water, everywhere, Nor any drop to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drink</span></strong>.” If the mariner were to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drink</span></strong> seawater, with its high concentration of dissolved salts, the water in his cells would diffuse out (down its concentration gradient), dehydrating the cells and killing the seafarer. Two recent studies, by Qiu <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) and by Voss <i>et al.</i> on page 634 in this issue (<i>2</i>), advance our understanding of how animal cells deal with such osmotic challenges.</p>

Measuring gill paracellular permeability with polyethylene glycol-4000 in freely swimming trout: proof of principle
<p>The influence of swimming activity on gill paracellular permeability has not been measured previously in fishes. We critically assessed the use of tritium-labeled polyethylene glycol ([<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000) for this purpose, a substance that is also a classic marker for extracellular fluid volume, glomerular filtration rate and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drink</span></strong>ing rate. Tests (8 h) on resting freshwater trout showed that when measuring [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance from the plasma in the efflux direction, correction for a large excretion via glomerular filtration was essential, necessitating urinary catheterization. When measuring [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance from the water in the influx direction, correction for a significant uptake by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drink</span></strong>ing was essential, necessitating terminal gut removal, whereas glomerular filtration losses were minimal. After correction for these alternate routes of loss and uptake, [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance rates by efflux from the plasma and by influx from the water were identical, showing that gill paracellular permeability is not rectified, and can be measured in either direction. The influx technique with terminal gut removal was used to assess gill paracellular permeability in trout without urinary catheters freely swimming at 1.2 body lengths s<sup>−1</sup> for 8 h. Branchial [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance rate (by influx from the water) increased significantly by ~80% in accord with a similar measured increase in O<sub>2</sub> consumption rate. Thus in trout, gill paracellular permeability does increase during exercise, in accord with the traditional concept of the osmorespiratory compromise.</p>

Selective control of up-regulated and down-regulated genes by temporal patterns and doses of insulin
<p>Secretion of insulin transiently increases after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eat</span></strong>ing, resulting in a high circulating concentration. Fasting limits insulin secretion, resulting in a low concentration of insulin in the circulation. We analyzed transcriptional responses to different temporal patterns and doses of insulin in the hepatoma FAO cells and identified 13 up-regulated and 16 down-regulated insulin-responsive genes (IRGs). The up-regulated IRGs responded more rapidly than did the down-regulated IRGs to transient stepwise or pulsatile increases in insulin concentration, whereas the down-regulated IRGs were repressed at lower concentrations of insulin than those required to stimulate the up-regulated IRGs. Mathematical modeling of the insulin response as two stages—(i) insulin signaling to transcription and (ii)transcription and mRNA stability—indicated that the first stage was the more rapid stage for the down-regulated IRGs, whereas the second stage of transcription was the more rapid stage for the up-regulated IRGs. A subset of the IRGs that were up-regulated or down-regulated in the FAO cells was similarly regulated in the livers of rats injected with a single dose of insulin. Thus, not only can cells respond to insulin but they can also interpret the intensity and pattern of signal to produce distinct transcriptional responses. These results provide insight that may be useful in tr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eat</span></strong>ing obesity and type 2 diabetes associated with aberrant insulin production or tissue responsiveness.</p>

Cascading impacts of large-carnivore extirpation in an African ecosystem
<p>Populations of the world’s largest carnivores are declining and now occupy mere fractions of their historical ranges. Theory predicts that when apex predators disappear, large herbivores become less fearful, occupy new habitats, and modify those habitats by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eat</span></strong>ing new food plants. Yet experimental support for this prediction has been difficult to obtain in large-mammal systems. After the extirpation of leopards and African wild dogs from Mozambique’s Gorongosa National Park, forest-dwelling antelopes [bushbuck (<i>Tragelaphus sylvaticus</i>)] expanded into treeless floodplains, where they consumed novel diets and suppressed a common food plant [waterwort (<i>Bergia mossambicensis</i>)]. By experimentally simulating predation risk, we demonstrate that this behavior was reversible. Thus, whereas anthropogenic predator extinction disrupted a trophic cascade by enabling rapid differentiation of prey behavior, carnivore restoration may just as rapidly reestablish that cascade.</p>

Plio-Pleistocene decline of African megaherbivores: No evidence for ancient hominin impacts
<p>It has long been proposed that pre-modern hominin impacts drove extinctions and shaped the evolutionary history of Africa’s exceptionally diverse large mammal communities, but this hypothesis has yet to be rigorously tested. We analyzed eastern African herbivore communities spanning the past 7 million years—encompassing the entirety of hominin evolutionary history—to test the hypothesis that top-down impacts of tool-bearing, m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eat</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eat</span></strong>ing hominins contributed to the demise of megaherbivores prior to the emergence of <i>Homo sapiens</i>. We document a steady, long-term decline of megaherbivores beginning ~4.6 million years ago, long before the appearance of hominin species capable of exerting top-down control of large mammal communities and predating evidence for hominin interactions with megaherbivore prey. Expansion of C<sub>4</sub> grasslands can account for the loss of megaherbivore diversity.</p>

Our looming lead problem
<p>On 25 April 2014, Flint Mayor Dayne Walling ceremoniously shut off a valve to the Detroit water supply and opened the flow of the Flint River into local homes and businesses. He marked the occasion by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drink</span></strong>ing from a glass filled with water from the new source. Eighteen months later, the water supply was switched back to Detroit. What occurred in between—the city's failure to control infrastructure corrosion, the deterioration of fresh water entering Flint residences, citizen complaints, government denials, elevated lead levels in children, and public outcry—would become the basis for a crisis that rose to national attention in 2015. <i>What the Eyes Don't See </i>by Mona Hanna-Attisha and <i>The Poisoned City </i>by Anna Clark are the first two books to document in detail this horrible disaster.</p>

Efficient coding explains the universal law of generalization in human perception
<p>Perceptual generalization and discrimination are fundamental cognitive abilities. For example, if a bird <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eat</span></strong>s a poisonous butterfly, it will learn to avoid preying on that species again by generalizing its past experience to new perceptual stimuli. In cognitive science, the “universal law of generalization” seeks to explain this ability and states that generalization between stimuli will follow an exponential function of their distance in “psychological space.” Here, I challenge existing theoretical explanations for the universal law and offer an alternative account based on the principle of efficient coding. I show that the universal law emerges inevitably from any information processing system (whether biological or artificial) that minimizes the cost of perceptual error subject to constraints on the ability to process or transmit information.</p>

RNA localization feeds translation
<p>The digestive tract has to cope with the challenge of functioning efficiently despite irregular cycles of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eat</span></strong>ing and fasting. Digestion and absorption of nutrients require large quantities of proteins, mainly enzymes and transporters (<i>1</i>). Although these proteins must be available in the epithelial cells that line the stomach and intestines within minutes upon feeding, their continuous production would impose high upkeep costs on the fasting organism. On page 1299 of this issue, Moor <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) identify a mechanism that may account for the responsiveness of the digestive system: The monolayer of enterocytes (which form the intestinal epithelium) controls protein expression at the level of translation, through regulated RNA localization.</p>

Neurons that drive and quench thirst

Indeed, the maintenance of adequate hydration is a prerequisite for life and, accordingly, the desire to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drink</span></strong> emerges as soon as the body's water content declines by 1 to 2%, and this feeling intensifies progressively with further depletion (<i>1</i>–<i>3</i>). Although regions in the brain that are critical for water intake have been known for more than 60 years, the identification and functional analysis of thirst-related neurons only became possible with the recent advent of genetically targeted photoactivation and photometry, methods that respectively allow manipulation and monitoring of electrical activity in vivo, using fiber-optic microprobes (<i>4</i>–<i>7</i>). On page 1149 of this issue, Allen <i>et al.</i> (<i>8</i>) reveal the existence of neurons that specifically encode the intensity and aversive quality of thirst within the median preoptic nucleus (MnPO) of the hypothalamus.</p>

Nobel honors discoveries in how cells eat themselves
<p>As the stench of the streets during a garbage strike quickly drives home, sanitation workers are the unsung heroes of modern cities and towns.

By performing "autophagy"—literally, self-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eat</span></strong>ing—they degrade or recycle toxic protein aggregates and cell components. This week, the cell biologist who worked out the genetics and mechanics of this process received the 2016 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. When Yoshinori Ohsumi, now at the Tokyo Institute of Technology's Frontier Research Center, did his pioneering work in yeast in the early 1990s, his results drew little attention outside cell biology. But in the past 15 years, others have shown that cells' clean-up machinery is crucial to human health.</p>

Experimental analysis of the liquid-feeding mechanism of the butterfly <i>Pieris rapae</i>
<p>The butterfly <i>Pieirs rapae</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drink</span></strong>s liquid using a long proboscis. A high pressure gradient is induced in the proboscis when cibarial pump muscles contract. However, liquid feeding through the long proboscis poses a disadvantage of high flow resistance. Hence, butterflies may possess special f<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eat</span></strong>ures to compensate for this disadvantage and succeed in foraging. The main objective of this study is to analyze the liquid-feeding mechanism of butterflies. The systaltic motion of the cibarial pump organ was visualized using the synchrotron X-ray imaging technique. In addition, an ellipsoidal pump model was established based on synchrotron X-ray micro-computed tomography. To determine the relationship between the cyclic variation of the pump volume and the liquid-feeding flow, velocity fields of the intake flow at the tip of the proboscis were measured using micro-particle image velocimetry. Reynolds and Womersley numbers of liquid-feeding flow in the proboscis were ~1.40 and 0.129, respectively. The liquid-feeding flow could be characterized as a quasi-steady state laminar flow. Considering these results, we analyzed the dimensions of the feeding apparatus on the basis of minimum energy consumption during the liquid-feeding process. The relationship between the proboscis and the cibarial pump was determined when minimum energy consumption occurs. As a result, the volume of the cibarial pump is proportional to the cube of the radius of the proboscis. It seems that the liquid-feeding system of butterflies and other long-proboscid insects follow the cube relationship. The present results provide insights into the feeding strategies of liquid-feeding butterflies.</p>

The Role of Efferocytosis in Atherosclerosis
<p>The necrotic core has long been a hallmark of the vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque. Although apoptotic cells are cleared quickly in almost all other tissue beds, their removal appears to be significantly impaired in the diseased blood vessel. Emerging evidence indicates that this phenomenon is caused by a defect in efferocytosis, the process by which apoptotic tissue is recognized for engulfment by phagocytic cells such as macrophages. Genetic and experimental data suggest that efferocytosis is impaired during atherogenesis caused by dysregulation of so-called <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eat</span></strong> me ligands, which govern the edibility of cells undergoing programmed cell d<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eat</span></strong>h. The following is a summary of recent data indicating that efferocytosis is a major unappreciated driver of lesion expansion but also a reversible defect that can potentially be targeted as a means to prevent plaque progression.</p>

Left Ventricular Dysfunction Switches Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Toward an Inflammatory Phenotype and Impairs Their Reparative Properties Via Toll-Like Receptor-4
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Little is known about the potentially unfavorable effects of mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) activation on the heart. MSCs can respond to tissue injury by anti- or proinflammatory activation. We aimed to study the potential negative interaction between left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) and MSC activation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We isolated MSCs from cardiac and subcutaneous fat tissues of mice with LVD 28 days after myocardial infarction or sham operation. To evaluate the effect of LVD on MSCs, we characterized cardiac MSCs and subcutaneous MSCs in vitro. Subsequently, we injected MSCs or saline into the infarcted myocardium of mice and evaluated LV remodeling and function 28 days after myocardial infarction. To test the hypothesis that toll-like receptor 4 (<i>TLR4</i>) mediates proinflammatory polarization of MSCs, we characterized cardiac MSCs from <i>TLR4</i><sup>-/-</sup> and wild-type (WT) mice after inflammatory stimulation in vitro. Next, we transplanted cardiac MSCs from <i>TLR4</i><sup>-/-</sup> and WT male mice into the infarcted myocardium of female WT mice and evaluated infarct size, MSC retention, inflammation, remodeling, and function after 7 days.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>LVD switched cardiac MSCs toward an inflammatory phenotype, with increased secretion of inflammatory cytokines as well as chemokines. The effect of LVD on subcutaneous MSCs was less remarkable. Although transplantation of cardiac MSCs and subcutaneous MSCs from LVD and sham hearts did not improve LV remodeling and function, cardiac MSCs from LVD exacerbated anterior wall thinning 28 days after myocardial infarction. The inflammatory polarization of cardiac MSCs by LVD was mediated by <i>TLR4</i>, as we found less secretion of inflammatory cytokines and higher secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines from activated cardiac MSCs of <i>TLR4</i>-deficient mice, compared with WT cardiac MSCs. Significantly, <i>TLR4</i> deficiency preserved the expression of CD47 (don’t <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eat</span></strong> me signal) on cardiac MSCs after both <i>TLR4</i> stimulation in vitro and transplantation into the infarcted heart.

Long-term infusion of aldosterone in mice resulted in elevation of plasma interleukin-1β levels and vascular abnormalities. Mice lacking the IL-1R or the inflammasome components NLRP3 and caspase-1 were protected from aldosterone-induced vascular damage. In vitro, aldosterone stimulated NLRP3-dependent interleukin-1β secretion by bone marrow–derived macrophages by activating nuclear factor-κB signaling and reactive oxygen species generation. Moreover, chimeric mice reconstituted with NLRP3-deficient hematopoietic cells showed that NLRP3 in immune cells mediates aldosterone-induced vascular damage. In addition, aldosterone increased the expression of NLRP3, active caspase-1, and mature interleukin-1β in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Hypertensive patients with hyperaldosteronism or normal levels of aldosterone exhibited increased activity of NLRP3 inflammasome, suggesting that the effect of hyperaldosteronism on the inflammasome may be mediated through high blood pressure.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Together, these data demonstrate that NLRP3 inflammasome, through activation of IL-1R, is critically involved in the deleterious vascular effects of aldosterone, placing NLRP3 as a potential target for therapeutic interventions in conditions with high aldosterone levels.</p></sec>

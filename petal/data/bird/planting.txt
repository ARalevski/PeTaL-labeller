<i>pheno</i>Seeder - A Robot System for Automated Handling and Phenotyping of Individual Seeds
<p>The enormous diversity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> traits is an intriguing feature and critical for the overwhelming success of higher plants. In particular, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> mass is generally regarded to be key for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>ling development but is mostly approximated by using scanning methods delivering only two-dimensional data, often termed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> size. However, three-dimensional traits, such as the volume or mass of single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s, are very rarely determined in routine measurements. Here, we introduce a device named <i>pheno</i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>er, which enables the handling and phenotyping of individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s of very different sizes. The system consists of a pick-and-place robot and a modular setup of sensors that can be versatilely extended. Basic biometric traits detected for individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s are two-dimensional data from projections, three-dimensional data from volumetric measures, and mass, from which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> density is also calculated. Each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> is tracked by an identifier and, after phenotyping, can be planted, sorted, or individually stored for further evaluation or processing (e.g. in routine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>-to-plant tracking pipelines). By investigating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), rape<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> (<i>Brassica napus</i>), and barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), we observed that, even for apparently round-shaped <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s of rape<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>, correlations between the projected area and the mass of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s were much weaker than between volume and mass. This indicates that simple projections may not deliver good proxies for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> mass. Although throughput is limited, we expect that automated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> phenotyping on a single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> basis can contribute valuable information for applications in a wide range of wild or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> species, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> classification, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> sorting, and assessment of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> quality.</p>

Root Tip Shape Governs Root Elongation Rate under Increased Soil Strength
<p>Increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> strength due to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> compaction or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> drying is a major limitation to root growth and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> productivity. Roots need to exert higher penetration force, resulting in increased penetration stress when elongating in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s of greater strength. This study aimed to quantify how the genotypic diversity of root tip geometry and root diameter influences root elongation under different levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> strength and to determine the extent to which roots adjust to increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> strength. Fourteen wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) varieties were grown in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> columns packed to three bulk densities representing low, moderate, and high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> strength. Under moderate and high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> strength, smaller root tip radius-to-length ratio was correlated with higher genotypic root elongation rate, whereas root diameter was not related to genotypic root elongation. Based on cavity expansion theory, it was found that smaller root tip radius-to-length ratio reduced penetration stress, thus enabling higher root elongation rates in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s with greater strength. Furthermore, it was observed that roots could only partially adjust to increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> strength. Root thickening was bounded by a maximum diameter, and root tips did not become more acute in response to increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> strength. The obtained results demonstrated that root tip geometry is a pivotal trait governing root penetration stress and root elongation rate in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s of greater strength. Hence, root tip shape needs to be taken into account when selecting for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> varieties that may tolerate high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> strength.</p>

Arabidopsis <i>LORELEI</i>, a Maternally Expressed Imprinted Gene, Promotes Early Seed Development
<p>In flowering plants, the female gametophyte controls pollen tube reception immediately before <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization and regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> development immediately after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization, although the controlling mechanisms remain poorly understood. Previously, we showed that <i>LORELEI</i> (<i>LRE</i>), which encodes a putative glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane protein, is critical for pollen tube reception by the female gametophyte before <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization and the initiation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> development after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization. Here, we show that <i>LRE</i> is expressed in the synergid, egg, and central cells of the female gametophyte and in the zygote and proliferating endosperm of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>. Interestingly, <i>LRE</i> expression in the developing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s was primarily from the matrigenic <i>LRE</i> allele, indicating that <i>LRE</i> expression is imprinted. However, <i>LRE</i> was biallelically expressed in 8-d-old <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>lings, indicating that the patrigenic allele does not remain silenced throughout the sporophytic generation. Regulation of imprinted <i>LRE</i> expression is likely novel, as <i>LRE</i> was not expressed in pollen or pollen tubes of mutants defective for MET1, DDM1, RNA-dependent DNA methylation, or MSI-dependent histone methylation. Additionally, the patrigenic <i>LRE</i> allele inherited from these mutants was not expressed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s. Surprisingly, and contrary to the predictions of the parental conflict hypothesis, LRE promotes growth in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s, as loss of the matrigenic but not the patrigenic <i>LRE</i> allele caused delayed initiation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> development. Our results showed that <i>LRE</i> is a rare imprinted gene that functions immediately after double <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization and supported the model that a passage through the female gametophyte establishes monoalleleic expression of <i>LRE</i> in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s and controls early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> development.</p>

A Maternally Deposited Endosperm Cuticle Contributes to the Physiological Defects of <i>transparent testa</i> Seeds
<p>Mature dry <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s are highly resilient plant structures where the encapsulated embryo is kept protected and dormant to facilitate its ultimate dispersion. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> viability is heavily dependent on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat’s capacity to shield living tissues from mechanical and oxidative stress. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat, also called the testa, arises after the differentiation of maternal ovular integuments during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> development. We recently described a thick cuticle tightly embedded in the mature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>’s endosperm cell wall. We show here that it is produced by the maternal inner integument 1 layer and, remarkably, transferred to the developing endosperm. Arabidopsis <i>transparent testa</i> (<i>tt</i>) mutations cause maternally derived <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat pigmentation defects. <i>TT</i> gene products encode proteins involved in flavonoid metabolism and regulators of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat development. <i>tt</i> mutants have abnormally high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat permeability, resulting in lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> viability and dormancy. However, the biochemical basis of this high permeability is not fully understood. We show that the cuticles of developing <i>tt</i> mutant integuments have profound structural defects, which are associated with enhanced cuticle permeability. Genetic analysis indicates that a functional proanthocyanidin synthesis pathway is required to limit cuticle permeability, and our results suggest that proanthocyanidins could be intrinsic components of the cuticle. Together, these results show that the formation of a maternal cuticle is an intrinsic part of the normal integumental differentiation program leading to testa formation and is essential for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>’s physiological properties.</p>

Repression of CYSTATHIONINE <i>γ</i>-SYNTHASE in Seeds Recruits the <i>S</i>-Methylmethionine Cycle
<p><i>S</i>-Methylmethionine (SMM) was suggested previously to participate in the metabolism of methionine (Met) in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s. To further reveal its roles, we had previously produced transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) RNA interference (RNAi) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s with lower transcript expression of CYSTATHIONINE γ-SYNTHASE (<i>AtCGS</i>), Met’s main regulatory enzyme. Unexpectedly, these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s accumulated significantly higher levels of Met compared with control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s through an as yet unknown mechanism. Here, transcript and metabolic analyses coupled with isotope-labeled [<sup>13</sup>C]SMM and [<sup>13</sup>C]Met feeding experiments enabled us to reveal that SMM that was synthesized in rosette leaves of RNAi plants significantly contributed to the accumulation of Met in their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s at late stages of development. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>-specific repression of <i>AtCGS</i> in RNAi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s triggered the induction of genes operating in the SMM cycle of rosette leaves, leading to elevated transport of SMM toward the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s, where higher reconversion rates of SMM to Met were detected. The metabolic rearrangements in RNAi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s resulted in an altered sulfur-associated metabolism, such as lower amounts of Cys and glutathione, as well as a differential composition of glucosinolates. Together, the data propose a novel cross talk existing between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s and rosette leaves along with mutual effects between the Asp family and SMM pathways operating in these tissues. They also shed light on the effects of higher Met levels on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> physiology and behavior.</p>

Spatial and Temporal Mapping of Key Lipid Species in <i>Brassica napus</i> Seeds
<p>The regulation of lipid synthesis in oil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s is still not fully understood. Oil<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> rape (<i>Brassica napus</i>) is the third most productive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>able oil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> on the global market; therefore, increasing our understanding of lipid accumulation in oil<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> rape <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s is of great economic, as well as intellectual, importance. Matrix-assisted laser/desorption ionization-mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) is a technique that allows the mapping of metabolites directly onto intact biological tissues, giving a spatial context to metabolism. We have used MALDI-MSI to study the spatial distribution of two major lipid species, triacylglycerols and phosphatidylcholines. A dramatic, heterogenous landscape of molecular species was revealed, demonstrating significantly different lipid compositions between the various tissue types within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>. The embryonic axis was found to be particularly enriched in palmitic acid, while the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat/aleurone layer accumulated vaccenic, linoleic, and α-linoleic acids. Furthermore, the lipid composition of the inner and outer cotyledons differed from each other, a remarkable discovery given the supposed identical functionality of these two tissues. Triacylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine molecular species distribution was analyzed through a developmental time series covering early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> lipid accumulation to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> maturity. The spatial patterning of lipid molecular species did not vary significantly during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> development. Data gathered using MALDI-MSI was verified through gas chromatography analysis of dissected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s. The distinct lipid distribution profiles observed imply differential regulation of lipid metabolism between the different tissue types of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>. Further understanding of this differential regulation will enhance efforts to improve oil<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> rape productivity and quality.</p>

Selection for a Zinc-Finger Protein Contributes to Seed Oil Increase during Soybean Domestication
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> oil is a momentous agronomical trait of soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) targeted by domestication in breeding. Although multiple oil-related genes have been uncovered, knowledge of the regulatory mechanism of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> oil biosynthesis is currently limited. We demonstrate that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>-preferred gene <i>GmZF351</i>, encoding a tandem CCCH zinc finger protein, is selected during domestication. Further analysis shows that <i>GmZF351</i> facilitates oil accumulation by directly activating <i>WRINKLED1</i>, <i>BIOTIN CARBOXYL CARRIER PROTEIN2</i>, <i>3-KETOACYL-ACYL CARRIER PROTEIN SYNTHASE III</i>, <i>DIACYLGLYCEROL O-ACYLTRANSFERASE1</i>, and <i>OLEOSIN2</i> in transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s. Overexpression of <i>GmZF351</i> in transgenic soybean also activates lipid biosynthesis genes, thereby accelerating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> oil accumulation. The <i>ZF351</i> haplotype from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cultiv</span></strong>ated soybean group and the wild soybean (<i>Glycine soja</i>) subgroup III correlates well with high gene expression level, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> oil contents and promoter activity, suggesting that selection of <i>GmZF351</i> expression leads to increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> oil content in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cultiv</span></strong>ated soybean. Our study provides novel insights into the regulatory mechanism for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> oil accumulation, and the manipulation of <i>GmZF351</i> may have great potential in the improvement of oil production in soybean and other related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong>s.</p>

The Major Origin of Seedless Grapes Is Associated with a Missense Mutation in the MADS-Box Gene <i>VviAGL11</i>
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>lessness is greatly prized by consumers of fresh grapes. While stenospermocarpic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> abortion determined by the <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> DEVELOPMENT INHIBITOR</i> (<i>SDI</i>) locus is the usual source of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>lessness in commercial grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cultiv</span></strong>ars, the underlying <i>sdi</i> mutation remains unknown. Here, we undertook an integrative approach to identify the causal mutation. Quantitative genetics and fine-mapping in two ‘Crimson <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>less’-derived F1 mapping populations confirmed the major effect of the <i>SDI</i> locus and delimited the <i>sdi</i> mutation to a 323-kb region on chromosome 18. RNA-sequencing comparing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> traces of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>less and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>ed F1 individuals identified processes triggered during <i>sdi</i>-determined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> abortion, including the activation of salicylic acid-dependent autoimmunity. The RNA-sequencing data set was investigated for candidate genes, and while no evidence for causal cis-acting regulatory mutations was detected, deleterious nucleotide changes in coding sequences of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>less haplotype were predicted in two genes within the <i>sdi</i> fine-mapping interval. Targeted resequencing of the two genes in a collection of 124 grapevine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cultiv</span></strong>ars showed that only the point variation causing the arginine-197-to-leucine substitution in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> morphogenesis regulator gene <i>AGAMOUS-LIKE11</i> (<i>VviAGL11</i>) was fully linked with stenospermocarpy. The concurrent postzygotic variation identified for this missense polymorphism and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>lessness phenotype in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>ed somatic variants of the original stenospermocarpic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cultiv</span></strong>ar supports a causal effect. We postulate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> abortion caused by this amino acid substitution in VviAGL11 is the major cause of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>lessness in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cultiv</span></strong>ated grapevine. This information can be exploited to boost <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>less grape breeding.</p>

Metal Tolerance Protein 8 Mediates Manganese Homeostasis and Iron Reallocation during Seed Development and Germination
<p>Metal accumulation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s is a prerequisite for germination and establishment of plants but also for micronutrient delivery to humans. To investigate metal transport processes and their interactions in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s, we focused on METAL TOLERANCE PROTEIN8 (MTP8), a tonoplast transporter of the manganese (Mn) subclade of cation diffusion facilitators, which in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) is expressed in embryos of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s. The x-ray fluorescence imaging showed that expression of MTP8 was responsible for Mn localization in subepidermal cells on the abaxial side of the cotyledons and in cortical cells of the hypocotyl. Accordingly, under low Mn availability, MTP8 increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> stores of Mn, required for efficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> germination. In mutant embryos lacking expression of <i>VACUOLAR IRON TRANSPORTER1</i> (<i>VIT1</i>), MTP8 built up iron (Fe) hotspots in <i>MTP8</i>-expressing cells types, suggesting that MTP8 transports Fe in addition to Mn. In <i>mtp8 vit1</i> double mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s, Mn and Fe were distributed in all cell types of the embryo. An Fe transport function of MTP8 was confirmed by its ability to complement Fe hypersensitivity of a yeast mutant defective in vacuolar Fe transport. Imbibing <i>mtp8-1</i> mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s in the presence of Mn or subjecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s to wet-dry cycles showed that MTP8 conferred Mn tolerance. During germination, MTP8 promoted reallocation of Fe from the vasculature. These results indicate that cell type-specific accumulation of Mn and Fe in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s depends on MTP8 and that this transporter plays an important role in the generation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> metal stores as well as for metal homeostasis and germination efficiency under challenging environmental conditions.</p>

A Specialized Diacylglycerol Acyltransferase Contributes to the Extreme Medium-Chain Fatty Acid Content of <i>Cuphea</i> Seed Oil
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> oils of many <i>Cuphea</i> sp. contain >90% of medium-chain fatty acids, such as decanoic acid (10:0). These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> oils, which are among the most compositionally variant in the plant kingdom, arise from specialized fatty acid biosynthetic enzymes and specialized acyltransferases. These include lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferases (LPAT) and diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGAT) that are required for successive acylation of medium-chain fatty acids in the <i>sn</i>-2 and <i>sn</i>-3 positions of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> triacylglycerols (TAGs). Here we report the identification of a cDNA for a DGAT1-type enzyme, designated CpuDGAT1, from the transcriptome of <i>C. avigera</i> var <i>pulcherrima</i> developing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s. Microsomes of camelina (<i>Camelina sativa</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s engineered for CpuDGAT1 expression displayed DGAT activity with 10:0-CoA and the diacylglycerol didecanoyl, that was approximately 4-fold higher than that in camelina <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> microsomes lacking CpuDGAT1. In addition, coexpression in camelina <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s of CpuDGAT1 with a <i>C. viscosissima</i> FatB thioesterase (CvFatB1) that generates 10:0 resulted in TAGs with nearly 15 mol % of 10:0. More strikingly, expression of CpuDGAT1 and CvFatB1 with the previously described CvLPAT2, a 10:0-CoA-specific <i>Cuphea</i> LPAT, increased 10:0 amounts to 25 mol % in camelina <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> TAG. These TAGs contained up to 40 mol % 10:0 in the <i>sn</i>-2 position, nearly double the amounts obtained from coexpression of CvFatB1 and CvLPAT2 alone. Although enriched in diacylglycerol, 10:0 was not detected in phosphatidylcholine in these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s. These findings are consistent with channeling of 10:0 into TAG through the combined activities of specialized LPAT and DGAT activities and demonstrate the biotechnological use of these enzymes to generate 10:0-rich <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> oils.</p>

Awake1, an ABC-Type Transporter, Reveals an Essential Role for Suberin in the Control of Seed Dormancy
<p>The mother plant plays an important dynamic role in the control of dormancy of her progeny <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> in response to environmental signals. In order to further understand the mechanisms by which this dormancy control takes place in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), we conducted a forward genetic screen to isolate mutants that fail to enter dormancy in response to variation in temperature during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> set. We show that, for the first of these mutants, designated <i>awake1</i>, the maternal allele is required for entry into strongly dormant states and that <i>awake1</i> mutants show <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> phenotypes shown previously to be associated with the loss of suberin in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>. We identify <i>awake1</i> as an allele of <i>ABCG20</i>, an ATP-binding cassette transporter-encoding gene required for the transport of fatty acids during suberin deposition, and show that further suberin-deficient mutants have <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> dormancy defects. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat suberin composition is affected by temperature during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> maturation, but this response appears to be independent of ABCG20. We conclude that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat suberin is essential for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> dormancy imposition by low temperature and that the exclusion of oxygen and water from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> by the suberin and tannin layers is important for dormancy imposition.</p>

MYB89 Transcription Factor Represses Seed Oil Accumulation
<p>In many higher plants, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> oil accumulation is precisely controlled by intricate multilevel regulatory networks, among which transcriptional regulation mainly influences oil biosynthesis. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the master positive transcription factors, <i>WRINKLED1</i> (<i>WRI1</i>) and <i>LEAFY COTYLEDON1-LIKE</i> (<i>L1L</i>), are important for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> oil accumulation. We found that an R2R3-MYB transcription factor, MYB89, was expressed predominantly in developing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s during maturation. Oil and major fatty acid biosynthesis in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s was significantly promoted by <i>myb89-1</i> mutation and <i>MYB89</i> knockdown; thus, MYB89 was an important repressor during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> oil accumulation. RNA sequencing revealed remarkable up-regulation of numerous genes involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> oil accumulation in <i>myb89</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s at 12 d after pollination. Posttranslational activation of a MYB89-glucocorticoid receptor fusion protein and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that MYB89 inhibited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> oil accumulation by directly repressing <i>WRI1</i> and five key genes and by indirectly suppressing <i>L1L</i> and 11 key genes involved in oil biosynthesis during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> maturation. These results help us to understand the novel function of MYB89 and provide new insights into the regulatory network of transcriptional factors controlling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> oil accumulation in Arabidopsis.</p>

Temperate tree species show identical response in tree water deficit but different sensitivities in sap flow to summer soil drying
<p>Temperate forests are expected to be particularly vulnerable to drought and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> drying because they are not adapted to such conditions and perform best in mesic environments. Here we ask (i) how sensitively four common temperate tree species (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i>, <i>Picea abies</i>, <i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i> and <i>Fraxinus excelsior</i>) respond in their water relations to summer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> drying and seek to determine (ii) if species-specific responses to summer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> drying are related to the onset of declining water status across the four species. Throughout 2012 and 2013 we determined tree water deficit (TWD) as a proxy for tree water status from recorded stem radius changes and monitored sap flow rates with sensors on 16 mature trees studied in the field at Lageren, Switzerland. All tree species responded equally in their relative maximum TWD to the onset of declining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> moisture. This implies that the water supply of all tree species was affected by declining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> moisture and that none of the four species was able to fully maintain its water status, e.g., by access to alternative water sources in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>. In contrast we found strong and highly species-specific responses of sap flow to declining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> moisture with the strongest decline in <i>P. abies</i> (92%), followed by <i>F. sylvatica</i> (53%) and <i>A. pseudoplatanus</i> (48%). <i>F. excelsior</i> did not significantly reduce sap flow. We hypothesize the species-specific responses in sap flow to declining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> moisture that occur despite a simultaneous increase in relative TWD in all species reflect how fast these species approach critical levels of their water status, which is most likely influenced by species-specific traits determining the hydraulic properties of the species tree.</p>

The whole-soil carbon flux in response to warming
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> organic carbon harbors three times as much carbon as Earth’s atmosphere, and its decomposition is a potentially large climate change feedback and major source of uncertainty in climate projections. The response of whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> profiles to warming has not been tested in situ. In a deep warming experiment in mineral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>, we found that CO<sub>2</sub> production from all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> depths increased with 4°C warming; annual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> respiration increased by 34 to 37%. All depths responded to warming with similar temperature sensitivities, driven by decomposition of decadal-aged carbon. Whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> warming reveals a larger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> respiration response than many in situ experiments (most of which only warm the surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>) and models.</p>

<i>MYB52</i> Negatively Regulates Pectin Demethylesterification in Seed Coat Mucilage
<p>Pectin, which is a major component of the plant primary cell walls, is synthesized and methyl-esterified in the Golgi apparatus and then demethylesterified by pectin methylesterases (PMEs) located in the cell wall. The degree of methylesterification affects the functional properties of pectin, and thereby influences plant growth, development and defense. However, little is known about the mechanisms that regulate pectin demethylesterification. Here, we show that in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat mucilage, the absence of the <i>MYB52</i> transcription factor is correlated with an increase in PME activity and a decrease in the degree of pectin methylesterification. Decreased methylesterification in the <i>myb52</i> mutant is also correlated with an increase in the calcium content of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> mucilage. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis and molecular genetic studies suggest that <i>MYB52</i> transcriptionally activates <i>PECTIN METHYLESTERASE INHIBITOR6</i> (<i>PMEI6</i>), <i>PMEI14</i>, and <i>SUBTILISIN-LIKE SER PROTEASE1.7</i> (<i>SBT1.7</i>) by binding to their promoters. <i>PMEI6</i> and <i>SBT1.7</i> have previously been shown to be involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat mucilage demethylesterification. Our characterization of two <i>PMEI14</i> mutants suggests that PMEI14 has a role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat mucilage demethylesterification, although its activity may be confined to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat in contrast to PMEI6, which functions in the whole <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>. Our demonstration that <i>MYB52</i> negatively regulates pectin demethylesterification in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat mucilage, and the identification of components of the molecular network involved, provides new insight into the regulatory mechanism controlling pectin demethylesterification and increases our understanding of the transcriptional regulation network involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat mucilage formation.</p>

Improving Plant Nitrogen Use Efficiency through Alteration of Amino Acid Transport Processes
<p>Improving the efficiency of nitrogen (N) uptake and utilization in plants could potentially increase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> yields while reducing N <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization and, subsequently, environmental pollution. Within most plants, N is transported primarily as amino acids. In this study, pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) plants overexpressing <i>AMINO ACID PERMEASE1</i> (<i>AAP1</i>) were used to determine if and how genetic manipulation of amino acid transport from source to sink affects plant N use efficiency. The modified plants were grown under low, moderate, or high N <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization regimes. The results showed that, independent of the N nutrition, the engineered plants allocate more N via the vasculature to the shoot and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s and produce more biomass and higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> yields than wild-type plants. Dependent on the amount of N supplied, the <i>AAP1</i>-overexpressing plants displayed improved N uptake or utilization efficiency, or a combination of the two. They also showed significantly increased N use efficiency in N-deficient as well as in N-rich <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s and, impressively, required half the amount of N to produce as many fruits and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s as control plants. Together, these data support that engineering N allocation from source to sink presents an effective strategy to produce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> plants with improved productivity as well as N use efficiency in a range of N environments.</p>

KNOX Protein OSH15 Induces Grain Shattering by Repressing Lignin Biosynthesis Genes
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> shattering is an agronomically important trait. Two major domestication factors are responsible for this: qSH1 and SH5. Whereas qSH1 functions in cell differentiation in the abscission zone (AZ), a major role of SH5 is the repression of lignin deposition. We have determined that a KNOX protein, OSH15, also controls <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> shattering. Knockdown mutations of <i>OSH15</i> showed reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>-shattering phenotypes. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that OSH15 interacts with SH5 and qSH1, two proteins in the BELL homeobox family. In transgenic plants carrying the <i>OSH15</i> promoter-<i>GUS</i> reporter construct, the reporter gene was preferentially expressed in the AZ during young spikelet development. The RNA in situ hybridization experiment also showed that <i>OSH15</i> messenger RNAs were abundant in the AZ during spikelet development. Analyses of <i>osh15 SH5-</i>D double mutants showed that <i>SH5</i> could not increase the degree of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> shattering when <i>OSH15</i> was absent, indicating that SH5 functions together with OSH15. In addition to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>-shattering phenotype, <i>osh15</i> mutants displayed dwarfism and accumulated a higher amount of lignin in internodes due to increased expression of the genes involved in lignin biosynthesis. Knockout mutations of <i>CAD2</i>, which encodes an enzyme for the last step in the monolignol biosynthesis pathway, caused an easy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>-shattering phenotype by reducing lignin deposition in the AZ. This indicated that the lignin level is an important determinant of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> shattering in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that both OSH15 and SH5 interact directly with <i>CAD2</i> chromatin. We conclude that OSH15 and SH5 form a dimer that enhances <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> shattering by directly inhibiting lignin biosynthesis genes.</p>

Ecophysiological variables influencing Aleppo pine seed and cone production: a review
<p>The most interesting factors associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> and cone production of Aleppo pine were largely reviewed to identify broad patterns and potential effectiveness of reforestation efforts and planning. Aleppo pine cone production and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> yields are relatively variable, with differences between spatial and temporal influences. These differences are considered, mainly between (i) year, (ii) stand characteristics and (iii) individual tree measurements. Annual variability among populations was recorded for cone production per tree, based on influencing factors such as genetic characteristics, wetness, nutrient availability, insect pests and disease. In addition, some factors may affect Aleppo pine tree growth directly but may be affecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> and cone production indirectly. Therefore, reduced stand density results in less competition among Aleppo pine trees and accompanying understory flora, which subsequently increases the stem diameter and other tree dimensions, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> production. This review suggests that reforestation planning, particularly thinning, will result in improved tree morphology that will increase Aleppo pine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> and cone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong>s. Wildfire intensity and stand conditions such as light and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> nutrient status are also examined.</p>

Differential radial growth patterns between beech (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i> L.) and oak (<i>Quercus robur</i> L.) on periodically waterlogged soils
<p>Climate scenarios for northern Central Europe project rising temperatures and increasing frequency and intensity of droughts but also a shift in precipitation pattern with more humid winters. This in turn may result in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> waterlogging during the following spring, leading to increasing stress for trees growing on hydric sites. The influence of waterlogging on growth of common beech and pedunculate oak has been studied intensively on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>lings under experimental conditions. However, the question remains whether results of these studies can be transferred to mature trees growing under natural conditions. To test this, we investigated general growth patterns and climate–growth relationships in four mature stands of beech and oak growing on hydromorphic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s (Stagnosols) in northeast Germany using dendrochronological methods. Our results confirmed the expected tolerance of oak to strong water-level fluctuations. Neither extremely wet conditions during spring nor summer droughts significantly affected its radial growth. Oak growth responded positively to warmer temperatures during previous year October and March of the current year of ring formation. Contrary to our expectations, also beech showed relatively low sensitivity to periods of high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> water saturation. Instead, summer drought turned out to be the main climatic factor influencing ring width of beech even under the specific periodically wet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> conditions of our study. This became evident from general climate–growth correlations over the last century as well as from discontinuous (pointer year) analysis with summer drought being significantly correlated to the occurrence of growth depressions. As ring width of the two species is affected by differing climate parameters, species-specific chronologies show no coherence in high-frequency variations even for trees growing in close proximity. We assume differences in rooting depth as the main reason for the differing growth patterns and climate correlations of the two species under study. Our results indicate that under the projected future climate scenarios, beech may suffer from increasing drought stress even on hydromorphic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s. Oak might be able to maintain a sufficient hydraulic status during summer droughts by reaching water in deeper <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> strata with its root system. Wet phases with waterlogged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> conditions during spring or summer appear to have only a little direct influence on radial growth of both species.</p>

A global atlas of the dominant bacteria found in soil

<i>ESA1</i> Is Involved in Embryo Sac Abortion in Interspecific Hybrid Progeny of Rice
<p>The emergence of sterile individuals in the hybrid backcross progeny of wild and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cultiv</span></strong>ated rice limits the use of wild rice alleles for improving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cultiv</span></strong>ated rice, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this sterility remain unclear. Here, we identified the semisterile introgression line YIL42, derived from a cross between the <i>indica</i> rice variety Teqing (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) and <i>Oryza rufipogon</i> accession YJCWR (Yuanjiang common wild rice), which exhibits semisterility. Using positional cloning, we isolated <i>EMBRYO SAC ABORTION 1</i> (<i>ESA1</i>), which encodes a nuclear-membrane localized protein containing an armadillo repeat domain. A mutation in <i>ESA1</i> at position 1819 (<sup>T</sup>1819<sup>C</sup>) converts a stop codon into an Arg (R) codon, causing delayed termination of protein translation. Analysis of transgenic lines indicated that the difference in ESA1 protein structure between <i>O. rufipogon</i>–derived <i>ESA1</i> and Teqing-derived <i>esa1</i> affects female gamete abortion during early mitosis. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ity investigation and expression analysis indicated that the interaction between <i>ESA1</i><sup>T1819</sup> and unknown gene(s) of Teqing affects spikelet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ity of the hybrid backcross progeny. The <i>ESA1</i><sup>T1819</sup> allele is present in <i>O. rufipogon</i> but absent in <i>O. sativa</i>, suggesting that variation in <i>ESA1</i> may be associated with interspecific hybrid incompatibility between wild and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cultiv</span></strong>ated rice. Our findings provide insight into the molecular mechanism underlying female sterility, which is useful for improving the panicle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> setting rate of rice and for developing a strategy to overcome interspecific hybrid sterility between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cultiv</span></strong>ated rice and wild rice.</p>

ABC Transporter-Mediated Transport of Glutathione Conjugates Enhances Seed Yield and Quality in Chickpea
<p>The identification of functionally relevant molecular tags is vital for genomics-assisted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> improvement and enhancement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> yield, quality, and productivity in chickpea (<i>Cicer arietinum</i>). The simultaneous improvement of yield/productivity as well as quality traits often requires pyramiding of multiple genes, which remains a major hurdle given various associated epistatic and pleotropic effects. Unfortunately, no single gene that can improve yield/productivity along with quality and other desirable agromorphological traits is known, hampering the genetic enhancement of chickpea. Using a combinatorial genomics-assisted breeding and functional genomics strategy, this study identified natural alleles and haplotypes of an <i>ABCC3</i>-type transporter gene that regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> weight, an important domestication trait, by transcriptional regulation and modulation of the transport of glutathione conjugates in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s of <i>desi</i> and <i>kabuli</i> chickpea.

Gene Regulatory Networks for the Haploid-to-Diploid Transition of <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>
<p>The sexual cycle of the unicellular <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> culminates in the formation of diploid zygotes that differentiate into dormant spores that eventually undergo meiosis. Mating between gametes induces rapid cell wall shedding via the enzyme g-lysin; cell fusion is followed by heterodimerization of sex-specific homeobox transcription factors, GSM1 and GSP1, and initiation of zygote-specific gene expression. To investigate the genetic underpinnings of the zygote developmental pathway, we performed comparative transcriptome analysis of both pre- and post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization samples. We identified 253 transcripts specifically enriched in early zygotes, 82% of which were not up-regulated in <i>gsp1</i> null zygotes. We also found that the GSM1/GSP1 heterodimer negatively regulates the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative wall program at the posttranscriptional level, enabling prompt transition from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative wall to zygotic wall assembly. Annotation of the g-lysin-induced and early zygote genes reveals distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative and zygotic wall programs, supported by concerted up-regulation of genes encoding cell wall-modifying enzymes and proteins involved in nucleotide-sugar metabolism. The haploid-to-diploid transition in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> is masterfully controlled by the GSM1/GSP1 heterodimer, translating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization and gamete coalescence into a bona fide differentiation program. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization-triggered integration of genes required to make related, but structurally and functionally distinct organelles—the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative versus zygote cell wall—presents a likely scenario for the evolution of complex developmental gene regulatory networks.</p>

Two Acyltransferases Contribute Differently to Linolenic Acid Levels in Seed Oil
<p>Acyltransferases are key contributors to triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis and, thus, are of great importance for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> oil quality. The effects of increased or decreased expression of <i>ACYL-COENZYME A:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1</i> (<i>DGAT1</i>) or <i>PHOSPHOLIPID:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE</i> (<i>PDAT</i>) on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> lipid composition were assessed in several <i>Camelina sativa</i> lines. Furthermore, in vitro assays of acyltransferases in microsomal fractions prepared from developing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s of some of these lines were performed. Decreased expression of <i>DGAT1</i> led to an increased percentage of 18:3<i>n</i>-3 without any change in total lipid content of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>. The tri-18:3 TAG increase occurred predominantly in the cotyledon, as determined with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry, whereas species with two 18:3<i>n</i>-3 acyl groups were elevated in both cotyledon and embryonal axis. <i>PDAT</i> overexpression led to a relative increase of 18:2<i>n</i>-6 at the expense of 18:3<i>n</i>-3, also without affecting the total lipid content. Differential distributions of TAG species also were observed in different parts of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>. The microsomal assays revealed that <i>C.</i> <i>sativa</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s have very high activity of diacylglycerol-phosphatidylcholine interconversion. The combination of analytical and biochemical data suggests that the higher 18:2<i>n</i>-6 content in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> oil of the <i>PDAT</i> overexpressors is due to the channeling of fatty acids from phosphatidylcholine into TAG before being desaturated to 18:3<i>n</i>-3, caused by the high activity of PDAT in general and by PDAT specificity for 18:2<i>n</i>-6. The higher levels of 18:3<i>n</i>-3 in <i>DGAT1</i>-silencing lines are likely due to the compensatory activity of a TAG-synthesizing enzyme with specificity for this acyl group and more desaturation of acyl groups occurring on phosphatidylcholine.</p>

The MYB107 Transcription Factor Positively Regulates Suberin Biosynthesis
<p>Suberin, a lipophilic polymer deposited in the outer integument of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat, represents an essential sealing component controlling water and solute movement and protecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> from pathogenic infection. Although many genes responsible for suberin synthesis are identified, the regulatory components controlling its biosynthesis have not been definitively determined. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis MYB107 transcription factor acts as a positive regulator controlling suberin biosynthetic gene expression in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat. <i>MYB107</i> coexpresses with suberin biosynthetic genes in a temporal manner during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> development. Disrupting <i>MYB107</i> particularly suppresses the expression of genes involved in suberin but not cutin biosynthesis, lowers <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat suberin accumulation, alters suberin lamellar structure, and consequently renders higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat permeability and susceptibility to abiotic stresses. Furthermore, MYB107 directly binds to the promoters of suberin biosynthetic genes, verifying its primary role in regulating their expression. Identifying MYB107 as a positive regulator for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat suberin synthesis offers a basis for discovering the potential transcriptional network behind one of the most abundant lipid-based polymers in nature.</p>

Network-Guided GWAS Improves Identification of Genes Affecting Free Amino Acids
<p>Amino acids are essential for proper growth and development in plants. Amino acids serve as building blocks for proteins but also are important for responses to stress and the biosynthesis of numerous essential compounds. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>, the pool of free amino acids (FAAs) also contributes to alternative energy, desiccation, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> vigor; thus, manipulating FAA levels can significantly impact a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>’s nutritional qualities. While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on branched-chain amino acids have identified some regulatory genes controlling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> FAAs, the genetic regulation of FAA levels, composition, and homeostasis in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s remains mostly unresolved. Hence, we performed GWAS on 18 FAAs from a 313-ecotype Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) association panel. Specifically, GWAS was performed on 98 traits derived from known amino acid metabolic pathways (approach 1) and then on 92 traits generated from an unbiased correlation-based metabolic network analysis (approach 2), and the results were compared. The latter approach facilitated the discovery of additional novel metabolic interactions and single-nucleotide polymorphism-trait associations not identified by the former approach. The most prominent network-guided GWAS signal was for a histidine (His)-related trait in a region containing two genes: a cationic amino acid transporter (CAT4) and a polynucleotide phosphorylase resistant to inhibition with fosmidomycin. A reverse genetics approach confirmed CAT4 to be responsible for the natural variation of His-related traits across the association panel. Given that His is a semiessential amino acid and a potent metal chelator, CAT4 orthologs could be considered as candidate genes for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> quality biofortification in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> plants.</p>

Long-term pattern and magnitude of soil carbon feedback to the climate system in a warming world

Plant-soil feedback and the maintenance of diversity in Mediterranean-climate shrublands
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> biota influence plant performance through plant-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> feedback, but it is unclear whether the strength of such feedback depends on plant traits and whether plant-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> feedback drives local plant diversity. We grew 16 co-occurring plant species with contrasting nutrient-acquisition strategies from hyperdiverse Australian shrublands and exposed them to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> biota from under their own or other plant species. Plant responses to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> biota varied according to their nutrient-acquisition strategy, including positive feedback for ectomycorrhizal plants and negative feedback for nitrogen-fixing and nonmycorrhizal plants.

Tri-Hydroxy-Triacylglycerol Is Efficiently Produced by Position-Specific Castor Acyltransferases
<p>Understanding the biochemistry of triacylglycerol (TAG) assembly is critical in tailoring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> oils to produce high-value products. Hydroxy-fatty acid (HFA) is one such valuable modified fatty acid, which can be produced at low levels in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> through transgenic expression of the castor (<i>Ricinus communis</i>) hydroxylase. The resulting plants have low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> oil content and poor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>ling establishment, indicating that Arabidopsis lacks efficient metabolic networks for biosynthesis and catabolism of hydroxy-containing TAG. To improve utilization of such substrates, we expressed three castor acyltransferase enzymes that incorporate HFA at each stereochemical position during TAG synthesis. This produced abundant tri-HFA TAG and concentrated 44% of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> HFA moieties into this one TAG species. Ricinoleic acid was more abundant than any other fatty acid in these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s, which had 3-fold more HFA by weight than that in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s following simple hydroxylase expression, the highest yet measured in a nonnative plant. Efficient utilization of hydroxy-containing lipid substrates increased the rate of TAG synthesis 2-fold, leading to complete relief of the low-oil phenotype. Partition of HFA into specific TAG molecules increased the storage lipid available for mobilization during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>ling development, resulting in a 1.9-fold increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>ling establishment. Expression of a complete acyltransferase pathway to efficiently process HFA establishes a benchmark in the quest to successfully produce modified oils in plants.</p>

Retrotransposon Insertion and DNA Methylation Regulate Aluminum Tolerance in European Barley Accessions
<p>Aluminum (Al) toxicity is a major stress factor limiting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> productivity in acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>. Although there is great genotypic variation in tolerance to Al toxicity, the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we report that, in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), the fourth largest cereal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> produced in the world, both retrotransposon insertion and DNA methylation are involved in regulating differential Al tolerance. <i>HvAACT1</i> is a major gene responsible for citrate secretion from the roots for external detoxification of Al. A multiretrotransposon-like (MRL) sequence insertion at least 15.3 kb in length was detected in the upstream genomic region of <i>HvAACT1</i> that displayed promoter activity and significantly enhanced <i>HvAACT1</i> expression, especially in the root tips of Al-tolerant accessions. Furthermore, in a number of accessions with low levels of <i>HvAACT1</i> expression, this MRL insertion was present but highly methylated. Geographical analysis showed that accessions with this MRL insertion are distributed mainly in European areas with acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s. Two wild barley accessions were found to possess this MRL insertion, but with a high degree of methylation. These results indicate that the MRL insertion and its degree of DNA methylation influence <i>HvAACT1</i> expression and that demethylation of this MRL insertion, which facilitates adaptation to acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s, occurred following barley domestication. Moreover, our results indicate that barley accessions in East Asia and Europe have developed independent but equivalent strategies to withstand Al toxicity in acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s.</p>

Development Defects of Hydroxy-Fatty Acid-Accumulating Seeds Are Reduced by Castor Acyltransferases
<p>Researchers have long endeavored to produce modified fatty acids in easily managed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> plants where they are not natively found. An important step toward this goal has been the biosynthesis of these valuable products in model oil<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s. The successful production of such fatty acids has revealed barriers to the broad application of this technology, including low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> oil and low proportion of the introduced fatty acid and reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> vigor. Here, we analyze the impact of producing hydroxy-fatty acids on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>ling development. We show that germinating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s of a hydroxy-fatty acid-accumulating Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) line produce chlorotic cotyledons and suffer reduced photosynthetic capacity. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>lings retain hydroxy-fatty acids in polar lipids, including chloroplast lipids, and exhibit decreased fatty acid synthesis. Triacylglycerol mobilization in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>ling development also is reduced, especially for lipids that include hydroxy-fatty acid moieties. These developmental defects are ameliorated by increased flux of hydroxy-fatty acids into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> triacylglycerol created through the expression of either castor (<i>Ricinus communis</i>) acyltransferase enzyme ACYL-COA:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE2 or PHOSPHOLIPID:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1A. Such expression increases both the level of total stored triacylglycerol and the rate at which it is mobilized, fueling fatty acid synthesis and restoring photosynthetic capacity. Our results suggest that further improvements in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>ling development may require the specific mobilization of triacylglycerol-containing hydroxy-fatty acids. Understanding the defects in early development caused by the accumulation of modified fatty acids and providing mechanisms to circumvent these defects are vital steps in the development of tailored oil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong>s.</p>

SEIPIN Proteins Mediate Lipid Droplet Biogenesis to Promote Pollen Transmission and Reduce Seed Dormancy
<p>Lipid droplets (LDs) are ubiquitous organelles in plant cells, but their physiological roles are largely unknown. To gain insight into the function of LDs in plants, we have characterized the Arabidopsis homologs of SEIPIN proteins, which are crucial factors for LD biogenesis in yeast and animals. <i>SEIPIN1</i> is expressed almost exclusively in embryos, while <i>SEIPIN2</i> and <i>SEIPIN3</i> have broader expression profiles with maximal levels in embryos and pollen, where LDs accumulate most abundantly. Genetic analysis demonstrates that all three <i>SEIPINs</i> contribute to proper LD biogenesis in embryos, whereas in pollen, only <i>SEIPIN2</i> and <i>SEIPIN3</i> play a significant role. The double <i>seipin2 seipin3</i> and triple <i>seipin</i> mutants accumulate extremely enlarged LDs in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s and pollen, which hinders their subsequent mobilization during germination. Interestingly, electron microscopy analysis reveals the presence of nuclear LDs attached to type I nucleoplasmic reticulum in triple <i>seipin</i> mutant embryos, supporting that SEIPINs are essential for maintaining the correct polarity of LD budding at the nuclear envelope, restricting it to the outer membrane. In pollen, the perturbations in LD biogenesis and turnover are coupled to reduced germination in vitro and with lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization efficiency in vivo. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s, germination per se is not affected in <i>seipin2 seipin3</i> and triple <i>seipin</i> mutants, but there is a striking increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> dormancy levels. Our findings reveal the relevance of SEIPIN-dependent LD biogenesis in pollen transmission and in adjusting the timing of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> germination, two key adaptive traits of great importance in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">agricultur</span></strong>e.</p>

The Ly6/uPAR protein Bouncer is necessary and sufficient for species-specific fertilization
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization is fundamental for sexual reproduction, yet its molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. We found that an oocyte-expressed Ly6/uPAR protein, which we call Bouncer, is a crucial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization factor in zebrafish. Membrane-bound Bouncer mediates sperm-egg binding and is thus essential for sperm entry into the egg. Remarkably, Bouncer not only is required for sperm-egg interaction but is also sufficient to allow cross-species <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization between zebrafish and medaka, two fish species that diverged more than 200 million years ago. Our study thus identifies Bouncer as a key determinant of species-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization in fish. Bouncer’s closest homolog in tetrapods, SPACA4, is restricted to the male germline in internally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>izing vertebrates, which suggests that our findings in fish have relevance to human biology.</p>

Feedback regulation of COOLAIR expression controls seed dormancy and flowering time
<p>Plants integrate seasonal signals, including temperature and day length, to optimize the timing of developmental transitions. Seasonal sensing requires the activity of two proteins, FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), that control certain developmental transitions in plants. During reproductive development, the mother plant uses FLC and FT to modulate progeny <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> dormancy in response to temperature. We found that for regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> dormancy, <i>FLC</i> and <i>FT</i> function in opposite configuration to how those same genes control time to flowering. For <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> dormancy, FT regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> dormancy through <i>FLC</i> gene expression and regulates chromatin state by activating antisense <i>FLC</i> transcription. Thus, in <i>Arabidopsis</i> the same genes controlled in opposite format regulate flowering time and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> dormancy in response to the temperature changes that characterize seasons.</p>

Country-specific effects of neonicotinoid pesticides on honey bees and wild bees

We use large field experiments to assess the effects of neonicotinoid-treated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong>s on three bee species across three countries (Hungary, Germany, and the United Kingdom). Winter-sown oil<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> rape was grown commercially with either <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coatings containing neonicotinoids (clothianidin or thiamethoxam) or no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> treatment (control). For honey bees, we found both negative (Hungary and United Kingdom) and positive (Germany) effects during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> flowering. In Hungary, negative effects on honey bees (associated with clothianidin) persisted over winter and resulted in smaller colonies in the following spring (24% declines). In wild bees (<i>Bombus terrestris</i> and <i>Osmia bicornis</i>), reproduction was negatively correlated with neonicotinoid residues. These findings point to neonicotinoids causing a reduced capacity of bee species to establish new populations in the year following exposure.</p>

Plant-soil feedbacks and mycorrhizal type influence temperate forest population dynamics
<p>Feedback with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> biota is an important determinant of terrestrial plant diversity. However, the factors regulating plant-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> feedback, which varies from positive to negative among plant species, remain uncertain. In a large-scale study involving 55 species and 550 populations of North American trees, the type of mycorrhizal association explained much of the variation in plant-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> feedbacks. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> collected beneath conspecifics, arbuscular mycorrhizal trees experienced negative feedback, whereas ectomycorrhizal trees displayed positive feedback. Additionally, arbuscular mycorrhizal trees exhibited strong conspecific inhibition at multiple spatial scales, whereas ectomycorrhizal trees exhibited conspecific facilitation locally and less severe conspecific inhibition regionally. These results suggest that mycorrhizal type, through effects on plant-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> feedbacks, could be an important contributor to population regulation and community structure in temperate forests.</p>

Radiocarbon constraints imply reduced carbon uptake by soils during the 21st century
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> is the largest terrestrial carbon reservoir and may influence the sign and magnitude of carbon cycle–climate feedbacks. Many Earth system models (ESMs) estimate a significant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> carbon sink by 2100, yet the underlying carbon dynamics determining this response have not been systematically tested against observations. We used <sup>14</sup>C data from 157 globally distributed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> profiles sampled to 1-meter depth to show that ESMs underestimated the mean age of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> carbon by a factor of more than six (430 ± 50 years versus 3100 ± 1800 years). Consequently, ESMs overestimated the carbon sequestration potential of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s by a factor of nearly two (40 ± 27%). These inconsistencies suggest that ESMs must better represent carbon stabilization processes and the turnover time of slow and passive reservoirs when simulating future atmospheric carbon dioxide dynamics.</p>

Enhancer-Promoter Interaction of <i>SELF PRUNING 5G</i> Shapes Photoperiod Adaptation
<p>Tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) is a major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>able fruit grown and consumed worldwide. Modern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cultiv</span></strong>ated tomatoes are derived from their wild relative, <i>Solanum pimpinellifolium</i>, a short-day plant that originated from the Andean region of South America. The molecular underpinnings of the regional adaptation and expansion of domesticated tomato remain largely unclear. In this study, we examined flowering time in wild and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cultiv</span></strong>ated tomatoes under both long-day and short-day conditions. Using quantitative trait locus mapping in a recombinant inbred line population, we identified <i>SELF PRUNING 5G</i> (<i>SP5G</i>) as a major locus influencing daylength adaptation in tomato. Genetic diversity analysis revealed that the genomic region harboring <i>SP5G</i> shows signatures of a domestication sweep. We found that a 52-bp sequence within the 3′ untranslated region of <i>SP5G</i> is essential for the enhanced expression of this gene, leading to delayed flowering time in tomatoes through a promoter-enhancer interaction that occurs only under long-day conditions. We further demonstrate that the absence of the 52-bp sequence attenuates the promoter-enhancer interaction and reduces <i>SP5G</i> expression in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cultiv</span></strong>ated tomatoes, making their flowering time insensitive to daylength. Our findings demonstrate that cis-regulatory variation at the enhancer region of the <i>SP5G</i> 3′ untranslated region confers reduced photoperiodic response in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cultiv</span></strong>ated tomatoes, uncovering a regulatory mechanism that could potentially be used to manipulate flowering time in tomato through novel biotechnological approaches.</p>

Root Engineering in Barley: Increasing Cytokinin Degradation Produces a Larger Root System, Mineral Enrichment in the Shoot and Improved Drought Tolerance
<p>Root size and architecture are important <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> plant traits, as they determine access to water and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> nutrients. The plant hormone cytokinin is a negative regulator of root growth and branching. Here, we generated transgenic barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) plants with an enlarged root system by enhancing cytokinin degradation in roots to explore the potential of cytokinin modulations in improving root functions. This was achieved through root-specific expression of a <i>CYTOKININ OXIDASE/DEHYDROGENASE</i> gene. Enhanced biomass allocation to roots did not penalize shoot growth or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> yield, indicating that these plants were not source limited. In leaves of transgenic lines, the concentrations of several macroelements and microelements were increased, particularly those with low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> mobility (phosphorus, manganese, and zinc). Importantly, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s contained up to 44% more zinc, which is beneficial for human nutrition. Transgenic lines also demonstrated dampened stress responses to long-term drought conditions, indicating lower drought sensitivity. Taken together, this work demonstrates that root engineering of cereals is a promising strategy to improve nutrient efficiency, biofortification, and drought tolerance.</p>

Most notably, the fatty acyl chain-dependent differential localization of phospholipids and triacylglycerols was observed within the embryo and radicle, showing correlation with the heterogeneous distribution of fatty acids. Other interesting observations include unusual localization of ceramides on the endosperm/scutellum boundary and subcellular localization of ferulate in the aleurone.</p>

SDG2-Mediated H3K4me3 Is Crucial for Chromatin Condensation and Mitotic Division during Male Gametogenesis in Arabidopsis
<p>Epigenetic reprogramming occurring during reproduction is crucial for both animal and plant development. Histone H3 Lys 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) is an evolutionarily conserved epigenetic mark of transcriptional active euchromatin. While much has been learned in somatic cells, H3K4me3 deposition and function in gametophyte is poorly studied. Here, we demonstrate that SET DOMAIN GROUP2 (SDG2)-mediated H3K4me3 deposition participates in epigenetic reprogramming during Arabidopsis male gametogenesis. We show that loss of SDG2 barely affects meiosis and cell fate establishment of haploid cells. However, we found that SDG2 is critical for postmeiotic microspore development. Mitotic cell division progression is partly impaired in the loss-of-function <i>sdg2-1</i> mutant, particularly at the second mitosis setting up the two sperm cells. We demonstrate that SDG2 is involved in promoting chromatin decondensation in the pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative nucleus, likely through its role in H3K4me3 deposition, which prevents ectopic heterochromatic H3K9me2 speckle formation. Moreover, we found that derepression of the LTR retrotransposon <i>ATLANTYS1</i> is compromised in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative cell of the <i>sdg2-1</i> mutant pollen. Consistent with chromatin condensation and compromised transcription activity, pollen germination and pollen tube elongation, representing the key function of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative cell in transporting sperm cells during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization, are inhibited in the <i>sdg2-1</i> mutant.

5′ to 3′ mRNA Decay Contributes to the Regulation of Arabidopsis Seed Germination by Dormancy

To understand whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> germination relies on the degradation of specific subsets of mRNA, we investigated whether the 5′ to 3′ RNA decay machinery participated in the regulation of this process. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s of <i>exoribonuclease4</i> (<i>xrn4</i>) and <i>varicose</i> (<i>vcs</i>) mutants displayed distinct dormancy phenotypes. Transcriptome analysis <i>of xrn4-5</i> and <i>vcs-8</i> mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s allowed us to identify genes that are likely to play a role in the control of germination. Study of 5′ untranslated region features of these transcripts revealed that specific motifs, secondary energy, and GC content could play a role in their degradation by XRN4 and VCS, and Gene Ontology clustering revealed novel actors of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> dormancy and germination. Several specific transcripts identified as being putative targets of XRN4 and VCS in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s (<i>PECTIN LYASE-LIKE</i>, <i>ASPARTYL PROTEASE</i>, <i>DWD-HYPERSENSITIVE-TO-ABA3</i>, and <i>YELLOW STRIPE-LIKE5</i>) were further studied by reverse genetics, and their functional roles in the germination process were confirmed by mutant analysis. These findings suggest that completion of germination and its regulation by dormancy also depend on the degradation of specific subsets of mRNA.</p>

Correlations between Circadian Rhythms and Growth in Challenging Environments
<p>In plants, the circadian system controls a plethora of processes, many with agronomic importance, such as photosynthesis, photoprotection, stomatal opening, and photoperiodic development, as well as molecular processes, such as gene expression. It has been suggested that modifying circadian rhythms may be a means to manipulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong>s to develop improved plants for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">agricultur</span></strong>e. However, there is very little information on how the clock influences the performance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> plants. We used a noninvasive, high-throughput technique, based on prompt chlorophyll fluorescence, to measure circadian rhythms and demonstrated that the technique works in a range of plants. Using fluorescence, we analyzed circadian rhythms in populations of wild barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i> ssp. <i>spontaneum</i>) from widely different ecogeographical locations in the Southern Levant part of the Fertile Crescent, an area with a high proportion of the total genetic variation of wild barley. Our results show that there is variability for circadian traits in the wild barley lines. We observed that circadian period lengths were correlated with temperature and aspect at the sites of origin of the plants, while the amplitudes of the rhythms were correlated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> composition. Thus, different environmental parameters may exert selection on circadian rhythms.</p>

Identification and Characterization of Arabidopsis Seed Coat Mucilage Proteins
<p>Plant cell wall proteins are important regulators of cell wall architecture and function. However, because cell wall proteins are difficult to extract and analyze, they are generally poorly understood. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of proteins integral to the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat mucilage, a specialized layer of the extracellular matrix composed of plant cell wall carbohydrates that is used as a model for cell wall research. The proteins identified in mucilage include those previously identified by genetic analysis, and several mucilage proteins are reduced in mucilage-deficient mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s, suggesting that these proteins are genuinely associated with the mucilage. Arabidopsis mucilage has both nonadherent and adherent layers. Both layers have similar protein profiles except for proteins involved in lipid metabolism, which are present exclusively in the adherent mucilage. The most abundant mucilage proteins include a family of proteins named TESTA ABUNDANT1 (TBA1) to TBA3; a less abundant fourth homolog was named TBA-LIKE (TBAL). <i>TBA</i> and <i>TBAL</i> transcripts and promoter activities were detected in developing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coats, and their expression requires <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat differentiation regulators. TBA proteins are secreted to the mucilage pocket during differentiation. Although reverse genetics failed to identify a function for TBAs/TBAL, the <i>TBA</i> promoters are highly expressed and cell type specific and so should be very useful tools for targeting proteins to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat epidermis. Altogether, these results highlight the mucilage proteome as a model for cell walls in general, as it shares similarities with other cell wall proteomes while also containing mucilage-specific features.</p>

Gibberellin Signaling Requires Chromatin Remodeler PICKLE to Promote Vegetative Growth and Phase Transitions
<p>PICKLE (PKL) is an ATP-dependent chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding domain (CHD3) chromatin remodeling enzyme in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Previous studies showed that PKL promotes embryonic-to-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative transition by inhibiting expression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>-specific genes during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> germination. The <i>pkl</i> mutants display a low penetrance of the “pickle root” phenotype, with a thick and green primary root that retains embryonic characteristics. The penetrance of this pickle root phenotype in <i>pkl</i> is dramatically increased in gibberellin (GA)-deficient conditions. At adult stages, the <i>pkl</i> mutants are semidwarfs with delayed flowering time, which resemble reduced GA-signaling mutants. These findings suggest that PKL may play a positive role in regulating GA signaling. A recent biochemical analysis further showed that PKL and GA signaling repressors DELLAs antagonistically regulate hypocotyl cell elongation genes by direct protein-protein interaction. To elucidate further the role of PKL in GA signaling and plant development, we studied the genetic interaction between PKL and DELLAs using the hextuple mutant containing <i>pkl</i> and <i>della</i> pentuple (<i>dP</i>) mutations. Here, we show that PKL is required for most of GA-promoted developmental processes, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative growth such as hypocotyl, leaf, and inflorescence stem elongation, and phase transitions such as juvenile-to-adult leaf and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative-to-reproductive phase. The removal of all DELLA functions (in the <i>dP</i> background) cannot rescue these phenotypes in <i>pkl</i>. RNA-sequencing analysis using the <i>ga1</i> (a GA-deficient mutant), <i>pkl</i>, and the <i>ga1 pkl</i> double mutant further shows that expression of 80% of GA-responsive genes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>lings is PKL dependent, including genes that function in cell elongation, cell division, and phase transitions. These results indicate that the CHD3 chromatin remodeler PKL is required for regulating gene expression during most of GA-regulated developmental processes.</p>

The Transcription Factor ATHB5 Affects GA-Mediated Plasticity in Hypocotyl Cell Growth during Seed Germination
<p>Gibberellic acid (GA)-mediated cell expansion initiates the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>-to-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>ling transition in plants and is repressed by DELLA proteins. Using digital single-cell analysis, we identified a cellular subdomain within the midhypocotyl, whose expansion drives the final step of this developmental transition under optimal conditions. Using network inference, the transcription factor ATHB5 was identified as a genetic factor whose localized expression promotes GA-mediated expansion specifically within these cells. Both this protein and its putative growth-promoting target <i>EXPANSIN3</i> are repressed by DELLA, and coregulated at single-cell resolution during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> germination. The cellular domains of hormone sensitivity were explored within the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) embryo by putting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s under GA-limiting conditions and quantifying cellular growth responses. The middle and upper hypocotyl have a greater requirement for GA to promote cell expansion than the lower embryo axis. Under these conditions, germination was still completed following enhanced growth within the radicle and lower axis. Under GA-limiting conditions, the <i>athb5</i> mutant did not show a phenotype at the level of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> germination, but it did at a cellular level with reduced cell expansion in the hypocotyl relative to the wild type. These data reveal that the spatiotemporal cell expansion events driving this transition are not determinate, and the conditional use of GA-ATHB5-mediated hypocotyl growth under optimal conditions may be used to optionally support rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>ling growth. This study demonstrates that multiple genetic and spatiotemporal cell expansion mechanisms underlie the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>ling transition in Arabidopsis.</p>

Substituted Phthalimide AC94377 Is a Selective Agonist of the Gibberellin Receptor GID1
<p>Gibberellin (GA) is a major plant hormone that regulates plant growth and development and is widely used as a plant growth regulator in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">agricultur</span></strong>al production. There is an increasing demand for function-limited GA mimics due to the limitations on the agronomical application of GA to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong>s, including GA’s high cost of producing and its leading to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong>s’ lodging. AC94377, a substituted phthalimide, is a chemical that mimics the growth-regulating activity of GAs in various plants, despite its structural difference. Although AC94377 is widely studied in many weeds and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong>s, its mode of action as a GA mimic is largely unknown. In this study, we confirmed that AC94377 displays GA-like activities in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and demonstrated that AC94377 binds to the Arabidopsis GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF1 (GID1) receptor (AtGID1), forms the AtGID1-AC94377-DELLA complex, and induces the degradation of DELLA protein. Our results also indicated that AC94377 is selective for a specific subtype among three AtGID1s and that the selectivity of AC94377 is attributable to a single residue at the entrance to the hydrophobic pocket of GID1. We conclude that AC94377 is a GID1 agonist with selectivity for a specific subtype of GID1, which could be further developed and used as a function-limited regulator of plant growth in both basic study and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">agricultur</span></strong>e.</p>

Identification of Homogentisate Dioxygenase as a Target for Vitamin E Biofortification in Oilseeds
<p>Soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) is a major plant source of protein and oil and produces important secondary metabolites beneficial for human health. As a tool for gene function discovery and improvement of this important <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong>, a mutant population was generated using fast neutron irradiation. Visual screening of mutagenized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s identified a mutant line, designated MO12, which produced brown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s as opposed to the yellow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s produced by the unmodified Williams 82 parental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cultiv</span></strong>ar. Using forward genetic methods combined with comparative genome hybridization analysis, we were able to establish that deletion of the <i>GmHGO1</i> gene is the genetic basis of the brown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>ed phenotype exhibited by the MO12 mutant line. <i>GmHGO1</i> encodes a homogentisate dioxygenase (HGO), which catalyzes the committed enzymatic step in homogentisate catabolism. This report describes to our knowledge the first functional characterization of a plant <i>HGO</i> gene, defects of which are linked to the human genetic disease alkaptonuria. We show that reduced homogentisate catabolism in a soybean <i>HGO</i> mutant is an effective strategy for enhancing the production of lipid-soluble antioxidants such as vitamin E, as well as tolerance to herbicides that target pathways associated with homogentisate metabolism. Furthermore, this work demonstrates the utility of fast neutron mutagenesis in identifying novel genes that contribute to soybean agronomic traits.</p>

Improving photosynthesis and crop productivity by accelerating recovery from photoprotection
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> leaves in full sunlight dissipate damaging excess absorbed light energy as heat. When sunlit leaves are shaded by clouds or other leaves, this protective dissipation continues for many minutes and reduces photosynthesis. Calculations have shown that this could cost field <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong>s up to 20% of their potential yield. Here, we describe the bioengineering of an accelerated response to natural shading events in <i>Nicotiana</i> (tobacco), resulting in increased leaf carbon dioxide uptake and plant dry matter productivity by about 15% in fluctuating light. Because the photoprotective mechanism that has been altered is common to all flowering plants and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong>s, the findings provide proof of concept for a route to obtaining a sustainable increase in productivity for food <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong>s and a much-needed yield jump.</p>

Single-cell profiling of the developing mouse brain and spinal cord with split-pool barcoding
<p>To facilitate scalable profiling of single cells, we developed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">split</span></strong>-pool ligation-based transcriptome sequencing (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">split</span></strong>-seq), a single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) method that labels the cellular origin of RNA through combinatorial barcoding. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">split</span></strong>-seq is compatible with fixed cells or nuclei, allows efficient sample multiplexing, and requires no customized equipment. We used <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">split</span></strong>-seq to analyze 156,049 single-nucleus transcriptomes from postnatal day 2 and 11 mouse brains and spinal cords. More than 100 cell types were identified, with gene expression patterns corresponding to cellular function, regional specificity, and stage of differentiation. Pseudotime analysis revealed transcriptional programs driving four developmental lineages, providing a snapshot of early postnatal development in the murine central nervous system. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">split</span></strong>-seq provides a path toward comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic analysis of other similarly complex multicellular systems.</p>

PI(4,5)P2 regulates myoblast fusion through Arp2/3 regulator localization at the fusion site
<p>Cell-cell fusion is a regulated process that requires merging of the opposing membranes and underlying cytoskeletons. However, the integration between membrane and cytoskeleton signaling during fusion is not known. Using <i>Drosophila</i>, we demonstrate that the membrane phosphoinositide PI(4,5)P2 is a crucial regulator of F-actin dynamics during myoblast fusion. PI(4,5)P2 is locally enriched and colocalizes spatially and temporally with the F-actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">focus</span></strong> that defines the fusion site. PI(4,5)P2 enrichment depends on receptor engagement but is upstream or parallel to actin remodeling. Regulators of actin branching via Arp2/3 colocalize with PI(4,5)P2 <i>in vivo</i> and bind PI(4,5)P2 <i>in vitro</i>. Manipulation of PI(4,5)P2 availability leads to impaired fusion, with a reduction in the F-actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">focus</span></strong> size and altered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">focus</span></strong> morphology. Mechanistically, the changes in the actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">focus</span></strong> are due to a failure in the enrichment of actin regulators at the fusion site. Moreover, improper localization of these regulators hinders expansion of the fusion interface. Thus, PI(4,5)P2 enrichment at the fusion site encodes spatial and temporal information that regulates fusion progression through the localization of activators of actin polymerization.</p>

Prediction of higher-selectivity catalysts by computer-driven workflow and machine learning
<p>Catalyst design in asymmetric reaction development has traditionally been driven by empiricism, wherein experimentalists attempt to qualitatively recognize structural patterns to improve selectivity. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">machin</span></strong>e learning algorithms and chemoinformatics can potentially accelerate this process by recognizing otherwise inscrutable patterns in large datasets. Herein we report a computationally guided workflow for chiral catalyst selection using chemoinformatics at every stage of development. Robust molecular descriptors that are agnostic to the catalyst scaffold allow for selection of a universal training set on the basis of steric and electronic properties. This set can be used to train <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">machin</span></strong>e learning methods to make highly accurate predictive models over a broad range of selectivity space. Using support vector <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">machin</span></strong>es and deep feed-forward neural networks, we demonstrate accurate predictive modeling in the chiral phosphoric acid–catalyzed thiol addition to <i>N</i>-acylimines.</p>

Our results indicate that text corpora contain recoverable and accurate imprints of our historic biases, whether morally neutral as toward insects or flowers, problematic as toward race or gender, or even simply veridical, reflecting the status quo distribution of gender with respect to careers or first names. Our methods hold promise for identifying and addressing sources of bias in culture, including technology.</p>

A coherent Ising machine for 2000-node optimization problems

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Cytokinin-Auxin Crosstalk in the Gynoecial Primordium Ensures Correct Domain Patterning<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) gynoecium consists of two congenitally fused carpels made up of two lateral valve domains and two medial domains, which retain meristematic properties and later fuse to produce the female reproductive structures vital for fertilization. Polar auxin transport (PAT) is important for setting up distinct apical auxin signaling domains in the early floral meristem remnants allowing for lateral domain identity and outgrowth. Crosstalk between auxin and cytokinin plays an important role in the development of other meristematic tissues, but hormone interaction studies to date have <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">focus</span></strong>ed on more accessible later-stage gynoecia and the spatiotemporal interactions pivotal for patterning of early gynoecium primordia remain unknown. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">focus</span></strong>ing on the earliest stages, we propose a cytokinin-auxin feedback model during early gynoecium patterning and hormone homeostasis. Our results suggest that cytokinin positively regulates auxin signaling in the incipient gynoecial primordium and strengthen the concept that cytokinin regulates auxin homeostasis during gynoecium development. Specifically, medial cytokinin promotes auxin biosynthesis components [<i>YUCCA1</i>/<i>4</i> (<i>YUC1</i>/<i>4</i>)] in, and PINFORMED7 (PIN7)-mediated auxin efflux from, the medial domain. The resulting laterally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">focus</span></strong>ed auxin signaling triggers <i>ARABIDOPSIS HISTIDINE PHOSPHOTRANSFER PROTEIN6</i> (<i>AHP6</i>), which then represses cytokinin signaling in a PAT-dependent feedback. Cytokinin also down-regulates PIN3, promoting auxin accumulation in the apex. The <i>yuc1</i>, <i>yuc4</i>, and <i>ahp6</i> mutants are hypersensitive to exogenous cytokinin and 1-napthylphthalamic acid (NPA), highlighting their role in mediolateral gynoecium patterning. In summary, these mechanisms self-regulate cytokinin and auxin signaling domains, ensuring correct domain specification and gynoecium development.</p>

Contemporary Assessment of Left Ventricular Diastolic Function in Older Adults
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although age-associated changes in left ventricular diastolic function are well recognized, limited data exist characterizing measures of diastolic function in older adults, including both reference ranges reflecting the older adult population and prognostically relevant values for incident heart failure (HF), as well as their associations with circulating biomarkers of HF risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Among 5801 elderly participants in the ARIC study (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities; age range, 67–90 years; mean age, 76±5 years; 42% male; 21% black), we determined the continuous association of diastolic measures (tissue Doppler imaging [TDI] e’, E/e’, and left atrial size) with concomitant N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide and subsequent HF hospitalization or death. We also determined sex-specific 10th and 90th percentile limits for these measures using quantile regression in 401 participants free of prevalent cardiovascular disease and risk factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Each measure of diastolic function was robustly associated with N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide and incident HF or death. ARIC-based reference limits for TDI e’ (4.6 and 5.2 cm/s for septal and lateral TDI e’, respectively) were substantially lower than guideline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong> points (7 and 10 cm/s, respectively), whereas E/e’ and left atrial size demonstrated good agreement with guideline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong> points. TDI e’ was nonlinearly associated with incident HF or death, with inflection points for risk supportive of ARIC-based limits. ARIC-based limits for diastolic function improved risk discrimination over guideline-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong> points based on the integrated discrimination improvement (<i>P</i><0.001) and continuous net reclassification improvement (<i>P</i><0.001), reclassifying 42% of the study population as having normal diastolic function. We replicate these findings in the Copenhagen City Heart Study. With these limits, 46% had normal diastolic function and were at low risk of HF hospitalization or death (1%/y over a mean 1.7-year follow-up), 49% had 1 or 2 abnormal measures and were at intermediate risk (2.4%/y), and all 3 diastolic measures were abnormal in 5% who were at high risk (7.5%/y).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings suggest that left ventricular longitudinal relaxation velocity declines as a part of healthy aging and is largely prognostically benign. The use of age-based normative values when considering an elderly population improves the risk discrimination of diastolic measures for incident HF or death.</p></sec>

The principles detailed in the document reflect the American Heart Association’s new dynamic and proactive goal to promote cardiovascular health throughout the life course. The primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">focus</span></strong> is on adult cardiovascular health and disease prevention, but critical to achievement of this goal is maintenance of ideal cardiovascular health from birth through childhood to young adulthood and beyond. Emphasis is placed on the fundamental principles and metrics that define cardiovascular health in children for the clinical or research setting, and a balanced and critical appraisal of the strengths and weaknesses of the cardiovascular health construct in children and adolescents is provided. Specifically, this document discusses 2 important factors: the promotion of ideal cardiovascular health in all children and the improvement of cardiovascular health metric scores in children currently classified as having poor or intermediate cardiovascular health. Other topics include the current status of cardiovascular health in US children, opportunities for the refinement of health metrics, improvement of health metric scores, and possibilities for promoting ideal cardiovascular health. Importantly, concerns about the suitability of using single thresholds to identify elevated cardiovascular risk throughout the childhood years and the limits of our current knowledge are noted, and suggestions for future directions and research are provided.</p>

Tree Physiology
An empirical study of the wound effect on sap flux density measured with thermal dissipation probes
<p>The insertion of thermal dissipation (TD) sensors on tree stems for sap flux density (SFD) measurements can lead to SFD underestimations due to a wound formation close to the drill hole. However, the wound effect has not been assessed experimentally for this method yet. Here, we propose an empirical approach to investigate the effect of the wound healing on measured sap flux with TD probes. The approach was performed for both, diffuse-porous (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i> (Linnaeus)) and ring-porous (<i>Quercus petraea</i> (Lieblein)) species. Thermal dissipation probes were installed on different dates along the growing season to document the effects of the dynamic wound formation. The trees were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong> in autumn and additional sensors were installed in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong> stems, therefore, without potential effects of wound development. A range of water pressures was applied to the stem segments and SFDs were simultaneously measured by TD sensors as well as gravimetrically in the laboratory. The formation of wounds around sensors installed in living tree stems led to underestimation of SFD by 21.4 ± 3 and 47.5 ± 3.8% in beech and oak, respectively. The differences between SFD underestimations of diffuse-porous beech and ring-porous oak were, however, not statistically significant. Sensors with 5-, 11- and 22-week-old wounds also showed no significant differences, which implies that the influence of wound formation on SFD estimates was completed within the first few weeks after perforation. These results were confirmed by time courses of SFD measurements in the field. Field SFD values decreased immediately after sensor installation and reached stable values after ~2 weeks with similar underestimations to the ones observed in the laboratory. We therefore propose a feasible approach to correct directly field observations of SFD for potential underestimations due to the wound effect.</p>

p53 dynamics in response to DNA damage vary across cell lines and are shaped by efficiency of DNA repair and activity of the kinase ATM
<p>Cellular systems show a wide range of signaling dynamics. Many of these dynamics are highly stereotyped, such as oscillations at a fixed frequency. However, most studies looking at the role of signaling dynamics <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">focus</span></strong> on one or a few cell lines, leaving the diversity of dynamics across tissues or cell lines a largely unexplored question. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">focus</span></strong>ed on the dynamics of the tumor suppressor protein p53, which regulates cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to DNA damage. We established live-cell reporters for 12 cancer cell lines expressing wild-type p53 and quantified p53 dynamics in response to double-strand break–inducing DNA damage. In many of the tested cell lines, we found that p53 abundance oscillated in response to ionizing radiation or the DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic neocarzinostatin and that the periodicity of the oscillations was fixed. In other cell lines, p53 abundance dynamically changed in different ways, such as a single broad pulse or a continuous induction. By combining single-cell assays of p53 signaling dynamics, small-molecule screening in live cells, and mathematical modeling, we identified molecules that perturbed p53 dynamics and determined that cell-specific variation in the efficiency of DNA repair and the activity of the kinase ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) controlled the signaling landscape of p53 dynamics. Because the dynamics of wild-type p53 varied substantially between cell lines, our study highlights the limitation of using one line as a model system and emphasizes the importance of studying the dynamics of other signaling pathways across different cell lines and genetic backgrounds.</p>

Restoring tumor suppression
<p>Many oncogenes and tumor suppressors that are mutated during cancer development act as enzymatic switches that phosphorylate (kinases) or dephosphorylate (phosphatases) substrates. Much attention has <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">focus</span></strong>ed on therapeutically inhibiting oncogenic kinases that are activated by mutation. However, there has been less <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">focus</span></strong> on targeting phosphatases, despite their importance in cancer development. The tumor suppressor PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog on chromosome 10) is the most frequently inactivated phosphatase in human cancer (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). The loss of PTEN phosphatase activity increases downstream activity of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)–AKT signaling pathway (<i>3</i>, <i>4</i>). Preclinical studies have shown that targeting the PI3K-AKT pathway reduces tumor growth when PTEN is inactivated (<i>5</i>). However, many PTEN mutant tumors are resistant to such therapies. On page 651 of this issue, Lee <i>et al.</i> (<i>6</i>) activate PTEN phosphatase by inhibiting a newly described inhibitory system and thereby reduce PI3K-AKT signaling and tumor growth in mice.</p>

Controlled crack propagation for atomic precision handling of wafer-scale two-dimensional materials

Ethics of maternal vaccination

Although a growing number of countries are adopting maternal vaccine programs against diseases like influenza and pertussis, and there is an increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">focus</span></strong> on including pregnant women in trials for new vaccines, there is little discussion of the ethical underpinnings of maternal vaccine programs (<i>2</i>).

The applied value of public investments in biomedical research

Although policy-makers often <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">focus</span></strong> on direct patenting by academic scientists, the bulk of the effect of NIH research on patenting appears to be indirect.

The inherently three-dimensional transition from bulk-turbulent to confined-coherent flows occurs concomitantly with a transition in the bundle orientational order near the surface and is controlled by a scale-invariant criterion related to the channel profile. The nonequilibrium transition of confined isotropic active fluids can be used to engineer self-organized soft <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">machin</span></strong>es.</p>

Ballistic miniband conduction in a graphene superlattice
<p>Rational design of long-period artificial lattices yields effects unavailable in simple solids. The moiré pattern in highly aligned graphene/hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) heterostructures is a lateral superlattice with high electron mobility and an unusual electronic dispersion whose miniband edges and saddle points can be reached by electrostatic gating. We investigated the dynamics of electrons in moiré minibands by measuring ballistic transport between adjacent local contacts in a magnetic field, known as the transverse electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">focus</span></strong>ing effect. At low temperatures, we observed caustics of skipping orbits extending over hundreds of superlattice periods, reversals of the cyclotron revolution for successive minibands, and breakdown of cyclotron motion near van Hove singularities. At high temperatures, electron-electron collisions suppress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">focus</span></strong>ing. Probing such miniband conduction properties is a necessity for engineering novel transport behaviors in superlattice devices.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
A Cycloheximide-Sensitive Step in Transverse Microtubule Array Patterning
<p>The growth properties of individual cells within a tissue determine plant morphology, and the organization of the cytoskeleton, particularly the microtubule arrays, determines cellular growth properties. We investigated the mechanisms governing the formation of transverse microtubule array patterns in axially growing Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) epidermal hypocotyl cells. Using quantitative imaging approaches, we mapped the transition of the cortical microtubule arrays into a transverse coaligned pattern after induction with auxin and gibberellic acid. Hormone induction led to an early loss of microtubule plus end density and a rotation toward oblique patterns. Beginning 30 min after induction, transverse microtubules appeared at the cell’s midzone concurrently with the loss of longitudinal polymers, eventually progressing apically and basally to remodel the array pattern. Based on the timing and known hormone-signaling pathways, we tested the hypothesis that the later events require de novo gene expression and, thus, constitute a level of genetic control over transverse patterning. We found that the presence of the translation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) resulted in a selective and reversible loss of transverse patterns that were replaced with radial-like pinwheel arrays exhibiting a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">split</span></strong> bipolar architecture centered at the cell’s midzone. Experiments using hormone induction and CHX revealed that pinwheel arrays occur when transverse microtubules increase at the midzone but longitudinal microtubules in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">split</span></strong> bipolar architecture are not suppressed. We propose that a key regulatory mechanism for creating the transverse microtubule coalignment in axially growing hypocotyls involves the expression of a CHX-sensitive factor that acts to suppress the nucleation of the longitudinally oriented polymers.</p>

Reproductive Long Intergenic Noncoding RNAs Exhibit Male Gamete Specificity and Polycomb Repressive Complex 2-Mediated Repression
<p>Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been characterized extensively in animals and are involved in several processes, including homeobox gene expression and X-chromosome inactivation. In comparison, there has been much less detailed characterization of plant lncRNAs, and the number of distinct lncRNAs encoded in plant genomes and their regulation by developmental and epigenetic mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we analyzed transcriptome data from Asian rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) and identified 6,309 long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">focus</span></strong>ing on their expression in reproductive tissues and organs. Most <i>O. sativa</i> lincRNAs were expressed in a highly tissue-specific manner, with an unexpectedly high fraction specifically expressed in male gametes. Mutation of a component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex2 (PRC2) resulted in derepression of another large class of lincRNAs, whose expression is correlated with H3K27 trimethylation in developing panicles. Overlap with the sperm cell-specific lincRNAs suggests that epigenetic repression of lincRNAs in the panicles was partially relieved in the male germline. Expression of a subset of lincRNAs also showed modulation by drought in reproductive tissues. Comparison with other cereal genomes showed that the lincRNAs generally have low levels of conservation at both the sequence and structural levels. Use of a novelty detection support vector <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">machin</span></strong>e model enabled the detection of nucleotide sequence and structural homology in ∼10% and ∼4% of the lincRNAs in genomes of purple false brome (<i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>) and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), respectively. This is the first study to report on a large number of lncRNAs that are targets of repression by PRC2 rather than mediating regulation via PRC2. That the vast majority of the lincRNAs reported here do not overlap with those of other rice studies indicates that these are a significant addition to the known lincRNAs in rice.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Microtubule Array Patterns Have a Common Underlying Architecture in Hypocotyl Cells
<p>Microtubules at the plant cell cortex influence cell shape by patterning the deposition of cell wall materials. The elongated cells of the hypocotyl create a variety of microtubule array patterns with differing degrees of polymer coalignment and orientation to the cell’s growth axis. To gain insight into the mechanisms driving array organization, we investigated the underlying microtubule array architecture in light-grown epidermal cells with explicit reference to array pattern. We discovered that all nontransverse patterns share a common underlying array architecture, having a core unimodal peak of coaligned microtubules in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">split</span></strong> bipolarized arrangement. The growing microtubule plus ends extend toward the cell’s apex and base with a region of antiparallel microtubule overlap at the cell’s midzone. This core coalignment continuously shifts between ±30° from the cell’s longitudinal growth axis, forming a continuum of longitudinal and oblique arrays. Transverse arrays exhibit the same unimodal core coalignment but form local domains of microtubules polymerizing in the same direction rather than a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">split</span></strong> bipolarized architecture. Quantitative imaging experiments and analysis of <i>katanin</i> mutants showed that the longitudinal arrays are created from microtubules originating on the outer periclinal cell face, pointing to a cell-directed, rather than self-organizing, mechanism for specifying the major array pattern classes in the hypocotyl cell.</p>

A new morphological classification for greater tuberosity fractures of the proximal humerus
<p>In this study, we describe a morphological classification   for greater tuberosity fractures of the proximal humerus. We divided   these fractures into three types: avulsion, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">split</span></strong> and depression.   We retrospectively reviewed all shoulder radiographs showing isolated   greater tuberosity fractures in a Level I trauma centre between   July 2007 and July 2012. We identified 199 cases where records and   radiographs were reviewed and included 79 men and 120 women with   a mean age of 58 years (23 to 96). The morphological classification   was applied to the first 139 cases by three reviewers on two occasions   using the Kappa statistic and compared with the AO and Neer classifications.   The inter- and intra-observer reliability of the morphological classification   was 0.73 to 0.77 and 0.69 to 0.86, respectively. This was superior   to the Neer (0.31 to 0.35/0.54 to 0.63) and AO (0.30 to 0.32/0.59   to 0.65) classifications. The distribution of avulsion, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">split</span></strong> and   depression type fractures was 39%, 41%, and 20%, respectively. This   classification of greater tuberosity fractures is more reliable   than the Neer or AO classifications. These distinct fracture morphologies   are likely to have implications in terms of pathophysiology and   surgical technique.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014;96-B:646–51.</p>

Development
Co-activation of microRNAs by Zelda is essential for early <i>Drosophila</i> development
<p>Transcription factors and microRNAs (miRNAs) are two important classes of <i>trans</i>-regulators in differential gene expression. Transcription factors occupy <i>cis</i>-regulatory motifs in DNA to activate or repress gene transcription, whereas miRNAs specifically pair with seed sites in target mRNAs to trigger mRNA decay or inhibit translation. Dynamic spatiotemporal expression patterns of transcription factors and miRNAs during development point to their stage- and tissue-specific functions. Recent studies have <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">focus</span></strong>ed on miRNA functions during development; however, much remains to explore regarding how the expression of miRNAs is initiated and how dynamic miRNA expression patterns are achieved by transcriptional regulatory networks at different developmental stages. Here, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">focus</span></strong>ed on the identification, regulation and function of miRNAs during the earliest stage of <i>Drosophila</i> development, when the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) takes place. Eleven miRNA clusters comprise the first set of miRNAs activated in the blastoderm embryo. The transcriptional activator Zelda is required for their proper activation and regulation, and Zelda binding observed in genome-wide binding profiles is predictive of enhancer activity. In addition, other blastoderm transcription factors, comprising both activators and repressors, the activities of which are potentiated and coordinated by Zelda, contribute to the accurate temporal and spatial expression of these miRNAs, which are known to function in diverse developmental processes. Although previous genetic studies showed no early phenotypes upon loss of individual miRNAs, our analysis of the <i>miR-1; miR-9a</i> double mutant revealed defects in gastrulation, demonstrating the importance of co-activation of miRNAs by Zelda during the MZT.</p>

Ranking Businesses and Municipal Locations by Spatiotemporal Cardiac Arrest Risk to Guide Public Defibrillator Placement
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Efforts to guide automated external defibrillator placement for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) treatment have <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">focus</span></strong>ed on identifying broadly defined location categories without considering hours of operation. Broad location categories may be composed of many businesses with varying accessibility. Identifying specific locations for automated external defibrillator deployment incorporating operating hours and time of OHCA occurrence may improve automated external defibrillator accessibility. We aim to identify specific businesses and municipal locations that maximize OHCA coverage on the basis of spatiotemporal assessment of OHCA risk in the immediate vicinity of franchise locations.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This study was a retrospective population-based cohort study using data from the Toronto Regional RescuNET Epistry cardiac arrest database. We identified all nontraumatic public OHCAs occurring in Toronto, ON, Canada, from January 2007 through December 2015. We identified 41 unique businesses and municipal location types with ≥20 locations in Toronto from the YellowPages, Canadian Franchise Association, and the City of Toronto Open Data Portal. We obtained their geographic coordinates and hours of operation from Web sites, by phone, or in person. We determined the number of OHCAs that occurred within 100 m of each location when it was open (spatiotemporal coverage) for Toronto overall and downtown. The businesses and municipal locations were then ranked by spatiotemporal OHCA coverage. To evaluate temporal stability of the rankings, we calculated intraclass correlation of the annual coverage values.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>There were 2654 nontraumatic public OHCAs. Tim Hortons ranked first in Toronto, covering 286 OHCAs. Starbucks ranked first in downtown, covering 110 OHCAs.

The leading indications for revision were instability   (n = 22, 0.46%), infection (n = 20, 0.42%), aseptic femoral loosening   (n = 15, 0.31%) and femoral fracture (n = 6, 0.12%). There were   changes in the surgical technique with respect to the Corail femoral component   during the ten-year period involving a change to collared components   and a trend towards larger size.

A case–control study of surgical site infection following operative fixation of fractures of the ankle in a large UK trauma unit
<p>Most of the literature on surgical site infections   following the surgical treatment of fractures of the ankle is based   on small series of patients, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">focus</span></strong>ing on diabetics or the elderly.   None have described post-operative functional scores in those patients   who develop an infection. We performed an age- and gender-matched   case–control study to identify patient- and surgery-related risk   factors for surgical site infection following open reduction and   internal fixation of a fracture of the ankle. Logistic regression   analysis was used to identify significant risk factors for infection   and to calculate odds ratios (OR). Function was assessed using the   Olerud and Molander Ankle Score. The incidence of infection was   4% (29/717) and 1.1% (8/717) were deep infections. The median ankle   score was significantly lower in the infection group compared with   the control group (60 <i>vs</i> 90, Mann–Whitney test   p < 0.0001).

Absence of strong strain effects in behavioral analyses of <i>Shank3</i>-deficient mice
<p>Haploinsufficiency of <i>SHANK3</i>, caused by chromosomal abnormalities or mutations that disrupt one copy of the gene, leads to a neurodevelopmental syndrome called Phelan-McDermid syndrome, symptoms of which can include absent or delayed speech, intellectual disability, neurological changes and autism spectrum disorders. The SHANK3 protein forms a key structural part of the post-synaptic density. We previously generated and characterized mice with a targeted disruption of <i>Shank3</i> in which exons coding for the ankyrin-repeat domain were deleted and expression of full-length Shank3 was disrupted. We documented specific deficits in synaptic function and plasticity, along with reduced reciprocal social interactions, in <i>Shank3</i> heterozygous mice. Changes in phenotype owing to a mutation at a single locus are quite frequently modulated by other loci, most dramatically when the entire genetic background is changed. In mice, each strain of laboratory mouse represents a distinct genetic background and alterations in phenotype owing to gene knockout or transgenesis are frequently different across strains, which can lead to the identification of important modifier loci. We have investigated the effect of genetic background on phenotypes of <i>Shank3</i> heterozygous, knockout and wild-type mice, using C57BL/6, 129SVE and FVB/Ntac strain backgrounds. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">focus</span></strong>ed on observable behaviors with the goal of carrying out subsequent analyses to identify modifier loci. Surprisingly, there were very modest strain effects over a large battery of analyses. These results indicate that behavioral phenotypes associated with <i>Shank3</i> haploinsufficiency are largely strain-independent.</p>

Precise control of miR-125b levels is required to create a regeneration-permissive environment after spinal cord injury: a cross-species comparison between salamander and rat
<p>Most spinal cord injuries lead to permanent paralysis in mammals. By contrast, the remarkable regenerative abilities of salamanders enable full functional recovery even from complete spinal cord transections. The molecular differences underlying this evolutionary divergence between mammals and amphibians are poorly understood. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">focus</span></strong>ed on upstream regulators of gene expression as primary entry points into this question. We identified a group of microRNAs (miRNAs) that are conserved between the Mexican axolotl salamander (<i>Ambystoma mexicanum</i>) and mammals but show marked cross-species differences in regulation patterns following spinal cord injury. We found that precise post-injury levels of one of these miRNAs (miR-125b) is essential for functional recovery, and guides correct regeneration of axons through the lesion site in a process involving the direct downstream target <i>Sema4D</i> in axolotls. Translating these results to a mammalian model, we increased miR-125b levels in the rat through mimic treatments following spinal cord transection. These treatments downregulated <i>Sema4D</i> and other glial-scar-related genes, and enhanced the animal’s functional recovery. Our study identifies a key regulatory molecule conserved between salamander and mammal, and shows that the expression of <i>miR-125b</i> and <i>Sema4D</i> must be carefully controlled in the right cells at the correct level to promote regeneration. We also show that these molecular components of the salamander’s regeneration-permissive environment can be experimentally harnessed to improve treatment outcomes for mammalian spinal cord injuries.</p>

<p>Brucellosis, a frequent bacterial zoonosis, can produce debilitating chronic disease with involvement of multiple organs in human patients. Whereas a<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong>e brucellosis is well studied using the murine animal model, long-term complications of host-pathogen interaction remain largely elusive. Human brucellosis frequently results in persistent, chronic osteoarticular system involvement, with complications such as arthritis, spondylitis and sacroiliitis. Here, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">focus</span></strong>ed on identifying infectious sites in the mouse that parallel <i>Brucella melitensis</i> foci observed in patients. <i>In vivo</i> imaging showed rapid bacterial dispersal to multiple sites of the murine axial skeleton. In agreement with these findings, immunohistochemistry revealed the presence of bacteria in bones and limbs, and in the lower spine vertebrae of the axial skeleton where they were preferentially located in the bone marrow. Surprisingly, some animals developed arthritis in paws and spine after infection, but without obvious bacteria in these sites. The identification of <i>Brucella</i> in the bones of mice corroborates the findings in humans that these osteoarticular sites are important niches for the persistence of <i>Brucella</i> in the host, but the mechanisms that mediate pathological manifestations in these sites remain unclear. Future studies addressing the immune responses within osteoarticular tissue foci could elucidate important tissue injury mediators and <i>Brucella</i> survival strategies.</p>

Bloomsbury report on mouse embryo phenotyping: recommendations from the IMPC workshop on embryonic lethal screening
<p>Identifying genes that are important for embryo development is a crucial first step towards understanding their many functions in driving the ordered growth, differentiation and organogenesis of embryos. It can also shed light on the origins of developmental disease and congenital abnormalities. Current international efforts to examine gene function in the mouse provide a unique opportunity to pinpoint genes that are involved in embryogenesis, owing to the emergence of embryonic lethal knockout mutants. Through internationally coordinated efforts, the International Knockout Mouse Consortium (IKMC) has generated a public resource of mouse knockout strains and, in April 2012, the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC), supported by the EU InfraCoMP programme, convened a workshop to discuss developing a phenotyping pipeline for the investigation of embryonic lethal knockout lines. This workshop brought together over 100 scientists, from 13 countries, who are working in the academic and commercial research sectors, including experts and opinion leaders in the fields of embryology, animal imaging, data capture, quality control and annotation, high-throughput mouse production, phenotyping, and reporter gene analysis. This article summarises the outcome of the workshop, including (1) the vital scientific importance of phenotyping embryonic lethal mouse strains for basic and translational research; (2) a common framework to harmonise international efforts within this context; (3) the types of phenotyping that are likely to be most appropriate for systematic use, with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">focus</span></strong> on 3D embryo imaging; (4) the importance of centralising data in a standardised form to facilitate data mining; and (5) the development of online tools to allow open access to and dissemination of the phenotyping data.</p>

Association Between Early Hyperoxia Exposure After Resuscitation From Cardiac Arrest and Neurological Disability
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Studies examining the association between hyperoxia exposure after resuscitation from cardiac arrest and clinical outcomes have reported conflicting results. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that early postresuscitation hyperoxia is associated with poor neurological outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This was a multicenter prospective cohort study. We included adult patients with cardiac arrest who were mechanically ventilated and received targeted temperature management after return of spontaneous circulation. We excluded patients with cardiac arrest caused by trauma or sepsis. Per protocol, partial pressure of arterial oxygen (Pa<sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub>) was measured at 1 and 6 hours after return of spontaneous circulation. Hyperoxia was defined as a Pa<sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub> >300 mm Hg during the initial 6 hours after return of spontaneous circulation. The primary outcome was poor neurological function at hospital discharge, defined as a modified Rankin Scale score >3. Multivariable generalized linear regression with a log link was used to test the association between Pa<sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub> and poor neurological outcome. To assess whether there was an association between other supranormal Pa<sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub> levels and poor neurological outcome, we used other Pa<sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong> points to define hyperoxia (ie, 100, 150, 200, 250, 350, 400 mm Hg).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of the 280 patients included, 105 (38%) had exposure to hyperoxia. Poor neurological function at hospital discharge occurred in 70% of patients in the entire cohort and in 77% versus 65% among patients with versus without exposure to hyperoxia respectively (absolute risk difference, 12%; 95% confidence interval, 1–23). Hyperoxia was independently associated with poor neurological function (relative risk, 1.23; 95% confidence interval, 1.11–1.35). On multivariable analysis, a 1-hour-longer duration of hyperoxia exposure was associated with a 3% increase in risk of poor neurological outcome (relative risk, 1.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.02–1.05). We found that the association with poor neurological outcome began at ≥300 mm Hg.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Early hyperoxia exposure after resuscitation from cardiac arrest was independently associated with poor neurological function at hospital discharge.</p></sec>

Fasting Versus Nonfasting and Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Accuracy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Recent recommendations favoring nonfasting lipid assessment may affect low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) estimation. The novel method of LDL-C estimation (LDL-C<sub>N</sub>) uses a flexible approach to derive patient-specific ratios of triglycerides to very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. This adaptability may confer an accuracy advantage in nonfasting patients over the fixed approach of the classic Friedewald method (LDL-C<sub>F</sub>).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used a US cross-sectional sample of 1 545  634 patients (959 153 fasting ≥10–12 hours; 586 481 nonfasting) from the second harvest of the Very Large Database of Lipids study to assess for the first time the impact of fasting status on novel LDL-C accuracy. Rapid ultracentrifugation was used to directly measure LDL-C content (LDL-C<sub>D</sub>). Accuracy was defined as the percentage of LDL-C<sub>D</sub> falling within an estimated LDL-C (LDL-C<sub>N</sub> or LDL-C<sub>F</sub>) category by clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong> points. For low estimated LDL-C (<70 mg/dL), we evaluated accuracy by triglyceride levels. The magnitude of absolute and percent differences between LDL-C<sub>D</sub> and estimated LDL-C (LDL-C<sub>N</sub> or LDL-C<sub>F</sub>) was stratified by LDL-C and triglyceride categories.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In both fasting and nonfasting samples, accuracy was higher with the novel method across all clinical LDL-C categories (range, 87%–94%) compared with the Friedewald estimation (range, 71%–93%; <i>P</i>≤0.001). With LDL-C <70 mg/dL, nonfasting LDL-C<sub>N</sub> accuracy (92%) was superior to LDL-C<sub>F</sub> accuracy (71%; <i>P</i><0.001). In this LDL-C range, 19% of fasting and 30% of nonfasting patients had differences ≥10 mg/dL between LDL-C<sub>F</sub> and LDL-C<sub>D</sub>, whereas only 2% and 3% of patients, respectively, had similar differences with novel estimation. Accuracy of LDL-C <70 mg/dL further decreased as triglycerides increased, particularly for Friedewald estimation (range, 37%–96%) versus the novel method (range, 82%–94%). With triglycerides of 200 to 399 mg/dL in nonfasting patients, LDL-C<sub>N</sub> <70 mg/dL accuracy (82%) was superior to LDL-C<sub>F</sub> (37%; <i>P</i><0.001). In this triglyceride range, 73% of fasting and 81% of nonfasting patients had ≥10 mg/dL differences between LDL-C<sub>F</sub> and LDL-C<sub>D</sub> compared with 25% and 20% of patients, respectively, with LDL-C<sub>N</sub>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Novel adaptable LDL-C estimation performs better in nonfasting samples than the fixed Friedewald estimation, with a particular accuracy advantage in settings of low LDL-C and high triglycerides. In addition to stimulating further study, these results may have immediate relevance for guideline committees, laboratory leadership, clinicians, and patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Association Between Hospital Volume, Processes of Care, and Outcomes in Patients Admitted With Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Hospital volume is frequently used as a structural metric for assessing quality of care, but its utility in patients admitted with a<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong>e heart failure (HF) is not well characterized. Accordingly, we sought to determine the relationship between admission volume, process-of-care metrics, and short- and long-term outcomes in patients admitted with a<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong>e HF.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients enrolled in the Get With The Guidelines-HF registry with linked Medicare inpatient data at 342 hospitals were assessed. Volume was assessed both as a continuous variable, and quartiles based on the admitting hospital annual HF case volume, as well: 5 to 38 (quartile 1), 39 to 77 (quartile 2), 78 to 122 (quartile 3), 123 to 457 (quartile 4). The main outcome measures were (1) process measures at discharge (achievement of HF achievement, quality, reporting, and composite metrics); (2) 30-day mortality and hospital readmission; and (3) 6-month mortality and hospital readmission. Adjusted logistic and Cox proportional hazards models were used to study these associations with hospital volume.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 125 595 patients with HF were included. Patients admitted to high-volume hospitals had a higher burden of comorbidities. On multivariable modeling, lower-volume hospitals were significantly less likely to be adherent to HF process measures than higher-volume hospitals. Higher hospital volume was not associated with a difference in in-hospital (odds ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.94–1.05; <i>P</i>=0.78) or 30-day mortality (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.97–1.01; <i>P</i>=0.26), or 30-day readmissions (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.97–1.00; <i>P</i>=0.10). There was a weak association of higher volumes with lower 6-month mortality (hazard ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97–0.99; <i>P</i>=0.001) and lower 6-month all-cause readmissions (hazard ratio, 0.98; 95%, CI 0.97–1.00; <i>P</i>=0.025).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our analysis of a large contemporary prospective national quality improvement registry of older patients with HF indicates that hospital volume as a structural metric correlates with process measures, but not with 30-day outcomes, and only marginally with outcomes up to 6 months of follow-up. Hospital profiling should <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">focus</span></strong> on participation in systems of care, adherence to process metrics, and risk-standardized outcomes rather than on hospital volume itself.</p></sec>

Effects of Bariatric Surgery in Obese Patients With Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Recent research efforts on bariatric surgery have <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">focus</span></strong>ed on metabolic and diabetes mellitus resolution. Randomized trials designed to assess the impact of bariatric surgery in patients with obesity and hypertension are needed.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In this randomized, single-center, nonblinded trial, we included patients with hypertension (using ≥2 medications at maximum doses or >2 at moderate doses) and a body mass index between 30.0 and 39.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Patients were randomized to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass plus medical therapy or medical therapy alone. The primary end point was reduction of ≥30% of the total number of antihypertensive medications while maintaining systolic and diastolic blood pressure <140 mm Hg and 90 mm Hg, respectively, at 12 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We included 100 patients (70% female, mean age 43.8±9.2 years, mean body mass index 36.9±2.7 kg/m2), and 96% completed follow-up. Reduction of ≥30% of the total number of antihypertensive medications while maintaining controlled blood pressure occurred in 41 of 49 patients from the gastric bypass group (83.7%) compared with 6 of 47 patients (12.8%) from the control group with a rate ratio of 6.6 (95% confidence interval, 3.1–14.0; <i>P</i><0.001). Remission of hypertension was present in 25 of 49 (51%) and 22 of 48 (45.8%) patients randomized to gastric bypass, considering office and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, respectively, whereas no patient submitted to medical therapy was free of antihypertensive drugs at 12 months. A post hoc analysis for the primary end point considering the SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) target reached consistent results, with a rate ratio of 3.8 (95% confidence interval, 1.4–10.6; <i>P</i>=0.005). Eleven patients (22.4%) from the gastric bypass group and none in the control group were able to achieve SPRINT levels without antihypertensives. Waist circumference, body mass index, fasting plasma glucose, glycohemoglobin, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and 10-year Framingham risk score were lower in the gastric bypass than in the control group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Bariatric surgery represents an effective strategy for blood pressure control in a broad population of patients with obesity and hypertension.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

<i>Enterococcus faecalis</i> Infective Endocarditis
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Because of the nephrotoxic effects of aminoglycosides, the Danish guidelines on infective endocarditis were changed in January 2007, reducing gentamicin treatment in enterococcal infective endocarditis from 4 to 6 weeks to only 2 weeks. In this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pilot</span></strong> study, we compare outcomes in patients with <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i> infective endocarditis treated in the years before and after endorsement of these new recommendations.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>A total of 84 consecutive patients admitted with definite left-sided <i>E faecalis</i> endocarditis in the period of 2002 to 2011 were enrolled. Forty-one patients were treated before and 43 patients were treated after January 1, 2007. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics. At hospitalization, the 2 groups had similar estimated glomerular filtration rates of 66 and 75 mL/min (<i>P</i>=0.22). Patients treated before January 2007 received gentamicin for a significantly longer period (28 versus 14 days; <i>P</i><0.001). The primary outcome, 1-year event-free survival, did not differ: 66% versus 69%, respectively (<i>P</i>=0.75). At discharge, the patients treated before 2007 had a lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (45 versus 66 mL/min; <i>P</i>=0.008) and a significantly greater decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (median, 11 versus 1 mL/min; <i>P</i>=0.009) compared with those treated after 2007.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Our present <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pilot</span></strong> study suggests that the recommended 2-week treatment with gentamicin seems adequate and preferable in treating non–high-level aminoglycoside-resistant <i>E faecalis</i> infective endocarditis. The longer duration of gentamicin treatment is associated with worse renal function. Although the certainty of the clinical outcomes is limited by the sample size, outcomes appear to be no worse with the shorter treatment duration. Randomized, controlled studies are warranted to substantiate these results.</p></sec>

Noninvasive blood tests for fetal development predict gestational age and preterm delivery
<p>Noninvasive blood tests that provide information about fetal development and gestational age could potentially improve prenatal care. Ultrasound, the current gold standard, is not always affordable in low-resource settings and does not predict spontaneous preterm birth, a leading cause of infant death. In a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pilot</span></strong> study of 31 healthy pregnant women, we found that measurement of nine cell-free RNA (cfRNA) transcripts in maternal blood predicted gestational age with comparable accuracy to ultrasound but at substantially lower cost. In a related study of 38 women (23 full-term and 15 preterm deliveries), all at elevated risk of delivering preterm, we identified seven cfRNA transcripts that accurately classified women who delivered preterm up to 2 months in advance of labor. These tests hold promise for prenatal care in both the developed and developing worlds, although they require validation in larger, blinded clinical trials.</p>

Use of inlet radiographs in the assessment of reduction after the surgical treatment of developmental dysplasia of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pilot</span></strong> study aimed to evaluate prospectively the use of inlet   radiographs of the hip as an alternative method of the assessment   of reduction after the surgical treatment of developmental dysplasia   of the hip (DDH).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The children in this study underwent surgery between January   2013 and January 2015. All had inlet radiographs and CT scans post-operatively.   Data were analysed by determining inter-observer reliability and   intra-observer reproducibility, using the kappa value (K). Differences   were settled by discussion between the two observers until a consensus   was reached. The sensitivity and specificity of the radiographic   and CT results were compared. A total of 26 radiographs were obtained   from 23 children, with a mean age of 2.38 years (one to five).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Similar high levels of intra- and inter-observer agreement were   observed (K = 0.834, 95% confidence interval (CI)). There was a   high agreement between the radiographic and CT results (K = 0.834,   5% CI), with excellent sensitivity and a specificity of 95.5%.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These results suggest that inlet radiographs may be a reliable   method of assessing the reduction of the hip after the surgical   treatment of DDH.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:697–701.</p></sec>

Synovial calprotectin
<sec><title>Aims </title><p>Recently, several synovial biomarkers have been introduced into   the algorithm for the diagnosis of a prosthetic joint infection   (PJI). Alpha defensin is a promising biomarker, with a high sensitivity   and specificity, but it is expensive. Calprotectin is a protein   that is present in the cytoplasm of neutrophils, is released upon   neutrophil activation and exhibits anti-microbial activity. Our   aim, in this study, was to determine the diagnostic potential of   synovial calprotectin in the diagnosis of a PJI.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>In this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pilot</span></strong> study, we prospectively collected synovial fluid   from the hip, knee, shoulder and elbow of 19 patients with a proven   PJI and from a control group of 42 patients who underwent revision   surgery without a PJI.</p><p>PJI was diagnosed according to the current diagnostic criteria   of the Musculoskeletal Infection Society. Synovial fluid was centrifuged   and the supernatant was used to measure the level of calprotectin   after applying a lateral flow immunoassay. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The median synovial calprotectin level was 991 mg/L (interquartile   range (IQR) 154 to 1787) in those with a PJI and 11 mg/L (IQR 3   to 29) in the control group (p < 0.0001). Using a cut-off value   of 50 mg/L, this level showed an excellent diagnostic accuracy,   with an area under the curve of 0.94. The overall sensitivity, specificity,   positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV)   was 89%, 90%, 81% and 95% respectively. The NPV was 97% in the nine   patients with a chronic PJI. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion </title><p>Synovial calprotectin may be a valuable biomarker in the diagnosis   of a PJI, especially in the exclusion of an infection. With a lateral   flow immunoassay, a relatively rapid quantitative diagnosis can   be made. The measurement is cheap and is easy to use. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:660–5.</p></sec>

Transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion using polyetheretherketone oblique cages with and without a titanium coating
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We compared the clinical and radiological outcomes of using a   polyetheretherketone cage with (TiPEEK) and without a titanium coating   (PEEK) for instrumented transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF).</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We conducted a randomised clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pilot</span></strong> trial of 40 patients   who were scheduled to undergo a TLIF procedure at one or two levels   between L2 and L5. The Oswestry disability index (ODI), EuroQoL-5D,   and back and leg pain were determined pre-operatively, and at three,   six, and 12 months post-operatively. Fusion rates were assessed   by thin slice CT at three months and by functional radiography at   12 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At final follow-up, one patient in each group had been lost to   follow-up. Two patients in each of the PEEK and TiPEEK groups were   revised for pseudarthrosis (p = 1.00). The rate of complete or partial   fusion at three months was 91.7% in both groups. Overall, there   were no significant differences in ODI or in radiological outcomes   between the groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Favourable results with identical clinical outcomes and a high   rate of fusion was seen in both groups. The titanium coating appears   to have no negative effects on outcome or safety in the short term.   A future study to determine the effect of titanium coating is warranted.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1366–72.</p></sec>

A pilot randomized trial of meniscal allograft transplantation versus personalized physiotherapy for patients with a symptomatic meniscal deficient knee compartment
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Meniscal allograft transplantation is undertaken to improve pain   and function in patients with a symptomatic meniscal deficient knee   compartment. While case series have shown improvements in patient   reported outcome measures (PROMs), its efficacy has not been rigorously   evaluated. This study aimed to compare PROMs in patients having   meniscal transplantation with those having personalized physiotherapy   at 12 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A single-centre assessor-blinded, comprehensive cohort study,   incorporating a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pilot</span></strong> randomized controlled trial (RCT) was performed   on patients with a symptomatic compartment of the knee in which   a (sub)total meniscectomy had previously been performed. They were   randomized to be treated either with a meniscal allograft transplantation   or personalized physiotherapy, and stratified for malalignment of   the limb. They entered the preference groups if they were not willing   to be randomized. The Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS),   International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score and Lysholm   score and complications were collected at baseline and at four,   eight and 12 months following the interventions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 36 patients entered the study; 21 were randomized   and 15 chose their treatments. Their mean age was 28 years (range   17 to 46). The outcomes were similar in the randomized and preference   groups, allowing pooling of data. At 12 months, the KOOS<sub>4</sub> composite   score (mean difference 12, p = 0.03) and KOOS subscales of pain   (mean difference 15, p = 0.02) and activities of daily living (mean   difference 18, p = 0.005) were significantly superior in the meniscal   transplantation group. Other PROMs also favoured this group without   reaching statistical significance. There were five complications   in the meniscal transplantation and one in the physiotherapy groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This is the first study to compare meniscal allograft transplantation   to non-operative treatment. The results provide the best quality   evidence to date of the symptomatic benefits of meniscal allograft   transplantation in the short term, but a multicentre RCT is required   to investigate this question further.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:56–63.</p></sec>

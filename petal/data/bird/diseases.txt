Blockade of surface-bound TGF-β on regulatory T cells abrogates suppression of effector T cell function in the tumor microenvironment
<p>Regulatory T cells (T<sub>regs</sub>) suppress anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> immunity by inhibiting the killing of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells by antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. To better understand the mechanisms involved, we used ex vivo three-dimensional collagen-fibrin gel cultures of dissociated B16 melanoma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s. This system recapitulated the in vivo suppression of antimelanoma immunity, rendering the dissociated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells resistant to killing by cocultured activated, antigen-specific T cells. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immunosuppress</span></strong>ion was not observed when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s excised from T<sub>reg</sub>-depleted mice were cultured in this system. Experiments with neutralizing antibodies showed that blocking transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) also prevented <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immunosuppress</span></strong>ion. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immunosuppress</span></strong>ion depended on cell-cell contact or cellular proximity because soluble factors from the collagen-fibrin gel cultures did not inhibit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cell killing by T cells. Moreover, intravital, two-photon microscopy showed that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-specific Pmel-1 effector T cells physically interacted with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-resident T<sub>regs</sub> in mice. T<sub>regs</sub> isolated from B16 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s alone were sufficient to suppress CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell–mediated killing, which depended on surface-bound TGF-β on the T<sub>regs</sub>. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immunosuppress</span></strong>ion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells correlated with a decrease in the abundance of the cytolytic protein granzyme B and an increase in the cell surface amount of the immune checkpoint receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1). These findings suggest that contact between T<sub>regs</sub> and anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> T cells in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> microenvironment inhibits antimelanoma immunity in a TGF-β–dependent manner and highlight potential ways to inhibit intra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>al T<sub>regs</sub> therapeutically.</p>

Risk of Cerebrovascular Events in 178 962 Five-Year Survivors of Cancer Diagnosed at 15 to 39 Years of Age
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Survivors of teenage and young adult cancer are at risk of cerebrovascular events, but the magnitude of and extent to which this risk varies by cancer type, decade of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s, age at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s, and attained age remains uncertain. This is the largest-ever cohort study to evaluate the risks of hospitalization for a cerebrovascular event among long-term survivors of teenage and young adult cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The population-based TYACSS (Teenage and Young Adult Cancer Survivor Study) (N=178,962) was linked to Hospital Episode Statistics data for England to investigate the risks of hospitalization for a cerebrovascular event among 5-year survivors of cancer diagnosed when 15 to 39 years of age. Observed numbers of first hospitalizations for cerebrovascular events were compared with that expected from the general population using standardized hospitalization ratios (SHRs) and absolute excess risks per 10 000 person-years. Cumulative incidence was calculated with death considered a competing risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, 2782 cancer survivors were hospitalized for a cerebrovascular event—40% higher than expected (SHR=1.4, 95% confidence interval, 1.3–1.4). Survivors of central nervous system (CNS) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s (SHR=4.6, 95% confidence interval, 4.3–5.0), head and neck <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s (SHR=2.6, 95% confidence interval, 2.2–3.1), and leukemia (SHR=2.5, 95% confidence interval, 1.9–3.1) were at greatest risk. Males had significantly higher absolute excess risks than females (absolute excess risks =7 versus 3), especially among head and neck <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> survivors (absolute excess risks =30 versus 11). By 60 years of age, 9%, 6%, and 5% of CNS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>, head and neck <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>, and leukemia survivors, respectively, had been hospitalized for a cerebrovascular event. Beyond 60 years of age, every year, 0.4% of CNS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> survivors were hospitalized for a cerebral infarction (versus 0.1% expected), whereas at any age, every year, 0.2% of head and neck <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> survivors were hospitalized for a cerebral infarction (versus 0.06% expected).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Survivors of a CNS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>, head and neck <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>, and leukemia are particularly at risk of hospitalization for a cerebrovascular event. The excess risk of cerebral infarction among CNS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> survivors increases with attained age. For head and neck <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> survivors, this excess risk remains high across all ages. These groups of survivors, particularly males, should be considered for surveillance of cerebrovascular risk factors and potential pharmacological interventions for cerebral infarction prevention.</p></sec>

Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor Type I Controls Cardiomyocyte Transforming Growth Factor-β and Cardiac Fibrosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibrosi</span></strong>s is the pathological consequence of stress-induced tissue remodeling and matrix accumulation. Increased levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor type I (PAI-1) have been shown to promote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibrosi</span></strong>s in multiple organ systems. Paradoxically, homozygous genetic deficiency of PAI-1 is associated with spontaneous age-dependent, cardiac-selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibrosi</span></strong>s in mice. We have identified a novel PAI-1-dependent mechanism that regulates cardiomyocyte-derived fibrogenic signals and cardiac transcriptional pathways during injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibrosi</span></strong>s in subjects with homozygous mutation in <i>SERPINE-1</i> was evaluated with late gadolinium-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. A murine cardiac injury model was performed by subcutaneous infusion of either saline or Angiotensin II by osmotic minipumps. We evaluated blood pressure, cardiac function (by echocardiography), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibrosi</span></strong>s (with Masson Trichrome staining), and apoptosis (with TUNEL staining), and we performed transcriptome analysis (with RNA sequencing). We further evaluated fibrotic signaling in isolated murine primary ventricular myocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibrosi</span></strong>s was detected in 2 otherwise healthy humans with complete PAI-1 deficiency because of a homozygous frameshift mutation in <i>SERPINE-1</i>. In addition to its suppressive role during spontaneous cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibrosi</span></strong>s in multiple species, we hypothesized that PAI-1 also regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibrosi</span></strong>s during cardiac injury. Treatment of young PAI-1<sup>−/−</sup> mice with Angiotensin II induced extensive hypertrophy and fibrotic cardiomyopathy, with increased cardiac apoptosis and both reactive and replacement <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibrosi</span></strong>s. Although Angiotensin II-induced hypertension was blunted in PAI-1<sup>−/−</sup> mice, cardiac hypertrophy was accelerated. Furthermore, ventricular myocytes were found to be an important source of cardiac transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and PAI-1 regulated TGF-β synthesis by cardiomyocytes in vitro as well as in vivo during cardiac injury. Transcriptome analysis of ventricular RNA after Angiotensin II treatment confirmed that PAI-1 deficiency significantly enhanced multiple TGF-β signaling elements and transcriptional targets, including genes for extracellular matrix components, mediators of extracellular matrix remodeling, matricellular proteins, and cardiac integrins compared with wild-type mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>PAI-1 is an essential repressor of cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibrosi</span></strong>s in mammals. We define a novel cardiomyocyte-specific regulatory mechanism for TGF-β production by PAI-1, which explains the paradoxical effect of PAI-1 deficiency in promoting cardiac-selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibrosi</span></strong>s. Thus, PAI-1 is a molecular switch that controls the cardiac TGF-β axis and its early transcriptional effects that lead to myocardial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibrosi</span></strong>s.</p></sec>

Breast tumors educate the proteome of stromal tissue in an individualized but coordinated manner
<p>Cancer forms specialized microenvironmental niches that promote local invasion and colonization. Engrafted patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) locally invade and colonize naive stroma in mice while enabling unambiguous molecular discrimination of human proteins in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> from mouse proteins in the microenvironment. To characterize how patient breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s form a niche and educate naive stroma, subcutaneous breast cancer PDXs were globally profiled by species-specific quantitative proteomics. Regulation of PDX stromal proteins by breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s was extensive, with 35% of the stromal proteome altered by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s consistently across different animals and passages. Differentially regulated proteins in the stroma clustered into six signatures, which included both known and previously unappreciated contributors to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> invasion and colonization. Stromal proteomes were coordinately regulated; however, the sets of proteins altered by each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> were highly distinct. Integrated analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> and stromal proteins, a comparison made possible in these xenograft models, indicated that the known hallmarks of cancer contribute pleiotropically to establishing and maintaining the microenvironmental niche of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>. Education of the stroma by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> is therefore an intrinsic property of breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s that is highly individualized, yet proceeds by consistent, nonrandom, and defined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-promoting molecular alterations.</p>

Bone voyage—Osteoblasts remotely control tumors
<p>Cancer is a systemic disease. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> growth and malignant progression rely not only on the intrinsic aberrant genetic and epigenetic makeup of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells but also on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-induced systemic factors that affect cells in the primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> as well as distant microenvironments (<i>1</i>). Notably, bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) have been shown to contribute to primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> progression by promoting hallmark processes such as inflammation, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immunosuppress</span></strong>ion, vasculogenesis, and extracellular matrix remodeling. BMDCs are also involved in establishing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-permissive microenvironments that form before the arrival of disseminated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells at future metastatic sites (known as premetastatic niches) and promote metastatic outgrowth (<i>2</i>–<i>5</i>).

Targeting TNFR2 with antagonistic antibodies inhibits proliferation of ovarian cancer cells and tumor-associated T<sub>regs</sub>
<p>Major barriers to cancer therapy include the lack of selective inhibitors of regulatory T cells (T<sub>regs</sub>) and the lack of broadly applicable ways to directly target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s through frequently expressed surface oncogenes. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">necrosi</span></strong>s factor receptor 2 (TNFR2) is an attractive target protein because of its restricted abundance to highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immunosuppress</span></strong>ive T<sub>regs</sub> and oncogenic presence on human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s. We characterized the effect of TNFR2 inhibition using antagonistic antibodies. In culture-based assays, we found that two TNFR2 antagonists inhibited T<sub>reg</sub> proliferation, reduced soluble TNFR2 secretion from normal cells, and enabled T effector cell expansion. The antagonistic activity occurred in the presence of added TNF, a natural TNFR2 agonist. These TNFR2 antibodies killed T<sub>regs</sub> isolated from ovarian cancer ascites more potently than it killed T<sub>regs</sub> from healthy donor samples, suggesting that these antibodies may have specificity for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> microenvironment. The TNFR2 antagonists also killed OVCAR3 ovarian cancer cells, which have abundant surface TNFR2. The antibodies stabilized antiparallel dimers in cell surface TNFR2 that rendered the receptor unable to activate the nuclear factor κB pathway and trigger cell proliferation. Our data suggest that, by targeting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immunosuppress</span></strong>ive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-associated T<sub>regs</sub>, antagonistic TNFR2 antibodies may be an effective treatment for cancers positive for TNFR2.</p>

Analysis of shared heritability in common disorders of the brain
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ers of the brain can exhibit considerable epidemiological comorbidity and often share symptoms, provoking debate about their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">etiolog</span></strong>ic overlap.

Targeting Chondroitin Sulfate Glycosaminoglycans to Treat Cardiac Fibrosis in Pathological Remodeling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Heart failure is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity, and the search for novel therapeutic approaches continues. In the monogenic disease mucopolysaccharidosis VI, loss-of-function mutations in arylsulfatase B lead to myocardial accumulation of chondroitin sulfate (CS) glycosaminoglycans, manifesting as myriad cardiac symptoms. Here, we studied changes in myocardial CS in nonmucopolysaccharidosis failing hearts and assessed its generic role in pathological cardiac remodeling.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Healthy and diseased human and rat left ventricles were subjected to histological and immunostaining methods to analyze glycosaminoglycan distribution. Glycosaminoglycans were extracted and analyzed for quantitative and compositional changes with Alcian blue assay and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry. Expression changes in 20 CS-related genes were studied in 3 primary human cardiac cell types and THP-1–derived macrophages under each of 9 in vitro stimulatory conditions. In 2 rat models of pathological remodeling induced by transverse aortic constriction or isoprenaline infusion, recombinant human arylsulfatase B (rhASB), clinically used as enzyme replacement therapy in mucopolysaccharidosis VI, was administered intravenously for 7 or 5 weeks, respectively. Cardiac function, myocardial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibrosi</span></strong>s, and inflammation were assessed by echocardiography and histology. CS-interacting molecules were assessed with surface plasmon resonance, and a mechanism of action was verified in vitro.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Failing human hearts displayed significant perivascular and interstitial CS accumulation, particularly in regions of intense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibrosi</span></strong>s. Relative composition of CS disaccharides remained unchanged. Transforming growth factor–β induced CS upregulation in cardiac fibroblasts. CS accumulation was also observed in both the pressure-overload and the isoprenaline models of pathological remodeling in rats. Early treatment with rhASB in the transverse aortic constriction model and delayed treatment in the isoprenaline model proved rhASB to be effective at preventing cardiac deterioration and augmenting functional recovery.

Patients were classified as having THV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thrombosi</span></strong>s if there was any evidence of hypoattenuated leaflet thickening. Anatomic and THV deployment geometries were analyzed, and thrombus volumes were computed through manual 3-dimensional reconstruction.

Interleukin-10 Inhibits Bone Marrow Fibroblast Progenitor Cell–Mediated Cardiac Fibrosis in Pressure-Overloaded Myocardium
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Activated fibroblasts (myofibroblasts) play a critical role in cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibrosi</span></strong>s; however, their origin in the diseased heart remains unclear, warranting further investigation. Recent studies suggest the contribution of bone marrow fibroblast progenitor cells (BM-FPCs) in pressure overload–induced cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibrosi</span></strong>s. We have previously shown that interleukin-10 (IL10) suppresses pressure overload–induced cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibrosi</span></strong>s; however, the role of IL10 in inhibition of BM-FPC–mediated cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibrosi</span></strong>s is not known.

To determine the bone marrow origin, chimeric mice were created with enhanced green fluorescent protein WT mice marrow to the IL10KO mice. For mechanistic studies, FPCs were isolated from mouse bone marrow.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Pressure overload enhanced BM-FPC mobilization and homing in IL10KO mice compared with WT mice. Furthermore, WT bone marrow (from enhanced green fluorescent protein mice) transplantation in bone marrow–depleted IL10KO mice (IL10KO chimeric mice) reduced transverse aortic constriction–induced BM-FPC mobilization compared with IL10KO mice. Green fluorescent protein costaining with α-smooth muscle actin or collagen 1α in left ventricular tissue sections of IL10KO chimeric mice suggests that myofibroblasts were derived from bone marrow after transverse aortic constriction. Finally, WT bone marrow transplantation in IL10KO mice inhibited transverse aortic constriction–induced cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibrosi</span></strong>s and improved heart function. At the molecular level, IL10 treatment significantly inhibited transforming growth factor-β–induced transdifferentiation and fibrotic signaling in WT BM-FPCs in vitro. Furthermore, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibrosi</span></strong>s-associated microRNA (miRNA) expression was highly upregulated in IL10KO-FPCs compared with WT-FPCs. Polymerase chain reaction–based selective miRNA analysis revealed that transforming growth factor-β–induced enhanced expression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibrosi</span></strong>s-associated miRNAs (miRNA-21, -145, and -208) was significantly inhibited by IL10. Restoration of miRNA-21 levels suppressed the IL10 effects on transforming growth factor-β–induced fibrotic signaling in BM-FPCs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings suggest that IL10 inhibits BM-FPC homing and transdifferentiation to myofibroblasts in pressure-overloaded myocardium.

Blockade of TNFR2 signaling enhances the immunotherapeutic effect of CpG ODN in a mouse model of colon cancer
<p>Through the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">necrosi</span></strong>s factor (TNF) receptor type II (TNFR2), TNF preferentially activates, expands, and promotes the phenotypic stability of CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T (T<sub>reg</sub>) cells. Those T<sub>reg</sub> cells that have a high abundance of TNFR2 have the maximal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immunosuppress</span></strong>ive capacity. We investigated whether targeting TNFR2 could effectively suppress the activity of T<sub>reg</sub> cells and consequently enhance the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. We found that, relative to a suboptimal dose of the immunostimulatory Toll-like receptor 9 ligand CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN), the combination of the suboptimal dose of CpG ODN with the TNFR2-blocking antibody M861 more markedly inhibited the growth of subcutaneously grafted mouse CT26 colon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells. This resulted in markedly fewer TNFR2<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells and more interferon-γ–positive (IFN-γ<sup>+</sup>) CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T lymphocytes infiltrating the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> and improved long-term <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-free survival in the mouse cohort. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-free mice were resistant to rechallenge by the same but not unrelated (4T1 breast cancer) cells. Treatment with the combination of TNFR2-blocking antibody and a CD25-targeted antibody also resulted in enhanced inhibition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> growth in a syngeneic 4T1 mouse model of breast cancer. Thus, the combination of a TNFR2 inhibitor and an immunotherapeutic stimulant may represent a more effective treatment strategy for various cancers.</p>

Potassium shapes antitumor immunity
<p>T cells protect us from infections and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s. Nonetheless, cancers grow, persist, and metastasize, even in the presence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), which include T cells with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cell–killing capabilities. This lack of immune control stems from the functional exhaustion, or hyporesponsiveness, of TILs as a consequence of chronic antigen exposure, poor expression of rejection antigens by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells, hypoxia, lack of nutrients or substrates, and/or other suppressive mechanisms in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> microenvironment (TME). Despite these challenges, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> antigen–specific TILs with stem cell–like behavior can mediate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> destruction after successful immunotherapy, such as immune checkpoint blockade (<i>1</i>). Finding mechanisms that maintain the stemness of TILs may lead to improved cancer immuno<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">therapi</span></strong>es. On page 1417 of this issue, Vodnala <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) identify the concentration of extracellular potassium in the TME as a determinant of the dysfunction and stemness of CD8<sup>+</sup> TILs. This helps explain how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s progress in the presence of T cells that could clear them and suggests new approaches to boost T cell stemness in cancer immunotherapy.</p>

NK cell–mediated cytotoxicity contributes to tumor control by a cytostatic drug combination
<p>Molecularly targeted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">therapi</span></strong>es aim to obstruct cell autonomous programs required for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> growth. We show that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors act in combination to suppress the proliferation of KRAS-mutant lung cancer cells while simultaneously provoking a natural killer (NK) cell surveillance program leading to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cell death. The drug combination, but neither agent alone, promotes retinoblastoma (RB) protein-mediated cellular senescence and activation of the immunomodulatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). SASP components <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">necrosi</span></strong>s factor–α and intercellular adhesion molecule–1 are required for NK cell surveillance of drug-treated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells, which contributes to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> regressions and prolonged survival in a KRAS-mutant lung cancer mouse model.

Why is the flu vaccine so mediocre?
<p>With flu season around the corner in the United States and Europe, the push has begun once again to encourage people to receive their annual shots. But over the past few years, it's become increasingly clear that the level of protection offered by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e varies widely each flu season, from 10% to 60%. And new research has revealed surprising reasons for its lackluster performance. For decades, it appeared that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e had an efficacy of 70% to 90%, but scientists now know that's because they were using a misleading test—replaced in the 1990s—to assess whether it protected people. The traditional explanation for failure also has been revamped. The flu strains selected for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e change each year based on what's in circulation, and scientists long blamed failure on mutations that occur in the circulating viruses in the 6–8 months that pass between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e being manufactured and used. But these "mismatches" sometimes occur in years when there's solid protection, and some years with lots of failure have good matches. It turns out that other forces at work include mutations in the strain selected for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e during the manufacturing process, which grows the virus in eggs. People's prior exposure to influenza also can bias their immune system toward a response that undermines that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e-triggered immunity. And the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e strain selection process itself relies heavily on the ferret <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">animal model</span></strong>, which can mislead, too. There's an increasing call now to improve the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e and organize the research community to more collaboratively try to develop a "universal" flu shot that works against many strains and lasts for many years, if not a lifetime. </p>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
A new and clinically relevant murine model of solid-organ transplant aspergillosis
<p>Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are a major cause of death in organ transplant patients. The murine hydrocortisone-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immunosuppress</span></strong>ion model of pulmonary aspergillosis is commonly used to characterise IFIs in these patients. However, this model does not take into account the effects of calcineurin inhibitors on transplant immunity to IFIs or the fungal calcineurin pathway, which is required for both virulence and antifungal drug resistance. To address these two issues, a new and clinically relevant transplant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immunosuppress</span></strong>ion model of tacrolimus (FK506) and hydrocortisone-associated pulmonary aspergillosis was developed. We first characterised IFIs in 406 patients with a lung transplant. This showed that all of the patients with pulmonary aspergillosis were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immunosuppress</span></strong>ed with calcineurin inhibitors and steroids. Murine pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that an ideal dose of 1 mg/kg/day of FK506 intraperitoneally produced blood trough levels in the human therapeutic range (5–12 ng/ml). There was increased mortality from pulmonary aspergillosis in a transplant-relevant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immunosuppress</span></strong>ion model using both FK506 and hydrocortisone as compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immunosuppress</span></strong>ion using hydrocortisone only. Lung histopathology showed neutrophil invasion and tracheobronchitis that was associated with reduced lung tumour <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">necrosi</span></strong>s factor-α (TNFα), JE (homologue of human MCP-1) and KC (homologue of human IL-8) at 24 hours, but increased lung TNFα, JE and KC at 48 hours when fungal burden was high. Furthermore, FK506 directly impaired fungal killing in alveolar macrophages <i>in vitro</i>, with FK506-mediated inhibition of the radial growth of <i>Aspergillus fumigatus in vitro</i> occurring at the low concentration of 5 ng/ml. Taken together, these findings show that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immunosuppress</span></strong>ive activity of FK506 outweighs its antifungal activity <i>in vivo</i>. These observations demonstrate that FK506 impairs innate immune responses and leads to an incremental increase in susceptibility to IFIs when it is combined with steroids. This new and clinically relevant mouse model of invasive aspergillosis is a valuable addition to the further study of both fungal immunity and antifungal therapy in organ transplantation.</p>

NT-proBNP (N-Terminal pro-B-Type Natriuretic Peptide)-Guided Therapy in Acute Decompensated Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The concept of natriuretic peptide guidance has been extensively studied in patients with chronic heart failure (HF), with only limited success. The effect of NT-proBNP (N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide)-guided therapy in patients with acute decompensated HF using a relative NT-proBNP target has not been investigated. This study aimed to assess whether NT-proBNP-guided therapy of patients with acute decompensated HF using a relative NT-proBNP target would lead to improved outcomes compared with conventional therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial to study the impact of in-hospital guidance for acute decompensated HF treatment by a predefined NT-proBNP target (>30% reduction from admission to discharge) versus conventional treatment. Patients with acute decompensated HF with NT-proBNP levels >1700 ng/L were eligible. After achieving clinical stability, 405 patients were randomized to either NT-proBNP-guided or conventional treatment (1:1). The primary end point was dual: a composite of all-cause mortality and HF readmissions in 180 days and the number of days alive out of the hospital in 180 days. Secondary end points were all-cause mortality within 180 days, HF readmissions within 180 days, and a composite of all-cause mortality and HF readmissions within 90 days.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Significantly more patients in the NT-proBNP-guided therapy group were discharged with an NT-proBNP reduction of >30% (80% versus 64%, <i>P</i>=0.001). Nonetheless, NT-proBNP-guided therapy did not significantly improve the combined event rate for all-cause mortality and HF readmissions (hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.72–1.37; <i>P</i>=0.99) or the median number of days alive outside of the hospital (178 versus 179 days for NT-proBNP versus conventional patients, <i>P</i>=0.39).

The transcription factor MAFK induces EMT and malignant progression of triple-negative breast cancer cells through its target GPNMB
<p>Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is particularly aggressive and difficult to treat. For example, the transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) pathway is implicated in TNBC progression and metastasis, but its opposing role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> suppression in healthy tissues and early-stage lesions makes it a challenging target. Therefore, additional molecular characterization of TNBC may lead to improved patient prognosis by informing the development and optimum use of targeted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">therapi</span></strong>es. We found that musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma (MAF) oncogene family protein K (MAFK), a member of the small MAF family of transcription factors that are induced by the TGF-β pathway, was abundant in human TNBC and aggressive mouse mammary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cell lines. MAFK promoted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>igenic growth and metastasis by 4T1 cells when implanted subcutaneously in mice. Overexpression of MAFK in mouse breast epithelial NMuMG cells induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotypes and promoted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> formation and invasion in mice. MAFK induced the expression of the gene encoding the transmembrane glycoprotein nmb (GPNMB). Similar to MAFK, GPNMB overexpression in NMuMG cells induced EMT, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> formation, and invasion, in mice, whereas knockdown of MAFK in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells before implantation suppressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> growth and progression. <i>MAFK</i> and <i>GPNMB</i> expression correlated with poor prognosis in TNBC patients. These findings suggest that MAFK and its target gene <i>GPNMB</i> play important roles in the malignant progression of TNBC cells, offering potentially new therapeutic targets for TNBC patients.</p>

Tumor metastasis to lymph nodes requires YAP-dependent metabolic adaptation
<p>In cancer patients, metastasis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s to sentinel lymph nodes (LNs) predicts disease progression and often guides treatment decisions. The mechanisms underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> LN metastasis are poorly understood. By using comparative transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses of primary and LN-metastatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s in mice, we found that LN metastasis requires that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells undergo a metabolic shift toward fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Transcriptional coactivator yes-associated protein (YAP) is selectively activated in LN-metastatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s, leading to the up-regulation of genes in the FAO signaling pathway. Pharmacological inhibition of FAO or genetic ablation of YAP suppressed LN metastasis in mice. Several bioactive bile acids accumulated to high levels in the metastatic LNs, and these bile acids activated YAP in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells, likely through the nuclear vitamin D receptor. Inhibition of FAO or YAP may merit exploration as a potential therapeutic strategy for mitigating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> metastasis to LNs.</p>

Facing your fears
<p>Remembering traumatic fearful events is adaptive. However, treating no-longer-threatening situations as dangerous may be maladaptive and lead to anxiety <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ers, including phobias and posttraumatic stress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>er. Central to many forms of therapy designed to tackle these anxiety <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ers is the idea that to overcome fear, one needs to face it. For instance, cognitive behavioral therapy and exposure therapy allow patients to confront the objects or situations that provoke their anxiety in the controlled environment of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">therapi</span></strong>st's office. With repeated exposures, the patients' anxiety levels gradually decline, and the objects or situations that they once feared no longer trouble them. On page 1239 of this issue Khalaf <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) provide a neural mechanism in mice for “facing one's fears.” These findings may inform the development of more effective forms of treatment for anxiety <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ers.</p>

Disorder-induced optical transition from spin Hall to random Rashba effect

Weak <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>er induces a photonic spin Hall effect, observed via quantum weak measurements, whereas strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>er leads to spin-split modes in momentum space, a random optical Rashba effect.

Incorporation of singular topology into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ered structure demonstrates repulsive vortex interaction depending on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>er strength. The photonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ered geometric phase can serve as a platform for the study of different phenomena emerging from complex media involving spin-orbit coupling.</p>

Ethics of maternal vaccination

Maternal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ation reduces the risk of infant infection primarily through the transfer of protective maternal antibodies to the fetus (<i>1</i>). Although a growing number of countries are adopting maternal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e programs against diseases like influenza and pertussis, and there is an increased focus on including pregnant women in trials for new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es, there is little discussion of the ethical underpinnings of maternal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e programs (<i>2</i>).

By contrast, an ethical approach focused on mothers' primary interests in protecting themselves and their children could serve as the basis of the ethical framework that guides <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e policies.</p>

Mechanisms of <i>prickle1a</i> function in zebrafish epilepsy and retinal neurogenesis
<p>Epilepsy is a complex neurological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>er characterized by unprovoked seizures. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">etiolog</span></strong>y is heterogeneous with both genetic and environmental causes. Genes that regulate neurotransmitters and ion channels in the central nervous system have been associated with epilepsy. However, a recent screening in human epilepsy patients identified mutations in the <i>PRICKLE1</i> (<i>PK1</i>) locus, highlighting a potentially novel mechanism underlying seizures. PK1 is a core component of the planar cell polarity network that regulates tissue polarity. Zebrafish studies have shown that Pk1 coordinates cell movement, neuronal migration and axonal outgrowth during embryonic development. Yet how dysfunction of Pk1 relates to epilepsy is unknown. To address the mechanism underlying epileptogenesis, we used zebrafish to characterize Pk1a function and epilepsy-related mutant forms. We show that knockdown of <i>pk1a</i> activity sensitizes zebrafish larva to a convulsant drug. To model defects in the central nervous system, we used the retina and found that <i>pk1a</i> knockdown induces neurite outgrowth defects; yet visual function is maintained. Furthermore, we characterized the functional and biochemical properties of the PK1 mutant forms identified in human patients. Functional analyses demonstrate that the wild-type Pk1a partially suppresses the gene knockdown retinal defects but not the mutant forms. Biochemical analysis reveals increased ubiquitylation of one mutant form and decreased translational efficiency of another mutant form compared with the wild-type Pk1a. Taken together, our results indicate that mutation of human PK1 could lead to defects in neurodevelopment and signal processing, providing insight into seizure predisposition in these patients.</p>

The utility of screening echocardiography hinges on the rate of RHD progression and the ability of penicillin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prophylaxi</span></strong>s to improve outcome. We report the longitudinal outcomes of a cohort of children with latent RHD and identify risk factors for unfavorable outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This was a prospective natural history study conducted under the Ugandan RHD registry.

Bi- and multivariable logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and Cox proportional hazards models, as well, were developed to search for risk factors for unfavorable outcome and compare progression-free survival between those treated and not treated with penicillin.

Polygenic Risk Score Identifies Subgroup With Higher Burden of Atherosclerosis and Greater Relative Benefit From Statin Therapy in the Primary Prevention Setting

However, in analyses of 2 randomized controlled primary prevention trials (ASCOT [Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial–Lipid-Lowering Arm] and JUPITER [Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin]), statin therapy led to a greater relative risk reduction among a subgroup at high genetic risk.

The lncRNA H19 mediates breast cancer cell plasticity during EMT and MET plasticity by differentially sponging miR-200b/c and let-7b
<p>Metastasis is a multistep process by which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells disseminate from their primary site and form secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s at a distant site. The pathophysiological course of metastasis is mediated by the dynamic plasticity of cancer cells, which enables them to shift between epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes through a transcriptionally regulated program termed epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and its reverse process, mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET). Using a mouse model of spontaneous metastatic breast cancer, we investigated the molecular mediators of metastatic competence within a heterogeneous primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> and how these cells then manipulated their epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity during the metastatic process. We isolated cells from the primary mammary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>, the circulation, and metastatic lesions in the lung in TA2 mice and found that the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) H19 mediated EMT and MET by differentially acting as a sponge for the microRNAs miR-200b/c and let-7b. We found that this ability enabled H19 to modulate the expression of the microRNA targets <i>Git2</i> and <i>Cyth3</i>, respectively, which encode regulators of the RAS superfamily member adenosine 5′-diphosphate (ADP) ribosylation factor (ARF), a guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) that promotes cell migration associated with EMT and disseminating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells. Decreasing the abundance of H19 or manipulating that of members in its axis prevented metastasis from grafts in syngeneic mice. Abundance of H19, GIT2, and CYTH3 in patient samples further suggests that H19 might be exploited as a biomarker for metastatic cells within breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s and perhaps as a therapeutic target to prevent metastasis.</p>

PSMA redirects cell survival signaling from the MAPK to the PI3K-AKT pathways to promote the progression of prostate cancer
<p>Increased abundance of the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) on prostate epithelium is a hallmark of advanced metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) and correlates negatively with prognosis. However, direct evidence that PSMA functionally contributes to PCa progression remains elusive. We generated mice bearing PSMA-positive or PSMA-negative PCa by crossing PSMA-deficient mice with transgenic PCa (TRAMP) models, enabling direct assessment of PCa incidence and progression in the presence or absence of PSMA. Compared with PSMA-positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s, PSMA-negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s were smaller, lower-grade, and more apoptotic with fewer blood vessels, consistent with the recognized proangiogenic function of PSMA. Relative to PSMA-positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s lacking PSMA had less than half the abundance of type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R), less activity in the survival pathway mediated by PI3K-AKT signaling, and more activity in the proliferative pathway mediated by MAPK-ERK1/2 signaling. Biochemically, PSMA interacted with the scaffolding protein RACK1, disrupting signaling between the β<sub>1</sub> integrin and IGF-1R complex to the MAPK pathway, enabling activation of the AKT pathway instead. Manipulation of PSMA abundance in PCa cell lines recapitulated this signaling pathway switch. Analysis of published databases indicated that IGF-1R abundance, cell proliferation, and expression of transcripts for antiapoptotic markers positively correlated with PSMA abundance in patients, suggesting that this switch may be relevant to human PCa. Our findings suggest that increase in PSMA in prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s contributes to progression by altering normal signal transduction pathways to drive PCa progression and that enhanced signaling through the IGF-1R/β<sub>1</sub> integrin axis may occur in other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s.</p>

Restoring tumor suppression
<p>Many oncogenes and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> suppressors that are mutated during cancer development act as enzymatic switches that phosphorylate (kinases) or dephosphorylate (phosphatases) substrates. Much attention has focused on therapeutically inhibiting oncogenic kinases that are activated by mutation. However, there has been less focus on targeting phosphatases, despite their importance in cancer development. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> suppressor PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog on chromosome 10) is the most frequently inactivated phosphatase in human cancer (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). The loss of PTEN phosphatase activity increases downstream activity of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)–AKT signaling pathway (<i>3</i>, <i>4</i>). Preclinical studies have shown that targeting the PI3K-AKT pathway reduces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> growth when PTEN is inactivated (<i>5</i>). However, many PTEN mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s are resistant to such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">therapi</span></strong>es. On page 651 of this issue, Lee <i>et al.</i> (<i>6</i>) activate PTEN phosphatase by inhibiting a newly described inhibitory system and thereby reduce PI3K-AKT signaling and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> growth in mice.</p>

High-fructose corn syrup enhances intestinal tumor growth in mice
<p>Excessive consumption of beverages sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is associated with obesity and with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. Whether HFCS contributes directly to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>igenesis is unclear. We investigated the effects of daily oral administration of HFCS in adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) mutant mice, which are predisposed to develop intestinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s. The HFCS-treated mice showed a substantial increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> size and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> grade in the absence of obesity and metabolic syndrome. HFCS increased the concentrations of fructose and glucose in the intestinal lumen and serum, respectively, and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s transported both sugars. Within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s, fructose was converted to fructose-1-phosphate, leading to activation of glycolysis and increased synthesis of fatty acids that support <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> growth. These mouse studies support the hypothesis that the combination of dietary glucose and fructose, even at a moderate dose, can enhance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>igenesis.</p>

A sweeter approach to vaccine design
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es have transformed human health. Yet, guided primarily by empiricism for centuries, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e design ultimately met its match in scourges such as HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria, which continue to plague global health. The elusive search for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es against such diseases has driven researchers of diverse expertise to forgo empirical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ology. Instead, they favor a reductionist approach inspired by how pathogens interact with the immune system, which has evolved to distinguish foreign from self by sensing both physical (e.g, size) and chemical (e.g., foreign molecules) features of pathogens. This has guided the rational design of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es that mimic key pathogen properties, including arraying antigens on particles to increase recognition by antibody-producing B cells (<i>1</i>). However, the mechanisms by which multivalent antigen display on nanoparticles—either synthetic or natural—enhances immunity, and how this may influence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e design principles, remain unresolved. On page 649 of this issue, Tokatlian <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) help fill this knowledge gap by demonstrating that engineering nanoparticles with glycans—sugar molecules—is critical to potentiating antibody responses. This might lead to improved next-generation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es against a wide diversity of pathogens.</p>

Single-cell transcriptomes from human kidneys reveal the cellular identity of renal tumors

Zika rewrites maternal immunization ethics

Rescue of exhausted CD8 T cells by PD-1–targeted therapies is CD28-dependent
<p>Programmed cell death–1 (PD-1)–targeted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">therapi</span></strong>es enhance T cell responses and show efficacy in multiple cancers, but the role of costimulatory molecules in this T cell rescue remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the CD28/B7 costimulatory pathway is essential for effective PD-1 therapy during chronic viral infection. Conditional gene deletion showed a cell-intrinsic requirement of CD28 for CD8 T cell proliferation after PD-1 blockade. B7-costimulation was also necessary for effective PD-1 therapy in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-bearing mice. In addition, we found that CD8 T cells proliferating in blood after PD-1 therapy of lung cancer patients were predominantly CD28-positive. Taken together, these data demonstrate CD28-costimulation requirement for CD8 T cell rescue and suggest an important role for the CD28/B7 pathway in PD-1 therapy of cancer patients.</p>

Tumor aneuploidy correlates with markers of immune evasion and with reduced response to immunotherapy
<p>Immuno<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">therapi</span></strong>es based on immune checkpoint blockade are highly effective in a subset of patients. An ongoing challenge is the identification of biomarkers that predict which patients will benefit from these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">therapi</span></strong>es. Aneuploidy, also known as somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs), is widespread in cancer and is posited to drive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>igenesis. Analyzing 12 human cancer types, we find that, for most, highly aneuploid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s show reduced expression of markers of cytotoxic infiltrating immune cells, especially CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, and increased expression of cell proliferation markers. Different types of SCNAs predict the proliferation and immune signatures, implying distinct underlying mechanisms. Using published data from two clinical trials of immune checkpoint blockade therapy for metastatic melanoma, we found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> aneuploidy inversely correlates with patient survival. Together with other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> characteristics such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> mutational load, aneuploidy may thus help identify patients most likely to respond to immunotherapy.</p>

<i>Rb1</i> and <i>Trp53</i> cooperate to suppress prostate cancer lineage plasticity, metastasis, and antiandrogen resistance
<p>Prostate cancer relapsing from antiandrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">therapi</span></strong>es can exhibit variant histology with altered lineage marker expression, suggesting that lineage plasticity facilitates therapeutic resistance. The mechanisms underlying prostate cancer lineage plasticity are incompletely understood. Studying mouse models, we demonstrate that <i>Rb1</i> loss facilitates lineage plasticity and metastasis of prostate adenocarcinoma initiated by <i>Pten</i> mutation. Additional loss of <i>Trp53</i> causes resistance to antiandrogen therapy. Gene expression profiling indicates that mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s resemble human prostate cancer neuroendocrine variants; both mouse and human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s exhibit increased expression of epigenetic reprogramming factors such as Ezh2 and Sox2.

These findings uncover genetic mutations that enable prostate cancer progression; identify mouse models for studying prostate cancer lineage plasticity; and suggest an epigenetic approach for extending clinical responses to antiandrogen therapy.</p>

Frequency, Predictors, and Impact of Combined Antiplatelet Therapy on Venous Thromboembolism in Patients With Symptomatic Atherosclerosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Observational studies suggest that symptomatic atherosclerosis may be associated with risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Prior randomized studies have demonstrated a significant reduction in recurrent VTE with aspirin monotherapy. Whether VTE risk is associated with more severe symptomatic atherosclerosis and more intensive antiplatelet therapy reduces VTE risk beyond aspirin monotherapy is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>TRA2P-TIMI 50 (Thrombin Receptor Antagonist in Secondary Prevention of Atherothrombotic Ischemic Events–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) (vorapaxar) and PEGASUS-TIMI 54 (Prevention of Cardiovascular Events in Patients With Prior Heart Attack Using Ticagrelor Compared to Placebo on a Background of Aspirin–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 54) (ticagrelor) were blinded, randomized placebo-controlled trials of antiplatelet therapy for the prevention of ischemic events in stable patients with symptomatic atherosclerosis. Two blinded vascular specialists systematically identified symptomatic venous thromboembolic events in both trials.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 47 611 patients with stable vascular disease followed for 3 years in both studies there were 343 VTE events in 301 patients (Kaplan-Meier rate at 3 years, 0.9% for placebo). The risk of VTE was independently associated with age, body mass index, polyvascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and malignancy. The burden of atherosclerosis manifested as an increasing number of symptomatic vascular territories was associated with a graded increase in the 3-year rates of VTE (0.76% for 1, 1.53% for 2, and 2.45% for 3 territories). More intensive antiplatelet therapy (vorapaxar and ticagrelor pooled) significantly reduced the risk of VTE by 29% compared with background antiplatelet therapy, from 0.93% to 0.64% at 3 years (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% confidence interval, 0.56–0.89; <i>P</i>=0.003).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The rate of VTE in patients with atherosclerosis is ≈0.3% per year while on treatment with ≥1 antiplatelet agent, with increased risk independently associated with the number of symptomatic vascular territories.

Association of Statin Dose With Amputation and Survival in Patients With Peripheral Artery Disease

The aim of this study is to determine the effect of statin intensity on PAD outcomes of amputation and mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using an observational cohort study design and a validated algorithm, we identified patients with incident PAD (2003–2014) in the national Veterans Affairs data. Highest statin intensity exposure (high-intensity versus low-to-moderate–intensity versus antiplatelet therapy but no statin use) was determined within 1 year of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of PAD. Outcomes of interest were lower extremity amputations and death. The association of statin intensity with incident amputation and mortality was assessed with Kaplan-Meier plots, Cox proportional hazards modeling, propensity score–matched analysis, and sensitivity and subgroup analyses, as well, to reduce confounding.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In 155 647 patients with incident PAD, more than a quarter (28%) were not on statins. Use of high-intensity statins was lowest in patients with PAD only (6.4%) in comparison with comorbid coronary/carotid disease (18.4%). Incident amputation and mortality risk declined significantly with any statin use in comparison with the antiplatelet therapy–only group. In adjusted Cox models, the high-intensity statin users were associated with lower amputation risk and mortality in comparison with antiplatelet therapy–only users (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.61–0.74 and hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.70–0.77, respectively). Low-to-moderate–intensity statins also had significant reductions in the risk of amputation and mortality (hazard ratio amputation, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.75– 0.86; hazard ratio death, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.81–0.86) in comparison with no statins (antiplatelet therapy only), but effect size was significantly weaker than the high-intensity statins (<i>P</i><0.001).

Efficacy and Safety of the Use of Non–Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants in Patients With Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation and Concomitant Aspirin Therapy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Current guidelines recommend non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) as the first-choice therapy in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation because these drugs have several benefits over the vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). It is unknown whether these benefits remain when NOACs have to be combined with aspirin therapy. To assess the efficacy and safety of NOACs compared with VKAs in patients with atrial fibrillation and concomitant aspirin therapy, we conducted a systematic review and study–based meta-analysis of published randomized controlled trials.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A systematic electronic literature search was done in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL Register of Controlled Trials for studies including published data of patients ≥18 years of age with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, randomized to either VKAs or NOACs, or receiving aspirin therapy at any time during the study that report all-cause stroke or systemic embolism, vascular death, myocardial infarction, major bleeding, or intracranial hemorrhage as an outcome.

Prevention of Stroke with the Addition of Ezetimibe to Statin Therapy in Patients With Acute Coronary Syndrome in IMPROVE-IT (Improved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Patients who experience an acute coronary syndrome are at heightened risk of recurrent ischemic events, including stroke. Ezetimibe improved cardiovascular outcomes when added to statin therapy in patients stabilized after acute coronary syndrome. We investigated the efficacy of the addition of ezetimibe to simvastatin for the prevention of stroke and other adverse cardiovascular events in IMPROVE-IT (Improved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial), with a focus on patients with a stroke before randomization.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients who experienced acute coronary syndrome were randomized to a placebo/simvastatin or ezetimibe/simvastatin regimen and followed for a median of 6 years. Treatment efficacy was assessed for the entire population and by subgroups for the first and total (first and subsequent) events for the end points of stroke of any <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">etiolog</span></strong>y, stroke subtypes, and the primary trial end point at 7 years.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 18 144 patients, 641 (3.5%) experienced at least 1 stroke; most were ischemic (527, 82%). Independent predictors of stroke included prior stroke, older age, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diabetes mellitus</span></strong>, myocardial infarction, and renal dysfunction. There was a nonsignificant reduction in the first event of stroke of any <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">etiolog</span></strong>y (4.2% versus 4.8%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73–1.00; <i>P</i>=0.052) with ezetimibe/simvastatin versus placebo/simvastatin, driven by a significant 21% reduction in ischemic stroke (3.4% versus 4.1%; HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.67–0.94; <i>P</i>=0.008) and a nonsignificant increase in hemorrhagic stroke (0.8% versus 0.6%; HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.93–2.04; <i>P</i>=0.11). Evaluating total events, including the first and all recurrent strokes, ezetimibe/simvastatin reduced stroke of any <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">etiolog</span></strong>y (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.70–0.98; <i>P</i>=0.029) and ischemic stroke (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.63–0.91; <i>P</i>=0.003). Patients who had experienced a stroke prior to randomization were at a higher risk of recurrence and demonstrated an absolute risk reduction of 8.6% for stroke of any <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">etiolog</span></strong>y (10.2% versus 18.8%; number needed to treat=12; HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.38–0.95; <i>P</i>=0.030) and 7.6% for ischemic stroke (8.7% versus 16.3%; number needed to treat=13; HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.31–0.86; <i>P</i>=0.011) with ezetimibe added to simvastatin therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The addition of ezetimibe to simvastatin in patients stabilized after acute coronary syndrome reduces the frequency of ischemic stroke, with a particularly large effect seen in patients with a prior stroke.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Phenotypic Characterization of <i>EIF2AK4</i> Mutation Carriers in a Large Cohort of Patients Diagnosed Clinically With Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare disease with an emerging genetic basis. Heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding the bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 (<i>BMPR2</i>) are the commonest genetic cause of PAH, whereas biallelic mutations in the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 4 gene (<i>EIF2AK4</i>) are described in pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis. Here, we determine the frequency of these mutations and define the genotype-phenotype characteristics in a large cohort of patients diagnosed clinically with PAH.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Whole-genome sequencing was performed on DNA from patients with idiopathic and heritable PAH and with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis recruited to the National Institute of Health Research BioResource–Rare Diseases study. Heterozygous variants in <i>BMPR2</i> and biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> variants with a minor allele frequency of <1:10 000 in control data sets and predicted to be deleterious (by combined annotation-dependent depletion, PolyPhen-2, and <i>sorting intolerant from tolerant</i> predictions) were identified as potentially causal. Phenotype data from the time of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s were also captured.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Eight hundred sixty-four patients with idiopathic or heritable PAH and 16 with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis were recruited. Mutations in <i>BMPR2</i> were identified in 130 patients (14.8%). Biallelic mutations in <i>EIF2AK4</i> were identified in 5 patients with a clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis. Furthermore, 9 patients with a clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of PAH carried biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutations. These patients had a reduced transfer coefficient for carbon monoxide (K<sc>co</sc>; 33% [interquartile range, 30%–35%] predicted) and younger age at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s (29 years; interquartile range, 23–38 years) and more interlobular septal thickening and mediastinal lymphadenopathy on computed tomography of the chest compared with patients with PAH without <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutations. However, radiological assessment alone could not accurately identify biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutation carriers. Patients with PAH with biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutations had a shorter survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutations are found in patients classified clinically as having idiopathic and heritable PAH. These patients cannot be identified reliably by computed tomography, but a low K<sc>co</sc> and a young age at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s suggests the underlying molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s. Genetic testing can identify these misclassified patients, allowing appropriate management and early referral for lung transplantation.</p></sec>

Medical Therapy for Secondary Prevention and Long-Term Outcome in Patients With Myocardial Infarction With Nonobstructive Coronary Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) occurs in 5% to 10% of all patients with myocardial infarction. Clinical trials of secondary prevention treatment in MINOCA patients are lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the associations between treatment with statins, renin-angiotensin system blockers, β-blockers, dual antiplatelet therapy, and long-term cardiovascular events.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This is an observational study of MINOCA patients recorded in the SWEDEHEART registry (the Swedish Web-system for Enhancement and Development of Evidence-based care in Heart disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapy) between July 2003 and June 2013 and followed until December 2013 for outcome events in the Swedish Cause of Death Register and National Patient Register. Of 199 162 myocardial infarction admissions, 9466 consecutive unique patients with MINOCA were identified. Among those, the 9136 patients surviving the first 30 days after discharge constituted the study population. Mean age was 65.3 years, and 61% were women. No patient was lost to follow-up. A stratified propensity score analysis was performed to match treated and untreated groups. The association between treatment and outcome was estimated by comparing between treated and untreated groups by using Cox proportional hazards models. The exposures were treatment at discharge with statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, β-blockers, and dual antiplatelet therapy. The primary end point was major adverse cardiac events defined as all-cause mortality, hospitalization for myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and heart failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>At discharge, 84.5%, 64.1%, 83.4%, and 66.4% of the patients were on statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, β-blockers, and dual antiplatelet therapy, respectively. During the follow-up of a mean of 4.1 years, 2183 (23.9%) patients experienced a major adverse cardiac event. The hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for major adverse cardiac events were 0.77 (0.68–0.87), 0.82 (0.73–0.93), and 0.86 (0.74–1.01) in patients on statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, and β-blockers, respectively. For patients on dual antiplatelet therapy followed for 1 year, the hazard ratio was 0.90 (0.74–1.08).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The results indicate long-term beneficial effects of treatment with statins and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers on outcome in patients with MINOCA, a trend toward a positive effect of β-blocker treatment, and a neutral effect of dual antiplatelet therapy. Properly powered randomized clinical trials to confirm these results are warranted.</p></sec>

Observation of the topological Anderson insulator in disordered atomic wires
<p>Topology and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>er have a rich combined influence on quantum transport. To probe their interplay, we synthesized one-dimensional chiral symmetric wires with controllable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>er via spectroscopic Hamiltonian engineering, based on the laser-driven coupling of discrete momentum states of ultracold atoms. Measuring the bulk evolution of a topological indicator after a sudden quench, we observed the topological Anderson insulator phase, in which added <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>er drives the band structure of a wire from topologically trivial to nontrivial. In addition, we observed the robustness of topologically nontrivial wires to weak <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>er and measured the transition to a trivial phase in the presence of strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>er. Atomic interactions in this quantum simulation platform may enable realizations of strongly interacting topological fluids.</p>

Cancer origins—genetics rules the day
<p>A major goal of cancer research is to identify central molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the development of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s and their response to treatment, with the aim of uncovering key vulnerabilities. Early events in the development of cancer may inform such vulnerabilities (<i>1</i>), but early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s are much more difficult to observe and study in patients than established <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s. Indeed, one of the hardest issues to resolve in early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> development is the relative contributions of the oncogenic driver mutations and the nonpathogenic gene networks expressed in a precancerous cell. On page 91 of this issue, Park <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) investigate the mechanisms of development of neuro endocrine cancer in the lung and the prostate using human epithelial cells in culture. They find that these neuroendocrine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s can arise from non-neuroendocrine epithelial cells, which converge upon reprogramming toward a neuroendocrine fate via a common and specific combination of genetic factors.</p>

Congo rapidly curtails Ebola
<p>An outbreak of Ebola that surfaced in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) on 8 May has petered out and, for the first time, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e may have had a role in containing spread. To date, Ebola has struck 53 people in the DRC's Équateur province, killing 29. Most everyone lived in remote, difficult-to-reach villages, although four cases surfaced in the heavily populated city of Mbandaka, triggering serious concerns of an epidemic exploding. A vigorous, rapid effort to contain spread began immediately, with the DRC's Ministry of Public Health working with international partners to build treatment facilities, conduct surveillance, and trace contacts of cases. On 21 May, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e effort began that focused on creating a "ring" around cases by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ating people they may have come in contact with directly or indirectly. Some 3300 people received the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e, which is still experimental and was given in a clinical trial. But the trial did not have a control group, so it will not be possible to assess the precise role, if any, it played in stopping spread. Then again, no one who received the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e developed the disease as of yet, and researchers noted that simply providing it helped with Ebola education.</p>

Genomic correlates of response to immune checkpoint therapies in clear cell renal cell carcinoma
<p>Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the programmed cell death 1 receptor (PD-1) improve survival in a subset of patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). To identify genomic alterations in ccRCC that correlate with response to anti–PD-1 monotherapy, we performed whole-exome sequencing of metastatic ccRCC from 35 patients. We found that clinical benefit was associated with loss-of-function mutations in the <i>PBRM1</i> gene (<i>P</i> = 0.012), which encodes a subunit of the PBAF switch-sucrose nonfermentable (SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling complex. We confirmed this finding in an independent validation cohort of 63 ccRCC patients treated with PD-1 or PD-L1 (PD-1 ligand) blockade therapy alone or in combination with anti–CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">therapi</span></strong>es (<i>P</i> = 0.0071). Gene-expression analysis of PBAF-deficient ccRCC cell lines and <i>PBRM1</i>-deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s revealed altered transcriptional output in JAK-STAT (Janus kinase–signal transducers and activators of transcription), hypoxia, and immune signaling pathways. <i>PBRM1</i> loss in ccRCC may alter global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-cell expression profiles to influence responsiveness to immune checkpoint therapy.</p>

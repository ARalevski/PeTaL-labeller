Observations of Ejecta Clouds Produced by Impacts onto Saturnâ€™s Rings
<sec><title>Saturn's <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">meteoroid</span></strong> Crash</title><p>During Saturn's equinox in 2009, when the Sun illuminated its rings edge-on, images taken by the Cassini spacecraft showed dust clouds appearing as bright streaks above the rings. Similar streaks were detected in 2005 and 2012 when Cassini observed the C ring at close range. <bold>Tiscareno <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 460) suggest that the cause of each observed feature is likely to be the impact of a stream of recently disrupted material originating from a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">meteoroid</span></strong> impact onto the ring and derive the influx rate of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">meteoroid</span></strong>s at Saturn.</p></sec>

U-Pb constraints on pulsed eruption of the Deccan Traps across the end-Cretaceous mass extinction
<p>Temporal correlation between some continental flood basalt eruptions and mass extinctions has been proposed to indicate causality, with eruptive volatile release driving environmental degradation and extinction. We tested this model for the Deccan Traps flood basalt province, which, along with the Chicxulub <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bolid</span></strong>e impact, is implicated in the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) extinction approximately 66 million years ago. We estimated Deccan eruption rates with uranium-lead (U-Pb) zircon geochronology and resolved four high-volume eruptive periods. According to this model, maximum eruption rates occurred before and after the K-Pg extinction, with one such pulse initiating tens of thousands of years prior to both the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bolid</span></strong>e impact and extinction. These findings support extinction models that incorporate both catastrophic events as drivers of environmental deterioration associated with the K-Pg extinction and its aftermath.</p>

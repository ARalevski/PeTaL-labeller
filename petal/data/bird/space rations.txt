The olfactory neuron AWC promotes avoidance of normally palatable food following chronic dietary restriction
<p>Changes in metabolic state alter foraging behavior and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> preference in animals. Here, I show that normally attractive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> becomes repulsive to <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> if animals are chronically undernourished as a result of alimentary tract defects. This behavioral plasticity is achieved in two ways: increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> leaving and induction of aversive behavior towards <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong>. A particularly strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> avoider is defective in the chitin synthase that makes the pharyngeal lining. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> avoidance induced by underfeeding is mediated by cGMP signaling in the olfactory neurons AWC and AWB, and the gustatory neurons ASJ and ASK. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> avoidance is enhanced by increased population density and is reduced if the animals are unable to correctly interpret their nutritional state as a result of defects in the AMP kinase or TOR/S6kinase pathways. The TGF-β/DBL-1 pathway suppresses <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> avoidance and the cellular basis for this is distinct from its role in aversive olfactory learning of harmful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong>. This study suggests that nutritional state feedback via nutrient sensors, population size and olfactory neurons guides <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> preference in <i>C. elegans</i>.</p>

Sources of Sodium in US Adults From 3 Geographic Regions
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Most US adults consume excess sodium. Knowledge about the dietary sources of sodium intake is critical to the development of effective reduction strategies.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A total of 450 adults were recruited from 3 geographic locations: Birmingham, AL (n=150); Palo Alto, CA (n=150); and the Minneapolis–St. Paul, MN (n=150), metropolitan areas. Equal numbers of women and men from each of 4 race/ethnic groups (blacks, Asians, Hispanics, and non-Hispanic whites) were targeted for recruitment. Four record-assisted 24-hour dietary recalls were collected from each participant with special procedures, which included the collection of duplicate samples of salt added to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> at the table and in home <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> prepa<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ration</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Sodium added to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> outside the home was the leading source of sodium, accounting for more than two thirds (70.9%) of total sodium intake in the sample. Although the proportion of sodium from this source was smaller in some subgroups, it was the leading contributor for all subgroups. Contribution ranged from 66.3% for those with a high school level of education or less to 75.0% for those 18 to 29 years of age. Sodium inherent to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> was the next highest contributor (14.2%), followed by salt added in home <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> prepa<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ration</span></strong> (5.6%) and salt added to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> at the table (4.9%).

Processed foods and food reward
<p>Signals that convey nutritional information from the gut to the brain regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> reinforcement and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> choice (<i>1</i>–<i>4</i>).

Impacts of historical warming on marine fisheries production
<p>Climate change is altering habitats for marine fishes and invertebrates, but the net effect of these changes on potential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> production is unknown. We used temperature-dependent population models to measure the influence of warming on the productivity of 235 populations of 124 species in 38 ecoregions. Some populations responded significantly positively (<i>n</i> = 9 populations) and others responded significantly negatively (<i>n</i> = 19 populations) to warming, with the direction and magnitude of the response explained by ecoregion, taxonomy, life history, and exploitation history. Hindcasts indicate that the maximum sustainable yield of the evaluated populations decreased by 4.1% from 1930 to 2010, with five ecoregions experiencing losses of 15 to 35%. Outcomes of fisheries management—including long-term <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">provis</span></strong>ioning—will be improved by accounting for changing productivity in a warmer ocean.</p>

The role of education interventions in improving economic rationality
<p>Schooling rewards people with labor market returns and nonpecuniary benefits in other realms of life. However, there is no experimental evidence showing that education interventions improve individual economic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ration</span></strong>ality. We examine this hypothesis by studying a randomized 1-year financial support program for education in Malawi that reduced absence and dropout rates and increased scores on a qualification exam of female secondary school students. We measure economic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ration</span></strong>ality 4 years after the intervention by using lab-in-the-field experiments to create scores of consistency with utility maximization that are derived from revealed preference theory. We find that students assigned to the intervention had higher scores of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ration</span></strong>ality. The results remain robust after controlling for changes in cognitive and noncognitive skills. Our results suggest that education enhances the quality of economic decision-making.</p>

Designing river flows to improve food security futures in the Lower Mekong Basin
<p>Rivers provide unrivaled opportunity for clean energy via hydropower, but little is known about the potential impact of dam-building on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> security these rivers provide. In tropical rivers, rainfall drives a periodic flood pulse fueling fish production and delivering nutrition to more than 150 million people worldwide. Hydropower will modulate this flood pulse, thereby threatening <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> security. We identified variance components of the Mekong River flood pulse that predict yield in one of the largest freshwater fisheries in the world. We used these variance components to design an algorithm for a managed hydrograph to explore future yields. This algorithm mimics attributes of discharge variance that drive fishery yield: prolonged low flows followed by a short flood pulse. Designed flows increased yield by a factor of 3.7 relative to historical hydrology. Managing desired components of discharge variance will lead to greater efficiency in the Lower Mekong Basin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> system.</p>

Rapid binge-like eating and body weight gain driven by zona incerta GABA neuron activation
<p>The neuronal substrate for binge eating, which can at times lead to obesity, is not clear. We find that optogenetic stimulation of mouse zona incerta (ZI) γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons or their axonal projections to paraventricular thalamus (PVT) excitatory neurons immediately (in 2 to 3 seconds) evoked binge-like eating. Minimal intermittent stimulation led to body weight gain; ZI GABA neuron ablation reduced weight. ZI stimulation generated 35% of normal 24-hour <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> intake in just 10 minutes. The ZI cells were excited by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> deprivation and the gut hunger signal ghrelin. In contrast, stimulation of excitatory axons from the parasubthalamic nucleus to PVT or direct stimulation of PVT glutamate neurons reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> intake. These data suggest an unexpected robust orexigenic potential for the ZI GABA neurons.</p>

Branch-specific plasticity of a bifunctional dopamine circuit encodes protein hunger
<p>Free-living animals must not only regulate the amount of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> they consume but also choose which types of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> to ingest. The shifting of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> preference driven by nutrient-specific hunger can be essential for survival, yet little is known about the underlying mechanisms. We identified a dopamine circuit that encodes protein-specific hunger in <i>Drosophila</i>. The activity of these neurons increased after substantial protein deprivation. Activation of this circuit simultaneously promoted protein intake and restricted sugar consumption, via signaling to distinct downstream neurons. Protein starvation triggered branch-specific plastic changes in these dopaminergic neurons, thus enabling sustained protein consumption. These studies reveal a crucial circuit mechanism by which animals adjust their dietary strategy to maintain protein homeostasis.</p>

MEK inhibitor trametinib does not prevent the growth of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)–addicted neuroblastomas
<p>Activation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway is implicated in driving the initiation and progression of multiple cancers. Several inhibitors targeting the RAS-MAPK pathway are clinically approved as single- or polyagent therapies for patients with specific types of cancer. One example is the MEK inhibitor trametinib, which is included as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ration</span></strong>al polytherapy strategy for treating EML4-ALK–positive, EGFR-activated, or KRAS-mutant lung cancers and neuroblastomas that also contain activating mutations in the RAS-MAPK pathway. In addition, in neuroblastoma, a heterogeneous disease, relapse cases display an increased rate of mutations in <i>ALK</i>, <i>NRAS</i>, and <i>NF1</i>, leading to increased activation of RAS-MAPK signaling. Co-targeting ALK and the RAS-MAPK pathway is an attractive option, because monotherapies have not yet produced effective results in ALK-addicted neuroblastoma patients. We evaluated the response of neuroblastoma cell lines to MEK-ERK pathway inhibition by trametinib. In contrast to RAS-MAPK pathway-mutated neuroblastoma cell lines, ALK-addicted neuroblastoma cells treated with trametinib showed increased activation (inferred by phosphorylation) of the kinases AKT and ERK5. This feedback response was mediated by the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2–associated protein SIN1, resulting in increased survival and prolife<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ration</span></strong> that depended on AKT signaling. In xenografts in mice, trametinib inhibited the growth of EML4-ALK–positive non–small cell lung cancer and RAS-mutant neuroblastoma but not ALK-addicted neuroblastoma. Thus, our results advise against the seemingly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ration</span></strong>al option of using MEK inhibitors to treat ALK-addicted neuroblastoma.</p>

Cascading impacts of large-carnivore extirpation in an African ecosystem
<p>Populations of the world’s largest carnivores are declining and now occupy mere fractions of their historical ranges. Theory predicts that when apex predators disappear, large herbivores become less fearful, occupy new habitats, and modify those habitats by eating new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> plants. Yet experimental support for this prediction has been difficult to obtain in large-mammal systems. After the extirpation of leopards and African wild dogs from Mozambique’s Gorongosa National Park, forest-dwelling antelopes [bushbuck (<i>Tragelaphus sylvaticus</i>)] expanded into treeless floodplains, where they consumed novel diets and suppressed a common <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> plant [waterwort (<i>Bergia mossambicensis</i>)]. By experimentally simulating predation risk, we demonstrate that this behavior was reversible. Thus, whereas anthropogenic predator extinction disrupted a trophic cascade by enabling rapid differentiation of prey behavior, carnivore resto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ration</span></strong> may just as rapidly reestablish that cascade.</p>

Closure of U.S. <i>Toxoplasma</i> lab draws ire

But on 2 April, after months of protests from animal welfare activists, USDA declared that the 37-year-old program had "reached its maturity" and "achieved" its goals. The Washington, D.C., advocacy group White Coat Waste Project had protested the lab's killing of dozens of cats each year. It used kittens to collect from their feces a form of the parasite that is needed for research and that is only produced in cats. This year, the group persuaded 61 members of Congress to co-sponsor the Kittens in Traumatic Testing Ends Now Act.</p>

Fluorine-programmed nanozipping to tailored nanographenes on rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> surfaces
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ration</span></strong>al synthesis of nanographenes and carbon nanoribbons directly on nonmetallic surfaces has been an elusive goal for a long time. We report that activation of the carbon (C)–fluorine (F) bond is a reliable and versatile tool enabling intramolecular aryl-aryl coupling directly on metal oxide surfaces. A challenging multistep transformation enabled by C–F bond activation led to a dominolike coupling that yielded tailored nanographenes directly on the rutile titania surface. Because of efficient regioselective zipping, we obtained the target nanographenes from flexible precursors. Fluorine positions in the precursor structure unambiguously dictated the running of the “zipping program,” resulting in the rolling up of oligophenylene chains. The high efficiency of the hydrogen fluoride zipping makes our approach attractive for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ration</span></strong>al synthesis of nanographenes and nanoribbons directly on insulating and semiconducting surfaces.</p>

Peanut allergen–specific antibodies go public
<p>Changes in the human environment and activities over the past few decades have caused an epidemic of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> allergies (<i>1</i>). People suffering from allergies often feel that they live on a cliff edge, as the allergens to which they react are potentially fatal (<i>2</i>). For example, tiny amounts of peanut picked up on skin or contaminating other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong>s can be dangerous to peanut-sensitized individuals (<i>2</i>–<i>4</i>). Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies mediate the allergic response. They bind to specific receptors on inflammatory immune cells: mast cells in mucosal tissues lining body surfaces and cavities, and basophils in the circulation. These cells mediate allergic responses triggered by specific antigens (allergens) that are recognized by IgE. B cells expressing IgG antibodies have long served as the paradigm for the development of B cells into antibody-secreting plasma cells in the immune response. Until recently, the far less abundant IgE-expressing B cells have proved to be elusive. On page 1306 of this issue, Croote <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) have analyzed single B cells from six individuals with peanut allergy, which enabled the identification of the natural Ig heavy- and light-chain pairs from IgE-expressing B cells that are responsible for peanut allergy. With this information they produced recombinant antibodies, identified the peanut allergen–specific antibodies, and used site-directed mutagenesis to suppress their activity. The mutated antibodies could be used to treat peanut allergy.</p>

Prolonged milk provisioning in a jumping spider
<p>Lactation is a mammalian attribute, and the few known nonmammal examples have distinctly different modalities. We document here milk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">provis</span></strong>ioning in a jumping spider, which compares functionally and behaviorally to lactation in mammals. The spiderlings ingest nutritious milk droplets secreted from the mother’s epigastric furrow until the subadult stage. Milk is indispensable for offspring survival in the early stages and complements their foraging in later stages. Maternal care, as for some long-lived vertebrates, continues after the offspring reach maturity. Furthermore, a female-biased adult sex ratio is acquired only when the mother is present. These findings demonstrate that mammal-like milk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">provis</span></strong>ioning and parental care for sexually mature offspring have also evolved in invertebrates, encouraging a reevaluation of their occurrence across the animal kingdom, especially in invertebrates.</p>

Programmable protein circuits in living cells
<p>Synthetic protein-level circuits could enable engineering of powerful new cellular behaviors. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ration</span></strong>al protein circuit design would be facilitated by a composable protein-protein regulation system in which individual protein components can regulate one another to create a variety of different circuit architectures. In this study, we show that engineered viral proteases can function as composable protein components, which can together implement a broad variety of circuit-level functions in mammalian cells. In this system, termed CHOMP (circuits of hacked orthogonal modular proteases), input proteases dock with and cleave target proteases to inhibit their function. These components can be connected to generate regulatory cascades, binary logic gates, and dynamic analog signal-processing functions. To demonstrate the utility of this system, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ration</span></strong>ally designed a circuit that induces cell death in response to upstream activators of the Ras oncogene. Because CHOMP circuits can perform complex functions yet be encoded as single transcripts and delivered without genomic integ<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ration</span></strong>, they offer a scalable platform to facilitate protein circuit engineering for biotechnological applications.</p>

Is gastrointestinal plasticity in king quail (<i>Coturnix chinensis</i>) elicited by diet-fibre or diet-energy dilution?
<p>Phenotypic plasticity of organ size allows some animals to manage fluctuations of resource quality or availability. Here, we examined the phenotypic plasticity of the gastrointestinal tract of king quail (<i>Coturnix chinensis</i>) in a diet-fibre manipulation study. Quail were offered either a control low-fibre (high-quality) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> (8.5% neutral-detergent fibre; NDF), or one of two experimental diets of higher fibre contents of 16% NDF (i.e. low-quality <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong>). To examine whether phenotypic plasticity of organ size was associated with the fibre content per se, or as a consequence of diluting the diet energy contents by adding fibre, one of the high-fibre feeds was ‘balanced’ with additional energy to match that of the low-fibre control diet. Total empty dry mass of the gastrointestinal tract was significantly heavier among birds offered the unbalanced high-fibre diet as compared with those offered the control diet, with birds offered the fibrous but energy-balanced diet having guts of intermediate size. The heavier entire-gut mass (dry) of quail offered the unbalanced high-fibre diet was associated mainly with these birds having significantly heavier gizzards. Notably, the larger gizzard in the birds offered the unbalanced high-fibre diet was associated with marked increases in their metabolisability (digestion) of diet fibre. Our findings suggest that the available energy in the diet may be more important for eliciting phenotypic changes in the gut of these herbivorous birds rather than simple physical effects of diet fibre on feed intakes or on muscular compensation to fibrous ingesta.</p>

An increase in minimum metabolic rate and not activity explains field metabolic rate changes in a breeding seabird
<p>The field metabolic rate (FMR) of a free-ranging animal can be considered as the sum of its maintenance costs (minimum metabolic rate, MMR) and additional costs associated with thermoregulation, digestion, production and activity. However, the relationships between FMR and BMR and how they relate to behaviour and extrinsic influences is not clear. In seabirds, FMR has been shown to increase during the breeding season. This is presumed to be the result of an increase in foraging activity, stimulated by increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> demands from growing chicks, but few studies have investigated in detail the factors that underlie these increases. We studied free-ranging Australasian gannets (<i>Morus serrator</i>) throughout their 5 month breeding season, and evaluated FMR, MMR and activity-related metabolic costs on a daily basis using the heart rate method. In addition, we simultaneously recorded behaviour (flying and diving) in the same individuals. FMR increased steadily throughout the breeding season, increasing by 11% from the incubation period to the long chick-brooding period. However, this was not accompanied by either an increase in flying or diving behaviour, or an increase in the energetic costs of activity. Instead, the changes in FMR could be explained exclusively by a progressive increase in MMR. Seasonal changes in MMR could be due to a change in body composition or a decrease in body condition associated with changing the allocation of resources between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">provis</span></strong>ioning adults and growing chicks. Our study highlights the importance of measuring physiological parameters continuously in free-ranging animals in order to understand fully the mechanisms underpinning seasonal changes in physiology and behaviour.</p>

Draft genome sequence of an inbred line of <i>Chenopodium quinoa</i>, an allotetraploid crop with great environmental adaptability and outstanding nutritional properties
<p><i>Chenopodium quinoa</i> Willd. (quinoa) originated from the Andean region of South America, and is a pseudocereal crop of the Amaranthaceae family. Quinoa is emerging as an important crop with the potential to contribute to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> security worldwide and is considered to be an optimal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> source for astronauts, due to its outstanding nutritional profile and ability to tolerate stressful environments. Furthermore, plant pathologists use quinoa as a representative diagnostic host to identify virus species. However, molecular analysis of quinoa is limited by its genetic heterogeneity due to outcrossing and its genome complexity derived from allotetraploidy. To overcome these obstacles, we established the inbred and standard quinoa accession Kd that enables rigorous molecular analysis, and presented the draft genome sequence of Kd, using an optimized combination of high-throughput next gene<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ration</span></strong> sequencing on the Illumina Hiseq 2500 and PacBio RS II sequencers. The <i>de novo</i> genome assembly contained 25 k scaffolds consisting of 1 Gbp with N50 length of 86 kbp. Based on these data, we constructed the free-access Quinoa Genome DataBase (QGDB). Thus, these findings provide insights into the mechanisms underlying agronomically important traits of quinoa and the effect of allotetraploidy on genome evolution.</p>

Long-Chain Monounsaturated Fatty Acids and Incidence of Congestive Heart Failure in 2 Prospective Cohorts
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Decades-old animal experiments suggested that dietary long-chain monounsaturated fatty acids (LCMUFAs) caused cardiotoxicity, leading, for example, development of Canola oil (Canadian oil low in erucic acid) from rapeseed. However, potential cardiotoxicity in humans and contemporary dietary sources of LCMUFAs are unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We prospectively investigated the associations of plasma phospholipid LCMUFAs (20:1, 22:1, and 24:1), assessed as objective biomarkers of exposure, with incidence congestive heart failure in 2 independent cohorts: 3694 older adults (mean age, 75.2±5.2 years) in the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS; 1992–2006) and 3577 middle-aged adults (mean age, 54.1±5.8 years) in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, Minnesota subcohort (ARIC; 1987–2008). We further examined dietary correlates of circulating LCMUFAs in CHS and ARIC and US dietary sources of LCMUFAs in the 2003–2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). In CHS, 997 congestive heart failure events occurred during 39 238 person-years; in ARIC, 330 events congestive heart failure events occurred during 64 438 person-years. After multivariable adjustment, higher levels of 22:1 and 24:1 were positively associated with greater incident congestive heart failure in both CHS and ARIC; hazard ratios were 1.34 (95% confidence interval, 1.02–1.76) and 1.57 (95% confidence interval, 1.11–2.23) for highest versus lowest quintiles of 22:1, respectively, and 1.75 (95% confidence interval, 1.23–2.50) and 1.92 (95% confidence interval, 1.22–3.03) for 24:1, respectively (<i>P</i> for trend ≤0.03 each). A variety of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong>s were related to circulating LCMUFAs in CHS and ARIC, consistent with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> sources of LCMUFAs in NHANES, including fish, poultry, meats, whole grains, and mustard.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Higher circulating levels of 22:1 and 24:1, with apparently diverse dietary sources, were associated with incident congestive heart failure in 2 independent cohorts, suggesting possible cardiotoxicity of LCMUFAs in humans.</p></sec>

Similar specificities of symbiont uptake by adults and larvae in an anemone model system for coral biology
<p>Reef-building corals depend for much of their energy on photosynthesis by symbiotic dinoflagellate algae (genus <i>Symbiodinium</i>) that live within their gastrodermal cells. However, the cellular mechanisms underpinning this ecologically critical symbiosis, including those governing the specificity of symbiont uptake by the host, remain poorly understood, in part because of the difficulties of working with corals in the laboratory. Here, we used the small symbiotic sea anemone <i>Aiptasia</i> as an experimentally tractable model system to analyze the specificity and timing of symbiosis onset in larval and adult animals under controlled laboratory conditions. Using four clonal, axenic <i>Symbiodinium</i> strains, we found no difference in uptake specificity between larvae (even when very young) and adults. Although both compatible and incompatible algal strains were found within the larval guts, only the former appeared to be internalized by gastrodermal cells, and they (but not incompatible algae) proliferated rapidly within the larvae in the absence of detectable exchange with other larvae. Older larvae showed reduced ingestion of both compatible and incompatible algae, and the addition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> failed to promote the uptake of an incompatible algal strain. Thus, <i>Aiptasia</i> adults and larvae appear to have similar mechanisms for discriminating between compatible and incompatible dinoflagellate types prior to phagocytosis by host gastrodermal cells. Whether a particular algal strain is compatible or incompatible appears to be stable during years of axenic culture in the absence of a host. These studies provide a foundation for future analyses of the mechanisms of symbiont-uptake specificity in this emerging model system.</p>

<i>In vivo</i> cranial bone strain and bite force in the agamid lizard <i>Uromastyx geyri</i>
<p><i>In vivo</i> bone strain data are the most direct evidence of deformation and strain regimes in the vertebrate cranium during feeding and can provide important insights into skull morphology. Strain data have been collected during feeding across a wide range of mammals; in contrast, <i>in vivo</i> cranial bone strain data have been collected from few sauropsid taxa. Here we present bone strain data recorded from the jugal of the herbivorous agamid lizard <i>Uromastyx geyri</i> along with simultaneously recorded bite force. Principal and shear strain magnitudes in <i>Uromastyx geyri</i> were lower than cranial bone strains recorded in <i>Alligator mississippiensis</i>, but higher than those reported from herbivorous mammals. Our results suggest that variations in principal strain orientations in the facial skeleton are largely due to differences in feeding behavior and bite location, whereas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> type has little impact on strain orientations. Furthermore, mean principal strain orientations differ between male and female <i>Uromastyx</i> during feeding, potentially because of sexual dimorphism in skull morphology.</p>

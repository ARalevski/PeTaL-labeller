Prospective randomised trial of non-operative <i>versus</i> operative management of olecranon fractures in the elderly
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this prospective randomised controlled trial was to   compare non-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative management for acute isolated   displaced fractures of the olecranon in patients aged ≥ 75 years.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Patients were randomised to either non-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative management or   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative management with either tension-band wiring or fixation   with a plate. They were reviewed at six weeks, three and six months   and one year after the injury. The primary outcome measure was the   Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score at one year.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 19 patients were randomised to non-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative (n =   8) or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative (n = 11; tension-band wiring (n = 9), plate (n =   2)) management. The trial was stopped prematurely as the rate of   complications (nine out of 11, 81.8%) in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative group was   considered to be unacceptable. There was, however, no difference   in the mean DASH scores between the groups at all times. The mean   score was 23 (0 to 59.6) in the non-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative group and 22 (2.5   to 57.8) in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative group, one year after the injury (p =   0.763).

Radiation-Induced DNA Damage in Operators Performing Endovascular Aortic Repair
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Radiation exposure during fluoroscopically guided interventions such as endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) is a growing concern for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ators. This study aimed to measure DNA damage/repair markers in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ators perfoming EVAR.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Expression of the DNA damage/repair marker, γ-H2AX and DNA damage response marker, phosphorylated ataxia telangiectasia mutated (pATM), were quantified in circulating lymphocytes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ators during the peri-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative period of endovascular (infrarenal, branched, and fenestrated) and open aortic repair using flow cytometry. These markers were separately measured in the same <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ators but this time wearing leg lead shielding in addition to upper body protection and compared with those <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ating with unprotected legs. Susceptibility to radiation damage was determined by irradiating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ators’ blood in vitro.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>γ-H2AX and pATM levels increased significantly in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ators immediately after branched endovascular aortic repair/fenestrated endovascular aortic repair (<i>P</i><0.0003 for both). Only pATM levels increased after infrarenal endovascular aortic repair (<i>P</i><0.04). Expression of both markers fell to baseline in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ators after 24 hours (<i>P</i><0.003 for both). There was no change in γ-H2AX or pATM expression after open repair. Leg protection abrogated γ-H2AX and pATM response after branched endovascular aortic repair/fenestrated endovascular aortic repair. The expression of γ-H2AX varied significantly when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ators’ blood was exposed to the same radiation dose in vitro (<i>P</i><0.0001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This is the first study to detect an acute DNA damage response in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ators performing fluoroscopically guided aortic procedures and highlights the protective effect of leg shielding. Defining the relationship between this response and cancer risk may better inform safe levels of chronic low-dose radiation exposure.</p></sec>

The effect of intravenous tranexamic acid on blood loss and early post-operative pain in total shoulder arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the impact of   intravenous tranexamic acid on the reduction of blood loss, transfusion   rate, and early post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative clinical outcome in total shoulder   arthroplasty.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A randomised, placebo-controlled trial which included 54 patients   undergoing unilateral primary stemless anatomical or stemmed reverse   total shoulder arthroplasty was undertaken. Patients received either   100 ml saline (placebo, n = 27), or 100 ml saline together with   1000 mg of tranexamic acid (TXA, n = 27) intravenously prior to   skin incision and during wound closure. Peri-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative blood loss   via an intra-articular drain was recorded and total blood loss was   calculated. The post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative transfusion rate was documented.   Assessment of early clinical parameters included the visual analogue   scale for pain (VAS), documentation of haematoma formation and adverse events.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Mean peri-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative blood drainage (placebo: 170 ml <i>versus</i> TXA:   50 ml, p = 0.001) and calculated mean total blood loss (placebo:   1248.2 ml <i>versus</i> TXA: 871.0 ml, p = 0.009) were   significantly lower in the TXA group. No transfusions were necessary   during the study period in either group. Mean VAS for pain significantly   decreased from pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative (VAS 7) to the early post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative   period (VAS 1.7, p < 0.001). Significant differences regarding   mean post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative pain between placebo (VAS 2.0) and TXA (VAS   1.3) were detected (p = 0.05). The occurrence of haematomas was   significantly more frequent in the placebo (59.3%, n = 16) than   in the TXA group (25.9%, n = 6, p = 0.027). Whereas only mild haematomas   developed in the TXA group, in the placebo group a total of 22.2%   (n = 6) developed either moderate or severe haematomas. No adverse   events associated with administration of TXA occurred.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Intravenous administration of TXA successfully reduced mean peri-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative   blood drainage, total estimated blood loss, pain during the first   post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative days, and haematoma formation in total shoulder arthroplasty.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1073–9.</p></sec>

‘Modern’ distal femoral locking plates allow safe, early weight-bearing with a high rate of union and low rate of failure
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Fractures of the distal femur can be challenging to manage and   are on the increase in the elderly osteoporotic population. Management   with casting or bracing can unacceptably limit a patient’s ability   to bear weight, but historically, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative fixation has been associated   with a high rate of re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation. In this study, we describe the outcomes   of fixation using modern implants within a strategy of early return   to function.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>All patients treated at our centre with lateral distal femoral   locking plates (LDFLP) between 2009 and 2014 were identified. Fracture   classification and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative information including weight-bearing   status, rates of union, re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation, failure of implants and mortality   rate, were recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 127 fractures were identified in 122 patients. The   mean age was 72.8 years (16 to 101) and 92 of the patients (75%)   were female. A consultant performed the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation in 85 of the cases,   (67%) with the remainder performed under direct consultant supervision.   In total 107 patients (84%) were allowed to bear full weight immediately.   The rate of clinical and radiological union was 81/85 (95%) and   only four fractures of 127 (3%) fractures required re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation   for failure of surgery.

Unsatisfactory outcomes following unicompartmental knee arthroplasty in patients with partial thickness cartilage loss
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>While medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is indicated   for patients with full-thickness cartilage loss, it is occasionally   used to treat those with partial-thickness loss. The aim of this   study was to investigate the five-year outcomes in a consecutive   series of UKAs used in patients with partial thickness cartilage   loss in the medial compartment of the knee.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between 2002 and 2014, 94 consecutive UKAs were undertaken in   90 patients with partial thickness cartilage loss and followed up   independently for a mean of six years (1 to 13). These patients   had partial thickness cartilage loss either on both femur and tibia   (13 knees), or on either the femur or the tibia, with full thickness   loss on the other surface of the joint (18 and 63 knees respectively).   Using propensity score analysis, these patients were matched 1:2 based   on age, gender and pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative Oxford Knee Score (OKS) with knees   with full thickness loss on both the femur and tibia. The functional   outcomes, implant survival and incidence of re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ations were assessed   at one, two and five years post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively. A subgroup of 36 knees   in 36 patients with partial thickness cartilage loss, who had pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative   MRI scans, was assessed to identify whether there were any factors   identified on MRI that predicted the outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Knees with partial thickness cartilage loss had significantly   worse functional outcomes at one, two and five years post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively   compared with those with full thickness loss. A quarter of knees   with partial thickness loss had a fair or poor result and a fifth   failed to achieve a clinically significant improvement in OKS from   a baseline of four points or more; double that seen in knees with   full thickness loss. Whilst there was no difference in implant survival between   the groups, the rate of re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation in knees with partial thickness   loss was three times higher. Most of the re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ations (three-quarters),   were arthroscopies for persistent pain.</p><p>Compared with those achieving good or excellent outcomes, patients   with partial thickness cartilage loss who achieved fair or poor   outcomes were younger and had worse pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative functional scores.   However, there were no other differences in the baseline demographics.   MRI findings of full thickness cartilage loss, subchondral oedema,   synovitis or effusion did not provide additional prognostic information.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Medial UKA should be reserved for patients with full thickness   cartilage loss on both the femur and tibia. Whilst some patients   with partial thickness loss achieve a good result we cannot currently   identify which these will be and in this situation MRI is unhelpful   and misleading.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:475–82.</p></sec>

Revision total knee arthroplasty for failed high tibial osteotomy and unicompartmental knee arthroplasty have similar patient-reported outcome measures in a two-year follow-up study
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Little is known about the relative outcomes of revision of unicompartmental   knee arthroplasty (UKA) and high tibial osteotomy (HTO) to total   knee arthroplasty (TKA). The aim of this study is to compare the   outcomes of revision surgery for the two procedures in terms of   complications, re-revision and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs)   at a minimum of two years follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This study was a retrospective review of data from an institutional   arthroplasty registry for cases performed between 2001 and 2014.   A total of 292 patients were identified, of which 217 had a revision   of HTO to TKA, and 75 had revision of UKA to TKA. While mean follow-up   was longer for the HTO group compared with the UKA group, patient   demographics (age, body mass index and Charlson co-morbidity index)   and PROMs (Short Form-36, Oxford Knee Score, Knee Society Score,   both objective and functional) were similar in the two groups prior   to revision surgery. Outcomes included the rate of complications   and    re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation, PROMS and patient-reported satisfaction at six months   and two years post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively.

Equalisation of leg lengths in total hip arthroplasty for patients with Crowe type-IV developmental dysplasia of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>There is no consensus about the best method of achieving equal   leg lengths at total hip arthroplasty (THA) in patients with Crowe   type-IV developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). We reviewed our   experience of a consecutive series of patients who underwent THA   for this indication.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We retrospectively reviewed 78 patients (86 THAs) with Crowe   type-IV DDH, including 64 women and 14 men, with a minimum follow-up   of two years.

Contemporary failure aetiologies of the primary, posterior-stabilised total knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The number of revision total knee arthroplasties (TKA) that are   performed is expected to increase. However, previous reports of   the causes of failure after TKA are limited in that they report   the causes at specific institutions, which are often dependent on   referral patterns. Our aim was to report the most common indications   for re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ations and revisions in a large series of posterior-stabilised   TKAs undertaken at a single institution, excluding referrals from   elsewhere, which may bias the causes of failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 5098 TKAs which were undertaken between 2000 and 2012   were included in the study. Re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ations, revisions with modular   component exchange, and revisions with non-modular component replacement   or removal were identified from the medical records. The mean follow-up   was five years (two to 12).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The Kaplan-Meier ten-year survival without a re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation, modular   component revision and non-modular component revision was 95.7%,   99.3% and 95.3%, respectively. The most common indications for a   re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation were: post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative stiffness (58%), delayed wound healing   (21%), and patellar clunk (11%). The indications for isolated modular   component revision were acute periprosthetic joint infection (PJI)   (64%) and instability (36%). The most common indications for non-modular   component revision were chronic PJI (52%), aseptic loosening (17%), periprosthetic   fracture (10%), and instability (10%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative stiffness remains the most common indication for   re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation after TKA. Infection is the most common indication   for modular and non-modular component revision. Aseptic loosening   was not an uncommon cause of failure, however, it was much less   common than in national registry and non-registry data. Focusing   on posterior-stabilised TKAs initially performed at our institution   allowed for an accurate assessment of the causes of failure in a   contemporary specialty practice.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:647–52.</p></sec>

Intra-operative digital imaging
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aims of this study were to examine the rate at which the   positioning of the acetabular component, leg length discrepancy   and femoral offset are outside an acceptable range in total hip   arthroplasties (THAs) which either do or do not involve the use   of intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative digital imaging.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A retrospective case-control study was undertaken with 50 patients   before and 50 patients after the integration of an intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative   digital imaging system in THA. The demographics of the two groups   were comparable for body mass index, age, laterality and the indication   for surgery. The digital imaging group had more men than the group without.   Surgical data and radiographic parameters, including the inclination   and anteversion of the acetabular component, leg length discrepancy,   and the difference in femoral offset compared with the contralateral   hip were collected and compared, as well as the incidence of altering   the position of a component based on the intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative image.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Digital imaging took a mean of five minutes (2.3 to 14.6) to   perform.

Direct Comparison of 4 Very Early Rule-Out Strategies for Acute Myocardial Infarction Using High-Sensitivity Cardiac Troponin I
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strategi</span></strong>es for very early rule-out of acute myocardial infarction using high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) have been identified. It remains unclear which strategy is most attractive for clinical application.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We prospectively enrolled unselected patients presenting to the emergency department with symptoms suggestive of acute myocardial infarction. The final diagnosis was adjudicated by 2 independent cardio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">logist</span></strong>s. Hs-cTnI levels were measured at presentation and after 1 hour in a blinded fashion. We directly compared all 4 hs-cTnI–based rule-out <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strategi</span></strong>es: limit of detection (LOD, hs-cTnI<2 ng/L), single cutoff (hs-cTnI<5 ng/L), 1-hour algorithm (hs-cTnI<5 ng/L and 1-hour change<2 ng/L), and the 0/1-hour algorithm recommended in the European Society of Cardiology guideline combining LOD and 1-hour algorithm.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 2828 enrolled patients, acute myocardial infarction was the final diagnosis in 451 (16%) patients. The LOD approach ruled out 453 patients (16%) with a sensitivity of 100% (95% confidence interval [CI], 99.2%–100%), the single cutoff 1516 patients (54%) with a sensitivity of 97.1% (95% CI, 95.1%–98.3%), the 1-hour algorithm 1459 patients (52%) with a sensitivity of 98.4% (95% CI, 96.8%–99.2%), and the 0/1-hour algorithm 1463 patients (52%) with a sensitivity of 98.4% (95% CI, 96.8%–99.2%). Predefined subgroup analysis in early presenters (≤2 hours) revealed significantly lower sensitivity (94.2%, interaction <i>P</i>=0.03) of the single cutoff, but not the other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strategi</span></strong>es. Two-year survival was 100% with LOD and 98.1% with the other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strategi</span></strong>es (<i>P</i><0.01 for LOD versus each of the other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strategi</span></strong>es).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>All 4 rule-out <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strategi</span></strong>es balance effectiveness and safety equally well. The single cutoff should not be applied in early presenters, whereas the 3 other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strategi</span></strong>es seem to perform well in this challenging subgroup.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Effect of pre-operative expectations on the outcomes following total shoulder arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims </title><p>Few studies have evaluated the relationship between patients’   pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative expectations and the outcome of orthopaedic procedures.   Our aim was to determine the effect of expectations on the outcome   after primary anatomical total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA). We hypothesised   that patients with greater expectations would have better outcomes. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Patients undergoing primary anatomical TSA completed the Hospital   for Special Surgery’s Shoulder Expectations Survey pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively.   The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES), Shoulder Activity   Scale (SAS), Short-Form-36 (SF-36), and visual analogue scale (VAS)   for pain, fatigue, and general health scores were also collected   pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively and two years post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively. Pearson correlations   were used to assess the relationship between the number of expectations   and the outcomes. Differences in outcomes between those with higher   and lower levels of expectations for each expectation were assessed   by independent samples <i>t</i>-test. Multivariable linear   regression analysis was used to control for potential confounding   factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 67 patients were evaluated two years post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively.   Most parameters of outcome improved significantly from baseline   and most patients were satisfied. A greater number of expectations   was associated with a significantly greater improvement in the ASES   score (p = 0.02). In the multivariable analysis, a greater number   of expectations was an independent predictor of better ASES, VAS   and SF-36 scores, as well as improvements in ASES and VAS pain scores   (p < 0.05). Greater expectations for many specific expectation   questions were significantly associated with better outcomes (p   < 0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>TSA is a successful procedure with significant improvements in   outcome, and greater    pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative expectations are associated with better outcomes. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1190–6.</p></sec>

Activity levels and return to work following total knee arthroplasty in patients under 65 years of age
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Little is known about employment following total knee arthroplasty   (TKA). This study aims to identify factors which predict return   to work following TKA in patients of working age in the United Kingdom.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients & Methods</title><p>We prospectively assessed 289 patients (289 TKAs) aged ≤ 65 years   who underwent TKA between 2010 and 2013. There were 148 women. The   following were recorded pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively: age, gender, body mass   index, social deprivation, comorbidities, indication for surgery,   work status and nature of employment, activity level as assessed by   the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) activity score   and Oxford Knee Score (OKS). The intention of patients to return   to work or to retire was not assessed pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively. At a mean   of 3.4 years (2 to 4) post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively, the return to work status,   OKS, the EuroQol-5 dimensions (EQ-5D) score, UCLA activity score   and Work, Osteoarthritis and joint-Replacement (WORQ) score were   obtained. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of 261 patients (90%) who were working before TKA, 105 (40%)   returned to any job, including 89 (34%) who returned to the same   job at a mean of 13.5 weeks (2 to 104) post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively. A total   of 108 (41%) retired following TKA and 18 remained on welfare. Patients   not working before the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation did not return to work. Median   UCLA scores improved in 125 patients (58%) from 4 (mild activity)   to 6 (moderate activity) (p < 0.001). Significant    (p < 0.05) factors which were predictive of return to any work   included age, heavy or moderate manual work, better post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative   UCLA, OKS and EQ-5D general health scores. Significant predictive   factors of return to the same work included age, heavy or moderate   manual work and post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative OKS. Multivariate analysis confirmed   heavy or moderate manual work and age to independently predict a   return to either any or the same work. All patients aged < 50   years who were working pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively returned to any work as did   60% of those aged between 50 and 54 years, 50% of those aged between   55 and 59 years and 24% those aged between 60 and 65 years. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>If working pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively, patients aged < 50 years invariably   returned to work following TKA, but only half of those aged between   50 to 60 years returned.

Five-year clinical and radiological outcomes in 257 consecutive cementless Oxford medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasties
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Our aim was to examine the clinical and radiographic outcomes   in 257 consecutive Oxford unicompartmental knee arthroplasties (OUKAs)   (238 patients), five years post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A retrospective evaluation was undertaken of patients treated   between April 2008 and October 2010 in a regional centre by two   non-designing surgeons with no previous experience of UKAs. The   Oxford Knee Scores (OKSs) were recorded and fluoroscopically aligned   radiographs were assessed post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively at one and five years.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The median age of the 238 patients was 65.0 years (interquartile   range (IQR) 59.0 to 73.0), the median body mas index was 30.0 (IQR   27.5 to 33.0) and 51.7% were male. There were no intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative   complications. There was a significant improvement in the median   OKS at six weeks (34, IQR 31.0 to 37.0), one year (38, IQR 29.0   to 43.0) and five years (37, IQR 27.0 to 42.0) when compared with   the pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative scores (16, IQR 13.0 to 19.0) (all p = < 0.01).

Pre-operative functional mobility as an independent determinant of inpatient functional recovery after total knee arthroplasty during three periods that coincided with changes in clinical pathways
<sec><title>Aims </title><p>To investigate whether pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative functional mobility is a   determinant of delayed inpatient recovery of activities (IRoA) after   total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in three periods that coincided with   changes in the clinical pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>All patients (n = 682, 73% women, mean age 70 years, standard   deviation 9) scheduled for TKA between 2009 and 2015 were pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively   screened for functional mobility by the Timed-up-and-Go test (TUG)   and De Morton mobility index (DEMMI). The cut-off point for delayed   IRoA was set on the day that 70% of the patients were recovered,   according to the Modified Iowa Levels of Assistance Scale (mILAS)   (a 5-item activity scale).

Spinopelvic mobility and acetabular component position for total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Posterior tilt of the pelvis with sitting provides biological   acetabular opening. Our goal was to study the post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative interaction   of skeletal mobility and sagittal acetabular component position.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This was a radiographic study of 160 hips (151 patients) who   prospectively had lateral spinopelvic hip radiographs for skeletal   and implant measurements. Intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative acetabular component position   was determined according to the pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative spinal mobility. Sagittal   implant measurements of ante-inclination and sacral acetabular angle were   used as surrogate measurements for the risk of impingement, and   intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative acetabular component angles were compared with these.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively, ante-inclination and sacral acetabular angles   were within normal range in 133 hips (83.1%).

Minimally invasive surgery for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to report a retrospective, consecutive   series of patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) who   were treated with posterior minimally invasive surgery (MIS) with   a mean follow-up of two years (<sc>sd</sc> 1.4; 0.9 to 0 3.7). Our   objectives were to measure the correction of the deformity and record   the peri-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative morbidity. Special attention was paid to the   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ating time (ORT), estimated blood loss (EBL), length of stay   (LOS) and further complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We prospectively collected the data of 70 consecutive patients   with AIS treated with MIS using three incisions and a muscle-splitting   approach by a single surgeon between June 2013 and February 2016   and these were retrospectively reviewed. There were eight male and   62 female patients with a mean age of 15 years (<sc>sd</sc> 4.5   ) with a mean body mass index of 19.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (<sc>sd</sc> 5.4).   The curves were classified according to Lenke; 40 curves were type   1, 15 were type 2, three were type 3, two were type 4, eight were   type 5 and two were type 6.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean primary Cobb angle was corrected from 58.9° (<sc>sd</sc> 12.6°)   pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively to 17.7° (<sc>sd</sc> 10.2°) post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively with   a mean correction of 69% (<sc>sd</sc> 20%, p < 0.001). The mean   kyphosis at T5 to T12 increased from 24.2° (<sc>sd</sc> 12.2°) pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively   to 30.1° (<sc>sd</sc> 9.6°,    p < 0.001) post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively.

Five additional complications   occurred in five patients (7.1%): one superficial wound infection,   one suture granuloma and three delayed deep surgical site infections.   The mean ORT was 337.1 mins (<sc>sd</sc> 121.3); the mean EBL was   345.7 ml (<sc>sd</sc> 175.1) and the mean LOS was 4.6 days (<sc>sd</sc> 0.8).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The use of MIS for patients with AIS results in a significant   correction of spinal deformity in both the frontal and sagittal   planes, with a low EBL and a short LOS.

Trends and risk factors for prolonged opioid use after unicompartmental knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate trends in opioid use   after unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA), to identify predictors   of prolonged use and to compare the rates of opioid use after UKA,   total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and total hip arthroplasty (THA).</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We identified 4205 patients who had undergone UKA between 2007   and 2015 from the Humana Inc. administrative claims database. Post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative   opioid use for one year post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively was assessed using the   rates of monthly repeat prescription. These were then compared between   patients with and without a specific variable of interest and with   those of patients who had undergone TKA and THA.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 4205 UKA patients were analysed. Of these, 1362 patients   (32.4%) were users of opioids. Pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative opioid use was the   strongest predictor of prolonged opioid use after UKA. Opioid users   were 1.4 (81.6% <i>versus</i> 57.7%), 3.7 (49.5% <i>versus</i> 13.3%)   and 5.5    (35.8% <i>versus</i> 6.5%) times more likely to be taking   opioids at one, two and three months post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively, respectively   (p < 0.05 for all). Younger age and specific comorbidities such   as anxiety/depression, smoking, back pain and substance abuse were   found to significantly increase the rate of repeat prescription   for opioids after UKA. Overall, UKA patients required significantly   less opioid prescriptions than patients who had undergone THA and TKA.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>One-third of patients who undergo UKA are given opioids in the   three months pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively. Pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative opioid use is the best   predictor of increased repeat prescriptions after UKA.

Mid-term outcomes of 77 modular radial head prostheses
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Radial head arthroplasty (RHA) may be used in the treatment of   non-reconstructable radial head fractures. The aim of this study   was to evaluate the mid-term clinical and radiographic results of   RHA.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between 2002 and 2014, 77 RHAs were implanted in 54 men and 23   women with either acute injuries (54) or with traumatic sequelae   (23) of a fracture of the radial head. Four designs of RHA were   used, including the Guepar (Small Bone Innovations (SBi)/Stryker;   36), Evolutive (Aston Medical; 24), rHead RECON (SBi/Stryker; ten)   or rHead STANDARD (SBi/Stryker; 7) prostheses. The mean follow-up   was 74.0 months (standard deviation (<sc>sd</sc>) 38.6; 24 to 141).   The indication for further surgery, range of movement, mean Mayo   Elbow Performance (MEP) score, quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder   and Hand (quickDASH) score, osteolysis and positioning of the implant   were also assessed according to the design, and acute or delayed   use.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean MEP and quickDASH scores were 90.2 (<sc>sd</sc> 14;   45 to 100), and 14.0 points (<sc>sd</sc> 12; 1.2 to 52.5), respectively. There   were no significant differences between RHA performed in acute or   delayed fashion. There were 30 re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ations (19 with, and 11 without   removal of the implant) during the first three post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative years.   Painful loosening was the primary indication for removal in 14 patients.   Short-stemmed prostheses (16 mm to 22 mm in length) were also associated   with an increased risk of painful loosening (odds ratio 3.54 (1.02   to 12.2), p = 0.045). Radiocapitellar instability was the primary   indication for re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation with retention of the implant (5). The   overall survival of the RHA, free from re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation, was 60.8% (<sc>sd</sc> 5.7%)   at ten years.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Bipolar and press-fit RHA gives unsatisfactory mid-term outcomes   in the treatment of acute fractures of the radial head or their   sequelae. The outcome may vary according to the design of the implant.

A pragmatic randomised controlled trial comparing the efficacy of a femoral nerve block and periarticular infiltration for early pain relief following total knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of a femoral   nerve block and a periarticular infiltration in the management of   early post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative pain after total knee arthroplasty (TKA).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A pragmatic, single centre, two arm parallel group, patient blinded,   randomised controlled trial was undertaken. All patients due for   TKA were eligible. Exclusion criteria included contraindications   to the medications involved in the study and patients with a neurological   abnormality of the lower limb. Patients received either a femoral   nerve block with 75 mg of 0.25% levobupivacaine hydrochloride around   the nerve, or periarticular infiltration with 150 mg of 0.25% levobupivacaine   hydrochloride, 10 mg morphine sulphate, 30 mg ketorolac trometamol   and 0.25 mg of adrenaline all diluted with 0.9% saline to make a   volume of 150 ml.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 264 patients were recruited and data from 230 (88%)   were available for the primary analysis. Intention-to-treat analysis   of the primary outcome measure of a visual analogue score for pain   on the first post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative day, prior to physiotherapy, was similar   in both groups.

Long-term outcomes of cemented <i>versus</i> cementless humeral components in arthroplasty of the shoulder
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>In the initial development of total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA),   the humeral component was usually fixed with cement. Cementless   components were subsequently introduced. The aim of this study was   to compare the long-term outcome of cemented and cementless humeral   components in arthroplasty of the shoulder.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>All patients who underwent primary arthroplasty of the shoulder   at our institution between 1970 and 2012 were included in the study.   There were 4636 patients with 1167 cemented humeral components and   3469 cementless components. Patients with the two types of fixation   were matched for nine different covariates using a propensity score   analysis. A total of 551 well-balanced pairs of patients with cemented   and cementless components were available after matching for comparison   of the outcomes. The clinical outcomes which were analysed included loosening   of the humeral component determined at revision surgery, periprosthetic   fractures, post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative infection and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ating time.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The overall five-, ten-, 15- and 20-year rates of survival were   98.9%, 97.2%, 95.5%, and 94.4%, respectively. Survival without loosening   at 20 years was 98% for cemented components and 92.4% for cementless   components. After propensity score matching including fixation as   determined by the design of the component, humeral loosening was   also found to be significantly higher in the cementless group. Survival   without humeral loosening at 20 years was 98.7% for cemented components   and 91.0% for cementless components. There was no significant difference   in the risk of intra- or post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative fracture. The rate of survival   without deep infection and the mean <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ating time were significantly   higher in the cemented group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Both types of fixation give rates of long-term survival of >   90%. Cemented components have better rates of survival without loosening   but this should be weighed against increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ating time and   the risk of bony destruction of the proximal humerus at the time   of revision of a cemented humeral component.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:666–73.</p></sec>

Radiographic scoring system for the evaluation of stability of cementless acetabular components in the presence of osteolysis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The stability of cementless acetabular components is an important   factor for surgical planning in the treatment of patients with pelvic   osteolysis after total hip arthroplasty (THA). However, the methods   for determining the stability of the acetabular component from pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative   radiographs remain controversial. Our aim was to develop a scoring   system to help in the assessment of the stability of the acetabular   component under these circumstances.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The new scoring system is based on the mechanism of failure of   these components and the location of the osteolytic lesion, according   to the DeLee and Charnley classification. Each zone is evaluated   and scored separately. The sum of the individual scores from the   three zones is reported as a total score with a maximum of 10 points.   The study involved 96 revision procedures which were undertaken   for wear or osteolysis in 91 patients between July 2002 and December   2012. Pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative anteroposterior pelvic radiographs and Judet   views were reviewed. The stability of the acetabular component was   confirmed intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively, it was found that 64 components were well-fixed   and 32 were loose. Mean total scores in the well-fixed and loose   components were 2.9 (0 to 7) and 7.2 (1 to 10), respectively (p   < 0.001). In hips with a low score (0 to 2), the component was   only loose in one of 33 hips (3%). The incidence of loosening increased   with increasing scores: in those with scores of 3 and 4, two of   19 components (10.5%) were loose; in hips with scores of 5 and 6, eight   of 19 components (44.5%) were loose; in hips with scores of 7 or   8, 13 of 17 components (70.6%) were loose; and for hips with scores   of 9 and 10, nine of nine components (100%) were loose. Receiver-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ating-characteristic curve   analysis demonstrated very good accuracy (area under the curve =   0.90, p < 0.001). The optimal cutoff point was a score of ≥ 5   with a sensitivity of 0.79, and a specificity of 0.87.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>There was a strong correlation between the scoring system and   the probability of loosening of a cementless acetabular component.   This scoring system provides a clinically useful tool for pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative   planning, and the evaluation of the outcome of revision surgery   for patients with loosening of a cementless acetabular component   in the presence of osteolysis.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:601–6.</p></sec>

A systematic review of Vancouver B2 and B3 periprosthetic femoral fractures
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the outcomes of Vancouver   type B2 and B3 fractures by performing a systematic review of the   methods of surgical treatment which have been reported.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A systematic search was performed in Ovid MEDLINE, Embase and   the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. For inclusion,   studies required a minimum of ten patients with a Vancouver type   B2 and/or ten patients with a Vancouver type B3 fracture, a minimum   mean follow-up of two years and outcomes which were matched to the type   of fracture. Studies were also required to report the rate of re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation   as an outcome measure. The protocol was registered in the PROSPERO   database. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 22 studies were included based on the eligibility   criteria, including 343 B2 fractures and 167 B3 fractures. The mean   follow-up ranged from 32 months to 74 months. </p><p>Of 343 Vancouver B2 fractures, the treatment in 298 (86.8%) involved   revision arthroplasty and 45 (12.6%) were treated with internal   fixation alone. A total of 37 patients (12.4%) treated with revision   arthroplasty and six (13.3%) treated by internal fixation only underwent   further re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation. </p><p>Of 167 Vancouver B3 fractures, the treatment in 160 (95.8%) involved   revision arthroplasty and eight (4.8%) were treated with internal   fixation without revision. A total of 23 patients (14.4%) treated   with revision arthroplasty and two (28.6%) treated only with internal   fixation required re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>A significant proportion, particularly of B2 fractures, were   treated without revision of the stem. These were associated with   a higher rate of re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation. The treatment of B3 fractures without   revision of the stem resulted in a high rate of re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation. This   demonstrates the importance of careful evaluation and accurate characterisation   of the fracture at the time of presentation to ensure the correct   management. There is a need for improvement in the reporting of   data in case series recording the outcome of the surgical treatment   of periprosthetic fractures. We have suggested a minimum dataset   to improve the quality of data in studies dealing with these fractures.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B(4   Supple B):17–25.</p></sec>

The effect of BMI on peri<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative outcomes in congenital heart disease patients has not been evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A multicenter retrospective cohort study was performed studying patients 10 to 35 years of age undergoing a congenital heart disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Heart Surgery Database between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2015. The primary outcomes were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative mortality and a composite outcome (1 or more of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative mortality, major adverse event, prolonged hospital length of stay, and wound infection/dehiscence). The associations between age- and sex-adjusted BMI percentiles and these outcomes were assessed, with adjustment for patient-level risk factors, with multivariate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">logist</span></strong>ic regression.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 18 337 patients (118 centers), 16% were obese, 15% were overweight, 53% were normal weight, 7% were underweight, and 9% were severely underweight. Observed risks of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative mortality (<i>P</i>=0.04) and composite outcome (<i>P</i><0.0001) were higher in severely underweight and obese subjects. Severely underweight BMI was associated with increased unplanned cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation and re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation for bleeding. Obesity was associated with increased risk of wound infection. In multivariable analysis, the association between BMI and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative mortality was no longer significant. Obese (odds ratio, 1.28; <i>P</i>=0.008), severely underweight (odds ratio, 1.29; <i>P</i><0.0001), and underweight (odds ratio, 1.39; <i>P</i>=0.002) subjects were associated with increased risk of composite outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Obesity and underweight BMI were associated with increased risk of composite adverse outcome independently of other risk factors. Further research is necessary to determine whether BMI represents a modifiable risk factor for peri<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative outcome.</p></sec>

Efficacy and Safety of a Pharmaco-Invasive Strategy With Half-Dose Alteplase Versus Primary Angioplasty in ST-Segment–Elevation Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Timely primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) cannot be offered to all patients with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Pharmaco-invasive (PhI) strategy has been proposed as a valuable alternative for eligible patients with STEMI. We conducted a randomized study to compare the efficacy and safety of a PhI strategy with half-dose fibrinolytic regimen versus PPCI in patients with STEMI.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The EARLY-MYO trial (Early Routine Catheterization After Alteplase Fibrinolysis Versus Primary PCI in Acute ST-Segment–Elevation Myocardial Infarction) was an investigator-initiated, prospective, multicenter, randomized, noninferiority trial comparing a PhI strategy with half-dose alteplase versus PPCI in patients with STEMI 18 to 75 years of age presenting ≤6 hours after symptom onset but with an expected PCI-related delay. The primary end point of the study was complete epicardial and myocardial reperfusion after PCI, defined as thrombolysis in myocardial infarction flow grade 3, thrombolysis in myocardial infarction myocardial perfusion grade 3, and ST-segment resolution ≥70%. We also measured infarct size and left ventricular ejection fraction with cardiac magnetic resonance and recorded 30-day clinical and safety outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 344 patients from 7 centers were randomized to PhI (n=171) or PPCI (n=173). PhI was noninferior (and even superior) to PPCI for the primary end point (34.2% versus 22.8%, <i>P</i> <sub>noninferiority</sub><0.05, <i>P</i><sub>superiority</sub>=0.022), with no significant differences in the frequency of the individual components of the combined end point: thrombolysis in myocardial infarction flow 3 (91.3% versus 89.2%, <i>P</i>=0.580), thrombolysis in myocardial infarction myocardial perfusion grade 3 (65.8% versus 62.9%, <i>P</i>=0.730), and ST-segment resolution ≥70% (50.9% versus 45.5%, <i>P</i>=0.377). Infarct size (23.3%±11.3% versus 25.8%±13.7%, <i>P</i>=0.101) and left ventricular ejection fraction (52.2%±11.0% versus 51.4%±12.0%, <i>P</i>=0.562) were similar in both groups. No significant differences occurred in 30-day rates of total death (0.6% versus 1.2%, <i>P</i>=1.0), reinfarction (0.6% versus 0.6%, <i>P</i>=1.0), heart failure (13.5% versus 16.2%, <i>P</i>=0.545), major bleeding events (0.6% versus 0%, <i>P</i>=0.497), or intracranial hemorrhage (0% versus 0%), but minor bleeding (26.9% versus 11.0%, <i>P</i><0.001) was observed more often in the PhI group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>For patients with STEMI presenting ≤6 hours after symptom onset and with an expected PCI-related delay, a PhI strategy with half-dose alteplase and timely PCI offers more complete epicardial and myocardial reperfusion when compared with PPCI. Adequately powered trials with this reperfusion strategy to assess clinical and safety outcomes are warranted.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

No difference in time-dependent improvement in functional outcome following closing wedge <i>versus</i> opening wedge high tibial osteotomy
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this prospective randomised study was to compare the   time course of clinical improvement during the first two years following   a closing or opening wedge high tibial osteotomy (HTO). It was hypothesised   that there would be no differences in clinical outcome between the   two techniques.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between 2007 and 2013, 70 consecutive patients were randomly   allocated to undergo either a closing or opening wedge HTO.

Factors affecting the rate of surgical site infection in patients after hemiarthroplasty of the hip following a fracture of the neck of the femur
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Surgical site infection can be a devastating complication of   hemiarthroplasty of the hip, when performed in elderly patients   with a displaced fracture of the femoral neck. It results in a prolonged   stay in hospital, a poor outcome and increased costs. Many studies   have identified risk and prognostic factors for deep infection.   However, most have combined the rates of infection following total   hip arthroplasty and internal fixation as well as hemiarthroplasty, despite   the fact that they are different entities. The aim of this study   was to clarify the risk and prognostic factors causing deep infection   after hemiarthroplasty alone.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Data were extracted from a prospective hip fracture database   and completed by retrospective review of the hospital records. A   total of 916 patients undergoing a hemiarthroplasty in two level   II trauma teaching hospitals between 01 January 2011 and    01 May 2016 were included. We analysed the potential peri-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative   risk factors with univariable and multivariable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">logist</span></strong>ic regression   analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 92 patients (10%) had a surgical site infection, and   44 (4.9%) developed a deep infection. After univariable analyses,   the multivariable model showed that the level of experience of the   surgeon measured by the number of hemiarthroplasties performed per   year was a significant prognostic factor (odds ratio (OR) 0.93,   p = 0.042) for the development of an infection. Secondly, the development   of a haematoma (OR 9.6, p < 0.001), a re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation (OR 4.7, p   = 0.004) and an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ating time of < 45 mins (OR 5.1, p = 0.002)   or    > 90 mins (OR 2.7, p = 0.034) were also significant factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>There was a significant association between the experience of   the surgeon and the rate of deep infection.

Pre-operative functional status as a predictor of morbidity and mortality after elective cervical spine surgery
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Patients seeking cervical spine surgery are thought to be increasing   in age, comorbidities and functional debilitation.

Anterior knee pain and evidence of osteoarthritis of the patellofemoral joint should not be considered contraindications to mobile-bearing unicompartmental knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>It is not clear whether anterior knee pain and osteoarthritis   (OA) of the patellofemoral joint (PFJ) are contraindications to   medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA). Our aim was to   investigate the long-term outcome of a consecutive series of patients,   some of whom had anterior knee pain and PFJ OA managed with UKA.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We assessed the ten-year functional outcomes and 15-year implant   survival of 805 knees (677 patients) following medial mobile-bearing   UKA. The intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative status of the PFJ was documented and, with   the exception of bone loss with grooving to the lateral side, neither   the clinical or radiological state of the PFJ nor the presence of   anterior knee pain were considered a contraindication. The impact   of radiographic findings and anterior knee pain was studied in a   subgroup of 100 knees (91 patients).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was no relationship between functional outcomes, at a mean   of ten years, or 15-year implant survival, and pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative anterior   knee pain, or the presence or degree of cartilage loss documented   intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively at the medial patella or trochlea, or radiographic   evidence of OA in the medial side of the PFJ. In 6% of cases there   was full thickness cartilage loss on the lateral side of the patella.   In these cases, the overall ten-year function and 15-year survival   was similar to those without cartilage loss; however they had slightly   more difficulty with descending stairs. Radiographic signs of OA   seen in the lateral part of the PFJ were not associated with a definite   compromise in functional outcome or implant survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Severe damage to the lateral side of the PFJ with bone loss and   grooving remains a contraindication to mobile-bearing UKA. Less   severe damage to the lateral side of the PFJ and damage to the medial   side, however severe, does not compromise the overall function or   survival, so should not be considered to be a contraindication. However,   if a patient does have full thickness cartilage loss on the lateral   side of the PFJ they may have a slight compromise in their ability   to descend stairs. Pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative anterior knee pain also does not   compromise the functional outcome or survival and should not be   considered to be a contraindication.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:632–9</p></sec>

The stability of the hip after the use of a proximal femoral endoprosthesis for oncological indications
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Instability of the hip is the most common mode of failure after   reconstruction with a proximal femoral arthroplasty (PFA) using   an endoprosthesis after excision of a tumour. Small studies report   improved stability with capsular repair of the hip and other techniques,   but these have not been investigated in a large series of patients.   The aim of this study was to evaluate variables associated with   the patient and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation that affect post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative stability.   We hypothesised an association between capsular repair and stability.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>In a retrospective cohort study, we identified 527 adult patients   who were treated with a PFA for tumours. Our data included demographics,   the pathological diagnosis, the amount of resection of the abductor   muscles, the techniques of reconstruction and the characteristics   of the implant. We used regression analysis to compare patients   with and without post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative instability.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 20 patients out of 527 (4%) had instability which   presented at a mean of 35 days (3 to 131) post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively. Capsular   repair was not associated with a reduced rate of instability. Bivariate   analysis showed that a posterolateral surgical approach (odds ratio   (OR) 0.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 0.86) and the type   of implant (p = 0.046) had a significant association with reduced   instability; age > 60 years predicted instability (OR 3.17, 95%   CI 1.00 to 9.98). Multivariate analysis showed age > 60 years (OR   5.09, 95% CI 1.23 to 21.07), female gender (OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.04   to 2.89), a malignant primary bone tumour (OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.06   to 3.95), and benign condition (OR 5.56, 95% CI 1.35 to 22.90),   but not metastatic disease or soft-tissue tumours, predicted instability,   while a posterolateral approach (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.53) was   protective against instability. No instability occurred when a synthetic   graft was used in 70 patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Stability of the hip after PFA is influenced by variables associated   with the patient, the pathology, the surgical technique and the   implant. We did not find an association between capsular repair   and improved stability. Extension of the tumour often dictates surgical   technique; however, our results indicate that PFA using a posterolateral   approach with a hemiarthroplasty and synthetic augment for soft-tissue   repair confers the lowest risk of instability. Patients who are   elderly, female, or with a primary benign or malignant bone tumour   should be counselled about an increased risk of instability.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:531–7.</p></sec>

Risk factors for post-operative periprosthetic fractures following primary total hip arthroplasty with a proximally coated double-tapered cementless femoral component
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to identify patient- and surgery-related   risk factors for sustaining an early periprosthetic fracture following   primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) performed using a double-tapered   cementless femoral component (Bi-Metric femoral stem; Biomet Inc.,   Warsaw, Indiana).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 1598 consecutive hips, in 1441 patients receiving   primary THA between January 2010 and June 2015, were retrospectively   identified. Level of pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative osteoarthritis, femoral Dorr   type and cortical index were recorded. Varus/valgus placement of   the stem and canal fill ratio were recorded post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively.

A total of 48 periprosthetic   fractures (3.0%) were identified during the follow-up and median   time until fracture was 16 days, (interquartile range 10 to 31.5).   Patients with femoral Dorr type C had a 5.2 times increased risk   of post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative periprosthetic fracture compared with type B,   while female patients had a near significant two times increased   risk over time for post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative fracture.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Dorr type C is an independent risk factor for early periprosthetic   fracture, following THA using a double tapered cementless stem such   as the Bi-Metric.

Proximal femoral replacement in contemporary revision total hip arthroplasty for severe femoral bone loss
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Loss or absence of proximal femoral bone in revision total hip   arthroplasty (THA) remains a significant challenge. While the main   indication for the use of proximal femoral replacements (PFRs) is   in the treatment of malignant disease, they have a valuable role   in revision THA for loosening, fracture and infection in patients   with bone loss. Our aim was to determine the clinical outcomes,   implant survivorship, and complications of PFRs used in revision   THA for indications other than malignancy.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A retrospective review of 44 patients who underwent revision   THA using a PFR between 2000 and 2013 was undertaken. Their mean   age was 79 years (53 to 97); 31 (70%) were women. The bone loss   was classified as Paprosky IIIB or IV in all patients. The mean   follow-up was six years (2 to 12), at which time 22 patients had   died and five were lost to follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean Harris Hip Score improved from 42.8 (25.9 to 82.9) pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively   to 68.5 (21.0 to 87.7) post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively (p = 0.0009). A total of   two PFRs had been revised, one for periprosthetic infection eight   years post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively and one for aseptic loosening six years post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively.   The Kaplan-Meier survivorship free of any revision or removal of   an implant was 86% at five years and 66% years at ten years. A total   of 12 patients (27%) had a complication including six with a dislocation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>PFRs provide a useful salvage option for patients, particularly   the elderly with massive proximal femoral bone loss who require   revision THA, with significant clinical improvement. While the survivorship   of the implant is good at five years, dislocation continues to be   the most common complication. The judicious use of larger femoral   heads, dual-mobility constructs, or constrained liners may help   to minimise the risk of dislocation.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:325–9.</p></sec>

Defining modes of failure after joint-preserving surgery of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Joint-preserving surgery of the hip (JPSH) has evolved considerably   and now includes a number of procedures, including arthroscopy,   surgical dislocation, and redirectional osteotomies of the femur   and acetabulum. There are a number of different factors which lead   to failure of JPSH. Consequently, it is of interest to assess the   various modes of failure in order to continue to identify best practice   and the indications for these procedures. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Using a retrospective observational study design, we reviewed   1013 patients who had undergone JPSH by a single surgeon between   2005 and 2015. There were 509 men and 504 women with a mean age   of 39 years (16 to 78). Of the 1013 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ations, 783 were arthroscopies,   122 surgical dislocations, and 108 peri-acetabular osteotomies (PAO).   We analysed the overall failure rates and modes of failure. Re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ations   were categorised into four groups: Mode 1 was arthritis progression   or organ failure leading to total hip arthroplasty (THA); Mode 2   was an Incorrect diagnosis/procedure; Mode 3 resulted from malcorrection   of femur (type A), acetabulum (type B), or labrum (type C) and Mode 4   resulted from an unintended consequence of the initial surgical   intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At a mean follow-up of 2.5 years, there had been 104 re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ations   (10.2%) with a mean patient age of 35.5 years (17 to 64).

Is computer navigation when used in the surgery of iliosacral pelvic bone tumours safer for the patient?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Due to the complex anatomy of the pelvis, limb-sparing resections   of pelvic tumours achieving adequate surgical margins, can often   be difficult. The advent of computer navigation has improved the   precision of resection of these lesions, though there is little   evidence comparing resection with or without the assistance of navigation.</p><p>Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy of navigation-assisted surgery   for the resection of pelvic bone tumours involving the posterior   ilium and sacrum. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Using our prospectively updated institutional database, we conducted   a retrospective case control study of 21 patients who underwent   resection of the posterior ilium and sacrum, for the treatment of   a primary sarcoma of bone, between 1987 and 2015. The resection   was performed with the assistance of navigation in nine patients   and without navigation in 12. We assessed the accuracy of navigation-assisted   surgery, as defined by the surgical margin and how this affects   the rate of local recurrence, the disease-free survival and the   effects on peri-and post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative morbidity. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean age of the patients was 36.4 years (15 to 66). The mean   size of the tumour was 10.9 cm. In the navigation-assisted group,   the margin was wide in two patients (16.7%), marginal in six (66.7%)   and wide-contaminated in one (11.1%) with no intralesional margin.   In the non-navigated-assisted group; the margin was wide in two   patients (16.7%), marginal in five (41.7%), intralesional in three   (25.0%) and wide-contaminated in two (16.7%). Local recurrence occurred   in two patients in the navigation-assisted group (22.2%) and six   in the non-navigation-assisted group (50.0%). The disease-free survival   was significantly better when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ated with navigation-assistance   (p = 0.048). The blood loss and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ating time were less in the   navigated-assisted group, as was the risk of a foot drop post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion </title><p>The introduction of navigation-assisted surgery for the resection   of tumours of the posterior ilium and sacrum has increased the safety   for the patients and allows for a better oncological outcome. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:261–6.</p></sec>

Correcting severe valgus deformity
<p>Valgus knee deformity can present a number of   unique surgical challenges for the total knee arthroplasty (TKA)   surgeon. Understanding the typical patterns of bone and soft-tissue pathology   in the valgus arthritic knee is critical for appropriate surgical   planning. This review aims to provide the knee arthroplasty surgeon   with an understanding of surgical management <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strategi</span></strong>es for the   treatment of valgus knee arthritis.</p><p>Lateral femoral and tibial deficiencies, contracted lateral soft   tissues, attenuated medial soft tissues, and multiplanar deformities   may all be present in the valgus arthritic knee. A number of classifications   have been reported in order to guide surgical management, and a variety   of surgical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strategi</span></strong>es have been described with satisfactory clinical   results. Depending on the severity of the deformity, a variety of   TKA implant designs may be appropriate for use.</p><p>Regardless of an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ating surgeon’s preferred surgical strategy,   adherence to a step-wise approach to deformity correction is advised.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B(1 Supple   A):60–4.</p>

The unsuspected prosthetic joint infection
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Positive cultures are not uncommon in cases of revision total   knee and hip arthroplasty (TKA and THA) for presumed aseptic causes.   The purpose of this study was to assess the incidence of positive   intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative cultures in presumed aseptic revision of TKA and   THA, and to determine whether the presence of intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative positive cultures   results in inferior survival in such cases.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A retrospective cohort study was assembled with 679 patients   undergoing revision knee (340 cases) or hip arthroplasty (339 cases)   for presumed aseptic causes. For all patients three or more separate   intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative cultures were obtained. Patients were diagnosed   with a previously unsuspected prosthetic joint infection (PJI) if two   or more cultures were positive with the same organism. Records were   reviewed for demographic details, pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative laboratory results   and culture results. The primary outcome measure was infection-free   implant survival at two years.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The incidence of unsuspected PJI was 27 out of 340 (7.9%) in   TKA and 41 out of 339 (12.1%) in THA. Following revision TKA, the   rate of infection-free implant survival in patients with an unsuspected   PJI was 88% (95% confidence intervals (CI) 60 to 97) at two years   compared with 98% (95% CI 94 to 99) in patients without PJI (p = 0.001).   After THA, the rate of survival was similar in those with unsuspected   PJI (92% (95% CI 73 to 98) at two years) and those without (94%   (95% CI 89 to 97), p = 0.31).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Following revision of TKA and THA for aseptic diagnoses, around   10% of cases were found to have positive cultures.

Multiple boluses of intravenous tranexamic acid to reduce hidden blood loss and the inflammatory response following enhanced-recovery primary total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy and safety   of multiple boluses of intravenous (IV) tranexamic acid (TXA) on   the hidden blood loss (HBL) and inflammatory response following   primary total hip arthroplasty (THA).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 150 patients were allocated randomly to receive a   single bolus of 20 mg/kg IV TXA before the incision (group A), a   single bolus followed by a second bolus of 1 g IV-TXA three hours   later (group B) or a single bolus followed by two boluses of 1 g   IV-TXA three and six hours later (group C). All patients were treated   using a standard peri-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative enhanced recovery protocol. Primary   outcomes were HBL and the level of haemoglobin (Hb) as well as the   levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) as markers   of inflammation. Secondary outcomes included the length of stay   in hospital and the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean HBL was significantly lower in group C (402.13 ml standard   deviation (<sc>sd)</sc> 225.97) than group A (679.28 ml<sc> sd</sc> 277.16,   p < 0.001) or B (560.62 ml <sc>sd</sc> 295.22, p = 0.010). The   decrease in the level of Hb between the pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative baseline and   the level on the third post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative day was 30.82 g/L (<sc>sd</sc> 6.31   g/L) in group A, 27.16 g/L (<sc>sd</sc> 6.83) in group B and 21.98   g/L (<sc>sd</sc> 3.72) in group C. This decrease differed significantly   among the three groups (p < 0.01). The mean level of CRP was   significantly lower in group C than in the other two groups on the   second (p ≤ 0.034) and third post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative days (p ≤ 0.014). The   levels of IL-6 were significantly lower in group C than group A   on the first three post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative days (p = 0.023).

<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aims of this study were to evaluate the clinical and radiological   outcomes of the Universal-2 total wrist arthroplasty (TWA) in patients   with rheumatoid arthritis.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This was a retrospective review of all 95 Universal-2 TWAs which   were performed in our institution between 2003 to 2012 in patients   with rheumatoid arthritis. A total of six patients were lost to   follow-up and two died of unrelated causes. A total of ten patients   had bilateral procedures. Accordingly, 75 patients (85 TWAs) were   included in the study. There were 59 women and 16 men with a mean   age of 59 years (26 to 86). The mean follow-up was 53 months (24   to 120). Clinical assessment involved recording pain on a visual   analogue score, range of movement, grip strength, the Quick Disabilities   of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) and Wrightington wrist scores.

Diagnostic Accuracy of the Aortic Dissection Detection Risk Score Plus D-Dimer for Acute Aortic Syndromes
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Acute aortic syndromes (AASs) are rare and severe cardiovascular emergencies with unspecific symptoms. For AASs, both misdiagnosis and overtesting are key concerns, and standardized diagnostic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strategi</span></strong>es may help physicians to balance these risks. D-dimer (DD) is highly sensitive for AAS but is inadequate as a stand-alone test. Integration of pretest probability assessment with DD testing is feasible, but the safety and efficiency of such a diagnostic strategy are currently unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a multicenter prospective observational study involving 6 hospitals in 4 countries from 2014 to 2016, consecutive outpatients were eligible if they had ≥1 of the following: chest/abdominal/back pain, syncope, perfusion deficit, and if AAS was in the differential diagnosis. The tool for pretest probability assessment was the aortic dissection detection risk score (ADD-RS, 0–3) per current guidelines. DD was considered negative (DD−) if <500 ng/mL. Final case adjudication was based on conclusive diagnostic imaging, autopsy, surgery, or 14-day follow-up. Outcomes were the failure rate and efficiency of a diagnostic strategy for ruling out AAS in patients with ADD-RS=0/DD− or ADD-RS ≤1/DD−.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 1850 patients were analyzed. Of these, 438 patients (24%) had ADD-RS=0, 1071 patients (58%) had ADD-RS=1, and 341 patients (18%) had ADD-RS >1. Two hundred forty-one patients (13%) had AAS: 125 had type A aortic dissection, 53 had type B aortic dissection, 35 had intramural aortic hematoma, 18 had aortic rupture, and 10 had penetrating aortic ulcer. A positive DD test result had an overall sensitivity of 96.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 93.6–98.6) and a specificity of 64% (95% CI, 61.6–66.4) for the diagnosis of AAS; 8 patients with AAS had DD−. In 294 patients with ADD-RS=0/DD−, 1 case of AAS was observed. This yielded a failure rate of 0.3% (95% CI, 0.1–1.9) and an efficiency of 15.9% (95% CI, 14.3–17.6) for the ADD-RS=0/DD− strategy. In 924 patients with ADD-RS ≤1/DD−, 3 cases of AAS were observed. This yielded a failure rate of 0.3% (95% CI, 0.1–1) and an efficiency of 49.9% (95% CI, 47.7–52.2) for the ADD-RS ≤1/DD− strategy.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Integration of ADD-RS (either ADD-RS=0 or ADD-RS ≤1) with DD may be considered to standardize diagnostic rule out of AAS.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

High On-Treatment Platelet Reactivity as a Risk Factor for Secondary Prevention After Coronary Stent Revascularization
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Individualizing antiplatelet therapy after platelet function testing did not improve outcome after coronary stenting in the Assessment by a Double Randomization of a Conventional Antiplatelet Strategy Versus a Monitoring-Guided Strategy for Drug-Eluting Stent Implantation and of Treatment Interruption Versus Continuation One Year After Stenting (ARCTIC) study. Whether results are different during the phase of secondary prevention starting after hospital discharge, when periprocedural events have been excluded, is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>In ARCTIC, 2440 patients were randomized before coronary stenting to a strategy of platelet function monitoring (VerifyNow P2Y<sub>12</sub>/aspirin point-of-care assay) with drug adjustment in suboptimal responders to antiplatelet therapy or to a conventional strategy without monitoring and without drug or dose changes. We performed a landmark analysis starting at the time of hospital discharge evaluating the primary end point of death, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, stroke, or urgent revascularization through 1 year. After discharge, the primary end point occurred in 8.6% of patients in the monitoring arm and 7.9% in the conventional arm (hazard ratio, 1.105; 95% confidence interval, 0.835–1.461; <i>P</i>=0.48). Stent thrombosis or urgent revascularization occurred in 4.4% and 4.5% in the monitoring and conventional arms, respectively (<i>P</i>=0.99). There was no difference for any of the other ischemic end points. Major bleeding event rates were 1.8% in the monitoring arm and 2.8% in the conventional arm (<i>P</i>=0.11), whereas major or minor bleeding event rates were 2.3% and 3.4%, respectively (<i>P</i>=0.10).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Detection of platelet hyper-reactivity by platelet function testing in patients undergoing coronary stenting with further therapeutic adjustment does not reduce ischemic recurrences after intervention.

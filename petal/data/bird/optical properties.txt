Light Sheet Microscopy Imaging of Light Absorption and Photosynthesis Distribution in Plant Tissue
<p>In vivo variable chlorophyll fluorescence measurements of photosystem II (PSII) quantum yields in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>ally dense systems are complicated by steep tissue light gradients due to scattering and <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong></span></strong>ion. Consequently, externally measured effective PSII quantum yields may be composed of signals derived from cells differentially exposed to actinic light, where cells located deeper inside tissues receive lower ir<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radianc</span></strong>e than cells closer to the surface and can display distinct photophysiological status. We demonstrate how measured distributions of PSII quantum yields in plant tissue change under natural tissue light gradients as compared with conventionally measured quantum yields with even exposure to actinic light. This was achieved by applying actinic ir<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radianc</span></strong>e perpendicular to one side of thallus cross sections of the aquatic macrophyte <i>Fucus vesiculosus</i> with laser light sheets of defined spectral composition, while imaging variable chlorophyll fluorescence from cross sections with a microscope-mounted pulse amplitude-modulated imaging system. We show that quantum yields are highly affected by light gradients and that traditional surface-based variable chlorophyll fluorescence measurements result in substantial underestimations and/or overestimations, depending on incident actinic ir<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radianc</span></strong>e. We present a method for using chlorophyll fluorescence profiles in combination with integrating sphere measurements of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ance and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmitt</span></strong>ance to calculate depth-resolved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong></span></strong>ion profiles, which can be used to correct apparent PSII electron transport rates to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s absorbed by PSII. <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong></span></strong>ion profiles of the investigated aquatic macrophyte were different in shape from what is typically observed in terrestrial leaves, and based on this finding, we discuss strategies for optimizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong></span></strong>ion via modulation of the structural organization of phytoelements according to in situ light environments.</p>

Observation of three-photon bound states in a quantum nonlinear medium
<p>Bound states of massive particles, such as nuclei, atoms, or molecules, constitute the bulk of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visibl</span></strong>e world around us. By contrast, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s typically only interact weakly. We report the observation of traveling three-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> bound states in a quantum nonlinear medium where the interactions between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s are mediated by atomic Rydberg states. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> correlation and conditional phase measurements reveal the distinct bunching and phase features associated with three-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> and two-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> bound states. Such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic trimers and dimers possess shape-preserving wave functions that depend on the constituent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> number. The observed bunching and strongly nonlinear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al phase are described by an effective field theory of Rydberg-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> interactions.

Deetiolation Enhances Phototropism by Modulating NON-PHOTOTROPIC HYPOCOTYL3 Phosphorylation Status
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>in (phot) receptor kinases play important roles in promoting plant growth by controlling light-capturing processes, such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>ism. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>ism is mediated through the action of NON-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>IC HYPOCOTYL3 (NPH3), which is dephosphorylated following phot activation. However, the functional significance of this early signaling event remains unclear. Here, we show that the onset of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>ism in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dark</span></strong>-grown (etiolated) seedlings of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) is enhanced by greening (deetiolation). Red and blue light were equally effective in promoting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>ism in Arabidopsis, consistent with our observations that deetiolation by phytochrome or cryptochrome was sufficient to enhance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>ism. Increased responsiveness did not result from an enhanced sensitivity to the phytohormone auxin, nor does it involve the phot-interacting protein, ROOT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>ISM2. Instead, deetiolated seedlings showed attenuated levels of NPH3 dephosphorylation and diminished relocalization of NPH3 from the plasma membrane during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>ism. Likewise, etiolated seedlings that lack the PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTORS (PIFs) PIF1, PIF3, PIF4, and PIF5 displayed reduced NPH3 dephosphorylation and enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>ism, consistent with their constitutive photomorphogenic phenotype in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dark</span></strong>ness. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>ic enhancement could also be achieved in etiolated seedlings by lowering the light intensity to diminish NPH3 dephosphorylation. Thus, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>ism is enhanced following deetiolation through the modulation of a phosphorylation rheostat, which in turn sustains the activity of NPH3. We propose that this dynamic mode of regulation enables young seedlings to maximize their establishment under changing light conditions, depending on their photoautotrophic capacity.</p>

Molecular Mechanisms Preventing Senescence in Response to Prolonged Darkness in a Desiccation-Tolerant Plant
<p>The desiccation-tolerant plant <i>Haberlea rhodopensis</i> can withstand months of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dark</span></strong>ness without any <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visibl</span></strong>e senescence. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of this adaptation to prolonged (30 d) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dark</span></strong>ness and subsequent return to light. <i>H. rhodopensis</i> plants remained green and viable throughout the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dark</span></strong> treatment. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dark</span></strong>ness regulated several transcription factor (TF) genes. Stress- and autophagy-related TFs such as <i>ERF8</i>, <i>HSFA2b</i>, <i>RD26</i>, <i>TGA1</i>, and <i>WRKY33</i> were up-regulated, while chloroplast- and flowering-related TFs such as <i>ATH1</i>, <i>COL2</i>, <i>COL4</i>, <i>RL1</i>, and <i>PTAC7</i> were repressed. <i>PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR4</i>, a negative regulator of photomorphogenesis and promoter of senescence, also was down-regulated. In response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dark</span></strong>ness, most of the photosynthesis- and photorespiratory-related genes were strongly down-regulated, while genes related to autophagy were up-regulated. This occurred concomitant with the induction of SUCROSE NON-FERMENTING1-RELATED PROTEIN KINASES (SnRK1) signaling pathway genes, which regulate responses to stress-induced starvation and autophagy. Most of the genes associated with chlorophyll catabolism, which are induced by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dark</span></strong>ness in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dark</span></strong>-senescing species, were either unregulated (<i>PHEOPHORBIDE A OXYGENASE, PAO; RED CHLOROPHYLL CATABOLITE REDUCTASE, RCCR</i>) or repressed (<i>STAY GREEN-LIKE</i>, <i>PHEOPHYTINASE</i>, and <i>NON-YELLOW COLORING1</i>). Metabolite profiling revealed increases in the levels of many amino acids in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dark</span></strong>ness, suggesting increased protein degradation. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dark</span></strong>ness, levels of the chloroplastic lipids digalactosyldiacylglycerol, monogalactosyldiacylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, and sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol decreased, while those of storage triacylglycerols increased, suggesting degradation of chloroplast membrane lipids and their conversion to triacylglycerols for use as energy and carbon sources. Collectively, these data show a coordinated response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dark</span></strong>ness, including repression of photosynthetic, photorespiratory, flowering, and chlorophyll catabolic genes, induction of autophagy and SnRK1 pathways, and metabolic reconfigurations that enable survival under prolonged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dark</span></strong>ness.</p>

A single-photon switch and transistor enabled by a solid-state quantum memory

However, the deterministic control of an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al signal with a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> requires strong interactions with a quantum memory, which has been challenging to achieve in a solid-state platform.

Deterministic generation of a cluster state of entangled photons
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic cluster states are a resource for quantum computation based solely on single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> measurements.

Gastrointestinal and renal responses to variable water intake in whitebellied sunbirds and New Holland honeyeaters
<p>Nectarivores face a constant challenge in terms of water balance, experiencing water loading or dehydration when switching between food plants or between feeding and fasting. To understand how whitebellied sunbirds and New Holland honeyeaters meet the challenges of varying preformed water load, we used the elimination of intramuscular-injected [<sup>14</sup>C]-<sc>l</sc>-glucose and <sup>3</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O to quantify intestinal and renal water handling on diets varying in sugar concentration. Both sunbirds and honeyeaters showed significant modulation of intestinal water <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong></span></strong>ion, allowing excess water to be shunted through the intestine when on dilute diets. Despite reducing their fractional water <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong></span></strong>ion, both species showed linear increases in water flux and fractional body water turnover as water intake increased (both afternoon and morning), suggesting that the modulation of fractional water <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong></span></strong>ion was not sufficient to completely offset dietary water loads. In both species, glomerular filtration rate was independent of water gain (but was higher for the afternoon), as was renal fractional water re<strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong></span></strong>ion (measured in the afternoon). During the natural overnight fast, both sunbirds and honeyeaters arrested whole kidney function. Evaporative water loss in sunbirds was variable but correlated with water gain. Both sunbirds and honeyeaters appear to modulate intestinal water <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong></span></strong>ion as an important component of water regulation to help deal with massive preformed water loads. Shutting down glomerular filtration rate during the overnight fast is another way of saving energy for osmoregulatory function. Birds maintain osmotic balance on diets varying markedly in preformed water load by varying both intestinal water <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong></span></strong>ion and excretion through the intestine and kidneys.</p>

Carbon dynamics of <i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i> seedlings under drought and complete darkness
<p>Carbon (C) storage is considered a key component to plant survival under drought and shade, although the combined effects of these factors on survival remain poorly understood. We investigated how drought and shade alter the C dynamics and survival of tree seedlings, and whether drought limits the access to or usage of stored C. We experimentally applied two levels of soil humidity (well-watered versus drought, the latter induced by dry-down) and light availability (light versus complete <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dark</span></strong>ness) on 1-year-old seedlings of <i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i> L. for 3 months. We quantified the survival, biomass, growth rate and non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) of seedlings at their time of death or at the end of the experiment for those that survived. We found that the soil dried out faster when drought was combined with light than when it was combined with complete <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dark</span></strong>ness. Seedlings subjected to both drought and light showed reduced growth and reached 100% mortality earlier than any other treatment, with the highest NSC concentrations at the time of death. Seedlings exposed to both drought and complete <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dark</span></strong>ness died significantly earlier than seedlings exposed to complete <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dark</span></strong>ness only, but had similar NSC concentrations at time of their death, suggesting that drought accelerated the use of stored C under complete <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dark</span></strong>ness. Complete <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dark</span></strong>ness significantly reduced seedling growth and whole-plant NSC concentrations regardless of soil humidity, while root NSC concentrations were significantly more reduced when complete <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dark</span></strong>ness was combined with drought conditions. Thus, the C dynamics in <i>A. pseudoplatanus</i> seedlings under complete <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dark</span></strong>ness was not hindered by drought, i.e., the access and use of stored C was not limited by drought. The contrasting growth and C storage responses driven by drought under light versus complete <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dark</span></strong>ness are consistent with a key role of the drought progression in the C dynamics of trees.</p>

A <i>LIMA1</i> variant promotes low plasma LDL cholesterol and decreases intestinal cholesterol absorption

A topological quantum optics interface
<p>The application of topology in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>s has led to a new paradigm in developing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic devices with robust <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es against disorder. Although considerable progress on topological phenomena has been achieved in the classical domain, the realization of strong light-matter coupling in the quantum domain remains unexplored. We demonstrate a strong interface between single quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emitt</span></strong>ers and topological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic states. Our approach creates robust counterpropagating edge states at the boundary of two distinct topological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic crystals. We demonstrate the chiral emission of a quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emitt</span></strong>er into these modes and establish their robustness against sharp bends. This approach may enable the development of quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>s devices with built-in protection, with potential applications in quantum simulation and sensing.</p>

Electron optics with p-n junctions in ballistic graphene
<p>Electrons <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmitt</span></strong>ed across a ballistic semiconductor junction are expected to undergo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">refract</span></strong>ion, analogous to light rays across an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al boundary. In graphene, the linear dispersion and zero-gap band structure admit highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transpar</span></strong>ent p-n junctions by simple electrostatic gating. Here, we employ transverse magnetic focusing to probe the propagation of carriers across an electrostatically defined graphene junction. We find agreement with the predicted Snell’s law for electrons, including the observation of both positive and negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">refract</span></strong>ion. Resonant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion across the p-n junction provides a direct measurement of the angle-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coeffici</span></strong>ent.

Chloroplast Ca<sup>2+</sup> Fluxes into and across Thylakoids Revealed by Thylakoid-Targeted Aequorin Probes
<p>Chloroplasts require a fine-tuned control of their internal Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, which is crucial for many aspects of photosynthesis and for other chloroplast-localized processes. Increasing evidence suggests that calcium regulation within chloroplasts also may influence Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathways in the cytosol. To investigate the involvement of thylakoids in Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis and in the modulation of chloroplast Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in vivo, we targeted the bio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lumin</span></strong>escent Ca<sup>2+</sup> reporter aequorin as a YFP fusion to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lumen</span></strong> and the stromal surface of thylakoids in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Thylakoid localization of aequorin-based probes in stably transformed lines was confirmed by confocal microscopy, immunogold labeling, and biochemical analyses. In resting conditions in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dark</span></strong>, free Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in the thylakoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lumen</span></strong> were maintained at about 0.5 μ<sc>m</sc>, which was a 3- to 5-fold higher concentration than in the stroma. Monitoring of chloroplast Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in different intrachloroplast subcompartments (stroma, thylakoid membrane, and thylakoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lumen</span></strong>) revealed the occurrence of stimulus-specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, characterized by unique kinetic parameters. Oxidative and salt stresses initiated pronounced free Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes in the thylakoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lumen</span></strong>. Localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases also were observed on the thylakoid membrane surface, mirroring transient Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes observed for the bulk stroma, but with specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics. Moreover, evidence was obtained for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dark</span></strong>-stimulated intrathylakoid Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes, suggesting a new scenario for light-to-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dark</span></strong>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluxes inside chloroplasts. Hence, thylakoid-targeted aequorin reporters can provide new insights into chloroplast Ca<sup>2+</sup> storage and signal transduction. These probes represent novel tools with which to investigate the role of thylakoids in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling networks within chloroplasts and plant cells.</p>

Single-molecule diffusion-based estimation of ligand effects on G protein–coupled receptors
<p>G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) are major drug targets. Developing a method to measure the activities of GPCRs is essential for pharmacology and drug screening. However, it is difficult to measure the effects of a drug by monitoring the receptor on the cell surface; thus, changes in the concentrations of downstream signaling molecules, which depend on the signaling pathway selectivity of the receptor, are often used as an index of receptor activity. We show that single-molecule imaging analysis provides an alternative method for assessing the effects of ligands on GPCRs. Using total internal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ion fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM), we monitored the dynamics of the diffusion of metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 (mGluR3), a class C GPCR, under various ligand conditions. Our single-molecule tracking analysis demonstrated that increases and decreases in the average diffusion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coeffici</span></strong>ent of mGluR3 quantitatively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ed the ligand-dependent inactivation and activation of receptors, respectively. Through experiments with inhibitors and dual-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong> single-molecule imaging analysis, we found that the diffusion of receptor molecules was altered by common physiological events associated with GPCRs, including G protein binding, and receptor accumulation in clathrin-coated pits. We also confirmed that agonist also decreased the average diffusion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coeffici</span></strong>ent for class A and B GPCRs, demonstrating that this parameter is a good index for estimating ligand effects on many GPCRs regardless of their phylogenetic groups, the chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es of the ligands, or G protein–coupling selectivity.</p>

Spectrally resolved helium absorption from the extended atmosphere of a warm Neptune-mass exoplanet

A Connection between Lysine and Serotonin Metabolism in Rice Endosperm
<p>Cereal endosperms produce a vast array of metabolites, including the essential amino acid lysine (Lys). Enhanced accumulation of Lys has been achieved via metabolic engineering in cereals, but the potential connection between metabolic engineering and Lys fortification is unclear. In mature seeds of engineered High Free Lysine (HFL) rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), the endosperm takes on a characteristic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dark</span></strong>-brown appearance. In this study, we use an integrated metabolomic and transcriptomic approach combined with functional validation to elucidate the key metabolites responsible for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dark</span></strong>-brown phenotype. Importantly, we found that serotonin biosynthesis was elevated dramatically and closely linked with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dark</span></strong>-brown endosperm <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong> in HFL rice. A functional connection between serotonin and endosperm <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong> was confirmed via overexpression of TDC3, a key enzyme of serotonin biosynthesis. Furthermore, we show that both the jasmonate signaling pathway and <i>TDC</i> expression were strongly induced in the late stage of endosperm development of HFL rice, coinciding with serotonin accumulation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dark</span></strong>-brown pigmentation. We propose a model for the metabolic connection between Lys and serotonin metabolism in which elevated 2-aminoadipate from Lys catabolism may play a key role in the connection between the jasmonate signaling pathway, serotonin accumulation, and the brown phenotype in rice endosperm. Our data provide a deeper understanding of amino acid metabolism in rice. In addition, the finding that both Lys and serotonin accumulate in HFL rice grains should promote efforts to create a nutritionally favorable crop.</p>

Chlorophyll Can Be Reduced in Crop Canopies with Little Penalty to Photosynthesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>

The relationship among leaf Chl, leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es, and photosynthetic biochemical capacity was measured in 67 soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) accessions showing large variation in leaf Chl. These relationships were integrated into a biophysical model of canopy-scale photosynthesis to simulate the intercanopy light environment and carbon assimilation capacity of canopies with wild type, a Chl-deficient mutant (<i>Y11y11</i>), and 67 other mutants spanning the extremes of Chl to quantify the impact of variation in leaf-level Chl on canopy-scale photosynthetic assimilation and identify possible opportunities for improving canopy photosynthesis through Chl reduction. These simulations demonstrate that canopy photosynthesis should not increase with Chl reduction due to increases in leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ance and nonoptimal distribution of canopy nitrogen. However, similar rates of canopy photosynthesis can be maintained with a 9% savings in leaf nitrogen resulting from decreased Chl. Additionally, analysis of these simulations indicate that the inability of Chl reductions to increase photosynthesis arises primarily from the connection between Chl and leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ance and secondarily from the mismatch between the vertical distribution of leaf nitrogen and the light <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong></span></strong>ion profile.

A Central Role for Triacylglycerol in Membrane Lipid Breakdown, Fatty Acid <i>β</i>-Oxidation, and Plant Survival under Extended Darkness
<p>Neutral lipid metabolism is a key aspect of intracellular homeostasis and energy balance and plays a vital role in cell survival under adverse conditions, including nutrient deprivation in yeast and mammals, but the role of triacylglycerol (TAG) metabolism in plant stress response remains largely unknown. By thoroughly characterizing mutants defective in SUGAR-DEPENDENT1 (SDP1) triacylglycerol lipase or PEROXISOMAL ABC TRANSPORTER 1 (PXA1), here we show that TAG is a key intermediate in the mobilization of fatty acids from membrane lipids for peroxisomal β-oxidation under prolonged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dark</span></strong> treatment. Disruption of SDP1 increased TAG accumulation in cytosolic lipid droplets and markedly enhanced plant tolerance to extended <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dark</span></strong>ness. We demonstrate that blocking TAG hydrolysis enhances plant tolerance to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dark</span></strong> treatment via two distinct mechanisms. In <i>pxa1</i> mutants, in which free fatty acids accumulated rapidly under extended <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dark</span></strong>ness, SDP1 disruption resulted in a marked decrease in levels of cytotoxic lipid intermediates such as free fatty acids and phosphatidic acid, suggesting a buffer function of TAG accumulation against lipotoxicity under fatty acid overload. In the wild type, in which free fatty acids remained low and unchanged under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dark</span></strong> treatment, disruption of SDP1 caused a decrease in reactive oxygen species production and hence the level of lipid peroxidation, indicating a role of TAG in protection against oxidative damage. Overall, our findings reveal a crucial role for TAG metabolism in membrane lipid breakdown, fatty acid turnover, and plant survival under extended <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dark</span></strong>ness.</p>

Genome-Wide Analysis of Selection on the Malaria Parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> in West African Populations of Differing Infection Endemicity
<p>Locally varying selection on pathogens may be due to differences in drug pressure, host immunity, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion opportunities between hosts, or the intensity of between-genotype competition within hosts. Highly recombining populations of the human malaria parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> throughout West Africa are closely related, as gene flow is relatively unrestricted in this endemic region, but markedly varying ecology and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion intensity should cause distinct local selective pressures. Genome-wide analysis of sequence variation was undertaken on a sample of 100 <i>P. falciparum</i> clinical isolates from a highly endemic region of the Republic of Guinea where <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion occurs for most of each year and compared with data from 52 clinical isolates from a previously sampled population from The Gambia, where there is relatively limited seasonal malaria <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion. Paired-end short-read sequences were mapped against the 3D7 <i>P. falciparum</i> reference genome sequence, and data on 136,144 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were obtained. Within-population analyses identifying loci showing evidence of recent positive directional selection and balancing selection confirm that antimalarial drugs and host immunity have been major selective agents. Many of the signatures of recent directional selection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ed by standardized integrated haplotype scores were population specific, including differences at drug resistance loci due to historically different antimalarial use between the countries. In contrast, both populations showed a similar set of loci likely to be under balancing selection as indicated by very high Tajima’s <i>D</i> values, including a significant overrepresentation of genes expressed at the merozoite stage that invades erythrocytes and several previously validated targets of acquired immunity. Between-population <i>F</i><sub>ST</sub> analysis identified exceptional differentiation of allele frequencies at a small number of loci, most markedly for five SNPs covering a 15-kb region within and flanking the <i>gdv1</i> gene that regulates the early stages of gametocyte development, which is likely related to the extreme differences in mosquito vector abundance and seasonality that determine the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion opportunities for the sexual stage of the parasite.</p>

Photon-mediated interactions between quantum emitters in a diamond nanocavity
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>-mediated interactions between quantum systems are essential for realizing quantum networks and scalable quantum information processing. We demonstrate such interactions between pairs of silicon-vacancy (SiV) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong> centers coupled to a diamond nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic cavity. When the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al transitions of the two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong> centers are tuned into resonance, the coupling to the common cavity mode results in a coherent interaction between them, leading to spectrally resolved superradiant and subradiant states. We use the electronic spin degrees of freedom of the SiV centers to control these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>ally mediated interactions. Such controlled interactions will be crucial in developing cavity-mediated quantum gates between spin qubits and for realizing scalable quantum network nodes.</p>

Optical skyrmion lattice in evanescent electromagnetic fields
<p>Topological defects play a key role in a variety of physical systems, ranging from high-energy to solid-state physics. A skyrmion is a type of topological defect that has shown promise for applications in the fields of magnetic storage and spintronics. We show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al skyrmion lattices can be generated using evanescent electromagnetic fields and demonstrate this using surface plasmon polaritons, imaged by phase-resolved near-field <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al microscopy. We show how the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al skyrmion lattice exhibits robustness to imperfections while the topological domain walls in the lattice can be continuously tuned, changing the spatial structure of the skyrmions from bubble type to Néel type. Extending the generation of skyrmions to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic systems provides various possibilities for applications in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al information processing, transfer, and storage.</p>

Genomic and epidemiological monitoring of yellow fever virus transmission potential
<p>The yellow fever virus (YFV) epidemic in Brazil is the largest in decades. The recent discovery of YFV in Brazilian <i>Aedes</i> species mosquitos highlights a need to monitor the risk of reestablishment of urban YFV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion in the Americas. We use a suite of epidemiological, spatial, and genomic approaches to characterize YFV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion. We show that the age and sex distribution of human cases is characteristic of sylvatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion. Analysis of YFV cases combined with genomes generated locally reveals an early phase of sylvatic YFV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion and spatial expansion toward previously YFV-free areas, followed by a rise in viral spillover to humans in late 2016. Our results establish a framework for monitoring YFV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion in real time that will contribute to a global strategy to eliminate future YFV epidemics.</p>

Imaging CF<sub>3</sub>I conical intersection and photodissociation dynamics with ultrafast electron diffraction
<p>Conical intersections play a critical role in excited-state dynamics of polyatomic molecules because they govern the reaction pathways of many nonadiabatic processes. However, ultrafast probes have lacked sufficient spatial resolution to image wave-packet trajectories through these intersections directly. Here, we present the simultaneous experimental characterization of one-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> and two-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> excitation channels in isolated CF<sub>3</sub>I molecules using ultrafast gas-phase electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffract</span></strong>ion. In the two-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> channel, we have mapped out the real-space trajectories of a coherent nuclear wave packet, which bifurcates onto two potential energy surfaces when passing through a conical intersection. In the one-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> channel, we have resolved excitation of both the umbrella and the breathing vibrational modes in the CF<sub>3</sub> fragment in multiple nuclear dimensions. These findings benchmark and validate ab initio nonadiabatic dynamics calculations.</p>

Seeded growth of single-crystal two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks
<p>Polymerization of monomers into periodic two-dimensional networks provides structurally precise, layered macromolecular sheets that exhibit desirable mechanical, optoelectronic, and molecular transport <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es. Two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) offer broad monomer scope but are generally isolated as powders comprising aggregated nanometer-scale crystallites. We found that 2D COF formation could be controlled using a two-step procedure in which monomers are added slowly to preformed nanoparticle seeds. The resulting 2D COFs are isolated as single-crystalline, micrometer-sized particles. Transient <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong></span></strong>ion spectroscopy of the dispersed COF nanoparticles revealed improvement in signal quality by two to three orders of magnitude relative to polycrystalline powder samples, and suggests <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exciton</span></strong> diffusion over longer length scales than those obtained through previous approaches.

Extraordinary plasticity of an inorganic semiconductor in darkness
<p>Inorganic semiconductors generally tend to fail in a brittle manner. Here, we report that extraordinary “plasticity” can take place in an inorganic semiconductor if the deformation is carried out “in complete <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dark</span></strong>ness.” Room-temperature deformation tests of zinc sulfide (ZnS) were performed under varying light conditions. ZnS crystals immediately fractured when they deformed under light irradiation. In contrast, it was found that ZnS crystals can be plastically deformed up to a deformation strain of ε<sub>t</sub> = 45% in complete <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dark</span></strong>ness. In addition, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al bandgap of the deformed ZnS crystals was distinctly decreased after deformation. These results suggest that dislocations in ZnS become mobile in complete <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dark</span></strong>ness and that multiplied dislocations can affect the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al bandgap over the whole crystal. Inorganic semiconductors are not necessarily intrinsically brittle.</p>

Adaptive infrared-reflecting systems inspired by cephalopods
<p>Materials and systems that statically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong> radiation in the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum underpin the performance of many entrenched technologies, including building insulation, energy-conserving windows, spacecraft components, electronics shielding, container packaging, protective clothing, and camouflage platforms.

Observation of bulk Fermi arc and polarization half charge from paired exceptional points
<p>The ideas of topology have found tremendous success in closed physical systems, but even richer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es exist in the more general open or dissipative framework. We theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate a bulk Fermi arc that develops from non-Hermitian radiative losses in an open system of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic crystal slabs. Moreover, we discover half-integer topological charges in the polarization of far-field radiation around the bulk Fermi arc. Both phenomena are shown to be direct consequences of the non-Hermitian topological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es of exceptional points, where resonances coincide in their frequencies and linewidths. Our work connects the fields of topological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ics, non-Hermitian physics, and singular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>s, providing a framework to explore more complex non-Hermitian topological systems.</p>

Building superlattices from individual nanoparticles via template-confined DNA-mediated assembly
<p>DNA programmable assembly has been combined with top-down lithography to construct superlattices of discrete, reconfigurable nanoparticle architectures on a gold surface over large areas. Specifically, the assembly of individual colloidal plasmonic nanoparticles with different shapes and sizes is controlled by oligonucleotides containing “locked” nucleic acids and confined environments provided by polymer pores to yield <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orient</span></strong>ed architectures that feature tunable arrangements and independently controllable distances at both nanometer- and micrometer-length scales. These structures, which would be difficult to construct by other common assembly methods, provide a platform to systematically study and control light-matter interactions in nanoparticle-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al materials. The generality and potential of this approach are explored by identifying a broadband absorber with a solvent polarity response that allows dynamic tuning of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visibl</span></strong>e light <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong></span></strong>ion.</p>

Anti-coalescence of bosons on a lossy beam splitter
<p>Two-boson interference, a fundamentally quantum effect, has been extensively studied with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s through the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect and observed with guided plasmons. Using two freely propagating surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) interfering on a lossy beam splitter, we show that the presence of loss enables us to modify the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ion and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion factors of the beam splitter, thus revealing quantum interference paths that do not exist in a lossless configuration. We investigate the two-plasmon interference on beam splitters with different sets of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ion and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion factors. Through coincidence-detection measurements, we observe either coalescence or anti-coalescence of SPPs. The results show that losses can be viewed as a degree of freedom to control quantum processes.</p>

Polymeric peptide pigments with sequence-encoded properties
<p>Melanins are a family of heterogeneous polymeric pigments that provide ultraviolet (UV) light protection, structural support, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation, and free radical scavenging. Formed by oxidative oligomerization of catecholic small molecules, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong></span></strong>es of melanins are influenced by covalent and noncovalent disorder. We report the use of tyrosine-containing tripeptides as tunable precursors for polymeric pigments.

Oxidative polymerization can be tuned in a sequence-dependent manner, resulting in peptide sequence–encoded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es such as UV absorbance, morphology, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation, and electrochemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es over a considerable range.

Nanometer resolution imaging and tracking of fluorescent molecules with minimal photon fluxes

By probing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emitt</span></strong>er with a local intensity minimum of excitation light, MINFLUX minimizes the fluorescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s needed for high localization precision. In our experiments, 22 times fewer fluorescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s are required as compared to popular centroid localization. In superresolution microscopy, MINFLUX attained ~1-nm precision, resolving molecules only 6 nanometers apart. MINFLUX tracking of single fluorescent proteins increased the temporal resolution and the number of localizations per trace by a factor of 100, as demonstrated with diffusing 30<i>S</i> ribosomal subunits in living <i>Escherichia coli</i>. As conceptual limits have not been reached, we expect this localization modality to break new ground for observing the dynamics, distribution, and structure of macromolecules in living cells and beyond.</p>

EIN3-LIKE1, MYB1, and ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR3 Act in a Regulatory Loop That Synergistically Modulates Ethylene Biosynthesis and Anthocyanin Accumulation
<p>Ethylene regulates climacteric fruit ripening, and EIN3-LIKE1 (EIL1) plays an important role in this process. In apple (<i>Malus domestica</i>), fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation is accompanied by ethylene release during fruit ripening, but the molecular mechanism that underlies these two physiological processes is unknown. In this study, we found that ethylene treatment markedly induced fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation as well as the expression of <i>MdMYB1</i>, a positive regulator of anthocyanin biosynthesis and fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation. In addition, we found that MdEIL1 directly bound to the promoter of <i>MdMYB1</i> and transcriptionally activated its expression, which resulted in anthocyanin biosynthesis and fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation. Furthermore, MdMYB1 interacted with the promoter of <i>ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR3</i>, a key regulator of ethylene biosynthesis, thereby providing a positive feedback for ethylene biosynthesis regulation. Overall, our findings provide insight into a mechanism involving the synergistic interaction of the ethylene signal with the MdMYB1 transcription factor to regulate ethylene biosynthesis and fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation in apple.</p>

Autophagy Deficiency Compromises Alternative Pathways of Respiration following Energy Deprivation in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>Under heterotrophic conditions, carbohydrate oxidation inside the mitochondrion is the primary energy source for cellular metabolism. However, during energy-limited conditions, alternative substrates are required to support respiration. Amino acid oxidation in plant cells plays a key role in this by generating electrons that can be transferred to the mitochondrial electron transport chain via the electron transfer flavoprotein/ubiquinone oxidoreductase system. Autophagy, a catabolic mechanism for macromolecule and protein recycling, allows the maintenance of amino acid pools and nutrient remobilization. Although the association between autophagy and alternative respiratory substrates has been suggested, the extent to which autophagy and primary metabolism interact to support plant respiration remains unclear. To investigate the metabolic importance of autophagy during development and under extended <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dark</span></strong>ness, Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants with disruption of autophagy (<i>atg</i> mutants) were used. Under normal growth conditions, <i>atg</i> mutants showed lower growth and seed production with no impact on photosynthesis. Following extended <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dark</span></strong>ness, <i>atg</i> mutants were characterized by signatures of early senescence, including decreased chlorophyll content and maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II coupled with increases in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dark</span></strong> respiration. Transcript levels of genes involved in alternative pathways of respiration and amino acid catabolism were up-regulated in <i>atg</i> mutants. The metabolite profiles of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dark</span></strong>-treated leaves revealed an extensive metabolic reprogramming in which increases in amino acid levels were partially compromised in <i>atg</i> mutants. Although an enhanced respiration in <i>atg</i> mutants was observed during extended <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dark</span></strong>ness, autophagy deficiency compromises protein degradation and the generation of amino acids used as alternative substrates to the respiration.</p>

Excess Diffuse Light Absorption in Upper Mesophyll Limits CO<sub>2</sub> Drawdown and Depresses Photosynthesis
<p>In agricultural and natural systems, diffuse light can enhance plant primary productivity due to deeper penetration into and greater ir<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radianc</span></strong>e of the entire canopy. However, for individual sun-grown leaves from three species, photosynthesis is actually less efficient under diffuse compared with direct light. Despite its potential impact on canopy-level productivity, the mechanism for this leaf-level diffuse light photosynthetic depression effect is unknown. Here, we investigate if the spatial distribution of light <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong></span></strong>ion relative to electron transport capacity in sun- and shade-grown sunflower (<i>Helianthus annuus</i>) leaves underlies its previously observed diffuse light photosynthetic depression. Using a new one-dimensional porous medium finite element gas-exchange model parameterized with light <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong></span></strong>ion profiles, we found that weaker penetration of diffuse versus direct light into the mesophyll of sun-grown sunflower leaves led to a more heterogenous saturation of electron transport capacity and lowered its CO<sub>2</sub> concentration drawdown capacity in the intercellular airspace and chloroplast stroma. This decoupling of light availability from photosynthetic capacity under diffuse light is sufficient to generate an 11% decline in photosynthesis in sun-grown but not shade-grown leaves, primarily because thin shade-grown leaves similarly distribute diffuse and direct light throughout the mesophyll. Finally, we illustrate how diffuse light photosynthetic depression could overcome enhancement in canopies with low light extinction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coeffici</span></strong>ents and/or leaf area, pointing toward a novel direction for future research.</p>

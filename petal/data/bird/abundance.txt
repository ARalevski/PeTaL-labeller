Mid-term changes in blood metal ion levels after Articular Surface Replacement arthroplasty of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Our first aim was to determine whether there are significant   changes in the level of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> ions in the blood at mid-term follow-up,   in patients with an Articular Surface Replacement (ASR) arthroplasty.   Secondly, we sought to identify risk factors for any increases.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The study involved 435 patients who underwent unilateral, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>-on-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>   (MoM) hip resurfacing (HRA) or total hip arthroplasty (THA). These   patients all had one measurement of the level of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> ions in the   blood before seven years had passed post-operatively (early evaluation)   and one after seven years had passed post-operatively (mid-term evaluation).   Changes in ion levels were tested using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test.   We identified subgroups at the highest risk of increase using a   multivariable linear logistic regression model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were significant increases in the levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> ions   for patients who underwent both MoM HRA (Chromium (Cr): 0.5 parts   per billion (ppb); Cobalt (Co): 1.1 ppb) and MoM THA (Cr: 0.5 ppb;   Co: 0.7 ppb). In a multivariable model considering MoM HRAs, the   change in the levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> ions was influenced by female gender   (Co: Odds Ratio (OR) 1.42; p = 0.002 and Cr: OR 1.08; p = 0.006).   The change was found to be irrespective of the initial level for   the MoM HRAs, whereas there was a negative relationship between   the initial level and the change in the level for those with a MoM   THA (Co: OR -0.43; p < 0.001 and Cr: OR -0.14; p = 0.033).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> ions in the blood increase significantly   over the period until mid-term follow-up in patients with both a   MoM HRA and those with a MoM THA. We recommend that the levels of   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> ions be measured most frequently for women with a MoM HRA.   While those with a MoM THA appear to stabilise at a certain level,   the accuracy of this trend is not yet clear. Vigilant follow-up   is still recommended. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B(4   Supple B):33–40.</p></sec>

Heavy Metals Induce Iron Deficiency Responses at Different Hierarchic and Regulatory Levels
<p>In plants, the excess of several heavy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s mimics iron (Fe) deficiency-induced chlorosis, indicating a disturbance in Fe homeostasis. To examine the level at which heavy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s interfere with Fe deficiency responses, we carried out an in-depth characterization of Fe-related physiological, regulatory, and morphological responses in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) exposed to heavy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s. Enhanced zinc (Zn) uptake closely mimicked Fe deficiency by leading to low chlorophyll but high ferric-chelate reductase activity and coumarin release. These responses were not caused by Zn-inhibited Fe uptake via IRON-REGULATED TRANSPORTER (IRT1). Instead, Zn simulated the transcriptional response of typical Fe-regulated genes, indicating that Zn affects Fe homeostasis at the level of Fe sensing. Excess supplies of cobalt and nickel altered root traits in a different way from Fe deficiency, inducing only transient Fe deficiency responses, which were characterized by a lack of induction of the ethylene pathway. Cadmium showed a rather inconsistent influence on Fe deficiency responses at multiple levels. By contrast, manganese evoked weak Fe deficiency responses in wild-type plants but strongly exacerbated chlorosis in <i>irt1</i> plants, indicating that manganese antagonized Fe mainly at the level of transport. These results show that the investigated heavy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s modulate Fe deficiency responses at different hierarchic and regulatory levels and that the interaction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s with physiological and morphological Fe deficiency responses is uncoupled. Thus, this study not only emphasizes the importance of assessing heavy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> toxicities at multiple levels but also provides a new perspective on how Fe deficiency contributes to the toxic action of individual heavy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s.</p>

Root Cortical Senescence Improves Growth under Suboptimal Availability of N, P, and K
<p>Root cortical senescence (RCS) in Triticeae reduces nutrient uptake, nutrient content, respiration, and radial hydraulic conductance of root tissue. We used the functional-structural model <i>SimRoot</i> to evaluate the functional implications of RCS in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) under suboptimal nitrate, phosphorus, and potassium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>ability. The utility of RCS was evaluated using sensitivity analyses in contrasting nutrient regimes. At flowering (80 d), RCS increased simulated plant growth by up to 52%, 73%, and 41% in nitrate-, phosphorus-, and potassium-limiting conditions, respectively. Plants with RCS had reduced nutrient requirement of root tissue for optimal plant growth, reduced total cumulative cortical respiration, and increased total carbon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reserv</span></strong>es. Nutrient reallocation during RCS had a greater effect on simulated plant growth than reduced respiration or nutrient uptake. Under low nutrient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>ability, RCS had greater benefit in plants with fewer tillers. RCS had greater benefit in phenotypes with fewer lateral roots at low nitrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>ability, but the opposite was true in low phosphorus or potassium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>ability. Additionally, RCS was quantified in field-grown barley in different nitrogen regimes. Field and virtual soil coring simulation results demonstrated that living cortical volume per root length (an indicator of RCS) decreased with depth in younger plants, while roots of older plants had very little living cortical volume per root length. RCS may be an adaptive trait for nutrient acquisition by reallocating nutrients from senescing tissue and secondarily by reducing root respiration. These simulated results suggest that RCS merits investigation as a breeding target for enhanced soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resourc</span></strong>e acquisition and edaphic stress tolerance.</p>

Metal Tolerance Protein 8 Mediates Manganese Homeostasis and Iron Reallocation during Seed Development and Germination
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> accumulation in seeds is a prerequisite for germination and establishment of plants but also for micronutrient delivery to humans. To investigate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> transport processes and their interactions in seeds, we focused on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> TOLERANCE PROTEIN8 (MTP8), a tonoplast transporter of the manganese (Mn) subclade of cation diffusion facilitators, which in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) is expressed in embryos of seeds. The x-ray fluorescence imaging showed that expression of MTP8 was responsible for Mn localization in subepidermal cells on the abaxial side of the cotyledons and in cortical cells of the hypocotyl. Accordingly, under low Mn <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>ability, MTP8 increased seed stores of Mn, required for efficient seed germination. In mutant embryos lacking expression of <i>VACUOLAR IRON TRANSPORTER1</i> (<i>VIT1</i>), MTP8 built up iron (Fe) hotspots in <i>MTP8</i>-expressing cells types, suggesting that MTP8 transports Fe in addition to Mn. In <i>mtp8 vit1</i> double mutant seeds, Mn and Fe were distributed in all cell types of the embryo. An Fe transport function of MTP8 was confirmed by its ability to complement Fe hypersensitivity of a yeast mutant defective in vacuolar Fe transport. Imbibing <i>mtp8-1</i> mutant seeds in the presence of Mn or subjecting seeds to wet-dry cycles showed that MTP8 conferred Mn tolerance. During germination, MTP8 promoted reallocation of Fe from the vasculature. These results indicate that cell type-specific accumulation of Mn and Fe in seeds depends on MTP8 and that this transporter plays an important role in the generation of seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> stores as well as for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> homeostasis and germination efficiency under challenging environmental conditions.</p>

Tree Physiology
Revisiting the sequencing of the first tree genome: <i>Populus trichocarpa</i>
<p>Ten years ago, it was announced that the Joint Genome Institute with funds provided by the Department of Energy, Office of Science, Biological and Environmental Research would sequence the black cottonwood (<i>Populus trichocarpa</i> Torr. & Gray) genome. This landmark decision was the culmination of work by the forest science community to develop <i>Populus</i> as a model system. Since its public release in late 2006, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>ability of the <i>Populus</i> genome has spawned research in plant biology, morphology, genetics and ecology. Here we address how the tree physiologist has used this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resourc</span></strong>e. More specifically, we revisit our earlier contention that the rewards of sequencing the <i>Populus</i> genome would depend on how quickly scientists working with woody perennials could adopt molecular approaches to investigate the mechanistic underpinnings of basic physiological processes. Several examples illustrate the integration of functional and comparative genomics into the forest sciences, especially in areas that target improved understanding of the developmental differences between woody perennials and herbaceous annuals (e.g., phase transitions). Sequencing the <i>Populus</i> genome and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>ability of genetic and genomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resourc</span></strong>es has also been instrumental in identifying candidate genes that underlie physiological and morphological traits of interest. Genome-enabled research has advanced our understanding of how phenotype and genotype are related and provided insights into the genetic mechanisms whereby woody perennials adapt to environmental stress. In the future, we anticipate that low-cost, high-throughput sequencing will continue to facilitate research in tree physiology and enhance our understanding at scales of individual organisms and populations. A challenge remains, however, as to how genomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resourc</span></strong>es, including the <i>Populus</i> genome, can be used to understand ecosystem function. Although examples are limited, progress in this area is encouraging and will undoubtedly improve as future research targets the many unique aspects of <i>Populus</i> as a keystone species in terrestrial ecosystems.</p>

Observation of the Wigner-Huntington transition to metallic hydrogen
<p>Producing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>lic hydrogen has been a great challenge in condensed matter physics. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>lic hydrogen may be a room-temperature superconductor and metastable when the pressure is released and could have an important impact on energy and rocketry. We have studied solid molecular hydrogen under pressure at low temperatures. At a pressure of 495 gigapascals, hydrogen becomes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>lic, with reflectivity as high as 0.91. We fit the reflectance using a Drude free-electron model to determine the plasma frequency of 32.5 ± 2.1 electron volts at a temperature of 5.5 kelvin, with a corresponding electron carrier density of 7.7 ± 1.1 × 10<sup>23</sup> particles per cubic centimeter, which is consistent with theoretical estimates of the atomic density. The properties are those of an atomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>. We have produced the Wigner-Huntington dissociative transition to atomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>lic hydrogen in the laboratory.</p>

Photochemical Route for Accessing Amorphous Metal Oxide Materials for Water Oxidation Catalysis
<sec><title>Amorphous and More Active</title><p>The electrochemical generation of hydrogen from water could help in the storage of energy generated by renewable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resourc</span></strong>es at off-peak times. However, catalysts for the slow step of this reaction, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), are based on oxides of noble <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s (iridium and ruthenium) that have limited abundance. A strategy for improving the performance of earth-abundant elements is to explore mixed-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> oxides and to prepare these as amorphous phases. <bold>Smith <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 60, published online 28 March) developed a general method for preparing amorphous oxides, based on photodecomposition of organo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>lic precursors.

Isostructural metal-insulator transition in VO<sub>2</sub>
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>-insulator transition in correlated materials is usually coupled to a symmetry-lowering structural phase transition. This coupling not only complicates the understanding of the basic mechanism of this phenomenon but also limits the speed and endurance of prospective electronic devices. We demonstrate an isostructural, purely electronically driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>-insulator transition in epitaxial heterostructures of an archetypal correlated material, vanadium dioxide. A combination of thin-film synthesis, structural and electrical characterizations, and theoretical modeling reveals that an interface interaction suppresses the electronic correlations without changing the crystal structure in this otherwise correlated insulator. This interaction stabilizes a nonequilibrium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>lic phase and leads to an isostructural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>-insulator transition. This discovery will provide insights into phase transitions of correlated materials and may aid the design of device functionalities.</p>

Colossal grain growth yields single-crystal metal foils by contact-free annealing
<p>Single-crystal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s have distinctive properties owing to the absence of grain boundaries and strong anisotropy. Commercial single-crystal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s are usually synthesized by bulk crystal growth or by deposition of thin films onto substrates, and they are expensive and small. We prepared extremely large single-crystal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> foils by “contact-free annealing” from commercial polycrystalline foils. The colossal grain growth (up to 32 square centimeters) is achieved by minimizing contact stresses, resulting in a preferred in-plane and out-of-plane crystal orientation, and is driven by surface energy minimization during the rotation of the crystal lattice followed by “consumption” of neighboring grains. Industrial-scale production of single-crystal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> foils is possible as a result of this discovery.</p>

Insulator-metal transition in dense fluid deuterium
<p>Dense fluid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>lic hydrogen occupies the interiors of Jupiter, Saturn, and many extrasolar planets, where pressures reach millions of atmospheres.

Probing the ultimate plasmon confinement limits with a van der Waals heterostructure
<p>The ability to confine light into tiny spatial dimensions is important for applications such as microscopy, sensing, and nanoscale lasers. Although plasmons offer an appealing avenue to confine light, Landau damping in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s imposes a trade-off between optical field confinement and losses. We show that a graphene-insulator-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> heterostructure can overcome that trade-off, and demonstrate plasmon confinement down to the ultimate limit of the length scale of one atom. This is achieved through far-field excitation of plasmon modes squeezed into an atomically thin hexagonal boron nitride dielectric spacer between graphene and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> rods. A theoretical model that takes into account the nonlocal optical response of both graphene and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> is used to describe the results. These ultraconfined plasmonic modes, addressed with far-field light excitation, enable a route to new regimes of ultrastrong light-matter interactions.</p>

Catalytic molten metals for the direct conversion of methane to hydrogen and separable carbon
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s that are active catalysts for methane (Ni, Pt, Pd), when dissolved in inactive low–melting temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s (In, Ga, Sn, Pb), produce stable molten <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> alloy catalysts for pyrolysis of methane into hydrogen and carbon. All solid catalysts previously used for this reaction have been deactivated by carbon deposition. In the molten alloy system, the insoluble carbon floats to the surface where it can be skimmed off. A 27% Ni–73% Bi alloy achieved 95% methane conversion at 1065°C in a 1.1-meter bubble column and produced pure hydrogen without CO<sub>2</sub> or other by-products. Calculations show that the active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s in the molten alloys are atomically dispersed and negatively charged. There is a correlation between the amount of charge on the atoms and their catalytic activity.</p>

Large gem diamonds from metallic liquid in Earth’s deep mantle
<p>The redox state of Earth’s convecting mantle, masked by the lithospheric plates and basaltic magmatism of plate tectonics, is a key unknown in the evolutionary history of our planet. Here we report that large, exceptional gem diamonds like the Cullinan, Constellation, and Koh-i-Noor carry direct evidence of crystallization from a redox-sensitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>lic liquid phase in the deep mantle. These sublithospheric diamonds contain inclusions of solidified iron-nickel-carbon-sulfur melt, accompanied by a thin fluid layer of methane ± hydrogen, and sometimes majoritic garnet or former calcium silicate perovskite. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>-dominated mineral assemblages and reduced volatiles in large gem diamonds indicate formation under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>-saturated conditions. We verify previous predictions that Earth has highly reducing deep mantle regions capable of precipitating a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>lic iron phase that contains dissolved carbon and hydrogen.</p>

Sexual competition affects biomass partitioning, carbon–nutrient balance, Cd allocation and ultrastructure of <i>Populus cathayana</i> females and males exposed to Cd stress
<p>Although increasing attention has been paid to plant adaptation to soil heavy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> contamination, competition and neighbor effects have been largely overlooked, especially in dioecious plants. In this study, we investigated growth as well as biochemical and ultrastructural responses of <i>Populus cathayana</i> Rehder females and males to cadmium (Cd) stress under different sexual competition patterns. The results showed that competition significantly affects biomass partitioning, photosynthetic capacity, leaf and root ultrastructure, Cd accumulation, the contents of polyphenols, and structural and nonstructural carbohydrates. Compared with single-sex cultivation, plants of opposite sexes exposed to sexual competition accumulated more Cd in tissues and their growth was more strongly inhibited, indicating enhanced Cd toxicity under sexual competition. Under intrasexual competition, females showed greater Cd accumulation, more serious damage at the ultrastructural level and greater reduction in physiological activity than under intersexual competition, while males performed better under intrasexual competition than under intersexual competition. Males improved the female microenvironment by greater Cd uptake and lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resourc</span></strong>e consumption under intersexual competition. These results demonstrate that the sex of neighbor plants and competition affect sexual differences in growth and in key physiological processes under Cd stress. The asymmetry of sexual competition highlighted here might regulate population structure, and spatial segregation and phytoremediation potential of both sexes in <i>P. cathayana</i> growing in heavy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>-contaminated soils.</p>

Quantum oscillations of electrical resistivity in an insulator
<p>In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s, orbital motions of conduction electrons on the Fermi surface are quantized in magnetic fields, which is manifested by quantum oscillations in electrical resistivity. This Landau quantization is generally absent in insulators. Here, we report a notable exception in an insulator—ytterbium dodecaboride (YbB<sub>12</sub>). The resistivity of YbB<sub>12</sub>, which is of a much larger magnitude than the resistivity in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s, exhibits distinct quantum oscillations. These unconventional oscillations arise from the insulating bulk, even though the temperature dependence of the oscillation amplitude follows the conventional Fermi liquid theory of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s with a large effective mass. Quantum oscillations in the magnetic torque are also observed, albeit with a lighter effective mass.</p>

Observation of alkaline earth complexes M(CO)<sub>8</sub> (M = Ca, Sr, or Ba) that mimic transition metals
<p>The alkaline earth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr), and barium (Ba) typically engage in chemical bonding as classical main-group elements through their <i>n</i>s and <i>n</i>p valence orbitals, where <i>n</i> is the principal quantum number. Here we report the isolation and spectroscopic characterization of eight-coordinate carbonyl complexes M(CO)<sub>8</sub> (where M = Ca, Sr, or Ba) in a low-temperature neon matrix. Analysis of the electronic structure of these cubic <i>O<sub>h</sub></i>-symmetric complexes reveals that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>–carbon monoxide (CO) bonds arise mainly from [M(d<sub>π</sub>)] → (CO)<sub>8</sub> π backdonation, which explains the strong observed red shift of the C-O stretching frequencies.

Scale-invariant magnetoresistance in a cuprate superconductor
<p>The anomalous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>lic state in the high-temperature superconducting cuprates is masked by superconductivity near a quantum critical point. Applying high magnetic fields to suppress superconductivity has enabled detailed studies of the normal state, yet the direct effect of strong magnetic fields on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>lic state is poorly understood. We report the high-field magnetoresistance of thin-film La<sub>2–</sub><i><sub>x</sub></i>Sr<i><sub>x</sub></i>CuO<sub>4</sub> cuprate in the vicinity of the critical doping, 0.161 ≤ <i>p</i> ≤ 0.190. We find that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>lic state exposed by suppressing superconductivity is characterized by magnetoresistance that is linear in magnetic fields up to 80 tesla. The magnitude of the linear-in-field resistivity mirrors the magnitude and doping evolution of the well-known linear-in-temperature resistivity that has been associated with quantum criticality in high-temperature superconductors.</p>

Synthesis of ultrasmall, homogeneously alloyed, bimetallic nanoparticles on silica supports
<p>Supported nanoparticles containing more than one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> have a variety of applications in sensing, catalysis, and biomedicine.

Ten permutations of noble and base <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s (platinum, palladium, copper, nickel, and cobalt) were synthesized with average particle sizes from 0.9 to 1.4 nanometers, with tight size distributions. High-resolution imaging and x-ray analysis confirmed the homogeneity of alloying in these ultrasmall nanoparticles.</p>

A liquid metal reaction environment for the room-temperature synthesis of atomically thin metal oxides
<p>Two-dimensional (2D) oxides have a wide variety of applications in electronics and other technologies. However, many oxides are not easy to synthesize as 2D materials through conventional methods. We used nontoxic eutectic gallium-based alloys as a reaction solvent and co-alloyed desired <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s into the melt. On the basis of thermodynamic considerations, we predicted the composition of the self-limiting interfacial oxide. We isolated the surface oxide as a 2D layer, either on substrates or in suspension.

A parity-breaking electronic nematic phase transition in the spin-orbit coupled metal Cd<sub>2</sub>Re<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>

We uncovered a multipolar nematic phase of matter in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>lic pyrochlore Cd<sub>2</sub>Re<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> using spatially resolved second-harmonic optical anisotropy measurements. Like previously discovered electronic nematic phases, this multipolar phase spontaneously breaks rotational symmetry while p<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reserv</span></strong>ing translational invariance. However, it has the distinguishing property of being odd under spatial inversion, which is allowed only in the presence of spin-orbit coupling.

Grain boundary stability governs hardening and softening in extremely fine nanograined metals
<p>Conventional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s become harder with decreasing grain sizes, following the classical Hall-Petch relationship. However, this relationship fails and softening occurs at some grain sizes in the nanometer regime for some alloys. In this study, we discovered that plastic deformation mechanism of extremely fine nanograined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s and their hardness are adjustable through tailoring grain boundary (GB) stability. The electrodeposited nanograined nickel-molybdenum (Ni–Mo) samples become softened for grain sizes below 10 nanometers because of GB-mediated processes. With GB stabilization through relaxation and Mo segregation, ultrahigh hardness is achieved in the nanograined samples with a plastic deformation mechanism dominated by generation of extended partial dislocations. Grain boundary stability provides an alternative dimension, in addition to grain size, for producing novel nanograined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s with extraordinary properties.</p>

CyanoGate: A Modular Cloning Suite for Engineering Cyanobacteria Based on the Plant MoClo Syntax
<p>Recent advances in synthetic biology research have been underpinned by an exponential increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>able genomic information and a proliferation of advanced DNA assembly tools. The adoption of plasmid vector assembly standards and parts libraries has greatly enhanced the reproducibility of research and the exchange of parts between different labs and biological systems. However, a standardized modular cloning (MoClo) system is not yet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>able for cyanobacteria, which lag behind other prokaryotes in synthetic biology despite their huge potential regarding biotechnological applications. By building on the assembly library and syntax of the Plant Golden Gate MoClo kit, we have developed a versatile system called CyanoGate that unites cyanobacteria with plant and algal systems. Here, we describe the generation of a suite of parts and acceptor vectors for making (1) marked/unmarked knock-outs or integrations using an integrative acceptor vector, and (2) transient multigene expression and repression systems using known and previously undescribed replicative vectors. We tested and compared the CyanoGate system in the established model cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 and the more recently described fast-growing strain <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973. The UTEX 2973 fast-growth phenotype was only evident under specific growth conditions; however, UTEX 2973 accumulated high levels of proteins with strong native or synthetic promoters. The system is publicly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>able and can be readily expanded to accommodate other standardized MoClo parts to accelerate the development of reliable synthetic biology tools for the cyanobacterial community.</p>

Carbon Supply and Photoacclimation Cross Talk in the Green Alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>
<p>Photosynthetic organisms are exposed to drastic changes in light conditions, which can affect their photosynthetic efficiency and induce photodamage. To face these changes, they have developed a series of acclimation mechanisms. In this work, we have studied the acclimation strategies of <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, a model green alga that can grow using various carbon sources and is thus an excellent system in which to study photosynthesis. Like other photosynthetic algae, it has evolved inducible mechanisms to adapt to conditions where carbon supply is limiting. We have analyzed how the carbon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>ability influences the composition and organization of the photosynthetic apparatus and the capacity of the cells to acclimate to different light conditions. Using electron microscopy, biochemical, and fluorescence measurements, we show that differences in CO<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>ability not only have a strong effect on the induction of the carbon-concentrating mechanisms but also change the acclimation strategy of the cells to light. For example, while cells in limiting CO<sub>2</sub> maintain a large antenna even in high light and switch on energy-dissipative mechanisms, cells in high CO<sub>2</sub> reduce the amount of pigments per cell and the antenna size. Our results show the high plasticity of the photosynthetic apparatus of <i>C. reinhardtii</i>. This alga is able to use various photoacclimation strategies, and the choice of which to activate strongly depends on the carbon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>ability.</p>

Is gastrointestinal plasticity in king quail (<i>Coturnix chinensis</i>) elicited by diet-fibre or diet-energy dilution?
<p>Phenotypic plasticity of organ size allows some animals to manage fluctuations of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resourc</span></strong>e quality or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>ability. Here, we examined the phenotypic plasticity of the gastrointestinal tract of king quail (<i>Coturnix chinensis</i>) in a diet-fibre manipulation study. Quail were offered either a control low-fibre (high-quality) food (8.5% neutral-detergent fibre; NDF), or one of two experimental diets of higher fibre contents of 16% NDF (i.e. low-quality food). To examine whether phenotypic plasticity of organ size was associated with the fibre content per se, or as a consequence of diluting the diet energy contents by adding fibre, one of the high-fibre feeds was ‘balanced’ with additional energy to match that of the low-fibre control diet. Total empty dry mass of the gastrointestinal tract was significantly heavier among birds offered the unbalanced high-fibre diet as compared with those offered the control diet, with birds offered the fibrous but energy-balanced diet having guts of intermediate size. The heavier entire-gut mass (dry) of quail offered the unbalanced high-fibre diet was associated mainly with these birds having significantly heavier gizzards. Notably, the larger gizzard in the birds offered the unbalanced high-fibre diet was associated with marked increases in their metabolisability (digestion) of diet fibre. Our findings suggest that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>able energy in the diet may be more important for eliciting phenotypic changes in the gut of these herbivorous birds rather than simple physical effects of diet fibre on feed intakes or on muscular compensation to fibrous ingesta.</p>

Management of massive acetabular bone defects in revision arthroplasty of the hip using a reconstruction cage and porous metal augment
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>It may not be possible to undertake revision total hip arthroplasty   (THA) in the presence of massive loss of acetabular bone stock using   standard cementless hemispherical acetabular components and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>   augments, as satisfactory stability cannot always be achieved. We   aimed to study the outcome using a reconstruction cage and a porous   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> augment in these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 22 acetabular revisions in 19 patients were performed   using a combination of a reconstruction cage and porous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> augments.   The augments were used in place of structural allografts. The mean   age of the patients at the time of surgery was 70 years (27 to 85)   and the mean follow-up was 39 months (27 to 58). The mean number   of previous THAs was 1.9 (1 to 3). All patients had segmental defects   involving more than 50% of the acetabulum and seven hips had an   associated pelvic discontinuity. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Three failures were observed in two hips, both of which had undergone   a previous resection of a tumour affecting the acetabulum. Other   complications included a late arterial injury, a sciatic nerve palsy,   a dislocation treated with a femoral revision, a deep infection   treated with irrigation and debridement and a fracture of the greater   trochanter treated conservatively. The mean Oxford Hip Score significantly   increased from 13.9 (2 to 23) to 28.7 (13 to 38) (p < 0.00001).   The mean vertical distance between the centre of rotation of the   hip and its normal location decreased from 30 mm to 10 mm.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Acceptable early survivorship can be achieved using this novel   technique, but it may be unsuitable for use in patients who have   previously undergone the resection of a tumour involving the acetabulum.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:607–13.</p></sec>

TreeTFDB: An Integrative Database of the Transcription Factors from Six Economically Important Tree Crops for Functional Predictions and Comparative and Functional Genomics
<p>Crop plants, whose productivity is affected by a wide range of growing and environmental conditions, are grown for economic purposes. Transcription factors (TFs) play central role in regulation of many biological processes, including plant development and responses to environmental stimuli, by activating or repressing spatiotemporal gene expression. Here, we describe the TreeTFDB (<ext-link>http://treetfdb.bmep.riken.jp/index.pl</ext-link>) that houses the TF repertoires of six economically important tree crop species: <i>Jatropha curcas</i>, papaya, cassava, poplar, castor bean and grapevine. Among these, the TF repertoire of <i>J. curcas</i> has not been reported by any other TF databases. In addition to their basic information, such as sequence and domain features, domain alignments, gene ontology assignment and sequence comparison, information on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>able full-length cDNAs, identity and positions of all types of known <i>cis</i>-motifs found in the promoter regions, gene expression data are provided. With its newly designed and friendly interface and its unique features, TreeTFDB will enable research community to predict the functions and provide access to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>able genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resourc</span></strong>es for performing comparative and functional genomics of the crop TFs, either individually or at whole family level, in a comprehensive and convenient manner.</p>

Non-invasive long-term fluorescence live imaging of <i>Tribolium castaneum</i> embryos
<p>Insect development has contributed significantly to our understanding of metazoan development. However, most information has been obtained by analyzing a single species, the fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Embryonic development of the red flour beetle <i>Tribolium castaneum</i> differs fundamentally from that of <i>Drosophila</i> in aspects such as short-germ development, embryonic leg development, extensive extra-embryonic membrane formation and non-involuted head development. Although <i>Tribolium</i> has become the second most important insect model organism, previous live imaging attempts have addressed only specific questions and no long-term live imaging data of <i>Tribolium</i> embryogenesis have been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>able. By combining light sheet-based fluorescence microscopy with a novel mounting method, we achieved complete, continuous and non-invasive fluorescence live imaging of <i>Tribolium</i> embryogenesis at high spatiotemporal resolution. The embryos survived the 2-day or longer imaging process, developed into adults and produced fertile progeny. Our data document all morphogenetic processes from the rearrangement of the uniform blastoderm to the onset of regular muscular movement in the same embryo and in four orientations, contributing significantly to the understanding of <i>Tribolium</i> development. Furthermore, we created a comprehensive chronological table of <i>Tribolium</i> embryogenesis, integrating most previous work and providing a reference for future studies. Based on our observations, we provide evidence that serosa window closure and serosa opening, although deferred by more than 1 day, are linked. All our long-term imaging datasets are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>able as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resourc</span></strong>e for the community. <i>Tribolium</i> is only the second insect species, after <i>Drosophila</i>, for which non-invasive long-term fluorescence live imaging has been achieved.</p>

Extracellular Matrix Proteomics Reveals Interplay of Aggrecan and Aggrecanases in Vascular Remodeling of Stented Coronary Arteries
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling contributes to in-stent restenosis and thrombosis. Despite its important clinical implications, little is known about ECM changes post–stent implantation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Bare-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> and drug-eluting stents were implanted in pig coronary arteries with an overstretch under optical coherence tomography guidance. Stented segments were harvested 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28 days post-stenting for proteomics analysis of the media and neointima.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 151 ECM and ECM-associated proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. After stent implantation, proteins involved in regulating calcification were upregulated in the neointima of drug-eluting stents. The earliest changes in the media were proteins involved in inflammation and thrombosis, followed by changes in regulatory ECM proteins. By day 28, basement membrane proteins were reduced in drug-eluting stents in comparison with bare-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> stents. In contrast, the large aggregating proteoglycan aggrecan was increased. Aggrecanases of the ADAMTS (a disintegrin and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>loproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) family contribute to the catabolism of vascular proteoglycans. An increase in ADAMTS-specific aggrecan fragments was accompanied by a notable shift from <i>ADAMTS1</i> and <i>ADAMTS5</i> to <i>ADAMTS4</i> gene expression after stent implantation. Immunostaining in human stented coronary arteries confirmed the presence of aggrecan and aggrecan fragments, in particular, at the contacts of the stent struts with the artery. Further investigation of aggrecan presence in the human vasculature revealed that aggrecan and aggrecan cleavage were more abundant in human arteries than in human veins. In addition, aggrecan synthesis was induced on grafting a vein into the arterial circulation, suggesting an important role for aggrecan in vascular plasticity. Finally, lack of ADAMTS-5 activity in mice resulted in an accumulation of aggrecan and a dilation of the thoracic aorta, confirming that aggrecanase activity regulates aggrecan abundance in the arterial wall and contributes to vascular remodeling.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Significant differences were identified by proteomics in the ECM of coronary arteries after bare-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> and drug-eluting stent implantation, most notably an upregulation of aggrecan, a major ECM component of cartilaginous tissues that confers resistance to compression. The accumulation of aggrecan coincided with a shift in <i>ADAMTS</i> gene expression. This study provides the first evidence implicating aggrecan and aggrecanases in the vascular injury response after stenting.</p></sec>

Right Ventricular Myofilament Functional Differences in Humans With Systemic Sclerosis–Associated Versus Idiopathic Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc)–associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have a far worse prognosis than those with idiopathic PAH (IPAH). In the intact heart, SSc-PAH exhibits depressed rest and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reserv</span></strong>e right ventricular (RV) contractility compared with IPAH. We tested whether this disparity involves underlying differences in myofilament function.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Cardiac myocytes were isolated from RV septal endomyocardial biopsies from patients with SSc-PAH, IPAH, or SSc with exertional dyspnea but no resting PAH (SSc-d); control RV septal tissue was obtained from nondiseased donor hearts (6–7 per group). Isolated myocyte passive length-tension and developed tension-calcium relationships were determined and correlated with in vivo RV function and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reserv</span></strong>e. RV septal fibrosis was also examined.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Myocyte passive stiffness from length-tension relations was similarly increased in IPAH and SSc-PAH compared with control, although SSc-PAH biopsies had more interstitial fibrosis. More striking disparities were found between active force-calcium relations. Compared with controls, maximal calcium-activated force (F<sub>max</sub>) was 28% higher in IPAH but 37% lower in SSc-PAH. F<sub>max</sub> in SSc-d was intermediate between control and SSc-PAH. The calcium concentration required for half-maximal force (EC<sub>50</sub>) was similar between control, IPAH, and SSc-d but lower in SSc-PAH. This disparity disappeared in myocytes incubated with the active catalytic subunit of protein kinase A. Myocyte F<sub>max</sub> directly correlated with in vivo RV contractility assessed by end-systolic elastance (<i>R<sup>2</sup></i>=0.46, <i>P</i>=0.002) and change in end-systolic elastance with exercise (<i>R<sup>2</sup></i>=0.49, <i>P</i>=0.008) and was inversely related with exercise-induced chamber dilation (<i>R<sup>2</sup></i>=0.63, <i>P</i><0.002), which also was a marker of depressed contractile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reserv</span></strong>e.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>A primary defect in human SSc-PAH resides in depressed sarcomere function, whereas this is enhanced in IPAH. These disparities correlate with in vivo RV contractility and contractile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reserv</span></strong>e and are consistent with worse clinical outcomes in SSc-PAH. The existence of sarcomere disease before the development of resting PAH in patients with SSc-d suggests that earlier identification and intervention may prove useful.</p></sec>

The Cost-Effectiveness of Antibiotic Prophylaxis for Patients at Risk of Infective Endocarditis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In March 2008, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommended stopping antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) for those at risk of infective endocarditis (IE) undergoing dental procedures in the United Kingdom, citing a lack of evidence of efficacy and cost-effectiveness. We have performed a new economic evaluation of AP on the basis of contemporary estimates of efficacy, adverse events, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resourc</span></strong>e implications.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A decision analytic cost-effectiveness model was used. Health service costs and benefits (measured as quality-adjusted life-years) were estimated. Rates of IE before and after the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>able to estimate prophylactic efficacy. AP adverse event rates were derived from recent UK data, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resourc</span></strong>e implications were based on English Hospital Episode Statistics.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>AP was less costly and more effective than no AP for all patients at risk of IE. The results are sensitive to AP efficacy, but efficacy would have to be substantially lower for AP not to be cost-effective. AP was even more cost-effective in patients at high risk of IE. Only a marginal reduction in annual IE rates (1.44 cases in high-risk and 33 cases in all at-risk patients) would be required for AP to be considered cost-effective at £20 000 ($26 600) per quality-adjusted life-year. Annual cost savings of £5.5 to £8.2 million ($7.3–$10.9 million) and health gains >2600 quality-adjusted life-years could be achieved from reinstating AP in England.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>AP is cost-effective for preventing IE, particularly in those at high risk. These findings support the cost-effectiveness of guidelines recommending AP use in high-risk individuals.</p></sec>

Included studies were limited to English or French language reports. Quality assessment was performed according to the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. We identified 169 publications, of which 7 studies were included. Studies have concluded that e-cigarettes can help reduce the number of cigarettes smoked and may be as effective for smoking cessation as the nicotine patch. Although there is a lack of data concerning the safety and efficacy of e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation therapy, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>able evidence showed no significant difference in adverse event rates between e-cigarettes and the nicotine patch.

Biosynthesis of Diterpenoids in <i>Tripterygium</i> Adventitious Root Cultures
<p>Adventitious root cultures were developed from <i>Tripterygium regelii</i>, and growth conditions were optimized for the abundant production of diterpenoids, which can be collected directly from the medium. An analysis of publicly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>able transcriptome data sets collected with <i>T. regelii</i> roots and root cultures indicated the presence of a large gene family (with 20 members) for terpene synthases (TPSs). Nine candidate diterpene synthase genes were selected for follow-up functional evaluation, of which two belonged to the TPS-c, three to the TPS-e/f, and four to the TPS-b subfamilies. These genes were characterized by heterologous expression in a modular metabolic engineering system in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. Members of the TPS-c subfamily were characterized as copalyl diphosphate (diterpene) synthases, and those belonging to the TPS-e/f subfamily catalyzed the formation of precursors of kaurane diterpenoids. The TPS-b subfamily encompassed genes coding for enzymes involved in abietane diterpenoid biosynthesis and others with activities as monoterpene synthases. The structural characterization of diterpenoids accumulating in the medium of <i>T. regelii</i> adventitious root cultures, facilitated by searching the Spektraris online spectral database, enabled us to formulate a biosynthetic pathway for the biosynthesis of triptolide, a diterpenoid with pharmaceutical potential. Considering the significant enrichment of diterpenoids in the culture medium, fast-growing adventitious root cultures may hold promise as a sustainable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resourc</span></strong>e for the large-scale production of triptolide.</p>

Pipeline to Identify Hydroxyproline-Rich Glycoproteins
<p>Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are functional proteins that lack a well-defined three-dimensional structure. The study of IDPs is a rapidly growing area as the crucial biological functions of more of these proteins are uncovered. In plants, IDPs are implicated in plant stress responses, signaling, and regulatory processes. A superfamily of cell wall proteins, the hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGPs), have characteristic features of IDPs. Their protein backbones are rich in the disordering amino acid proline, they contain repeated sequence motifs and extensive posttranslational modifications (glycosylation), and they have been implicated in many biological functions. HRGPs are evolutionarily ancient, having been isolated from the protein-rich walls of chlorophyte algae to the cellulose-rich walls of embryophytes. Examination of HRGPs in a range of plant species should provide valuable insights into how they have evolved. Commonly divided into the arabinogalactan proteins, extensins, and proline-rich proteins, in reality, a continuum of structures exists within this diverse and heterogenous superfamily. An inability to accurately classify HRGPs leads to inconsistent gene ontologies limiting the identification of HRGP classes in existing and emerging omics data sets. We present a novel and robust motif and amino acid bias (MAAB) bioinformatics pipeline to classify HRGPs into 23 descriptive subclasses. Validation of MAAB was achieved using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>able genomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resourc</span></strong>es and then applied to the 1000 Plants transcriptome project (<ext-link>www.onekp.com</ext-link>) data set. Significant improvement in the detection of HRGPs using multiple-<i>k-</i>mer transcriptome assembly methodology was observed. The MAAB pipeline is readily adaptable and can be modified to optimize the recovery of IDPs from other organisms.</p>

Genome-Wide Prediction of Metabolic Enzymes, Pathways, and Gene Clusters in Plants
<p>Plant metabolism underpins many traits of ecological and agronomic importance. Plants produce numerous compounds to cope with their environments but the biosynthetic pathways for most of these compounds have not yet been elucidated. To engineer and improve metabolic traits, we need comprehensive and accurate knowledge of the organization and regulation of plant metabolism at the genome scale. Here, we present a computational pipeline to identify metabolic enzymes, pathways, and gene clusters from a sequenced genome. Using this pipeline, we generated metabolic pathway databases for 22 species and identified metabolic gene clusters from 18 species. This unified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resourc</span></strong>e can be used to conduct a wide array of comparative studies of plant metabolism. Using the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resourc</span></strong>e, we discovered a widespread occurrence of metabolic gene clusters in plants: 11,969 clusters from 18 species. The prevalence of metabolic gene clusters offers an intriguing possibility of an untapped source for uncovering new metabolite biosynthesis pathways. For example, more than 1,700 clusters contain enzymes that could generate a specialized metabolite scaffold (signature enzymes) and enzymes that modify the scaffold (tailoring enzymes). In four species with sufficient gene expression data, we identified 43 highly coexpressed clusters that contain signature and tailoring enzymes, of which eight were characterized previously to be functional pathways. Finally, we identified patterns of genome organization that implicate local gene duplication and, to a lesser extent, single gene transposition as having played roles in the evolution of plant metabolic gene clusters.</p>

Metabolic Control of Tobacco Pollination by Sugars and Invertases
<p>Pollination in flowering plants is initiated by germination of pollen grains on stigmas followed by fast growth of pollen tubes representing highly energy-consuming processes. The symplastic isolation of pollen grains and tubes requires import of Suc <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>able in the apoplast. We show that the functional coupling of Suc cleavage by invertases and uptake of the released hexoses by monosaccharide transporters are critical for pollination in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>). Transcript profiling, in situ hybridization, and immunolocalization of extracellular invertases and two monosaccharide transporters in vitro and in vivo support the functional coupling in supplying carbohydrates for pollen germination and tube growth evidenced by spatiotemporally coordinated expression. Detection of vacuolar invertases in maternal tissues by these approaches revealed metabolic cross talk between male and female tissues and supported the requirement for carbohydrate supply in transmitting tissue during pollination. Tissue-specific expression of an invertase inhibitor and addition of the chemical invertase inhibitor miglitol strongly reduced extracellular invertase activity and impaired pollen germination. Measurements of (competitive) uptake of labeled sugars identified two import pathways for exogenously <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>able Suc into the germinating pollen operating in parallel: direct Suc uptake and via the hexoses after cleavage by extracellular invertase. Reduction of extracellular invertase activity in pollen decreases Suc uptake and severely compromises pollen germination. We further demonstrate that Glc as sole carbon source is sufficient for pollen germination, whereas Suc is supporting tube growth, revealing an important regulatory role of both the invertase substrate and products contributing to a potential metabolic and signaling-based multilayer regulation of pollination by carbohydrates.</p>

Starch Turnover and Metabolism during Flower and Early Embryo Development
<p>The accumulation of starch within photosynthetic tissues and within dedicated storage organs has been characterized extensively in many species, and a function in buffering carbon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>ability or in fueling later growth phases, respectively, has been proposed. However, developmentally regulated starch turnover within heterotrophic tissues other than dedicated storage organs is poorly characterized, and its function is not well understood. Here, we report on the characterization of starch turnover during flower, early embryo, and silique development in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) using a combined clearing-staining technique on whole-mount tissue. Besides the two previously documented waves of transient starch accumulation in the stamen envelope, occurring during meiosis and pollen mitosis I, we identified a novel, third wave of starch amylogenesis/amylolysis during the last stages of stamen development. To gain insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms, we analyzed publicly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>able microarray data, which revealed a developmentally coordinated expression of carbohydrate transport and metabolism genes during these waves of transient starch accumulation. Based on this analysis, we characterized starch dynamics in mutants affecting hexose phosphate metabolism and translocation, and identified the Glc-6-phosphate/phosphate antiporter GPT1 as the putative translocator of Glc-6-phosphate for starch biosynthesis in reproductive tissues. Based on these results, we propose a model of starch synthesis within the pollen grain and discuss the nutrient transport route feeding the embryo within the developing seed.</p>

The HvNramp5 Transporter Mediates Uptake of Cadmium and Manganese, But Not Iron
<p>The Natural Resistance Associated Macrophage Protein (Nramp) represents a transporter family for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> ions in all organisms. Here, we functionally characterized a member of Nramp family in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), HvNramp5. This member showed different expression patterns, transport substrate specificity, and cellular localization from its close homolog in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), OsNramp5, although HvNramp5 was also localized to the plasma membrane. <i>HvNramp5</i> was mainly expressed in the roots and its expression was not affected by Cd and deficiency of Zn, Cu, and Mn, but slightly up-regulated by Fe deficiency. Spatial expression analysis showed that the expression of <i>HvNramp5</i> was higher in the root tips than that in the basal root regions. Furthermore, analysis with laser microdissection revealed higher expression of <i>HvNramp5</i> in the outer root cell layers. HvNramp5 showed transport activity for both Mn<sup>2+</sup> and Cd<sup>2+</sup>, but not for Fe<sup>2+</sup> when expressed in yeast. Immunostaining with a HvNramp5 antibody showed that this protein was localized in the root epidermal cells without polarity. Knockdown of <i>HvNramp5</i> in barley resulted in a significant reduction in the seedling growth at low Mn supply, but this reduction was rescued at high Mn supply. The concentration of Mn and Cd, but not other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s including Cu, Zn, and Fe, was decreased in both the roots and shoots of knockdown lines compared with the wild-type barley. These results indicate that HvNramp5 is a transporter required for uptake of Mn and Cd, but not for Fe, and that barley has a distinct uptake system from rice.</p>

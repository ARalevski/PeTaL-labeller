Differential effects of vitamins E and C and carotenoids on growth, resistance to oxidative stress, fledging success and plumage colouration in wild great tits
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress is the imbalance between the production of reactive species and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong></span></strong>ants, which causes damage to lipids, proteins and DNA. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong></span></strong>ants, like vitamins and carotenoids, can limit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative damage and can therefore regulate the trade-off between growth, which is a period of high reactive species production, and self-maintenance. However, the role of carotenoids as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong></span></strong>ants <i>in vivo</i> has been debated, and it has been suggested that carotenoid-based signals indicate the availability of non-pigmentary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong></span></strong>ants (e.g. vitamins) that protect carotenoids from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation, known as the ‘protection hypothesis’. To evaluate the importance of vitamins versus carotenoids as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong></span></strong>ants during growth and to test the protection hypothesis, we supplemented nestling great tits, <i>Parus major</i>, 3, 5 and 7 days after hatching with a single dose of carotenoids and/or vitamins in a 2×2 full-factorial design. We subsequently measured body condition, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong></span></strong>ant capacity, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative damage, fledging success and plumage reflectance. Vitamins enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong></span></strong>ant capacity, but did not affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative damage. Vitamin-treated nestlings had higher growth rates and higher probability of fledging. In contrast, carotenoids did not affect any of these traits. Furthermore, carotenoid-based colouration increased over the breeding season in nestlings that received vitamins only. This study shows that vitamins are limiting for growth rate and fledging success, and suggests that vitamins could regulate the trade-off between growth and self-maintenance in favour of the former. Moreover, our results are consistent with the idea that carotenoids are minor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong></span></strong>ants in birds, but they do not support the protection hypothesis.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Carnosic Acid and Carnosol, Two Major Antioxidants of Rosemary, Act through Different Mechanisms
<p>Carnosic acid, a phenolic diterpene specific to the Lamiaceae family, is highly abundant in rosemary (<i>Rosmarinus officinalis</i>). Despite numerous industrial and medicinal/pharmaceutical applications of its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong></span></strong>ative features, this compound in planta and its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong></span></strong>ant mechanism have received little attention, except a few studies of rosemary plants under natural conditions. In vitro analyses, using high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet and luminescence imaging, revealed that carnosic acid and its major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized derivative, carnosol, protect lipids from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation. Both compounds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">preserv</span></strong>ed linolenic acid and monogalactosyldiacylglycerol from singlet oxygen and from hydroxyl radical. When applied exogenously, they were both able to protect thylakoid membranes prepared from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves against lipid per<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation. Different levels of carnosic acid and carnosol in two contrasting rosemary varieties correlated with tolerance to lipid per<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation. Upon reactive oxygen species (ROS) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation of lipids, carnosic acid was consumed and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized into various derivatives, including into carnosol, while carnosol resisted, suggesting that carnosic acid is a chemical quencher of ROS. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong></span></strong>ative function of carnosol relies on another mechanism, occurring directly in the lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation process. Under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative conditions that did not involve ROS generation, carnosol inhibited lipid per<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation, contrary to carnosic acid. Using spin probes and electron paramagnetic resonance detection, we confirmed that carnosic acid, rather than carnosol, is a ROS quencher. Various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized derivatives of carnosic acid were detected in rosemary leaves in low light, indicating chronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation of this compound, and accumulated in plants exposed to stress conditions, in parallel with a loss of carnosic acid, confirming that chemical quenching of ROS by carnosic acid takes place in planta.</p>

Proteome-Wide Analysis of Cysteine Reactivity during Effector-Triggered Immunity
<p>A surge in the accumulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ants generates shifts in the cellular redox potential during early stages of plant infection with pathogens and activation of effector-triggered immunity (ETI). The redoxome, defined as the proteome-wide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative modifications of proteins caused by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ants, has a well-known impact on stress responses in metazoans. However, the identity of proteins and the residues sensitive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation during the plant immune response remain largely unknown. Previous studies of the thimet oligopeptidases TOP1 and TOP2 placed them in the salicylic acid dependent branch of ETI, with a current model wherein TOPs sustain interconnected organellar and cytosolic pathways that modulate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative burst and development of cell death. Herein, we characterized the ETI redoxomes in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) wild-type Col-0 and <i>top1top2</i> mutant plants using a differential alkylation-based enrichment technique coupled with label-free mass spectrometry-based quantification. We identified cysteines sensitive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation in a wide range of protein families at multiple time points after pathogen infection. Differences were detected between Col-0 and <i>top1top2</i> redoxomes regarding the identity and number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized cysteines, and the amplitude of time-dependent fluctuations in protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation. Our results support a determining role for TOPs in maintaining the proper level and dynamics of proteome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation during ETI. This study significantly expands the repertoire of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation-sensitive plant proteins and can guide future mechanistic studies.</p>

Structure Annotation and Quantification of Wheat Seed Oxidized Lipids by High-Resolution LC-MS/MS
<p>Lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation is a process ubiquitous in life, but the direct and comprehensive analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized lipids has been limited by available analytical methods. We applied high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to quantify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized lipids (glycerides, fatty acids, phospholipids, lysophospholipids, and galactolipids) and implemented a platform-independent high-throughput-amenable analysis pipeline for the high-confidence annotation and acyl composition analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized lipids. Lipid contents of 90 different naturally aged wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) seed stocks were quantified in an untargeted high-resolution LC-MS experiment, resulting in 18,556 quantitative mass-to-charge ratio features. In a posthoc liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry experiment, high-resolution MS/MS spectra (5 mD accuracy) were recorded for 8,957 out of 12,080 putatively monoisotopic features of the LC-MS data set. A total of 353 non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized and 559 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized lipids with up to four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ional oxygen atoms were annotated based on the accurate mass recordings (1.5 ppm tolerance) of the LC-MS data set and filtering procedures. MS/MS spectra available for 828 of these annotations were analyzed by translating experimentally known fragmentation rules of lipids into the fragmentation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized lipids. This led to the identification of 259 non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized and 365 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized lipids by both accurate mass and MS/MS spectra and to the determination of acyl compositions for 221 non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized and 295 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized lipids. Analysis of 15-year aged wheat seeds revealed increased lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation and hydrolysis in seeds stored in ambient versus cold conditions.</p>

Mediterranean Diet Improves High-Density Lipoprotein Function in High-Cardiovascular-Risk Individuals
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The biological functions of high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) contribute to explaining the cardioprotective role of the lipoprotein beyond quantitative HDL cholesterol levels. A few small-scale interventions with a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong></span></strong>ant have improved some HDL functions.

Oxidation of Translation Factor EF-Tu Inhibits the Repair of Photosystem II<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The repair of photosystem II (PSII) is particularly sensitive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress and the inhibition of repair is associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative damage to the translational elongation system in the cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this inhibition are unknown. We previously demonstrated in vitro that EF-Tu, a translation factor that delivers aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosome, is inactivated by reactive oxygen species via <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation of the Cys residue Cys-82. In this study, we examined the physiological role of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation of EF-Tu in <i>Synechocystis</i>. Under strong light, EF-Tu was rapidly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized to yield <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized monomers in vivo. We generated a <i>Synechocystis</i> transformant that expressed mutated EF-Tu in which Cys-82 had been replaced with a Ser residue. Under strong light, the de novo synthesis of proteins that are required for PSII repair, such as D1, was enhanced in the transformant and photoinhibition of PSII was alleviated. However, photodamage to PSII, measured in the presence of lincomycin, was similar between the transformant and wild-type cells, suggesting that expression of mutated EF-Tu might enhance the repair of PSII. Alleviating photoinhibition through mutation of EF-Tu did not alter cell growth under strong light, perhaps due to the enhanced production of reactive oxygen species. These observations suggest that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation of EF-Tu under strong light inhibits PSII repair, resulting in the stimulation of photoinhibition.</p>

Activation of the cnidarian oxidative stress response by ultraviolet radiation, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and crude oil
<p>Organisms are continuously exposed to reactive chemicals capable of causing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress and cellular damage. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong></span></strong>ant enzymes, such as super<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e dismutases (SODs) and catalases, are present in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes and provide an important means of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong>izing such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ants. Studies in cnidarians have previously documented the occurrence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong></span></strong>ant enzymes (transcript expression, protein expression and/or enzymatic activity), but most of these studies have not been conducted in species with sequenced genomes or included phylogenetic analyses, making it difficult to compare results across species due to uncertainties in the relationships between genes. Through searches of the genome of the sea anemone <i>Nematostella vectensis</i> Stephenson, one catalase gene and six SOD family members were identified, including three copper/zinc-containing SODs (CuZnSODs), two manganese-containing SODs (MnSODs) and one copper chaperone of SOD (CCS). In 24 h acute toxicity tests, juvenile <i>N. vectensis</i> showed enhanced sensitivity to combinations of ultraviolet radiation (UV) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs, specifically pyrene, benzo[a]pyrene and fluoranthene) relative to either stressor alone. Adult <i>N. vectensis</i> exhibited little or no mortality following UV, benzo[a]pyrene or crude oil exposure but exhibited changes in gene expression. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong></span></strong>ant enzyme transcripts were both upregulated and downregulated following UV and/or chemical exposure. Expression patterns were most strongly affected by UV exposure but varied between experiments, suggesting that responses vary according to the intensity and duration of exposure. These experiments provide a basis for comparison with other cnidarian taxa and for further studies of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress response in <i>N. vectensis.</i></p>

ATM directs DNA damage responses and proteostasis via genetically separable pathways
<p>The protein kinase ATM is a master regulator of the DNA damage response but also responds directly to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress. Loss of ATM causes ataxia telangiectasia, a neurodegenerative disorder with pleiotropic symptoms that include cerebellar dysfunction, cancer, diabetes, and premature aging. We genetically separated the activation of ATM by DNA damage from that by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress using separation-of-function mutations. We found that deficient activation of ATM by the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex and DNA double-strand breaks resulted in loss of cell viability, checkpoint activation, and DNA end resection in response to DNA damage. In contrast, loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative activation of ATM had minimal effects on DNA damage–related outcomes but blocked ATM-mediated initiation of checkpoint responses after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress and resulted in deficiencies in mitochondrial function and autophagy. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, expression of a variant ATM incapable of activation by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress resulted in widespread protein aggregation. These results indicate a direct relationship between the mechanism of ATM activation and its effects on cellular metabolism and DNA damage responses in human cells and implicate ATM in the control of protein homeostasis.</p>

Hawkmoths use nectar sugar to reduce oxidative damage from flight
<p>Nectar-feeding animals have among the highest recorded metabolic rates. High aerobic performance is linked to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative damage in muscles. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong></span></strong>ants in nectar are scarce to nonexistent. We propose that nectarivores use nectar sugar to mitigate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative damage caused by the muscular demands of flight. We found that sugar-fed moths had lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative damage to their flight muscle membranes than unfed moths. Using respirometry coupled with δ<sup>13</sup>C analyses, we showed that moths generate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong></span></strong>ant potential by shunting nectar glucose to the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), resulting in a reduction in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative damage to the flight muscles. We suggest that nectar feeding, the use of PPP, and intense exercise are causally linked and have allowed the evolution of powerful fliers that feed on nectar.</p>

What Quantity of Photosystem I Is Optimum for Safe Photosynthesis?
<p>PSI has the potential to generate reactive oxygen species and be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>atively inactivated by the reactive oxygen species. The photo-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative damage of PSI (also called PSI photoinhibition) causes the inhibition of the plant growth and is a lethal event for plants. It has been reported that PSI photoinhibition does not occur as long as the reaction-center chlorophyll (P700) remains <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized, even in excess light conditions. This process is termed P700 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation and is supported by various regulatory mechanisms and likely also by the stoichiometric quantities of photosynthetic apparatus. In this study, we assessed how decreased photochemically active PSI in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) affected a variety of photosynthetic parameters, including P700 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation. Inactivation of PSI was rapidly and selectively induced by repetitive short-pulse illumination. PSI photoinhibition correlated linearly with decreases in effective quantum yield of PSII and nonphotochemical quenching; however, the photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate was less affected, as exemplified by ∼50% of the normal CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate maintained with an 80% loss in PSI photochemical activity. In contrast, effective quantum yield of PSI was enhanced following PSI photoinhibition, mainly owing to a decrease in the electron donor-side limitation of PSI. Based on these results, we propose that the stoichiometric quantity of PSI is optimized to induce P700 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation for dissipating excess light energy in PSI, thus avoiding inhibition of photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation caused by PSI photoinhibition.</p>

The detoxification of such aldehydes by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation is attributed to aldehyde dehydrogenases but never to aldehyde <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ases. The feasibility of the detoxification of aldehydes in siliques via <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation by AAO4 was demonstrated, first, by its ability to efficiently <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ize an array of aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes, including the reactive carbonyl species (RCS) acrolein, hydroxyl-2-nonenal, and malondialdehyde. Next, exogenous application of several aldehydes to siliques in AAO4 knockout (KO) Arabidopsis plants induced severe tissue damage and enhanced malondialdehyde levels and senescence symptoms, but not in wild-type siliques. Furthermore, abiotic stresses such as dark and ultraviolet C irradiation caused an increase in endogenous RCS and higher expression levels of senescence marker genes, leading to premature senescence of KO siliques, whereas RCS and senescence marker levels in wild-type siliques were hardly affected. Finally, in naturally senesced KO siliques, higher endogenous RCS levels were associated with enhanced senescence molecular markers, chlorophyll degradation, and earlier seed shattering compared with the wild type. The aldehyde-dependent differential generation of super<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e and hydrogen per<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e by AAO4 and the induction of AAO4 expression by hydrogen per<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e shown here suggest a self-amplification mechanism for detoxifying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ional reactive aldehydes produced during stress. Taken together, our results indicate that AAO4 plays a critical role in delaying senescence in siliques by catalyzing aldehyde detoxification.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Xylem Surfactants Introduce a New Element to the Cohesion-Tension Theory
<p>Vascular plants transport water under negative pressure without constantly creating gas bubbles that would disable their hydraulic systems. Attempts to replicate this feat in artificial systems almost invariably result in bubble formation, except under highly controlled conditions with pure water and only hydrophilic surfaces present. In theory, conditions in the xylem should favor bubble nucleation even more: there are millions of conduits with at least some hydrophobic surfaces, and xylem sap is saturated or sometimes supersaturated with atmospheric gas and may contain surface-active molecules that can lower surface tension. So how do plants transport water under negative pressure? Here, we show that angiosperm xylem contains abundant hydrophobic surfaces as well as insoluble lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfact</span></strong>ants, including phospholipids, and proteins, a composition similar to pulmonary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfact</span></strong>ants. Lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfact</span></strong>ants were found in xylem sap and as nanoparticles under transmission electron microscopy in pores of intervessel pit membranes and deposited on vessel wall surfaces. Nanoparticles observed in xylem sap via nanoparticle-tracking analysis included <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfact</span></strong>ant-coated nanobubbles when examined by freeze-fracture electron microscopy. Based on their fracture behavior, this technique is able to distinguish between dense-core particles, liquid-filled, bilayer-coated vesicles/liposomes, and gas-filled bubbles. Xylem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfact</span></strong>ants showed strong surface activity that reduces surface tension to low values when concentrated as they are in pit membrane pores. We hypothesize that xylem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surfact</span></strong>ants support water transport under negative pressure as explained by the cohesion-tension theory by coating hydrophobic surfaces and nanobubbles, thereby keeping the latter below the critical size at which bubbles would expand to form embolisms.</p>

Wide Variation in Reported Rates of Stroke Across Cohorts of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Oral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anticoagul</span></strong>ants decrease ischemic stroke rates in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) but increase the risk of bleeding. For the average patient with AF, the threshold of annual ischemic stroke rate where the benefit of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anticoagul</span></strong>ation outweighs the bleeding risk (net clinical benefit) has been shown to be ≈1% to 2%. Guideline recommendations for oral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anticoagul</span></strong>ants in AF are based on the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc stroke risk point scores, assuming that those scores translate to fixed stroke rates. However, the relationship between stroke point scores and annual stroke rates may vary substantially across populations. We sought to comprehensively assess the reported rates of stroke in patients with AF and the relationship of stroke rates to stroke risk point scores.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A systematic review of cohort studies and randomized controlled trials enrolled patients with nonvalvular AF not treated with oral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anticoagul</span></strong>ants.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of the 3552 studies screened, we identified 34 studies eligible for analysis. Overall stroke rates in cohort studies were highly heterogeneous (Q=5706.54, <i>P</i><0.001; I<sup>2</sup> = 99.6%) and ranged from 0.45% to 9.28% per year, despite being of similar objective study quality. The mean North American stroke rate was less than one-third that of the mean European stroke rate (<i>P</i><0.0001). However, a random effects regression indicated that between-study variability was not significantly accounted for by cohort region, prospective versus retrospective design, calendar year of study, or outcome event cluster. At a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score of 1, 76% of cohorts reported ischemic stroke rates <1% per year and only 18% of cohorts reported a stroke rate >2% per year. At a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score of 2, 27% of cohorts reported stroke rates below 1% per year, 40% reported stroke rates between 1 and 2% per year, and 33% reported stroke rates >2% per year.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Substantial variation exists across cohorts in overall stroke rates and rates corresponding to CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc point scores. These variations can affect the point score threshold for recommending oral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anticoagul</span></strong>ants in AF. The majority of cohorts did not observe stroke rates that would indicate a clear expected net clinical benefit for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anticoagul</span></strong>ating AF patients with CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc scores of 1 or 2.</p></sec>

Reactive oxygen species induce virus-independent MAVS oligomerization in systemic lupus erythematosus
<p>The increased expression of genes induced by type I interferon (IFN) is characteristic of viral infections and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We showed that mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) protein, which normally forms a complex with retinoic acid gene I (RIG-I)–like helicases during viral infection, was activated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress independently of RIG-I helicases. We found that chemically generated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress stimulated the formation of MAVS oligomers, which led to mitochondrial hyperpolarization and decreased adenosine triphosphate production and spare respiratory capacity, responses that were not observed in similarly treated cells lacking MAVS. Peripheral blood lymphocytes of SLE patients also showed spontaneous MAVS oligomerization that correlated with the increased secretion of type I IFN and mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress. Furthermore, inhibition of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) by the mitochondria-targeted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong></span></strong>ant MitoQ prevented MAVS oligomerization and type I IFN production. ROS-dependent MAVS oligomerization and type I IFN production were reduced in cells expressing the MAVS-C79F variant, which occurs in 30% of sub-Saharan Africans and is linked with reduced type I IFN secretion and milder disease in SLE patients. Patients expressing the MAVS-C79F variant also had reduced amounts of oligomerized MAVS in their plasma compared to healthy controls. Together, our findings suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress–induced MAVS oligomerization in SLE patients may contribute to the type I IFN signature that is characteristic of this syndrome.</p>

Laser cooling of ions in a neutral plasma
<p>Laser cooling of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong> plasma is a challenging task because of the high temperatures typically associated with the plasma state. By using an ultracold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong> plasma created by photoionization of an ultracold atomic gas, we avoid this obstacle and demonstrate laser cooling of ions in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong> plasma. After 135 microseconds of cooling, we observed a reduction in ion temperature by up to a factor of four, with the temperature reaching as low as 50(4) millikelvin. This pushes laboratory studies of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong> plasmas deeper into the strongly coupled regime, beyond the limits of validity of current kinetic theories for calculating transport properties. The same optical forces also retard the plasma expansion, opening avenues for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong>-plasma confinement and manipulation.</p>

A liquid metal reaction environment for the room-temperature synthesis of atomically thin metal oxides
<p>Two-dimensional (2D) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>es have a wide variety of applications in electronics and other technologies. However, many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>es are not easy to synthesize as 2D materials through conventional methods. We used nontoxic eutectic gallium-based alloys as a reaction solvent and co-alloyed desired metals into the melt. On the basis of thermodynamic considerations, we predicted the composition of the self-limiting interfacial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e. We isolated the surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e as a 2D layer, either on substrates or in suspension. This enabled us to produce extremely thin subnanometer layers of HfO<sub>2</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and Gd<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. The liquid metal–based reaction route can be used to create 2D materials that were previously inaccessible with preexisting methods.

Photochemical Route for Accessing Amorphous Metal Oxide Materials for Water Oxidation Catalysis

Protein Carbonylation and Glycation in Legume Nodules
<p>Nitrogen fixation is an agronomically and environmentally important process catalyzed by bacterial nitrogenase within legume root nodules. These unique symbiotic organs have high metabolic rates and produce large amounts of reactive oxygen species that may modify proteins irreversibly. Here, we examined two types of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative posttranslational modifications of nodule proteins: carbonylation, which occurs by direct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation of certain amino acids or by interaction with reactive aldehydes arising from cell membrane lipid per<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>es; and glycation, which results from the reaction of lysine and arginine residues with reducing sugars or their auto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation products. We used a strategy based on the enrichment of carbonylated peptides by affinity chromatography followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify 369 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized proteins in bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>) nodules. Of these, 238 corresponded to plant proteins and 131 to bacterial proteins. Lipid per<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation products induced most carbonylation sites. This study also revealed that carbonylation has major effects on two key nodule proteins. Metal-catalyzed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation caused the inactivation of malate dehydrogenase and the aggregation of leghemoglobin. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, numerous glycated proteins were identified in vivo, including three key nodule proteins: sucrose synthase, glutamine synthetase, and glutamate synthase. Label-free quantification identified 10 plant proteins and 18 bacterial proteins as age-specifically glycated. Overall, our results suggest that the selective carbonylation or glycation of crucial proteins involved in nitrogen metabolism, transcriptional regulation, and signaling may constitute a mechanism to control cell metabolism and nodule senescence.</p>

The Tomato Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase SlMPK1 Is as a Negative Regulator of the High-Temperature Stress Response
<p>High-temperature (HT) stress is a major environmental stress that limits plant growth and development. MAPK cascades play key roles in plant growth and stress signaling, but their involvement in the HT stress response is poorly understood. Here, we describe a 47-kD MBP-phosphorylated protein (p47-MBPK) activated in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) leaves under HT and identify it as SlMPK1 by tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Silencing of <i>SlMPK1</i> in transgenic tomato plants resulted in enhanced tolerance to HT, while overexpression resulted in reduced tolerance. Proteomic analysis identified a set of proteins involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong></span></strong>ant defense that are significantly more abundant in RNA interference-<i>SlMPK1</i> plants than nontransgenic plants under HT stress. RNA interference-<i>SlMPK1</i> plants also showed changes in membrane lipid per<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong></span></strong>ant enzyme activities. Furthermore, using yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified a serine-proline-rich protein homolog, SlSPRH1, which interacts with SlMPK1 in yeast, in plant cells, and in vitro. We demonstrate that SlMPK1 can directly phosphorylate SlSPRH1. Furthermore, the serine residue serine-44 of SlSPRH1 is a crucial phosphorylation site in the SlMPK1-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong></span></strong>ant defense mechanism activated during HT stress. We also demonstrate that heterologous expression of <i>SlSPRH1</i> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) led to a decrease in thermotolerance and lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong></span></strong>ant capacity. Taken together, our results suggest that SlMPK1 is a negative regulator of thermotolerance in tomato plants. SlMPK1 acts by regulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong></span></strong>ant defense, and its substrate SlSPRH1 is involved in this pathway.</p>

A Putative Protein <i>O</i>-Fucosyltransferase Facilitates Pollen Tube Penetration through the Stigma<i>–</i>Style Interface
<p>During pollen-pistil interactions in angiosperms, the male gametophyte (pollen) germinates to produce a pollen tube. To fertilize ovules located within the female pistil, the pollen tube must physically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">penetr</span></strong>ate specialized tissues. Whereas the process of pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">penetr</span></strong>ation through the pistil has been anatomically well described, the genetic regulation remains poorly understood. In this study, we identify a novel Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) gene, <i>O-FUCOSYLTRANSFERASE1</i> (<i>AtOFT1</i>), which plays a key role in pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">penetr</span></strong>ation through the stigma-style interface. Semi-in vivo growth assays demonstrate that <i>oft1</i> mutant pollen tubes have a reduced ability to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">penetr</span></strong>ate the stigma-style interface, leading to a nearly 2,000-fold decrease in <i>oft1</i> pollen transmission efficiency and a 5- to 10-fold decreased seed set. We also demonstrate that AtOFT1 is localized to the Golgi apparatus, indicating its potential role in cellular glycosylation events. Finally, we demonstrate that <i>AtOFT1</i> and other similar Arabidopsis genes represent a novel clade of sequences related to metazoan protein <i>O</i>-fucosyltransferases and that mutation of residues that are important for <i>O</i>-fucosyltransferase activity compromises AtOFT1 function in vivo. The results of this study elucidate a physiological function for AtOFT1 in pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">penetr</span></strong>ation through the stigma-style interface and highlight the potential importance of protein <i>O</i>-glycosylation events in pollen-pistil interactions.</p>

Cytosolic and Chloroplastic DHARs Cooperate in Oxidative Stress-Driven Activation of the Salicylic Acid Pathway
<p>The complexity of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong></span></strong>ative systems gives rise to many unresolved questions. One relates to the functional importance of dehydroascorbate reductases (DHARs) in interactions between ascorbate and glutathione. To investigate this issue, we produced a complete set of loss-of-function mutants for the three annotated Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) DHARs. The combined loss of <i>DHAR1</i> and <i>DHAR3</i> expression decreased extractable activity to very low levels but had little effect on phenotype or ascorbate and glutathione pools in standard conditions. An analysis of the subcellular localization of the DHARs in Arabidopsis lines stably transformed with GFP fusion proteins revealed that DHAR1 and DHAR2 are cytosolic while DHAR3 is chloroplastic, with no evidence for peroxisomal or mitochondrial localizations. When the mutations were introduced into an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress genetic background (<i>cat2</i>), the <i>dhar1 dhar2</i> combination decreased glutathione <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation and inhibited <i>cat2</i>-triggered induction of the salicylic acid pathway. These effects were reversed in <i>cat2 dhar1 dhar2 dhar3</i> complemented with any of the three DHARs. The data suggest that (1) DHAR can be decreased to negligible levels without marked effects on ascorbate pools, (2) the cytosolic isoforms are particularly important in coupling intracellular hydrogen per<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e metabolism to glutathione <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation, and (3) DHAR-dependent glutathione <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation influences redox-driven salicylic acid accumulation.</p>

Ferredoxin:NADP(H) Oxidoreductase Abundance and Location Influences Redox Poise and Stress Tolerance
<p>In linear photosynthetic electron transport, ferredoxin:NADP(H) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>oreductase (FNR) transfers electrons from ferredoxin (Fd) to NADP<sup>+</sup>. Both NADPH and reduced Fd (Fd<sup>red</sup>) are required for reductive assimilation and light/dark activation/deactivation of enzymes. FNR is therefore a hub, connecting photosynthetic electron transport to chloroplast redox metabolism. A correlation between FNR content and tolerance to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress is well established, although the precise mechanism remains unclear. We investigated the impact of altered FNR content and localization on electron transport and super<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e radical evolution in isolated thylakoids, and probed resulting changes in redox homeostasis, expression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress markers, and tolerance to high light in planta. Our data indicate that the ratio of Fd<sup>red</sup> to FNR is critical, with either too much or too little FNR potentially leading to increased super<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e production, and perception of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress at the level of gene transcription. In FNR overexpressing plants, which show more NADP(H) and glutathione pools, improved tolerance to high-light stress indicates that disturbance of chloroplast redox poise and increased free radical generation may help “prime” the plant and induce protective mechanisms. In <i>fnr1</i> knock-outs, the NADP(H) and glutathione pools are more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized relative to the wild type, and the photoprotective effect is absent despite perception of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress at the level of gene transcription.</p>

High basal metabolic rate does not elevate oxidative stress during reproduction in laboratory mice
<p>Increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress (OS) has been suggested as a physiological cost of reproduction. However, previous studies reported ambiguous results, with some even showing a reduction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative damage during reproduction. We tested whether the link between reproduction and OS is mediated by basal metabolic rate (BMR), which has been hypothesized to affect both the rate of radical oxygen species production and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong></span></strong>ative capacity. We studied the effect of reproduction on OS in females of laboratory mice divergently selected for high (H-BMR) and low (L-BMR) BMR, previously shown to differ with respect to parental investment. Non-reproducing L-BMR females showed higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative damage to lipids (quantified as the level of malondialdehyde in internal organ tissues) and DNA (quantified as the level of 8-oxodG in blood serum) than H-BMR females. Reproduction did not affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative damage to lipids in either line; however, it reduced damage to DNA in L-BMR females. Reproduction increased catalase activity in liver (significantly stronger in L-BMR females) and decreased it in kidneys. We conclude that the effect of reproduction on OS depends on the initial variation in BMR and varies between studied internal organs and markers of OS.</p>

Skeletal muscle fuel selection occurs at the mitochondrial level
<p>Mammals exponentially increase the rate of carbohydrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation as exercise intensity rises, while birds combust lipid almost exclusively while flying at high percentages of aerobic capacity. The fuel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized by contracting muscle depends on many factors: whole-body fuel storage mass, mobilization, blood transport, cellular uptake, and substrate selection at the level of the mitochondrion. We examined the fuel preferences of mitochondria isolated from mammalian and avian locomotory muscles using two approaches. First, the influence of substrates on the kinetics of respiration (<i>K</i><sub>m,ADP</sub> and <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>) was evaluated. For all substrates and combinations, <i>K</i><sub>m,ADP</sub> was generally twofold higher in avian mitochondria. Second, fuel competition between pyruvate, glutamate and/or palmitoyl-<sc>l</sc>-carnitine at three levels of ATP free energy was determined using the principle of mass balance and the measured rates of O<sub>2</sub> consumption and metabolite accumulation/utilization. Avian mitochondria strongly spared pyruvate from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation when another substrate was available and fatty acid was the dominant substrate, regardless of energy state. Mammalian mitochondria exhibited some preference for fatty acid over pyruvate at lower flux (higher energy state), but exhibited a much greater tendency to select pyruvate and glutamate when available. Studies in sonicated mitochondria revealed twofold higher electron transport chain electron conductance in avian mitochondria. We conclude that substantial fuel selection occurs at the level of the mitochondrial matrix and that avian flight muscle mitochondria are particularly biased toward the selection of fatty acid, possibly by facilitating high β-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation flux by maintaining a more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized matrix.</p>

A radical approach to the copper oxidative addition problem: Trifluoromethylation of bromoarenes
<p>Transition metal–catalyzed arene functionalization has been widely used for molecular synthesis over the past century. In this arena, copper catalysis has long been considered a privileged platform due to the propensity of high-valent copper to undergo reductive elimination with a wide variety of coupling fragments. However, the sluggish nature of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion has limited copper’s capacity to broadly facilitate haloarene coupling protocols. Here, we demonstrate that this copper <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion problem can be overcome with an aryl radical–capture mechanism, wherein the aryl radical is generated through a silyl radical halogen abstraction. This strategy was applied to a general trifluoromethylation of aryl bromides through dual copper-photoredox catalysis. Mechanistic studies support the formation of an open-shell aryl species.</p>

Two-billion-year-old evaporites capture Earth’s great oxidation
<p>Major changes in atmospheric and ocean chemistry occurred in the Paleoproterozoic era (2.5 to 1.6 billion years ago). Increasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation dramatically changed Earth’s surface, but few quantitative constraints exist on this important transition. This study describes the sedimentology, mineralogy, and geochemistry of a 2-billion-year-old, ~800-meter-thick evaporite succession from the Onega Basin in Russian Karelia. The deposit consists of a basal unit dominated by halite (~100 meters) followed by units dominated by anhydrite-magnesite (~500 meters) and dolomite-magnesite (~200 meters). The evaporite minerals robustly constrain marine sulfate concentrations to at least 10 millimoles per kilogram of water, representing an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ant reservoir equivalent to more than 20% of the modern ocean-atmosphere <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>izing capacity. These results show that substantial amounts of surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ant accumulated during this critical transition in Earth’s oxygenation.</p>

Microbial oxidation of lithospheric organic carbon in rapidly eroding tropical mountain soils
<p>Lithospheric organic carbon (“petrogenic”; OC<sub>petro</sub>) is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized during exhumation and subsequent erosion of mountain ranges. This process is a considerable source of carbon di<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e (CO<sub>2</sub>) to the atmosphere over geologic time scales, but the mechanisms that govern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation rates in mountain landscapes are poorly constrained. We demonstrate that, on average, 67 ± 11% of the OC<sub>petro</sub> initially present in bedrock exhumed from the tropical, rapidly eroding Central Range of Taiwan is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized in soils, leading to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of 6.1 to 18.6 metric tons of carbon per square kilometer per year. The molecular and isotopic evolution of bulk OC and lipid biomarkers during soil formation reveals that OC<sub>petro</sub> remineralization is microbially mediated. Rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation in mountain soils drives CO<sub>2</sub> emission fluxes that increase with erosion rate, thereby counteracting CO<sub>2</sub> drawdown by silicate weathering and biospheric OC burial.</p>

Major role of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria in dark ocean carbon fixation
<p>Carbon fixation by chemoautotrophic microorganisms in the dark ocean has a major impact on global carbon cycling and ecological relationships in the ocean’s interior, but the relevant taxa and energy sources remain enigmatic. We show evidence that nitrite-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>izing bacteria affiliated with the Nitrospinae phylum are important in dark ocean chemoautotrophy. Single-cell genomics and community metagenomics revealed that Nitrospinae are the most abundant and globally distributed nitrite-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>izing bacteria in the ocean. Metaproteomics and metatranscriptomics analyses suggest that nitrite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation is the main pathway of energy production in Nitrospinae. Microautoradiography, linked with catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization, indicated that Nitrospinae fix 15 to 45% of inorganic carbon in the mesopelagic western North Atlantic. Nitrite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation may have a greater impact on the carbon cycle than previously assumed.</p>

Anti-Markovnikov alkene oxidation by metal-oxo–mediated enzyme catalysis

Structural basis of the redox switches in the NAD<sup>+</sup>-reducing soluble [NiFe]-hydrogenase
<p>NAD<sup>+</sup> (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized form of NAD:nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide)–reducing soluble [NiFe]-hydrogenase (SH) is phylogenetically related to NADH (reduced form of NAD<sup>+</sup>):quinone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>oreductase (complex I), but the geometrical arrangements of the subunits and Fe–S clusters are unclear. Here, we describe the crystal structures of SH in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized and reduced states. The cluster arrangement is similar to that of complex I, but the subunits orientation is not, which supports the hypothesis that subunits evolved as prebuilt modules. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized active site includes a six-coordinate Ni, which is unprecedented for hydrogenases, whose coordination geometry would prevent O<sub>2</sub> from approaching. In the reduced state showing the normal active site structure without a physiological electron acceptor, the flavin mononucleotide cofactor is dissociated, which may be caused by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation state change of nearby Fe–S clusters and may suppress production of reactive oxygen species.</p>

A Specific Glycogen Mobilization Strategy Enables Rapid Awakening of Dormant Cyanobacteria from Chlorosis
<p>Many organisms survive stressful conditions via entry into a dormant state that can be rapidly exited when the stressor disappears; this ability provides a strong selective advantage. In the cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803, the exit from nitrogen chlorosis takes less than 48 h and is enabled by the impressive metabolic flexibility of these cyanobacteria, which pass through heterotrophic and mixotrophic phases before reentering photoautotrophic growth. Switching between these states requires delicate coordination of carbohydrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation, CO<sub>2</sub> fixation, and photosynthesis. Here, we investigated the contribution of the different carbon catabolic routes by assessing mutants of these pathways during nitrogen chlorosis and resuscitation. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion of nitrate to nitrogen-starved cells rapidly starts the awakening program. Metabolism switches from maintenance metabolism, characterized by residual photosynthesis and low cellular ATP levels, to an initial heterotrophic phase, characterized by respiration and an immediate increase in ATP levels. This respiration relies on glycogen breakdown catalyzed by the glycogen phosphorylase GlgP2. In the following transient mixotrophic phase, photosynthesis and CO<sub>2</sub> fixation restart and glycogen is consumed. During the mixotrophic phase, parallel operation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative pentose phosphate cycle and the Entner-Doudoroff pathway is required for resuscitation to proceed; the glycolytic route via the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway has minor importance. Our data suggest that, during resuscitation, only the Entner-Doudoroff and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative pentose phosphate pathways supply the metabolic intermediates necessary for the anabolic reactions required to reconstitute a vegetative cell. Intriguingly, the key enzymes for glycogen catabolism are already expressed during the preceding chlorotic phase, in apparent preparation for rapid resuscitation.</p>

Extracellular ATP Acts on Jasmonate Signaling to Reinforce Plant Defense
<p>Damaged cells send various signals to stimulate defense responses. Recent identification and genetic studies of the plant purinoceptor, P2K1 (also known as DORN1), have demonstrated that extracellular ATP is a signal involved in plant stress responses, including wounding, perhaps to evoke plant defense. However, it remains largely unknown how extracellular ATP induces plant defense responses. Here, we demonstrate that extracellular ATP induces plant defense mediated through activation of the intracellular signaling of jasmonate (JA), a well-characterized defense hormone. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves, ATP pretreatment induced resistance against the necrotrophic fungus, <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>. The induced resistance was enhanced in the P2K1 receptor overexpression line, but reduced in the receptor mutant, <i>dorn1</i>-<i>3</i>. Mining the transcriptome data revealed that ATP induces a set of JA-induced genes. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, the P2K1-associated coexpression network contains defense-related genes, including those encoding jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins, which play key roles as repressors of JA signaling. We examined whether extracellular ATP impacts the stability of JAZ1 in Arabidopsis. The results showed that the JAZ1 stability decreased in response to ATP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion in a proteasome-dependent manner. This reduction required intracellular signaling via second messengers—cytosolic calcium, reactive oxygen species, and nitric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e. Interestingly, the ATP-induced JAZ1 degradation was attenuated in the JA receptor mutant, <i>coi1</i>, but not in the JA biosynthesis mutant, <i>aos</i>, or upon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion of JA biosynthesis inhibitors. Immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that ATP increases the interaction between COI1 and JAZ1, suggesting direct cross talk between extracellular ATP and JA in intracellular signaling events. Taken together, these results suggest that extracellular ATP signaling directly impacts the JA signaling pathway to maximize plant defense responses.</p>

Root Tip Shape Governs Root Elongation Rate under Increased Soil Strength
<p>Increased soil strength due to soil compaction or soil drying is a major limitation to root growth and crop productivity. Roots need to exert higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">penetr</span></strong>ation force, resulting in increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">penetr</span></strong>ation stress when elongating in soils of greater strength. This study aimed to quantify how the genotypic diversity of root tip geometry and root diameter influences root elongation under different levels of soil strength and to determine the extent to which roots adjust to increased soil strength. Fourteen wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) varieties were grown in soil columns packed to three bulk densities representing low, moderate, and high soil strength. Under moderate and high soil strength, smaller root tip radius-to-length ratio was correlated with higher genotypic root elongation rate, whereas root diameter was not related to genotypic root elongation. Based on cavity expansion theory, it was found that smaller root tip radius-to-length ratio reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">penetr</span></strong>ation stress, thus enabling higher root elongation rates in soils with greater strength. Furthermore, it was observed that roots could only partially adjust to increased soil strength. Root thickening was bounded by a maximum diameter, and root tips did not become more acute in response to increased soil strength. The obtained results demonstrated that root tip geometry is a pivotal trait governing root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">penetr</span></strong>ation stress and root elongation rate in soils of greater strength. Hence, root tip shape needs to be taken into account when selecting for crop varieties that may tolerate high soil strength.</p>

A Key Role for Apoplastic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in Norway Spruce Phenolic Metabolism
<p>Apoplastic events such as monolignol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation and lignin polymerization are difficult to study in intact trees. To investigate the role of apoplastic hydrogen per<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) in gymnosperm phenolic metabolism, an extracellular lignin-forming cell culture of Norway spruce (<i>Picea abies</i>) was used as a research model. Scavenging of apoplastic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by potassium iodide repressed lignin formation, in line with per<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ases activating monolignols for lignin polymerization. Time-course analyses coupled to candidate substrate-product pair network propagation revealed differential accumulation of low-molecular-weight phenolics, including (glycosylated) oligolignols, (glycosylated) flavonoids, and proanthocyanidins, in lignin-forming and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-scavenging cultures and supported that monolignols are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>atively coupled not only in the cell wall but also in the cytoplasm, where they are coupled to other monolignols and proanthocyanidins. Dilignol glycoconjugates with reduced structures were found in the culture medium, suggesting that cells are able to transport glycosylated dilignols to the apoplast. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that scavenging of apoplastic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> resulted in remodulation of the transcriptome, with reduced carbon flux into the shikimate pathway propagating down to monolignol biosynthesis. Aggregated coexpression network analysis identified candidate enzymes and transcription factors for monolignol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation and apoplastic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion to potential H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> receptors. The results presented indicate that the redox state of the apoplast has a profound influence on cellular metabolism.</p>

Measuring the migration of the components and polyethylene wear after total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>This paper describes the methodology, validation and reliability   of a new computer-assisted method which uses models of the patient’s   bones and the components to measure their migration and polyethylene   wear from radiographs after total hip arthroplasty (THA).</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Models of the patient’s acetabular and femoral component obtained   from the manufacturer and models of the patient’s pelvis and femur   built from a single computed tomography (CT) scan, are used by a   computer program to measure the migration of the components and   the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">penetr</span></strong>ation of the femoral head from anteroposterior and lateral radiographs   taken at follow-up visits. The program simulates the radiographic   setup and matches the position and orientation of the models to   outlines of the pelvis, the acetabular and femoral component, and   femur on radiographs. Changes in position and orientation reflect   the migration of the components and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">penetr</span></strong>ation of the femoral   head. Validation was performed using radiographs of phantoms simulating   known migration and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">penetr</span></strong>ation, and the clinical feasibility of   measuring migration was assessed in two patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Migration of the acetabular and femoral components can be measured   with limits of agreement (LOA) of 0.37 mm and 0.33 mm, respectively.   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">penetr</span></strong>ation of the femoral head can be measured with LOA of 0.161   mm.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The migration of components and polyethylene wear can be measured   without needing specialised radiographs.

Female Sex Is a Risk Modifier Rather Than a Risk Factor for Stroke in Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Stroke risk in atrial fibrillation is assessed by using the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score. Sex category (Sc, ie, female sex) confers 1 point on CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc. We hypothesized that female sex is a stroke risk modifier, rather than an overall risk factor, when added to a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA (sex-independent thromboembolism risk) score scale.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using 3 nationwide registries, we identified patients with incident nonvalvular atrial fibrillation from January 1, 1997, through December 31, 2015. Patients receiving oral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anticoagul</span></strong>ant treatment at baseline were excluded, and person-time was censored at the time of treatment initiation (if any). CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA scores were calculated for men and women, and were followed for up to 1 year in the Danish National Patient Registry. The primary outcome was a primary hospital code for ischemic stroke or systemic embolism (thromboembolism). We calculated crude event rates for risk strata as events per 100 person-years. For quantifying absolute risk of stroke, we calculated risks based on the pseudovalue method. Female sex as a prognostic factor was investigated by inclusion as an interaction term on the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA score to calculate the thromboembolic risk ratio for different score points.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 239 671 patients with atrial fibrillation (48.7% women) contributed to the analyses. The mean ages for women and men were 76.6 years and 70.3 years, respectively; the mean CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA scores were 2.7 for women and 2.3 for men. The overall 1-year thromboembolic rate per 100 person-years for women was 7.3 and 5.7 for men. The 1-year absolute risk of thromboembolism was 0.5% among men and women with a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA score of 0 and increased up to >7% among very comorbid patients (score >5). The risk ratio (male as reference) across points >1 indicated that women exhibit a higher stroke risk. The interaction was statistically significant (<i>P</i><0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Female sex is a risk modifier for stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Initial decisions on oral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anticoagul</span></strong>ant treatment could be guided by a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA score (ie, excluding the sex category criterion), but the Sc risk component modifies and accentuates stroke risk in women who would have been eligible for oral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anticoagul</span></strong>ant treatment on the basis of ≥2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ional stroke risk factors.</p></sec>

The Fluid Mechanics of Transcatheter Heart Valve Leaflet Thrombosis in the Neosinus
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Transcatheter heart valve (THV) thrombosis has been increasingly reported. In these studies, thrombus quantification has been based on a 2-dimensional assessment of a 3-dimensional phenomenon.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Postprocedural, 4-dimensional, volume-rendered CT data of patients with CoreValve, Evolut R, and SAPIEN 3 transcatheter aortic valve replacement enrolled in the RESOLVE study (Assessment of Transcatheter and Surgical Aortic Bioprosthetic Valve Dysfunction With Multimodality Imaging and Its Treatment with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anticoagul</span></strong>ation) were included in this analysis. Patients on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anticoagul</span></strong>ation were excluded. SAPIEN 3 and CoreValve/Evolut R patients with and without hypoattenuated leaflet thickening were included to study differences between groups. Patients were classified as having THV thrombosis if there was any evidence of hypoattenuated leaflet thickening. Anatomic and THV deployment geometries were analyzed, and thrombus volumes were computed through manual 3-dimensional reconstruction. We aimed to identify and evaluate risk factors that contribute to THV thrombosis through the combination of retrospective clinical data analysis and in vitro imaging in the space between the native and THV leaflets (neosinus).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>SAPIEN 3 valves with leaflet thrombosis were on average 10% further expanded (by diameter) than those without (95.5±5.2% versus 85.4±3.9%; <i>P</i><0.001). However, this relationship was not evident with the CoreValve/Evolut R. In CoreValve/Evolut Rs with thrombosis, the thrombus volume increased linearly with implant depth (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup>=0.7, <i>P</i><0.001). This finding was not seen in the SAPIEN 3. The in vitro analysis showed that a supraannular THV deployment resulted in a nearly 7-fold decrease in stagnation zone size (velocities <0.1 m/s) when compared with an intraannular deployment. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, the in vitro model indicated that the size of the stagnation zone increased as cardiac output decreased.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Although transcatheter aortic valve replacement thrombosis is a multifactorial process involving foreign materials, patient-specific blood chemistry, and complex flow patterns, our study indicates that deployed THV geometry may have implications on the occurrence of thrombosis. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, a supraannular neosinus may reduce thrombosis risk because of reduced flow stasis. Although <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ional prospective studies are needed to further develop strategies for minimizing thrombus burden, these results may help identify patients at higher thrombosis risk and aid in the development of next-generation devices with reduced thrombosis risk.</p></sec>

Endothelial Microparticles From Acute Coronary Syndrome Patients Induce Premature Coronary Artery Endothelial Cell Aging and Thrombogenicity
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Microparticles (MPs) have emerged as a surrogate marker of endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular risk. This study examined the potential of MPs from senescent endothelial cells (ECs) or from patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) to promote premature EC aging and thrombogenicity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Primary porcine coronary ECs were isolated from the left circumflex coronary artery. MPs were prepared from ECs and venous blood from patients with ACS (n=30) and from healthy volunteers (n=4) by sequential centrifugation. The level of endothelial senescence was assessed as senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity using flow cytometry, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress using the redox-sensitive probe dihydroethidium, tissue factor activity using an enzymatic Tenase assay, the level of target protein expression by Western blot analysis, platelet aggregation using an aggregometer, and shear stress using a cone-and-plate viscometer.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Senescence, as assessed by senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, was induced by the passaging of porcine coronary artery ECs from passage P1 to P4, and was associated with a progressive shedding of procoagulant MPs. Exposure of P1 ECs to MPs shed from senescent P3 cells or circulating MPs from ACS patients induced increased senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress, early phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and Akt, and upregulation of p53, p21, and p16. Ex vivo, the prosenescent effect of circulating MPs from ACS patients was evidenced only under conditions of low shear stress. Depletion of endothelial-derived MPs from ACS patients reduced the induction of senescence. Prosenescent MPs promoted EC thrombogenicity through tissue factor upregulation, shedding of procoagulant MPs, endothelial nitric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e synthase downregulation, and reduced nitric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e–mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation. These MPs exhibited angiotensin-converting enzyme activity and upregulated AT1 receptors and angiotensin-converting enzyme in P1 ECs. Losartan, an AT1 receptor antagonist, and inhibitors of either mitogen-activated protein kinases or phosphoinositide 3-kinase prevented the MP-induced endothelial senescence.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These findings indicate that endothelial-derived MPs from ACS patients induce premature endothelial senescence under atheroprone low shear stress and thrombogenicity through angiotensin II–induced redox-sensitive activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt. They further suggest that targeting endothelial-derived MP shedding and their bioactivity may be a promising therapeutic strategy to limit the development of an endothelial dysfunction post-ACS.</p></sec>

Transcatheter Treatment of Severe Tricuspid Regurgitation With the Edge-to-Edge MitraClip Technique
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Current surgical and medical treatment options for severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) are limited, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ional interventional approaches are required. In the present observational study, the safety and feasibility of transcatheter repair of chronic severe TR with the MitraClip system were evaluated. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, the effects on clinical symptoms were assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients with heart failure symptoms and severe TR on optimal medical treatment were treated with the MitraClip system. Safety, defined as periprocedural adverse events such as death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiac tamponade, and feasibility, defined as successful implantation of 1 or more MitraClip devices and reduction of TR by at least 1 grade, were evaluated before discharge and after 30 days. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, functional outcome, defined as changes in New York Heart Assocation class and 6-minute walking distance, were assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We included 64 consecutive patients (mean age 76.6±10 years) deemed unsuitable for surgery who underwent MitraClip treatment for chronic, severe TR for compassionate use. Functional TR was present in 88%; in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, 22 patients were also treated with the MitraClip system for mitral regurgitation as a combined procedure. The degree of TR was severe or massive in 88% of patients before the procedure. The MitraClip device was successfully implanted in the tricuspid valve in 97% of the cases. After the procedure, TR was reduced by at least 1 grade in 91% of the patients, thereof 4% that were reduced from massive to severe. In 13% of patients, TR remained severe after the procedure. Significant reductions in effective regurgitant orifice area (0.9±0.3cm<sup>2</sup> versus 0.4±0.2cm<sup>2</sup>; <i>P</i><0.001), vena contracta width (1.1±0.5 cm versus 0.6±0.3 cm; <i>P</i>=0.001), and regurgitant volume (57.2±12.8 mL/beat versus 30.8±6.9 mL/beat; <i>P</i><0.001) were observed. No intraprocedural deaths, cardiac tamponade, emergency surgery, stroke, myocardial infarction, or major vascular complications occurred. Three (5%) in-hospital deaths occurred. New York Heart Association class was significantly improved (<i>P</i><0.001), and 6-minute walking distance increased significantly (165.9±102.5 m versus 193.5±115.9 m; <i>P</i>=0.007).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Transcatheter treatment of TR with the MitraClip system seems to be safe and feasible in this cohort of preselected patients. Initial efficacy analysis showed encouraging reduction of TR, which may potentially result in improved clinical outcomes.</p></sec>

Use of Intravenous Recombinant Tissue Plasminogen Activator in Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke Who Take Non–Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants Before Stroke
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Intravenous rt-PA (recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator) is effective in improving outcomes in ischemic stroke; however, there are few data on the use of rt-PA in patients who are receiving a non–vitamin K antagonist oral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anticoagul</span></strong>ant (NOAC).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using data from the American Heart Association Get With The Guidelines-Stroke Registry, we examined the outcomes of use of thrombolytic therapy in patients with ischemic stroke who received <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anticoagul</span></strong>ation with NOACs versus those on warfarin (international normalized ratio <1.7) or not on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anticoagul</span></strong>ation from 1289 registry hospitals between October 2012 and March 2015.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 42 887 patients with ischemic stroke treated with intravenous rt-PA within 4.5 hours, 251 were taking NOACs (dabigatran 87, rivaroxaban 129, and apixaban 35) before their stroke, 1500 were taking warfarin, and 41 136 were on neither. Patients on NOACs or warfarin were older, had more comorbid conditions, and experienced more severe strokes than did those who were not on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anticoagul</span></strong>ation (median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 12, 13, and 9, respectively). Unadjusted rates of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage in the NOAC, warfarin, and none groups were 4.8%, 4.9%, and 3.9%, respectively (<i>P</i>=0.11). In comparison with those not on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anticoagul</span></strong>ation, the adjusted odds ratio for symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage for those on NOACs was 0.92 (95% confidence interval, 0.51–1.65) and for those on warfarin the adjusted odds ratio was 0.85 (95% confidence interval, 0.66–1.10). There were also no significant differences in the risk for life-threatening/serious systemic hemorrhage, any rt-PA complication, in-hospital mortality, and modified Rankin Scale at discharge across 3 groups. Similar results were also found after propensity score matching.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Although experience of using rt-PA in patients with ischemic stroke on a NOAC is limited, these preliminary observations suggest that rt-PA appears to be reasonably well tolerated without prohibitive risks for adverse events among selected NOAC-treated patients. Future studies should evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous rt-PA in patients with ischemic stroke who are taking NOACs.</p></sec>

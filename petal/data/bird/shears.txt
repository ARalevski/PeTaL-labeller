Microtubules tune mechanotransduction through NOX2 and TRPV4 to decrease sclerostin abundance in osteocytes
<p>The adaptation of the skeleton to its mechanical environment is orchestrated by mechanosensitive osteocytes, largely by regulating the abundance of sclerostin, a secreted inhibitor of bone formation. We defined a microtubule-dependent mechanotransduction pathway that linked fluid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shear</span></strong></span></strong> stress to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) signals that led to a reduction in sclerostin abundance in cultured osteocytes. We demonstrated that microtubules stabilized by detyrosination, a reversible posttranslational modification of polymerized α-tubulin, determined the stiffness of the cytoskeleton, which set the mechanoresponsive range of cultured osteocytes to fluid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shear</span></strong></span></strong> stress. We showed that fluid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shear</span></strong></span></strong> stress through the microtubule network activated NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2)–generated ROS that target the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel TRPV4 to elicit Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Furthermore, tuning the abundance of detyrosinated tubulin affected cytoskeletal stiffness to define the mechanoresponsive range of cultured osteocytes to fluid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shear</span></strong></span></strong> stress. Finally, we demonstrated that NOX2-ROS elicited Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals that activated the kinase CaMKII to decrease the abundance of sclerostin protein. Together, these discoveries may identify potentially druggable targets for regulating osteocyte mechanotransduction to affect bone quality.</p>

Shear properties of Earth’s inner core constrained by a detection of <i>J</i> waves in global correlation wavefield
<p>Seismic <i>J</i> waves, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shear</span></strong></span></strong> waves that traverse Earth’s inner core, provide direct constraints on the inner core’s solidity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shear</span></strong></span></strong> properties. However, these waves have been elusive in the direct seismic wavefield because of their small amplitudes. We devised a new method to detect <i>J</i> waves in the earthquake coda correlation wavefield. They manifest through the similarity with other compressional core-sensitive signals. The inner core is solid, but relatively soft, with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shear</span></strong></span></strong>-wave speeds and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shear</span></strong></span></strong> moduli of 3.42 ± 0.02 kilometers per second and 149.0 ± 1.6 gigapascals (GPa) near the inner core boundary and 3.58 ± 0.02 kilometers per second and 167.4 ± 1.6 GPa in Earth’s center. The values are 2.5% lower than the widely used Preliminary Earth Reference Model. This provides new constraints on the dynamical interpretation of Earth’s inner core.</p>

Disturbed Flow Promotes Arterial Stiffening Through Thrombospondin-1
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Arterial stiffness and wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shear</span></strong></span></strong> stress are powerful determinants of cardiovascular health, and arterial stiffness is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality. Low and oscillatory wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shear</span></strong></span></strong> stress, termed disturbed flow (d-flow), promotes atherosclerotic arterial remodeling, but the relationship between d-flow and arterial stiffness is not well understood. The objective of this study was to define the role of d-flow on arterial stiffening and discover the relevant signaling pathways by which d-flow stiffens arteries.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>D-flow was induced in the carotid arteries of young and old mice of both sexes. Arterial stiffness was quantified ex vivo with cylindrical biaxial mechanical testing and in vivo from duplex ultrasound and compared with unmanipulated carotid arteries from 80-week-old mice. Gene expression and pathway analysis was performed on endothelial cell–enriched RNA and validated by immunohistochemistry. In vitro testing of signaling pathways was performed under oscillatory and laminar wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shear</span></strong></span></strong> stress conditions. Human arteries from regions of d-flow and stable flow were tested ex vivo to validate critical results from the animal model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>D-flow induced arterial stiffening through collagen deposition after partial carotid ligation, and the degree of stiffening was similar to that of unmanipulated carotid arteries from 80-week-old mice. Intimal gene pathway analyses identified transforming growth factor-β pathways as having a prominent role in this stiffened arterial response, but this was attributable to thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) stimulation of profibrotic genes and not changes to transforming growth factor-β. In vitro and in vivo testing under d-flow conditions identified a possible role for TSP-1 activation of transforming growth factor-β in the upregulation of these genes. TSP-1 knockout animals had significantly less arterial stiffening in response to d-flow than wild-type carotid arteries. Human arteries exposed to d-flow had similar increases TSP-1 and collagen gene expression as seen in our model.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>TSP-1 has a critical role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shear</span></strong></span></strong>-mediated arterial stiffening that is mediated in part through TSP-1’s activation of the profibrotic signaling pathways of transforming growth factor-β. Molecular targets in this pathway may lead to novel therapies to limit arterial stiffening and the progression of disease in arteries exposed to d-flow.</p></sec>

Handedness in shearing auxetics creates rigid and compliant structures
<p>In nature, repeated base units produce handed structures that selectively bond to make rigid or compliant materials. Auxetic tilings are scale-independent frameworks made from repeated unit cells that expand under tension. We discovered how to produce handedness in auxetic unit cells that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shear</span></strong></span></strong> as they expand by changing the symmetries and alignments of auxetic tilings. Using the symmetry and alignment rules that we developed, we made handed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shear</span></strong></span></strong>ing auxetics that tile planes, cylinders, and spheres. By compositing the handed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shear</span></strong></span></strong>ing auxetics in a manner inspired by keratin and collagen, we produce both compliant structures that expand while twisting and deployable structures that can rigidly lock. This work opens up new possibilities in designing chemical frameworks, medical devices like stents, robotic systems, and deployable engineering structures.</p>

Endothelial Microparticles From Acute Coronary Syndrome Patients Induce Premature Coronary Artery Endothelial Cell Aging and Thrombogenicity
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Microparticles (MPs) have emerged as a surrogate marker of endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular risk. This study examined the potential of MPs from senescent endothelial cells (ECs) or from patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) to promote premature EC aging and thrombogenicity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Primary porcine coronary ECs were isolated from the left circumflex coronary artery. MPs were prepared from ECs and venous blood from patients with ACS (n=30) and from healthy volunteers (n=4) by sequential centrifugation. The level of endothelial senescence was assessed as senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity using flow cytometry, oxidative stress using the redox-sensitive probe dihydroethidium, tissue factor activity using an enzymatic Tenase assay, the level of target protein expression by Western blot analysis, platelet aggregation using an aggregometer, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shear</span></strong></span></strong> stress using a cone-and-plate viscometer.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Senescence, as assessed by senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, was induced by the passaging of porcine coronary artery ECs from passage P1 to P4, and was associated with a progressive shedding of procoagulant MPs. Exposure of P1 ECs to MPs shed from senescent P3 cells or circulating MPs from ACS patients induced increased senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, oxidative stress, early phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and Akt, and upregulation of p53, p21, and p16. Ex vivo, the prosenescent effect of circulating MPs from ACS patients was evidenced only under conditions of low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shear</span></strong></span></strong> stress. Depletion of endothelial-derived MPs from ACS patients reduced the induction of senescence. Prosenescent MPs promoted EC thrombogenicity through tissue factor upregulation, shedding of procoagulant MPs, endothelial nitric oxide synthase downregulation, and reduced nitric oxide–mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation. These MPs exhibited angiotensin-converting enzyme activity and upregulated AT1 receptors and angiotensin-converting enzyme in P1 ECs. Losartan, an AT1 receptor antagonist, and inhibitors of either mitogen-activated protein kinases or phosphoinositide 3-kinase prevented the MP-induced endothelial senescence.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These findings indicate that endothelial-derived MPs from ACS patients induce premature endothelial senescence under atheroprone low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shear</span></strong></span></strong> stress and thrombogenicity through angiotensin II–induced redox-sensitive activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt.

Augmentation of Muscle Blood Flow by Ultrasound Cavitation Is Mediated by ATP and Purinergic Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Augmentation of tissue blood flow by therapeutic ultrasound is thought to rely on convective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shear</span></strong></span></strong>. Microbubble contrast agents that undergo ultrasound-mediated cavitation markedly amplify these effects. We hypothesized that purinergic signaling is responsible for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shear</span></strong></span></strong>-dependent increases in muscle perfusion during therapeutic cavitation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Unilateral exposure of the proximal hindlimb of mice (with or without ischemia produced by iliac ligation) to therapeutic ultrasound (1.3 MHz, mechanical index 1.3) was performed for 10 minutes after intravenous injection of 2×10<sup>8</sup> lipid microbubbles. Microvascular perfusion was evaluated by low-power contrast ultrasound perfusion imaging. In vivo muscle ATP release and in vitro ATP release from endothelial cells or erythrocytes were assessed by a luciferin-luciferase assay. Purinergic signaling pathways were assessed by studying interventions that (1) accelerated ATP degradation; (2) inhibited P2Y receptors, adenosine receptors, or K<sub>ATP</sub> channels; or (3) inhibited downstream signaling pathways involving endothelial nitric oxide synthase or prostanoid production (indomethacin). Augmentation in muscle perfusion by ultrasound cavitation was assessed in a proof-of-concept clinical trial in 12 subjects with stable sickle cell disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Therapeutic ultrasound cavitation increased muscle perfusion by 7-fold in normal mice, reversed tissue ischemia for up to 24 hours in the murine model of peripheral artery disease, and doubled muscle perfusion in patients with sickle cell disease. Augmentation in flow extended well beyond the region of ultrasound exposure. Ultrasound cavitation produced an ≈40-fold focal and sustained increase in ATP, the source of which included both endothelial cells and erythrocytes. Inhibitory studies indicated that ATP was a critical mediator of flow augmentation that acts primarily through either P2Y receptors or adenosine produced by ectonucleotidase activity. Combined indomethacin and inhibition of endothelial nitric oxide synthase abolished the effects of therapeutic ultrasound, indicating downstream signaling through both nitric oxide and prostaglandins.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Therapeutic ultrasound using microbubble cavitation to increase muscle perfusion relies on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shear</span></strong></span></strong>-dependent increases in ATP, which can act through a diverse portfolio of purinergic signaling pathways.

Seismic evidence for partial melting at the root of major hot spot plumes
<p>Ultralow-velocity zones are localized regions of extreme material properties detected seismologically at the base of Earth's mantle. Their nature and role in mantle dynamics are poorly understood. We used <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shear</span></strong></span></strong> waves diffracted at the core-mantle boundary to illuminate the root of the Iceland plume from different directions. Through waveform modeling, we detected a large ultralow-velocity zone and constrained its shape to be axisymmetric to a very good first order. We thus attribute it to partial melting of a locally thickened, denser- and hotter-than-average layer, reflecting dynamics and elevated temperatures within the plume root. Such structures are few and far apart, and they may be characteristic of the roots of some of the broad mantle plumes tomographically imaged within the large low-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shear</span></strong></span></strong>-velocity provinces in the lower mantle.</p>

Mega-earthquakes rupture flat megathrusts
<p>The 2004 Sumatra-Andaman and 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquakes highlighted gaps in our understanding of mega-earthquake rupture processes and the factors controlling their global distribution: A fast convergence rate and young buoyant lithosphere are not required to produce mega-earthquakes. We calculated the curvature along the major subduction zones of the world, showing that mega-earthquakes preferentially rupture flat (low-curvature) interfaces. A simplified analytic model demonstrates that heterogeneity in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shear</span></strong></span></strong> strength increases with curvature. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shear</span></strong></span></strong> strength on flat megathrusts is more homogeneous, and hence more likely to be exceeded simultaneously over large areas, than on highly curved faults.</p>

Interferon Regulatory Factor 5 Controls Necrotic Core Formation in Atherosclerotic Lesions by Impairing Efferocytosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Myeloid cells are central to atherosclerotic lesion development and vulnerable plaque formation. Impaired ability of arterial phagocytes to uptake apoptotic cells (efferocytosis) promotes lesion growth and establishment of a necrotic core. The transcription factor interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-5 is an important modulator of myeloid function and programming. We sought to investigate whether IRF5 affects the formation and phenotype of atherosclerotic lesions.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We investigated the role of IRF5 in atherosclerosis in 2 complementary models. First, atherosclerotic lesion development in hyperlipidemic apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE<sup>-/-</sup>) mice and ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice with a genetic deletion of IRF5 (ApoE<sup>-/-</sup>Irf5<sup>-/-</sup>) was compared and then lesion development was assessed in a model of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shear</span></strong></span></strong> stress-modulated vulnerable plaque formation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Both lesion and necrotic core size were significantly reduced in ApoE<sup>-/-</sup>Irf5<sup>-/-</sup> mice compared with IRF5-competent ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice.

A significant loss of CD11c<sup>+</sup> macrophages was evident in ApoE<sup>-/-</sup>Irf5<sup>-/-</sup> mice in the aorta, draining lymph nodes, and bone marrow cell cultures, indicating that IRF5 maintains CD11c<sup>+</sup> macrophages in atherosclerosis. Moreover, we revealed that the CD11c gene is a direct target of IRF5 in macrophages. In the absence of IRF5, CD11c<sup>-</sup> macrophages displayed a significant increase in expression of the efferocytosis-regulating integrin-β3 and its ligand milk fat globule-epidermal growth factor 8 protein and enhanced efferocytosis in vitro and in situ.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>IRF5 is detrimental in atherosclerosis by promoting the maintenance of proinflammatory CD11c<sup>+</sup> macrophages within lesions and controlling the expansion of the necrotic core by impairing efferocytosis.</p></sec>

MoChlo: A Versatile, Modular Cloning Toolbox for Chloroplast Biotechnology
<p>Plant synthetic biology is a rapidly evolving field with new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong>s constantly emerging to drive innovation. Of particular interest is the application of synthetic biology to chloroplast biotechnology to generate plants capable of producing new metabolites, vaccines, biofuels, and high-value chemicals. Progress made in the assembly of large DNA molecules, composing multiple transcriptional units, has significantly aided in the ability to rapidly construct novel vectors for genetic engineering. In particular, Golden Gate assembly has provided a facile molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong> for standardized assembly of synthetic genetic elements into larger DNA constructs. In this work, a complete modular chloroplast cloning system, MoChlo, was developed and validated for fast and flexible chloroplast engineering in plants. A library of 128 standardized chloroplast-specific parts (47 promoters, 38 5′ untranslated regions [5′UTRs], nine promoter:5′UTR fusions, 10 3′UTRs, 14 genes of interest, and 10 chloroplast-specific destination vectors) were mined from the literature and modified for use in MoChlo assembly, along with chloroplast-specific destination vectors. The strategy was validated by assembling synthetic operons of various sizes and determining the efficiency of assembly. This method was successfully used to generate chloroplast transformation vectors containing up to seven transcriptional units in a single vector (∼10.6-kb synthetic operon). To enable researchers with limited resources to engage in chloroplast biotechnology, and to accelerate progress in the field, the entire kit, as described, is available through Addgene at minimal cost. Thus, the MoChlo kit represents a valuable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong> for fast and flexible design of heterologous metabolic pathways for plastid metabolic engineering.</p>

Modulating Protein Stability to Switch Toxic Protein Function On and Off in Living Cells
<p>Toxic proteins are prime targets for molecular farming (the generation of pharmacologically active or biotechnologically usable compounds in plants) and are also efficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong>s for targeted cell ablation in genetics, developmental biology, and biotechnology. However, achieving conditional activity of cytotoxins and maintaining the toxin-expressing plants as stably transformed lines remain challenging. Here, we produce a switchable version of the highly cytotoxic bacterial RNase barnase by fusing the protein to a portable protein degradation cassette, the low-temperature degron cassette. This method allows conditional genetics based on conditional protein degradation via the N-end rule or N-degron pathway and has been used to vice versa accumulate and/or deplete a diverse variety of highly active, unstable or stable target proteins in different living multicellular organisms and cell systems. Moreover, we expressed the barnase fusion under control of the trichome-specific <i>TRIPTYCHON</i> promoter. This enabled efficient temperature-dependent control of protein accumulation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaf hairs (trichomes). By tuning the levels of the protein, we were able to control the fate of trichomes in vivo. The on-demand formation of trichomes through manipulating the balance between stabilization and destabilization of barnase provides proof of concept for a robust and powerful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong> for conditional switchable cell arrest. We present this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong> as a potential strategy for the manufacture and accumulation of cytotoxic proteins and toxic high-value products in plants or for conditional genetic cell ablation.</p>

The Coumarin Glucoside, Esculin, Reveals Rapid Changes in Phloem-Transport Velocity in Response to Environmental Cues
<p>The study of phloem transport and its vital roles in long-distance communication and carbon allocation have been hampered by a lack of suitable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong>s that allow high-throughput, real-time studies. Esculin, a fluorescent coumarin glucoside, is recognized by Suc transporters, including AtSUC2, which loads it into the phloem for translocation to sink tissues. These properties make it an ideal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong> for use in live-imaging experiments, where it acts as a surrogate for Suc. Here, we show that esculin is translocated with a similar efficiency to Suc and, because of its ease of application and detection, demonstrate that it is an ideal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong> for in vivo studies of phloem transport. We used esculin to determine the effect of different environmental cues on the velocity of phloem transport. We provide evidence that fluctuations in cotyledon Suc levels influence phloem velocity rapidly, supporting the pressure-flow model of phloem transport. Under acute changes in light levels, the phloem velocity mirrored changes in the expression of <i>AtSUC2</i>. This observation suggests that under certain environmental conditions, transcriptional regulation may affect the abundance of AtSUC2 and thus regulate the phloem transport velocity.</p>

Predicted Arabidopsis Interactome Resource and Gene Set Linkage Analysis: A Transcriptomic Analysis Resource
<p>An advanced functional understanding of omics data is important for elucidating the design logic of physiological processes in plants and effectively controlling desired traits in plants. We present the latest versions of the Predicted Arabidopsis Interactome Resource (PAIR) and of the gene set linkage analysis (GSLA) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong>, which enable the interpretation of an observed transcriptomic change (differentially expressed genes [DEGs]) in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) with respect to its functional impact for biological processes. PAIR version 5.0 integrates functional association data between genes in multiple forms and infers 335,301 putative functional interactions. GSLA relies on this high-confidence inferred functional association network to expand our perception of the functional impacts of an observed transcriptomic change. GSLA then interprets the biological significance of the observed DEGs using established biological concepts (annotation terms), describing not only the DEGs themselves but also their potential functional impacts. This unique analytical capability can help researchers gain deeper insights into their experimental results and highlight prospective directions for further investigation. We demonstrate the utility of GSLA with two case studies in which GSLA uncovered how molecular events may have caused physiological changes through their collective functional influence on biological processes. Furthermore, we showed that typical annotation-enrichment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong>s were unable to produce similar insights to PAIR/GSLA.

Phylogenetic Tools for Generalized HIV-1 Epidemics: Findings from the PANGEA-HIV Methods Comparison
<p>Viral phylogenetic methods contribute to understanding how HIV spreads in populations, and thereby help guide the design of prevention interventions. So far, most analyses have been applied to well-sampled concentrated HIV-1 epidemics in wealthy countries. To direct the use of phylogenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong>s to where the impact of HIV-1 is greatest, the Phylogenetics And Networks for Generalized HIV Epidemics in Africa (PANGEA-HIV) consortium generates full-genome viral sequences from across sub-Saharan Africa. Analyzing these data presents new challenges, since epidemics are principally driven by heterosexual transmission and a smaller fraction of cases is sampled. Here, we show that viral phylogenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong>s can be adapted and used to estimate epidemiological quantities of central importance to HIV-1 prevention in sub-Saharan Africa. We used a community-wide methods comparison exercise on simulated data, where participants were blinded to the true dynamics they were inferring. Two distinct simulations captured generalized HIV-1 epidemics, before and after a large community-level intervention that reduced infection levels. Five research groups participated. Structured coalescent modeling approaches were most successful: phylogenetic estimates of HIV-1 incidence, incidence reductions, and the proportion of transmissions from individuals in their first 3 months of infection correlated with the true values (Pearson correlation > 90%), with small bias. However, on some simulations, true values were markedly outside reported confidence or credibility intervals. The blinded comparison revealed current limits and strengths in using HIV phylogenetics in challenging settings, provided benchmarks for future methods’ development, and supports using the latest generation of phylogenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong>s to advance HIV surveillance and prevention.</p>

Discovering relationships between nuclear receptor signaling pathways, genes, and tissues in Transcriptomine
<p>We previously developed a web <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong>, Transcriptomine, to explore expression profiling data sets involving small-molecule or genetic manipulations of nuclear receptor signaling pathways. We describe advances in biocuration, query interface design, and data visualization that enhance the discovery of uncharacterized biology in these pathways using this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong>. Transcriptomine currently contains about 45 million data points encompassing more than 2000 experiments in a reference library of nearly 550 data sets retrieved from public archives and systematically curated. To make the underlying data points more accessible to bench biologists, we classified experimental small molecules and gene manipulations into signaling pathways and experimental tissues and cell lines into physiological systems and organs. Incorporation of these mappings into Transcriptomine enables the user to readily evaluate tissue-specific regulation of gene expression by nuclear receptor signaling pathways. Data points from animal and cell model experiments and from clinical data sets elucidate the roles of nuclear receptor pathways in gene expression events accompanying various normal and pathological cellular processes. In addition, data sets targeting non-nuclear receptor signaling pathways highlight transcriptional cross-talk between nuclear receptors and other signaling pathways. We demonstrate with specific examples how data points that exist in isolation in individual data sets validate each other when connected and made accessible to the user in a single interface. In summary, Transcriptomine allows bench biologists to routinely develop research hypotheses, validate experimental data, or model relationships between signaling pathways, genes, and tissues.</p>

We investigated the function of TFEB in vascular biology and pathophysiology and demonstrated that TFEB in endothelial cells inhibited inflammation and reduced atherosclerosis development. Laminar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shear</span></strong></span></strong> stress, which protects against atherosclerosis, increased TFEB abundance in cultured primary human endothelial cells. Furthermore, TFEB overexpression in these cells was anti-inflammatory, whereas TFEB knockdown aggravated inflammation. The anti-inflammatory effect of TFEB was, at least, partially due to reduced oxidative stress because TFEB overexpression in endothelial cells decreased the concentrations of reactive oxygen species and increased the expression of the antioxidant genes <i>HO1</i> (which encodes heme oxygenase 1) and <i>SOD2</i> (which encodes superoxide dismutase 2). In addition, transgenic mice with endothelial cell–specific expression of TFEB exhibited reduced leukocyte recruitment to endothelial cells and decreased atherosclerosis development. Our study suggests that TFEB is a protective transcription factor against endothelial cell inflammation and a potential target for treating atherosclerosis and associated cardiovascular diseases.</p>

AMPK promotes mitochondrial biogenesis and function by phosphorylating the epigenetic factors DNMT1, RBBP7, and HAT1
<p>Adenosine monophosphate (AMP)–activated protein kinase (AMPK) acts as a master regulator of cellular energy homeostasis by directly phosphorylating metabolic enzymes and nutrient transporters and by indirectly promoting the transactivation of nuclear genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and function. We explored the mechanism of AMPK-mediated induction of gene expression. We identified AMPK consensus phosphorylation sequences in three proteins involved in nucleosome remodeling: DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), retinoblastoma binding protein 7 (RBBP7), and histone acetyltransferase 1 (HAT1). DNMT1 mediates DNA methylation that limits transcription factor access to promoters and is inhibited by RBBP7. Acetylation of histones by HAT1 creates a more relaxed chromatin-DNA structure that favors transcription. AMPK-mediated phosphorylation resulted in the activation of HAT1 and inhibition of DNMT1. For DNMT1, this inhibition was both a direct effect of phosphorylation and the result of increased interaction with RBBP7. In human umbilical vein cells, pharmacological AMPK activation or pulsatile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shear</span></strong></span></strong> stress triggered nucleosome remodeling and decreased cytosine methylation, leading to increased expression of nuclear genes encoding factors involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and function, such as peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor gamma coactivator–1α (PGC-1α), transcription factor A (Tfam), and uncoupling proteins 2 and 3 (UCP2 and UCP3). Similar effects were seen in the aortas of mice given pharmacological AMPK activators, and these effects required AMPK2α. These results enhance our understanding of AMPK-mediated mitochondrial gene expression through nucleosome remodeling.</p>

Fluid-induced aseismic fault slip outpaces pore-fluid migration
<p>Earthquake swarms attributed to subsurface fluid injection are usually assumed to occur on faults destabilized by increased pore-fluid pressures. However, fluid injection could also activate aseismic slip, which might outpace pore-fluid migration and transmit earthquake-triggering stress changes beyond the fluid-pressurized region. We tested this theoretical prediction against data derived from fluid-injection experiments that activated and measured slow, aseismic slip on preexisting, shallow faults. We found that the pore pressure and slip history imply a fault whose strength is the product of a slip-weakening friction coefficient and the local effective normal stress. Using a coupled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shear</span></strong></span></strong>-rupture model, we derived constraints on the hydromechanical parameters of the actively deforming fault. The inferred aseismic rupture front propagates faster and to larger distances than the diffusion of pressurized pore fluid.</p>

1.9-million- and 2.4-million-year-old artifacts and stone tool–cutmarked bones from Ain Boucherit, Algeria
<p>East Africa has provided the earliest known evidence for Oldowan stone artifacts and hominin-induced stone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong> cutmarks dated to ~2.6 million years (Ma) ago. The ~1.8-million-year-old stone artifacts from Ain Hanech (Algeria) were considered to represent the oldest archaeological materials in North Africa. Here we report older stone artifacts and cutmarked bones excavated from two nearby deposits at Ain Boucherit estimated to ~1.9 Ma ago, and the older to ~2.4 Ma ago. Hence, the Ain Boucherit evidence shows that ancestral hominins inhabited the Mediterranean fringe in northern Africa much earlier than previously thought. The evidence strongly argues for early dispersal of stone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong> manufacture and use from East Africa or a possible multiple-origin scenario of stone technology in both East and North Africa.</p>

Programmed DNA destruction by miniature CRISPR-Cas14 enzymes
<p>CRISPR-Cas systems provide microbes with adaptive immunity to infectious nucleic acids and are widely employed as genome editing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong>s. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong>s use RNA-guided Cas proteins whose large size (950 to 1400 amino acids) has been considered essential to their specific DNA- or RNA-targeting activities. Here we present a set of CRISPR-Cas systems from uncultivated archaea that contain Cas14, a family of exceptionally compact RNA-guided nucleases (400 to 700 amino acids). Despite their small size, Cas14 proteins are capable of targeted single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) cleavage without restrictive sequence requirements. Moreover, target recognition by Cas14 triggers nonspecific cutting of ssDNA molecules, an activity that enables high-fidelity single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping (Cas14-DETECTR). Metagenomic data show that multiple CRISPR-Cas14 systems evolved independently and suggest a potential evolutionary origin of single-effector CRISPR-based adaptive immunity.</p>

Digital chemical test impresses
<p>Toxicologists this week unveiled a chemical safety screening <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong> that could greatly reduce the need for six common animal tests.

But it also has limitations; for instance, the method can't reliably evaluate a chemical's risk of causing cancer. And it's not clear how open regulatory agencies will be to adopting a nonanimal approach, although both European and U.S. regulators say they are open to the idea. Still, the big data approach is encouraging to those seeking to reduce and replace animal testing.</p>

The formation of peak rings in large impact craters
<p>Large impacts provide a mechanism for resurfacing planets through mixing near-surface rocks with deeper material. Central peaks are formed from the dynamic uplift of rocks during crater formation. As crater size increases, central peaks transition to peak rings. Without samples, debate surrounds the mechanics of peak-ring formation and their depth of origin. Chicxulub is the only known impact structure on Earth with an unequivocal peak ring, but it is buried and only accessible through drilling. Expedition 364 sampled the Chicxulub peak ring, which we found was formed from uplifted, fractured, shocked, felsic basement rocks. The peak-ring rocks are cross-cut by dikes and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shear</span></strong></span></strong> zones and have an unusually low density and seismic velocity. Large impacts therefore generate vertical fluxes and increase porosity in planetary crust.</p>

High-resolution interrogation of functional elements in the noncoding genome

We developed a CRISPR screen using ~18,000 single guide RNAs targeting >700 kilobases surrounding the genes <i>NF1</i>, <i>NF2</i>, and <i>CUL3</i>, which are involved in BRAF inhibitor resistance in melanoma. We find that noncoding locations that modulate drug resistance also harbor predictive hallmarks of noncoding function.

CyanoGate: A Modular Cloning Suite for Engineering Cyanobacteria Based on the Plant MoClo Syntax
<p>Recent advances in synthetic biology research have been underpinned by an exponential increase in available genomic information and a proliferation of advanced DNA assembly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong>s. The adoption of plasmid vector assembly standards and parts libraries has greatly enhanced the reproducibility of research and the exchange of parts between different labs and biological systems. However, a standardized modular cloning (MoClo) system is not yet available for cyanobacteria, which lag behind other prokaryotes in synthetic biology despite their huge potential regarding biotechnological applications. By building on the assembly library and syntax of the Plant Golden Gate MoClo kit, we have developed a versatile system called CyanoGate that unites cyanobacteria with plant and algal systems. Here, we describe the generation of a suite of parts and acceptor vectors for making (1) marked/unmarked knock-outs or integrations using an integrative acceptor vector, and (2) transient multigene expression and repression systems using known and previously undescribed replicative vectors. We tested and compared the CyanoGate system in the established model cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 and the more recently described fast-growing strain <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973. The UTEX 2973 fast-growth phenotype was only evident under specific growth conditions; however, UTEX 2973 accumulated high levels of proteins with strong native or synthetic promoters. The system is publicly available and can be readily expanded to accommodate other standardized MoClo parts to accelerate the development of reliable synthetic biology <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong>s for the cyanobacterial community.</p>

PaCeQuant: A Tool for High-Throughput Quantification of Pavement Cell Shape Characteristics
<p>Pavement cells (PCs) are the most frequently occurring cell type in the leaf epidermis and play important roles in leaf growth and function. In many plant species, PCs form highly complex jig<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">saw</span></strong>-puzzle-shaped cells with interlocking lobes. Understanding of their development is of high interest for plant science research because of their importance for leaf growth and hence for plant fitness and crop yield. Studies of PC development, however, are limited, because robust methods are lacking that enable automatic segmentation and quantification of PC shape parameters suitable to reflect their cellular complexity. Here, we present our new ImageJ-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong>, PaCeQuant, which provides a fully automatic image analysis workflow for PC shape quantification. PaCeQuant automatically detects cell boundaries of PCs from confocal input images and enables manual correction of automatic segmentation results or direct import of manually segmented cells. PaCeQuant simultaneously extracts 27 shape features that include global, contour-based, skeleton-based, and PC-specific object descriptors. In addition, we included a method for classification and analysis of lobes at two-cell junctions and three-cell junctions, respectively. We provide an R script for graphical visualization and statistical analysis. We validated PaCeQuant by extensive comparative analysis to manual segmentation and existing quantification <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong>s and demonstrated its usability to analyze PC shape characteristics during development and between different genotypes. PaCeQuant thus provides a platform for robust, efficient, and reproducible quantitative analysis of PC shape characteristics that can easily be applied to study PC development in large data sets.</p>

A SIMPLE Pipeline for Mapping Point Mutations

Hybridization in Plants: Old Ideas, New Techniques
<p>Hybridization has played an important role in the evolution of many lineages. With the growing availability of genomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong>s and advancements in genomic analyses, it is becoming increasingly clear that gene flow between divergent taxa can generate new phenotypic diversity, allow for adaptation to novel environments, and contribute to speciation. Hybridization can have immediate phenotypic consequences through the expression of hybrid vigor. On longer evolutionary time scales, hybridization can lead to local adaption through the introgression of novel alleles and transgressive segregation and, in some cases, result in the formation of new hybrid species. Studying both the abundance and the evolutionary consequences of hybridization has deep historical roots in plant biology. Many of the hypotheses concerning how and why hybridization contributes to biological diversity currently being investigated were first proposed tens and even hundreds of years ago. In this Update, we discuss how new advancements in genomic and genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong>s are revolutionizing our ability to document the occurrence of and investigate the outcomes of hybridization in plants.</p>

Insights from the Shell Proteome: Biomineralization to Adaptation
<p>Bivalves have evolved a range of complex shell forming mechanisms that are reflected by their incredible diversity in shell mineralogy and microstructures. A suite of proteins exported to the shell matrix space plays a significant role in controlling these features, in addition to underpinning some of the physical properties of the shell itself. Although, there is a general consensus that a minimum basic protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong> kit is required for shell construction, to date, this remains undefined. In this study, the shell matrix proteins (SMPs) of four highly divergent bivalves (The Pacific oyster, <i>Crassostrea gigas</i>; the blue mussel, <i>Mytilus edulis</i>; the clam, <i>Mya truncata</i>, and the king scallop, <i>Pecten maximus</i>) were analyzed in an identical fashion using proteomics pipeline. This enabled us to identify the critical elements of a “basic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong> kit” for calcification processes, which were conserved across the taxa irrespective of the shell morphology and arrangement of the crystal surfaces. In addition, protein domains controlling the crystal layers specific to aragonite and calcite were also identified. Intriguingly, a significant number of the identified SMPs contained domains related to immune functions. These were often are unique to each species implying their involvement not only in immunity, but also environmental adaptation. This suggests that the SMPs are selectively exported in a complex mix to endow the shell with both mechanical protection and biochemical defense.</p>

Furthermore, mean principal strain orientations differ between male and female <i>Uromastyx</i> during feeding, potentially because of sexual dimorphism in skull morphology.</p>

An inducible knockout mouse to model the cell-autonomous role of PTEN in initiating endometrial, prostate and thyroid neoplasias
<p><i>PTEN</i> is one of the most frequently mutated tumor suppressor genes in human cancers. The role of PTEN in carcinogenesis has been validated by knockout mouse models. <i>PTEN</i> heterozygous mice develop neoplasms in multiple organs. Unfortunately, the embryonic lethality of biallelic excision of <i>PTEN</i> has inhibited the study of complete <i>PTEN</i> deletion in the development and progression of cancer. By crossing PTEN conditional knockout mice with transgenic mice expressing a tamoxifen-inducible Cre-ER<sup>T</sup> under the control of a chicken actin promoter, we have generated a tamoxifen-inducible mouse model that allows temporal control of <i>PTEN</i> deletion. Interestingly, administration of a single dose of tamoxifen resulted in <i>PTEN</i> deletion mainly in epithelial cells, but not in stromal, mesenchymal or hematopoietic cells. Using the mT/mG double-fluorescent Cre reporter mice, we demonstrate that epithelial-specific <i>PTEN</i> excision was caused by differential Cre activity among tissues and cells types. Tamoxifen-induced deletion of <i>PTEN</i> resulted in extremely rapid and consistent formation of endometrial <i>in situ</i> adenocarcinoma, prostate intraepithelial neoplasia and thyroid hyperplasia. We also analyzed the role of PTEN ablation in other epithelial cells, such as the tubular cells of the kidney, hepatocytes, colonic epithelial cells or bronchiolar epithelium, but those tissues did not exhibit neoplastic growth. Finally, to validate this model as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong> to assay the efficacy of anti-tumor drugs in PTEN deficiency, we administered the mTOR inhibitor everolimus to mice with induced <i>PTEN</i> deletion. Everolimus dramatically reduced the progression of endometrial proliferations and significantly reduced thyroid hyperplasia. This model could be a valuable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong> to study the cell-autonomous mechanisms involved in PTEN-loss-induced carcinogenesis and provides a good platform to study the effect of anti-neoplastic drugs on PTEN-negative tumors.</p>

Derivation and Validation of the CREST Model for Very Early Prediction of Circulatory Etiology Death in Patients Without ST-Segment–Elevation Myocardial Infarction After Cardiac Arrest

We developed and validated a prediction model to rapidly determine that risk and facilitate triage to individualized treatment pathways.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>With the use of INTCAR (International Cardiac Arrest Registry), an 87-question data set representing 44 centers in the United States and Europe, patients were classified as having had CED or a combined end point of neurological-etiology death or survival. Demographics and clinical factors were modeled in a derivation cohort, and backward stepwise logistic regression was used to identify factors independently associated with CED. We demonstrated model performance using area under the curve and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test in the derivation and validation cohorts, and assigned a simplified point-scoring system.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 638 patients in the derivation cohort, 121 (18.9%) had CED. The final model included preexisting coronary artery disease (odds ratio [OR], 2.86; confidence interval [CI], 1.83–4.49; <i>P</i>≤0.001), nonshockable rhythm (OR, 1.75; CI, 1.10–2.77; P=0.017), initial ejection fraction<30% (OR, 2.11; CI, 1.32–3.37; <i>P</i>=0.002), shock at presentation (OR, 2.27; CI, 1.42–3.62; P<0.001), and ischemic time >25 minutes (OR, 1.42; CI, 0.90–2.23; P=0.13). The derivation model area under the curve was 0.73, and Hosmer-Lemeshow test P=0.47. Outcomes were similar in the 318-patient validation cohort (area under the curve 0.68, Hosmer-Lemeshow test P=0.41). When assigned a point for each associated factor in the derivation model, the average predicted versus observed probability of CED with a CREST score (coronary artery disease, initial heart rhythm, low ejection fraction, shock at the time of admission, and ischemic time >25 minutes) of 0 to 5 was: 7.1% versus 10.2%, 9.5% versus 11%, 22.5% versus 19.6%, 32.4% versus 29.6%, 38.5% versus 30%, and 55.7% versus 50%.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The CREST model stratified patients immediately after resuscitation according to risk of a circulatory-etiology death.

Potent Thrombolytic Effect of <i>N</i>-Acetylcysteine on Arterial Thrombi
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Platelet cross-linking during arterial thrombosis involves von Willebrand Factor (VWF) multimers. Therefore, proteolysis of VWF appears promising to disaggregate platelet-rich thrombi and restore vessel patency in acute thrombotic disorders such as ischemic stroke, acute coronary syndrome, or acute limb ischemia. <i>N</i>-Acetylcysteine (NAC, a clinically approved mucolytic drug) can reduce intrachain disulfide bonds in large polymeric proteins. In the present study, we postulated that NAC might cleave the VWF multimers inside occlusive thrombi, thereby leading to their dissolution and arterial recanalization.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Experimental models of thrombotic stroke induced by either intra-arterial thrombin injection or ferric chloride application followed by measurement of cerebral blood flow using a combination of laser Doppler flowmetry and MRI were performed to uncover the effects of NAC on arterial thrombi. To investigate the effect of NAC on larger vessels, we also performed ferric chloride–induced carotid artery thrombosis. In vitro experiments were performed to study the molecular bases of NAC thrombolytic effect, including platelet aggregometry, platelet-rich thrombi lysis assays, thromboelastography (ROTEM), and high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shear</span></strong></span></strong> VWF string formation using microfluidic devices. We also investigated the putative prohemorrhagic effect of NAC in a mouse model of intracranial hemorrhage induced by in situ collagenase type VII injection.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We demonstrated that intravenous NAC administration promotes lysis of arterial thrombi that are resistant to conventional approaches such as recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator, direct thrombin inhibitors, and antiplatelet treatments. Through in vitro and in vivo experiments, we provide evidence that the molecular target underlying the thrombolytic effects of NAC is principally the VWF that cross-link platelets in arterial thrombi. Coadministration of NAC and a nonpeptidic GpIIb/IIIa inhibitor further improved its thrombolytic efficacy, essentially by accelerating thrombus dissolution and preventing rethrombosis. Thus, in a new large-vessel thromboembolic stroke model in mice, this cotreatment significantly improved ischemic lesion size and neurological outcome. It is important to note that NAC did not worsen hemorrhagic stroke outcome, suggesting that it exerts thrombolytic effects without significantly impairing normal hemostasis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We provide evidence that NAC is an effective and safe alternative to currently available antithrombotic agents to restore vessel patency after arterial occlusion.</p></sec>

Long Noncoding RNA MANTIS Facilitates Endothelial Angiogenic Function
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The angiogenic function of endothelial cells is regulated by numerous mechanisms, but the impact of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) has hardly been studied. We set out to identify novel and functionally important endothelial lncRNAs.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Epigenetically controlled lncRNAs in human umbilical vein endothelial cells were searched by exon-array analysis after knockdown of the histone demethylase JARID1B. Molecular mechanisms were investigated by RNA pulldown and immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, microarray, several knockdown approaches, CRISPR-Cas9, assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing, and chromatin immunoprecipitation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Patient samples from lung and tumors were studied for MANTIS expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A search for epigenetically controlled endothelial lncRNAs yielded lncRNA n342419, here termed MANTIS, as the most strongly regulated lncRNA. Controlled by the histone demethylase JARID1B, MANTIS was downregulated in patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension and in rats treated with monocrotaline, whereas it was upregulated in carotid arteries of <i>Macaca fascicularis</i> subjected to atherosclerosis regression diet, and in endothelial cells isolated from human glioblastoma patients. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion or silencing of MANTIS with small interfering RNAs or GapmeRs inhibited angiogenic sprouting and alignment of endothelial cells in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shear</span></strong></span></strong> stress. Mechanistically, the nuclear-localized MANTIS lncRNA interacted with BRG1, the catalytic subunit of the switch/sucrose nonfermentable chromatin-remodeling complex. This interaction was required for nucleosome remodeling by keeping the ATPase function of BRG1 active. Thereby, the transcription of key endothelial genes such as <i>SOX18</i>, <i>SMAD6</i>, and <i>COUP-TFII</i> was regulated by ensuring efficient RNA polymerase II machinery binding.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>MANTIS is a differentially regulated novel lncRNA facilitating endothelial angiogenic function.</p></sec>

Hemocompatibility-Related Outcomes in the MOMENTUM 3 Trial at 6 Months
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The HeartMate 3 (HM3) Left Ventricular Assist System (LVAS) (Abbott) is a centrifugal, fully magnetically levitated, continuous-flow blood pump engineered to enhance hemocompatibility and reduce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shear</span></strong></span></strong> stress on blood components. The MOMENTUM 3 trial (Multicenter Study of MagLev Technology in Patients Undergoing Mechanical Circulatory Support Therapy With HeartMate 3) compares the HM3 LVAS with the HeartMate II (HMII) LVAS (Abbott) in advanced heart failure refractory to medical management, irrespective of therapeutic intention (bridge to transplant versus destination therapy). This investigation reported its primary outcome in the short-term cohort (n=294; 6-month follow-up), demonstrating superiority of the HM3 for the trial primary end point (survival free of a disabling stroke or reoperation to replace the pump for malfunction), driven by a reduced need for reoperations. The aim of this analysis was to evaluate the aggregate of hemocompatibility-related clinical adverse events (HRAEs) between the 2 LVAS.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a secondary end point evaluation of HRAE (survival free of any nonsurgical bleeding, thromboembolic event, pump thrombosis, or neurological event) in the short-term cohort (as-treated cohort n=289) at 6 months. The net burden of HRAE was also assessed by using a previously described hemocompatibility score, which uses 4 escalating tiers of hierarchal severity to derive a total score for events encountered during the entire follow-up experience for each patient.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In 289 patients in the as-treated group (151 the HM3 and 138 the HMII), survival free of any HRAE was achieved in 69% of the HM3 group and in 55% of the HMII group (hazard ratio, 0.62; confidence interval, 0.42–0.91; <i>P</i>=0.012). Using the hemocompatibility score, the HM3 group demonstrated less pump thrombosis requiring reoperation (0 versus 36 points, <i>P</i><0.001) or medically managed pump thrombosis (0 versus 5 points, <i>P</i>=0.02), and fewer nondisabling strokes (6 versus 24 points, <i>P</i>=0.026) than the control HMII LVAS. The net hemocompatibility score in the HM3 in comparison with the HMII patients was 101 (0.67±1.50 points/patient) versus 137 (0.99±1.79 points/patient) (odds ratio, 0.64; confidence interval, 0.39–1.03; <i>P</i>=0.065).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In this secondary analysis of the MOMENTUM 3 trial, the HM3 LVAS demonstrated greater freedom from HRAEs in comparison with the HMII LVAS at 6 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Cathepsin G Controls Arterial But Not Venular Myeloid Cell Recruitment
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Therapeutic targeting of arterial leukocyte recruitment in the context of atherosclerosis has been disappointing in clinical studies. Reasons for such failures include the lack of knowledge of arterial-specific recruitment patterns. Here we establish the importance of the cathepsin G (CatG) in the context of arterial myeloid cell recruitment.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Intravital microscopy of the carotid artery, the jugular vein, and cremasteric arterioles and venules in <i>Apoe</i><sup><i>–/–</i></sup>and CatG-deficient mice (<i>Apoe</i><sup><i>–/–</i></sup><i>Ctsg</i><sup><i>–/–</i></sup>) was used to study site-specific myeloid cell behavior after high-fat diet feeding or tumor necrosis factor stimulation. Atherosclerosis development was assessed in aortic root sections after 4 weeks of high-fat diet, whereas lung inflammation was assessed after inhalation of lipopolysaccharide. Endothelial deposition of CatG and CCL5 was quantified in whole-mount preparations using 2-photon and confocal microscopy.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Our observations elucidated a crucial role for CatG during arterial leukocyte adhesion, an effect not found during venular adhesion. Consequently, CatG deficiency attenuates atherosclerosis but not acute lung inflammation. Mechanistically, CatG is immobilized on arterial endothelium where it activates leukocytes to firmly adhere engaging integrin clustering, a process of crucial importance to achieve effective adherence under high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shear</span></strong></span></strong> flow. Therapeutic neutralization of CatG specifically abrogated arterial leukocyte adhesion without affecting myeloid cell adhesion in the microcirculation. Repetitive application of CatG-neutralizing antibodies permitted inhibition of atherogenesis in mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Taken together, these findings present evidence of an arterial-specific recruitment pattern centered on CatG-instructed adhesion strengthening. The inhibition of this process could provide a novel strategy for treatment of arterial inflammation with limited side effects.</p></sec>

Targeted mutagenesis using CRISPR/Cas system in medaka
<p>Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) system-based RNA-guided endonuclease (RGEN) has recently emerged as a simple and efficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong> for targeted genome editing. In this study, we showed successful targeted mutagenesis using RGENs in medaka, <i>Oryzias latipes</i>. Somatic and heritable mutations were induced with high efficiency at the targeted genomic sequence on the <i>DJ-1</i> gene in embryos that had been injected with the single guide RNA (sgRNA) transcribed by a T7 promoter and capped RNA encoding a Cas9 nuclease. The sgRNAs that were designed for the target genomic sequences without the 5′ end of GG required by the T7 promoter induced the targeted mutations. This suggests that the RGEN can target any sequence adjacent to an NGG protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence, which occurs once every 8 bp. The off-target alterations at 2 genomic loci harboring double mismatches in the 18-bp targeting sequences were induced in the RGEN-injected embryos. However, we also found that the off-target effects could be reduced by lower dosages of sgRNA. Taken together, our results suggest that CRISPR/Cas-mediated RGENs may be an efficient and flexible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong> for genome editing in medaka.</p>

Cross-species analysis of genetically engineered mouse models of MAPK-driven colorectal cancer identifies hallmarks of the human disease
<p>Effective treatment options for advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) are limited, survival rates are poor and this disease continues to be a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Despite being a highly heterogeneous disease, a large subset of individuals with sporadic CRC typically harbor relatively few established ‘driver’ lesions. Here, we describe a collection of genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of sporadic CRC that combine lesions frequently altered in human patients, including well-characterized tumor suppressors and activators of MAPK signaling. Primary tumors from these models were profiled, and individual GEMM tumors segregated into groups based on their genotypes. Unique allelic and genotypic expression signatures were generated from these GEMMs and applied to clinically annotated human CRC patient samples. We provide evidence that a <i>Kras</i> signature derived from these GEMMs is capable of distinguishing human tumors harboring <i>KRAS</i> mutation, and tracks with poor prognosis in two independent human patient cohorts. Furthermore, the analysis of a panel of human CRC cell lines suggests that high expression of the GEMM <i>Kras</i> signature correlates with sensitivity to targeted pathway inhibitors. Together, these findings implicate GEMMs as powerful preclinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong>s with the capacity to recapitulate relevant human disease biology, and support the use of genetic signatures generated in these models to facilitate future drug discovery and validation efforts.</p>

Functional analysis of a zebrafish <i>myd88</i> mutant identifies key transcriptional components of the innate immune system
<p>Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are an important class of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that recognize microbial and danger signals. Their downstream signaling upon ligand binding is vital for initiation of the innate immune response. In human and mammalian models, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MYD88) is known for its central role as an adaptor molecule in interleukin 1 receptor (IL-1R) and TLR signaling. The zebrafish is increasingly used as a complementary model system for disease research and drug screening. Here, we describe a zebrafish line with a truncated version of MyD88 as the first zebrafish mutant for a TLR signaling component. We show that this immune-compromised mutant has a lower survival rate under standard rearing conditions and is more susceptible to challenge with the acute bacterial pathogens <i>Edwardsiella tarda</i> and <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i>. Microarray and quantitative PCR analysis revealed that expression of genes for transcription factors central to innate immunity (including NF-ĸB and AP-1) and the pro-inflammatory cytokine Il1b, is dependent on MyD88 signaling during these bacterial infections. Nevertheless, expression of immune genes independent of MyD88 in the <i>myd88</i> mutant line was sufficient to limit growth of an attenuated <i>S. typhimurium</i> strain. In the case of infection with the chronic bacterial pathogen <i>Mycobacterium marinum</i>, we show that MyD88 signaling has an important protective role during early pathogenesis. During mycobacterial infection, the <i>myd88</i> mutant shows accelerated formation of granuloma-like aggregates and increased bacterial burden, with associated lower induction of genes central to innate immunity. This zebrafish <i>myd88</i> mutant will be a valuable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong> for further study of the role of IL1R and TLR signaling in the innate immunity processes underlying infectious diseases, inflammatory disorders and cancer.</p>

Generation and validation of a zebrafish model of EAST (epilepsy, ataxia, sensorineural deafness and tubulopathy) syndrome
<p>Recessive mutations in <i>KCNJ10</i>, which encodes an inwardly rectifying potassium channel, were recently identified as the cause of EAST syndrome, a severe and disabling multi-organ disorder consisting of epilepsy, ataxia, sensorineural deafness and tubulopathy that becomes clinically apparent with seizures in infancy. A <i>Kcnj10</i> knockout mouse shows postnatal mortality and is therefore not suitable for drug discovery. Because zebrafish are ideal for <i>in vivo</i> screening for potential therapeutics, we tested whether <i>kcnj10</i> knockdown in zebrafish would fill this need. We cloned zebrafish <i>kcnj10</i> and demonstrated that its function is equivalent to that of human <i>KCNJ10</i>. We next injected splice- and translation-blocking <i>kcnj10</i> antisense morpholino oligonucleotides and reproduced the cardinal symptoms of EAST syndrome – ataxia, epilepsy and renal tubular defects. Several of these phenotypes could be assayed in an automated manner. We could rescue the morphant phenotype with complementary RNA (cRNA) encoding human wild-type KCNJ10, but not with cRNA encoding a KCNJ10 mutation identified in individuals with EAST syndrome. Our results suggest that zebrafish will be a valuable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong> to screen for compounds that are potentially therapeutic for EAST syndrome or its individual symptoms. Knockdown of <i>kcnj10</i> represents the first zebrafish model of a salt-losing tubulopathy, which has relevance for blood pressure control.</p>

Bloomsbury report on mouse embryo phenotyping: recommendations from the IMPC workshop on embryonic lethal screening
<p>Identifying genes that are important for embryo development is a crucial first step towards understanding their many functions in driving the ordered growth, differentiation and organogenesis of embryos. It can also shed light on the origins of developmental disease and congenital abnormalities. Current international efforts to examine gene function in the mouse provide a unique opportunity to pinpoint genes that are involved in embryogenesis, owing to the emergence of embryonic lethal knockout mutants. Through internationally coordinated efforts, the International Knockout Mouse Consortium (IKMC) has generated a public resource of mouse knockout strains and, in April 2012, the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC), supported by the EU InfraCoMP programme, convened a workshop to discuss developing a phenotyping pipeline for the investigation of embryonic lethal knockout lines. This workshop brought together over 100 scientists, from 13 countries, who are working in the academic and commercial research sectors, including experts and opinion leaders in the fields of embryology, animal imaging, data capture, quality control and annotation, high-throughput mouse production, phenotyping, and reporter gene analysis. This article summarises the outcome of the workshop, including (1) the vital scientific importance of phenotyping embryonic lethal mouse strains for basic and translational research; (2) a common framework to harmonise international efforts within this context; (3) the types of phenotyping that are likely to be most appropriate for systematic use, with a focus on 3D embryo imaging; (4) the importance of centralising data in a standardised form to facilitate data mining; and (5) the development of online <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong>s to allow open access to and dissemination of the phenotyping data.</p>

CTDGFinder: A Novel Homology-Based Algorithm for Identifying Closely Spaced Clusters of Tandemly Duplicated Genes
<p>Closely spaced clusters of tandemly duplicated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s (CTDGs) contribute to the diversity of many phenotypes, including chemosensation, snake venom, and animal body plans. CTDGs have traditionally been identified subjectively as genomic neighborhoods containing several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> duplicates in close proximity; however, CTDGs are often highly variable with respect to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> number, intergenic distance, and synteny. This lack of formal definition hampers the study of CTDG evolutionary dynamics and the discovery of novel CTDGs in the exponentially growing body of genomic data. To address this gap, we developed a novel homology-based algorithm, CTDGFinder, which formalizes and automates the identification of CTDGs by examining the physical distribution of individual members of families of duplicated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s across chromosomes. Application of CTDGFinder accurately identified CTDGs for many well-known <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters (e.g., Hox and beta-globin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters) in the human, mouse and 20 other mammalian genomes. Differences between previously annotated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters and our inferred CTDGs were due to the exclusion of nonhomologs that have historically been considered parts of specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters, the inclusion or absence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s between the CTDGs and their corresponding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters, and the splitting of certain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters into distinct CTDGs. Examination of human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s showing tissue-specific enhancement of their expression by CTDGFinder identified members of several well-known <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters (e.g., cytochrome P450s and olfactory receptors) and revealed that they were unequally distributed across tissues. By formalizing and automating CTDG identification, CTDGFinder will facilitate understanding of CTDG evolutionary dynamics, their functional implications, and how they are associated with phenotypic diversity.</p>

The Roles of Mutation, Selection, and Expression in Determining Relative Rates of Evolution in Mitochondrial versus Nuclear Genomes
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eukaryot</span></strong>es rely on proteins encoded by the nuclear and mitochondrial (mt) genomes, which interact within multisubunit complexes such as oxidative-phosphorylation enzymes. Although selection is thought to be less efficient on the asexual mt genome, in bilaterian animals the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions (<i>ω</i>) is lower in mt- compared with nuclear-encoded OXPHOS subunits, suggesting <i>stronger</i> effects of purifying selection in the mt genome. Because high levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion constrain protein sequence evolution, one proposed resolution to this paradox is that mt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s are expressed more highly than nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. To test this hypothesis, we investigated expression and sequence evolution of mt and nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s from 84 diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eukaryot</span></strong>es that vary in mt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> content and mutation rate. We found that the relationship between mt and nuclear <i>ω</i> values varied dramatically across <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eukaryot</span></strong>es. In contrast, transcript abundance is consistently higher for mt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s than nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, regardless of which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s happen to be in the mt genome. Consequently, expression levels cannot be responsible for the differences in <i>ω</i>. Rather, 84% of the variance in the ratio of <i>ω</i> values between mt and nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s could be explained by differences in mutation rate between the two genomes. We relate these findings to the hypothesis that high rates of mt mutation select for compensatory changes in the nuclear genome. We also propose an explanation for why mt transcripts consistently outnumber their nuclear counterparts, with implications for mitonuclear protein imbalance and aging.</p>

Gcorn Plant: A Database for Retrieving Functional and Evolutionary Traits of Plant Genes
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> homology helps us understand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> function and speciation. The number of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s and species registered in public databanks is continuously increasing. It is useful to associate homologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s of various plants to better understand plant speciation. We designed the Gcorn plant database for the retrieval of information on homology and evolution of a plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> of interest. Amino acid sequences of 73 species (62 land plants and 11 green algae), containing 2,682,261 sequences, were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Reference Sequence database. Based on NCBI BLAST searches between these sequences, homologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s were grouped at various thresholds of homology indices devised by the authors. To show functional and evolutionary traits of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> of interest, a phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic tree, connecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s with high homology indices, and line charts of the numbers of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s with various homology indices, are depicted. In addition, such indices are projected on a network graph in which species studied are connected based on the ratios of homologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, and on a phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic tree for species based on NCBI Taxonomy. Gcorn plant provides information on homologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s at various virtual time points along with speciation in plants.</p>

Roles of miR319 and TCP Transcription Factors in Leaf Development
<p>Sophisticated regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and their target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, is required for leaf differentiation, growth, and senescence. The impact of miR319 and its target <i>TEOSINTE BRANCHED1</i>, <i>CYCLOIDEA</i>, and <i>PROLIFERATING CELL NUCLEAR ANTIGEN BINDING FACTOR</i> (<i>TCP</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s on leaf development has been extensively investigated, but the redundancies of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families often interfere with the evaluation of their function and regulation in the developmental context. Here, we present the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic evidence of the involvement of the <i>MIR319</i> and <i>TCP</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaf development. Single mutations in <i>MIR319A</i> and <i>MIR319B</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s moderately inhibited the formation of leaf serrations, whereas double mutations increased the extent of this inhibition and resulted in the formation of smooth leaves. Mutations in <i>MIR319</i> and gain-of-function mutations in the <i>TCP4</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> conferred resistance against miR319 and impaired the cotyledon boundary and leaf serration formation. These mutations functionally associated with <i>CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, which regulate the cotyledon boundary and leaf serration formation. In contrast, loss-of-function mutations in miR319-targeted and nontargeted <i>TCP</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s cooperatively induced the formation of serrated leaves in addition to changes in the levels of their downstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> transcript. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the <i>MIR319</i> and <i>TCP</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families underlie robust and multilayer control of leaf development. This study also provides a framework toward future researches on redundant miRNAs and transcription factors in Arabidopsis and crop plants.</p>

Unique Physiological and Transcriptional Shifts under Combinations of Salinity, Drought, and Heat
<p>Climate-change-driven stresses such as extreme temperatures, water deficit, and ion imbalance are projected to exacerbate and jeopardize global food security. Under field conditions, these stresses usually occur simultaneously and cause damages that exceed single stresses. Here, we investigated the transcriptional patterns and morpho-physiological acclimations of <i>Brachypodium dystachion</i> to single salinity, drought, and heat stresses, as well as their double and triple stress combinations. Hierarchical clustering analysis of morpho-physiological acclimations showed that several traits exhibited a gradually aggravating effect as plants were exposed to combined stresses. On the other hand, other morphological traits were dominated by salinity, while some physiological traits were shaped by heat stress. Response patterns of differentially expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, under single and combined stresses (i.e. common stress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s), were maintained only among 37% of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, indicating a limited expression consistency among partially overlapping stresses. A comparison between common stress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s that were uniquely expressed only under combined stresses (i.e. combination unique <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s) revealed a significant shift from increased intensity to antagonistic responses, respectively. The different transcriptional signatures imply an alteration in the mode of action under combined stresses and limited ability to predict plant responses as different stresses are combined. Coexpression analysis coupled with enrichment analysis revealed that each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> subset was enriched with different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical processes. Common stress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s were enriched with known stress response pathways, while combination unique-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s were enriched with unique processes and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s with unknown functions that hold the potential to improve stress tolerance and enhance cereal productivity under suboptimal field conditions.</p>

Stability of Single-Parent Gene Expression Complementation in Maize Hybrids upon Water Deficit Stress
<p>Heterosis is the superior performance of F1 hybrids compared with their homozygous, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tically distinct parents. In this study, we monitored the transcriptomic divergence of the maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) inbred lines B73 and Mo17 and their reciprocal F1 hybrid progeny in primary roots under control and water deficit conditions simulated by polyethylene glycol treatment. Single-parent expression (SPE) of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s is an extreme instance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion complementation, in which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s are active in only one of two parents but are expressed in both reciprocal hybrids. In this study, 1,997 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s only expressed in B73 and 2,024 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s only expressed in Mo17 displayed SPE complementation under control and water deficit conditions. As a consequence, the number of active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in hybrids exceeded the number of active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in the parental inbred lines significantly independent of treatment. SPE patterns were substantially more stable to expression changes by water deficit treatment than other genotype-specific expression profiles. While, on average, 75% of all SPE patterns were not altered in response to polyethylene glycol treatment, only 17% of the remaining genotype-specific expression patterns were not changed by water deficit. Nonsyntenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s that lack syntenic orthologs in other grass species, and thus evolved late in the grass lineage, were significantly overrepresented among SPE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. Hence, the significant overrepresentation of nonsyntenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s among SPE patterns and their stability under water limitation might suggest a function of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s during the early developmental manifestation of heterosis under fluctuating environmental conditions in hybrid progeny of the inbred lines B73 and Mo17.</p>

The Evolution of Innate Immune Genes: Purifying and Balancing Selection on β-Defensins in Waterfowl
<p>In disease dynamics, high immune <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> diversity can confer a selective advantage to hosts in the face of a rapidly evolving and diverse pathogen fauna. This is supported empirically for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s involved in pathogen recognition and signalling. In contrast, effector <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s involved in pathogen clearance may be more constrained. β-Defensins are innate immune effector <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s; their main mode of action is via disruption of microbial membranes. Here, five β-defensin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s were characterized in mallards (<i>Anas platyrhynchos</i>) and other waterfowl; key reservoir species for many zoonotic diseases. All five <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s showed remarkably low diversity at the individual-, population-, and species-level. Furthermore, there was widespread sharing of identical alleles across species divides. Thus, specific β-defensin alleles were maintained not only spatially but also over long temporal scales, with many amino acid residues being fixed across all species investigated. Purifying selection to maintain individual, highly efficacious alleles was the primary evolutionary driver of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in waterfowl. However, we also found evidence for balancing selection acting on the most recently duplicated β-defensin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> (<i>AvBD3b</i>). For this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>, we found that amino acid replacements were more likely to be radical changes, suggesting that duplication of β-defensin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s allows exploration of wider functional space. Structural conservation to maintain function appears to be crucial for avian β-defensin effector molecules, resulting in low tolerance for new allelic variants. This contrasts with other types of innate immune <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, such as receptor and signalling molecules, where balancing selection to maintain allelic diversity has been shown to be a strong evolutionary force.</p>

Old but Not (So) Degenerated—Slow Evolution of Largely Homomorphic Sex Chromosomes in Ratites
<p>De<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>ration of the nonrecombining chromosome is a common feature of sex chromosome evolution, readily evident by the presence of a pair of largely heteromorphic chromosomes, like in eutherian mammals and birds. However, in ratites (order Palaeognathae, including, e.g., ostrich), the Z and W chromosomes are similar in size and largely undifferentiated, despite avian sex chromosome evolution was initiated > 130 Ma. To better understand what may limit sex chromosome evolution, we performed ostrich transcriptome sequencing and studied <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s from the nonrecombining region of the W chromosome. Fourteen gametologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> pairs present on the W chromosome and Z chromosome were identified, with synonymous sequence divergence of 0.027–0.177. The location of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s on the Z chromosome was consistent with a sequential increase in divergence, starting 110–157 and ending 24–30 Ma. On the basis of the occurrence of Z-linked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s hemizygous in females, we estimate that about one-third of the Z chromosome does not recombine with the W chromosome in female meiosis. Pairwise <i>d</i><sub>N</sub><i>/d</i><sub>S</sub> between gametologs decreased with age, suggesting strong evolutionary constraint in old gametologs. Lineage-specific <i>d</i><sub>N</sub><i>/d</i><sub>S</sub> was consistently higher in W-linked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, in accordance with the lower efficacy of selection expected in nonrecombining chromosomes. A higher ratio of GC > AT:AT > GC substitutions in W-linked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s supports a role for GC-biased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> conversion in differentially driving base composition on the two sex chromosomes. A male-to-female (M:F) expression ratio of close to one for recombining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s and close to two for Z-linked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s lacking a W copy show that dosage compensation is essentially absent. Some gametologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s have retained active expression of the W copy in females (giving a M:F ratio of 1 for the gametologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> pair), whereas for others W expression has become severely reduced resulting in a M:F ratio of close to 2. These observations resemble the patterns of sex chromosome evolution seen in other avian and mammalian lineages, suggesting similar underlying evolutionary processes, although the rate of sex chromosome differentiation has been atypically low. Lack of dosage compensation may be a factor hindering sex chromosome evolution in this lineage.</p>

Atypical Protein Phosphatase 2A Gene Families Do Not Expand via Paleopolyploidization
<p>Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) presents unique opportunities for analyzing molecular mechanisms of functional divergence between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> family members. The canonical PP2A holoenzyme regulates multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eukaryot</span></strong>ic signaling pathways by dephosphorylating target proteins and contains a catalytic (C) subunit, a structural/scaffolding (A) subunit, and a regulatory (B) subunit. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s encoding PP2A subunits have expanded into multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families in both flowering plants and mammals, and the extent to which different isoform functions may overlap is not clearly understood. To gain insight into the diversification of PP2A subunits, we used phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic analyses to reconstruct the evolutionary histories of PP2A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s encoding PP2A subunits in mammals represent ancient lineages that expanded early in vertebrate evolution, while flowering plant PP2A subunit lineages evolved much more recently. Despite this temporal difference, our data indicate that the expansion of PP2A subunit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families in both flowering plants and animals was driven by whole-genome duplications followed by nonrandom <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> loss. Selection analysis suggests that the expansion of one B subunit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> family (B56/PPP2R5) was driven by functional diversification rather than by the maintenance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> dosage. We also observed reduced expansion rates in three distinct B subunit subclades. One of these subclades plays a highly conserved role in cell division, while the distribution of a second subclade suggests a specialized function in supporting beneficial microbial associations. Thus, while whole-genome duplications have driven the expansion and diversification of most PP2A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families, members of functionally specialized subclades quickly revert to singleton status after duplication events.</p>

Histone Modifications Define Expression Bias of Homoeologous Genomes in Allotetraploid Cotton
<p>Histone modifications regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eukaryot</span></strong>es, but their roles in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion changes in interspecific hybrids or allotetraploids are poorly understood. Histone modifications can be mapped by immunostaining of metaphase chromosomes at the single cell level and/or by chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) for analyzing individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. Here, we comparatively analyzed immunostained metaphase chromosomes and ChIP-seq of individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, which revealed a chromatin basis for biased homoeologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion in polyploids. We examined H3K4me3 density and transcriptome maps in root-tip cells of allotetraploid cotton (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>). The overall H3K4me3 levels were relatively equal between A and D chromosomes, which were consistent with equal numbers of expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s between the two subgenomes. However, intensities per chromosomal area were nearly twice as high in the D homeologs as in the A homeologs. Consistent with the cytological observation, ChIP-seq analysis showed that more D homeologs with biased H3K4me3 levels than A homeologs with biased modifications correlated with the greater number of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s with D-biased expression than that with A-biased expression in most homeologous chromosome pairs. Two chromosomes displayed different expression levels compared with other chromosomes, which correlate with known translocations and may affect the local chromatin structure and expression levels for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s involved. This example of genome-wide histone modifications that determine expression bias of homeologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in allopolyploids provides a molecular basis for the evolution and domestication of polyploid species, including many important crops.</p>

The Evolution of Silicon Transport in Eukaryotes
<p>Biosilicification (the formation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical structures from silica) occurs in diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eukaryot</span></strong>ic lineages, plays a major role in global biogeochemical cycles, and has significant biotechnological applications. Silicon (Si) uptake is crucial for biosilicification, yet the evolutionary history of the transporters involved remains poorly known. Recent evidence suggests that the SIT family of Si transporters, initially identified in diatoms, may be widely distributed, with an extended family of related transporters (SIT-Ls) present in some nonsilicified organisms. Here, we identify SITs and SIT-Ls in a range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eukaryot</span></strong>es, including major silicified lineages (radiolarians and chrysophytes) and also bacterial SIT-Ls. Our evidence suggests that the symmetrical 10-transmembrane-domain SIT structure has independently evolved multiple times via duplication and fusion of 5-transmembrane-domain SIT-Ls. We also identify a second <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> family, similar to the active Si transporter Lsi2, that is broadly distributed amongst siliceous and nonsiliceous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eukaryot</span></strong>es. Our analyses resolve a distinct group of Lsi2-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, including plant and diatom Si-responsive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, and sequences unique to siliceous sponges and choanoflagellates. The SIT/SIT-L and Lsi2 transporter families likely contribute to biosilicification in diverse lineages, indicating an ancient role for Si transport in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eukaryot</span></strong>es. We propose that these Si transporters may have arisen initially to prevent Si toxicity in the high Si Precambrian oceans, with subsequent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ically induced reductions in Si concentrations of Phanerozoic seas leading to widespread losses of SIT, SIT-L, and Lsi2-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in diverse lineages. Thus, the origin and diversification of two independent Si transporter families both drove and were driven by ancient ocean Si levels.</p>

Molecular Characterization and Evolution of a Gene Family Encoding Both Female- and Male-Specific Reproductive Proteins in <i>Drosophila</i>
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> duplication is an important mechanism for the evolution of new reproductive proteins. However, in most cases, each resulting paralog continues to function within the same sex. To investigate the possibility that seminal fluid proteins arise through duplicates of female reproductive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s that become “co-opted” by males, we screened female reproductive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> for cases of duplication in which one of the resulting paralogs produces a protein in males that is transferred to females during mating. We identified a set of three tandemly duplicated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s that encode secreted serine-type endopeptidase homologs, two of which are expressed primarily in the female reproductive tract (RT), whereas the third is expressed specifically in the male RT and encodes a seminal fluid protein. Evolutionary and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion analyses across <i>Drosophila</i> species suggest that this family arose from a single-copy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> that was female-specific; after duplication, one paralog evolved male-specific expression. Functional tests of knockdowns of each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> in <i>D. melanogaster</i> show that one female-expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> is essential for full fecundity, and both female-expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s contribute singly or in combination to a female’s propensity to remate. In contrast, knockdown of the male-expressed paralog had no significant effect on female fecundity or remating. These data are consistent with a model in which members of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> family exert effects on females by acting on a common, female-expressed target. After duplication and male co-option of one paralog, the evolution of the interacting proteins could have resulted in differential strengths or effects of each paralog.</p>

Evidence for Selection on Gene Expression in Cultivated Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>)
<p>Artificial selection has been used throughout plant domestication and breeding to develop crops that are adapted to diverse environments. Here, we investigate whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> regulatory changes have been widespread targets of lineage-specific selection in cultivated lines Minghui 63 and Zhenshan 97 of rice, <i>Oryza sativa</i>. A line experiencing positive selection for either an increase or a decrease in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s' transcript abundances is expected to have an overabundance of expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) alleles that increase or decrease those <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s' expression, respectively. Results indicate that several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s that share <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> Ontology terms or are members of the same coexpression module have eQTL alleles from one parent that consistently increase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion relative to the second parent. A second line of evidence for lineage-specific selection is an overabundance of <i>cis–trans</i> pairs of eQTL alleles that affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion in the same direction (are reinforcing). Across all <i>cis–trans</i> pairs of eQTL, including pairs that both weakly and strongly affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion, there is no evidence for selection. However, the frequency of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s with reinforcing eQTL increases with eQTL strength. Therefore, there is evidence that eQTL with strong effects were positively selected during rice cultivation. Among 41 <i>cis–trans</i> pairs with strong <i>trans</i> eQTL, 31 have reinforcing eQTL. Several of the candidate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s under positive selection accurately predict phenotypic differences between Minghui 63 and Zhenshan 97. Overall, our results suggest that positive selection for regulatory alleles may be a key factor in plant improvement.</p>

Systematic Biology
Lateral Gene Transfer from the Dead
<p>In phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic studies, the evolution of molecular sequences is assumed to have taken place along the phylogeny traced by the ancestors of extant species. In the presence of lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> transfer, however, this may not be the case, because the species lineage from which a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> was transferred may have gone extinct or not have been sampled. Because it is not feasible to specify or reconstruct the complete phylogeny of all species, we must describe the evolution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s outside the represented phylogeny by modeling the speciation dynamics that gave rise to the complete phylogeny. We demonstrate that if the number of sampled species is small compared with the total number of existing species, the overwhelming majority of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> transfers involve speciation to and evolution along extinct or unsampled lineages. We show that the evolution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s along extinct or unsampled lineages can to good approximation be treated as those of independently evolving lineages described by a few global parameters. Using this result, we derive an algorithm to calculate the probability of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> tree and recover the maximum-likelihood reconciliation given the phylogeny of the sampled species. Examining 473 near-universal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families from 36 cyanobacteria, we find that nearly a third of transfer events (28%) appear to have topological signatures of evolution along extinct species, but only approximately 6% of transfers trace their ancestry to before the common ancestor of the sampled cyanobacteria.

Genetics of Variable Disease Expression Conferred by Inverse Gene-For-Gene Interactions in the Wheat-<i>Parastagonospora nodorum</i> Pathosystem
<p>The wheat-<i>Parastagonospora nodorum</i> pathosystem involves the recognition of pathogen-secreted necrotrophic effectors (NEs) by corresponding wheat NE sensitivity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. This inverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>-for-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> recognition leads to necrotrophic effector-triggered susceptibility and ultimately septoria nodorum blotch disease. Here, we used multiple pathogen isolates to individually evaluate the effects of the host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>-NE interactions <i>Tan spot necrosis1</i>-Stagonospora nodorum ToxinA (<i>Tsn1</i>-SnToxA), <i>Stagonospora nodorum necrosis1</i>-Stagonospora nodorum Toxin1 (<i>Snn1</i>-SnTox1), and <i>Stagonospora nodorum necrosis3-B genome homeolog1</i>-Stagonospora nodorum Toxin3 (<i>Snn3-B1</i>-SnTox3), alone and in various combinations, to determine the relative importance of these interactions in causing disease. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic analysis of a recombinant inbred wheat population inoculated separately with three <i>P. nodorum</i> isolates, all of which produce all three NEs, indicated that the <i>Tsn1</i>-SnToxA and <i>Snn3-B1</i>-SnTox3 interactions contributed to disease caused by all four isolates, but their effects varied and ranged from epistatic to additive. The <i>Snn1</i>-SnTox1 interaction was associated with increased disease for one isolate, but for other isolates, there was evidence that this interaction inhibited the expression of other host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>-NE interactions. RNA sequencing analysis in planta showed that <i>SnTox1</i> was differentially expressed between these three isolates after infection. Further analysis of NE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>-knockout isolates showed that the effect of some interactions could be masked or inhibited by other compatible interactions, and the regulation of this occurs at the level of NE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> transcription. Collectively, these results show that the inverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>-for-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> interactions leading to necrotrophic effector-triggered susceptibility in the wheat-<i>P. nodorum</i> pathosystem vary in their effects depending on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic backgrounds of the pathogen and host, and interplay among the interactions is complex and intricately regulated.</p>

Evolution of Cold Acclimation and Its Role in Niche Transition in the Temperate Grass Subfamily Pooideae
<p>The grass subfamily Pooideae dominates the grass floras in cold temperate regions and has evolved complex physiological adaptations to cope with extreme environmental conditions like frost, winter, and seasonality. One such adaptation is cold acclimation, wherein plants increase their frost tolerance in response to gradually falling temperatures and shorter days in the autumn. However, understanding how complex traits like cold acclimation evolve remains a major challenge in evolutionary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y. Here, we investigated the evolution of cold acclimation in Pooideae and found that a phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tically diverse set of Pooideae species displayed cold acclimation capacity. However, comparing differential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion after cold treatment in transcriptomes of five phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tically diverse species revealed widespread species-specific responses of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s with conserved sequences. Furthermore, we studied the correlation between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> family size and number of cold-responsive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s as well as between selection pressure on coding sequences of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s and their cold responsiveness. We saw evidence of protein-coding and regulatory sequence evolution as well as the origin of novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s and functions contributing toward evolution of a cold response in Pooideae. Our results reflect that selection pressure resulting from global cooling must have acted on already diverged lineages. Nevertheless, conservation of cold-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion of certain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s indicates that the Pooideae ancestor may have possessed some molecular machinery to mitigate cold stress. Evolution of adaptations to seasonally cold climates is regarded as particularly difficult. How Pooideae evolved to transition from tropical to temperate biomes sheds light on how complex traits evolve in the light of climate changes.</p>

Engineering Artificial MicroRNAs for Multiplex Gene Silencing and Simplified Transgenic Screen

In both single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> and multiple-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> silencing, we observed an overall improvement in performance by amiRNAs designed using our strategy in Arabidopsis protoplasts and transgenic plants.

Out of Water: The Origin and Early Diversification of Plant <i>R</i>-Genes
<p>During plant-pathogen interactions, plants use intracellular proteins with nucleotide-binding site and Leu-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) domains to detect pathogens. NBS-LRR proteins represent a major class of plant disease resistance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s (<i>R</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s). Whereas <i>R</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s have been well characterized in angiosperms, little is known about their origin and early diversification. Here, we perform comprehensive evolutionary analyses of <i>R</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in plants and report the identification of <i>R</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in basal-branching streptophytes, including charophytes, liverworts, and mosses. Phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic analyses suggest that plant <i>R</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s originated in charophytes and R-proteins diversified into TIR-NBS-LRR proteins and non-TIR-NBS-LRR proteins in charophytes. Moreover, we show that plant R-proteins evolved in a modular fashion through frequent gain or loss of protein domains. Most of the <i>R</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in basal-branching streptophytes underwent adaptive evolution, indicating an ancient involvement of <i>R</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in plant-pathogen interactions.

Processes Underlying a Reproductive Barrier in <i>indica</i>-<i>japonica</i> Rice Hybrids Revealed by Transcriptome Analysis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>In rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), hybrids between <i>indica</i> and <i>japonica</i> subspecies are usually highly sterile, which provides a model system for studying postzygotic reproductive isolation. A killer-protector system, <i>S5</i>, composed of three adjacent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s (<i>ORF3</i>, <i>ORF4</i>, and <i>ORF5</i>), regulates female gamete fertility of <i>indica-japonica</i> hybrids. To characterize the processes underlying this system, we performed transcriptomic analyses of pistils from rice variety Balilla (BL), Balilla with transformed <i>ORF5+</i> (BL<i>5+</i>) producing sterile female gametes, and Balilla with transformed <i>ORF3+</i> and <i>ORF5+</i> (BL<i>3+5+</i>) producing fertile gametes. RNA sequencing of tissues collected before (MMC), during (MEI), and after (AME) meiosis of the megaspore mother cell detected 19,269 to 20,928 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s as expressed. Comparison between BL<i>5+</i> and BL showed that <i>ORF5+</i> induced differential expression of 8,339, 6,278, and 530 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s at MMC, MEI, and AME, respectively. At MMC, large-scale differential expression of cell wall-modifying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s and biotic and abiotic response <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s indicated that cell wall integrity damage induced severe biotic and abiotic stresses. The processes continued to MEI and induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress as indicated by differential expression of ER stress-responsive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, leading to programmed cell death at MEI and AME, resulting in abortive female gametes. In the BL<i>3+5+</i>/BL comparison, 3,986, 749, and 370 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s were differentially expressed at MMC, MEI, and AME, respectively. Large numbers of cell wall modification and biotic and abiotic response <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s were also induced at MMC but largely suppressed at MEI without inducing ER stress and programed cell death , producing fertile gametes. These results have <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>ral implications for the understanding of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical processes underlying reproductive barriers.</p>

Validating Genome-Wide Association Candidates Controlling Quantitative Variation in Nodulation
<p>Genome-wide association (GWA) studies offer the opportunity to identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s that contribute to naturally occurring variation in quantitative traits. However, GWA relies exclusively on statistical association, so functional validation is necessary to make strong claims about <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> function. We used a combination of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>-disruption platforms (Tnt1 retrotransposons, hairpin RNA-interference constructs, and CRISPR/Cas9 nucleases) together with randomized, well-replicated experiments to evaluate the function of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s that an earlier GWA study in <i>Medicago truncatula</i> had identified as candidates contributing to variation in the symbiosis between legumes and rhizobia. We evaluated ten candidate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s found in six clusters of strongly associated single nucleotide polymorphisms, selected on the basis of their strength of statistical association, proximity to annotated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> models, and root or nodule expression. We found statistically significant effects on nodule production for three candidate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, each validated in two independent mutants. Annotated functions of these three <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s suggest their contributions to quantitative variation in nodule production occur through processes not previously connected to nodulation, including phosphorous supply and salicylic acid-related defense response. These results demonstrate the utility of GWA combined with reverse muta<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>sis technologies to discover and validate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s contributing to naturally occurring variation in quantitative traits. The results highlight the potential for GWA to complement forward <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tics in identifying the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic basis of ecologically and economically important traits.</p>

The Genotype–Phenotype Map of Yeast Complex Traits: Basic Parameters and the Role of Natural Selection
<p>Most phenotypic traits are controlled by many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, but a global picture of the genotype–phenotype map (GPM) is lacking. For example, in no species do we know <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>rally how many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s affect a trait and how large these effects are. It is also unclear to what extent GPMs are shaped by natural selection. Here we address these fundamental questions using the reverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic data of 220 morphological traits in 4,718 budding yeast strains, each of which lacks a nonessential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>. We show that 1) the proportion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s affecting a trait varies from <1% to >30%, averaging 6%, 2) most traits are impacted by many more small-effect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s than large-effect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, and 3) the mean effect of all nonessential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s on a trait decreases precipitously as the estimated importance of the trait to fitness increases. An analysis of 3,116 yeast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion traits in 754 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>-deletion strains reveals a similar pattern. These findings illustrate the power of genome-wide reverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tics in genotype–phenotype mapping, uncover an enormous range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic complexity of phenotypic traits, and suggest that the GPM of cellular organisms has been shaped by natural selection for mutational robustness.</p>

The Repertoires of Ubiquitinating and Deubiquitinating Enzymes in Eukaryotic Genomes
<p>Reversible protein ubiquitination regulates virtually all known cellular activities. Here, we present a quantitatively evaluated and broadly applicable method to predict <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eukaryot</span></strong>ic ubiquitinating enzymes (UBE) and deubiquitinating enzymes (DUB) and its application to 50 distinct genomes belonging to four of the five major phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic supergroups of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eukaryot</span></strong>es: unikonts (including metazoans, fungi, choanozoa, and amoebozoa), excavates, chromalveolates, and plants. Our method relies on a collection of profile hidden Markov models, and we demonstrate its superior performance (coverage and classification accuracy >99%) by identifying approximately 25% and approximately 35% additional UBE and DUB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in yeast and human, which had not been reported before. In yeast, we predict 85 UBE and 24 DUB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, for 814 UBE and 107 DUB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in the human genome. Most UBE and DUB families are present in all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eukaryot</span></strong>ic lineages, with plants and animals harboring massively enlarged repertoires of ubiquitin ligases. Unicellular organisms, on the other hand, typically harbor less than 300 UBEs and less than 40 DUBs per genome. Ninety-one UBE/DUB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s are orthologous across all four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eukaryot</span></strong>ic supergroups, and these likely represent a primordial core of enzymes of the ubiquitination system probably dating back to the first <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eukaryot</span></strong>es approximately 2 billion years ago. Our genome-wide predictions are available through the Database of Ubiquitinating and Deubiquitinating Enzymes (<ext-link>www.DUDE-db.org</ext-link>), where users can also perform advanced sequence and phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic analyses and submit their own predictions.</p>

Here, we have analyzed the transcriptomes of six major tissues dissected from mid-gestational (TS12) mouse embryos.

If two deletions don't stop growth, try three
<p>How many and which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s does an organism need at a minimum to sustain growth? With the identification of essential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in a variety of organisms such as yeast (<i>1</i>), worms (<i>2</i>), and human cultured cells (<i>3</i>–<i>5</i>), the answer may seem obvious: Remove all nonessential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, and the organism should be able to continue to survive and grow. In the yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, the workhorse of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic interaction mapping, ∼1000 of the ∼6000 (∼17%) protein-coding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s are essential for viability (<i>1</i>). So theoretically, one might think that one could remove the other ∼5000 nonessential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s and still have a growing yeast. The reason this does not work is that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s interact with each other to drive different traits, including viability and growth. On page 283 of this issue, Kuzmin <i>et al.</i> (<i>6</i>) provide the first systematic analysis of trigenic interactions in yeast in which three <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> deletions are combined in individual strains in order to ascertain the importance of multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> interactions for growth.

RNA Polymerase II Read-Through Promotes Expression of Neighboring Genes in SAL1-PAP-XRN Retrograde Signaling
<p>In plants, the molecular function(s) of the nucleus-localized 5′-3′ EXORIBONUCLEASES (XRNs) are unclear; however, their activity is reported to have a significant effect on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion and SAL1-mediated retrograde signaling. Using parallel analysis of RNA ends, we documented a dramatic increase in uncapped RNA substrates of the XRNs in both <i>sal1</i> and <i>xrn2xrn3</i> mutants. We found that a major consequence of reducing SAL1 or XRN activity was RNA Polymerase II 3′ read-through. This occurred at 72% of expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, demonstrating a major genome-wide role for the XRN-torpedo model of transcription termination in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Read-through is speculated to have a negative effect on transcript abundance; however, we did not observe this. Rather, we identified a strong association between read-through and increased transcript abundance of tandemly orientated downstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, strongly correlated with the proximity (less than 1,000 bp) and expression of the upstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>. We observed read-through in the proximity of 903 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s up-regulated in the <i>sal1-8</i> retrograde signaling mutant; thus, this phenomenon may account directly for up to 23% of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s up-regulated in <i>sal1-8</i>. Using <i>APX2</i> and <i>AT5G43770</i> as exemplars, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tically uncoupled read-through loci from downstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s to validate the principle of read-through-mediated mRNA regulation, providing one mechanism by which an ostensibly posttranscriptional exoribonuclease that targets uncapped RNAs could modulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion.</p>

Characterization of Imprinted Genes in Rice Reveals Conservation of Regulation and Imprinting with Other Plant Species
<p>Genomic imprinting is an epi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic phenomenon by which certain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s display differential expression in a parent-of-origin-dependent manner. Hundreds of imprinted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s have been identified from several plant species. Here, we identified, with a high level of confidence, 208 imprinted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> candidates from rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). Imprinted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s of rice showed limited association with the transposable elements, which contrasts with findings from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>rally, imprinting in rice is conserved within a species, but intraspecific variation also was detected. The imprinted rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s do not show signatures of selection, which suggests that domestication has had a limited evolutionary consequence on genomic imprinting. Although conservation of imprinting in plants is limited, we show that some loci are imprinted in several different species. Moreover, our results suggest that different types of epi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic regulation can be established either before or after fertilization. Imprinted 24-nucleotide small RNAs and their neighboring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s tend to express alleles from different parents. This association was not observed between 21-nucleotide small RNAs and their neighboring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. Together, our findings suggest that the regulation of imprinting can be diverse, and genomic imprinting has evolutionary and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical significance.</p>

In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the initiation of endosperm coenocytic growth upon fertilization and the transition to endosperm cellularization are regulated by the FERTILIZATION-INDEPENDENT SEED (FIS)-Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), a putative H3K27 methyltransferase. Here, we address the possible role of the FIS-PRC2 complex in regulating the type I MADS-box <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> family, which has been shown previously to regulate early endosperm development. We show that a subclass of type I MADS-box <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s (C2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s) was expressed in distinct domains of the coenocytic endosperm in wild-type seeds. Furthermore, the C2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s were mostly up-regulated biallelically during the extended coenocytic phase of endosperm development in the FIS-PRC2 mutant background. Using allele-specific expression analysis, we also identified a small subset of C2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s subjected to FIS-PRC2-dependent maternal or FIS-PRC2-independent paternal imprinting. Our data support a dual role for the FIS-PRC2 complex in the regulation of C2 type I MADS-box <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, as evidenced by a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>ralized role in the repression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion at both alleles associated with endosperm cellularization and a specialized role in silencing the maternal allele of imprinted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s.</p>

Multi-Omics Driven Assembly and Annotation of the Sandalwood (<i>Santalum album</i>) Genome
<p>Indian sandalwood (<i>Santalum album</i>) is an important tropical evergreen tree known for its fragrant heartwood-derived essential oil and its valuable carving wood. Here, we applied an integrated genomic, transcriptomic, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proteom</span></strong>ic approach to assemble and annotate the Indian sandalwood genome. Our genome sequencing resulted in the establishment of a draft map of the smallest genome for any woody tree species to date (221 Mb). The genome annotation predicted 38,119 protein-coding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s and 27.42% repetitive DNA elements. In-depth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proteom</span></strong>e analysis revealed the identities of 72,325 unique peptides, which confirmed 10,076 of the predicted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. The addition of transcriptomic and proteogenomic approaches resulted in the identification of 53 novel proteins and 34 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>-correction events that were missed by genomic approaches. Proteogenomic analysis also helped in reassigning 1,348 potential noncoding RNAs as bona fide protein-coding messenger RNAs. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> expression patterns at the RNA and protein levels indicated that peptide sequencing was useful in capturing proteins encoded by nuclear and organellar genomes alike. Mass spectrometry-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proteom</span></strong>ic evidence provided an unbiased approach toward the identification of proteins encoded by organellar genomes. Such proteins are often missed in transcriptome data sets due to the enrichment of only messenger RNAs that contain poly(A) tails. Overall, the use of integrated omic approaches enhanced the quality of the assembly and annotation of this nonmodel plant genome. The availability of genomic, transcriptomic, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proteom</span></strong>ic data will enhance genomics-assisted breeding, germplasm characterization, and conservation of sandalwood trees.</p>

Trehalose 6-Phosphate Regulates Photosynthesis and Assimilate Partitioning in Reproductive Tissue<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Transgenic maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) that expresses rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) <i>TREHALOSE PHOSPHATE PHOSPHATASE1</i> (<i>TPP1</i>) from the rice <i>MADS6</i> promoter, which is active over the flowering period, produces higher yields than wild type. This yield increase occurs with or without drought conditions during flowering. To understand the mechanistic basis of the increased yield, we characterized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion and metabolite profiles in leaves and developing female reproductive tissue, comprising florets, node, pith, and shank, over the flowering period with and without drought. The <i>MADS6</i> promoter was most active in the vasculature, particularly phloem companion cells in florets and pith, consistent with the largest decreases in trehalose 6-phosphate (T6P) levels (2- to 3-fold) being found in pith and florets. Low T6P led to decreased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion for primary metabolism and increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion for secondary metabolism, particularly lipid-related pathways. Despite similar changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion, the pith and floret displayed opposing assimilate profiles: sugars, sugar phosphates, amino acids, and lipids increased in florets, but decreased in pith. Possibly explaining this assimilate distribution, seven <i>SWEET</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s were found to be up-regulated in the transgenic plants. SnRK1 activity and the expression of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> for the SnRK1 beta subunit, expression of SnRK1 marker <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, and endogenous trehalose pathway <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s were also altered. Furthermore, leaves of the transgenic maize maintained a higher photosynthetic rate for a longer period compared to wild type. In conclusion, we found that decreasing T6P in reproductive tissues down-regulates primary metabolism and up-regulates secondary metabolism, resulting in different metabolite profiles in component tissues. Our data implicate T6P/ SnRK1 as a major regulator of whole-plant resource allocation for crop yield improvement.</p>

The Conserved and Unique Genetic Architecture of Kernel Size and Weight in Maize and Rice
<p>Maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) is a major staple crop. Maize kernel size and weight are important contributors to its yield. Here, we measured kernel length, kernel width, kernel thickness, hundred kernel weight, and kernel test weight in 10 recombinant inbred line populations and dissected their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic architecture using three statistical models. In total, 729 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were identified, many of which were identified in all three models, including 22 major QTLs that each can explain more than 10% of phenotypic variation. To provide candidate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s for these QTLs, we identified 30 maize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s that are orthologs of 18 rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s reported to affect rice seed size or weight. Interestingly, 24 of these 30 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s are located in the identified QTLs or within 1 Mb of the significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We further confirmed the effects of five <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s on maize kernel size/weight in an independent association mapping panel with 540 lines by candidate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> association analysis. Lastly, the function of <i>ZmINCW1</i>, a homolog of rice <i>GRAIN INCOMPLETE FILLING1</i> that affects seed size and weight, was characterized in detail. <i>ZmINCW1</i> is close to QTL peaks for kernel size/weight (less than 1 Mb) and contains significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms affecting kernel size/weight in the association panel. Overexpression of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> can rescue the reduced weight of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) homozygous mutant line in the <i>AtcwINV2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> (Arabidopsis ortholog of <i>ZmINCW1</i>). These results indicate that the molecular mechanisms affecting seed development are conserved in maize, rice, and possibly Arabidopsis.</p>

Six-Rowed Spike3 (VRS3) Is a Histone Demethylase That Controls Lateral Spikelet Development in Barley
<p>The complex nature of crop genomes has long prohibited the efficient isolation of agronomically relevant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. However, recent advances in next-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>ration sequencing technologies provide new ways to accelerate fine-mapping and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> isolation in crops. We used RNA sequencing of allelic <i>six-rowed spike3</i> (<i>vrs3</i>) mutants with altered spikelet development for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> identification and functional analysis in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>). Variant calling in two allelic <i>vrs3</i> mutants revealed that <i>VRS3</i> encodes a putative histone Lys demethylase with a conserved zinc finger and Jumonji C and N domain. Sanger sequencing of this candidate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> in independent allelic <i>vrs3</i> mutants revealed a series of mutations in conserved domains, thus confirming our candidate as the <i>VRS3</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> and suggesting that the row type in barley is determined epi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tically. Global transcriptional profiling in developing shoot apical meristems of <i>vrs3</i> suggested that VRS3 acts as a transcriptional activator of the row-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s <i>VRS1</i> (<i>Hv.HOMEOBOX1</i>) and <i>INTERMEDIUM-C</i> (<i>INT-C</i>; <i>Hv.TEOSINTE BRANCHED1</i>). Comparative transcriptome analysis of the row-type mutants <i>vrs3</i>, <i>vrs4</i> (<i>Hv.RAMOSA2</i>), and <i>int-c</i> confirmed that all three <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s act as transcriptional activators of <i>VRS1</i> and quantitative variation in the expression levels of <i>VRS1</i> in these mutants correlated with differences in the number of developed lateral spikelets. The identification of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s and pathways affecting seed number in small grain cereals will enable to further unravel the transcriptional networks controlling this important yield component.</p>

Diversification of Root Hair Development Genes in Vascular Plants
<p>The molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic program for root hair development has been studied intensively in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). To understand the extent to which this program might operate in other plants, we conducted a large-scale comparative analysis of root hair development <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s from diverse vascular plants, including eudicots, monocots, and a lycophyte. Combining phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tics and transcriptomics, we discovered conservation of a core set of root hair <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s across all vascular plants, which may derive from an ancient program for unidirectional cell growth coopted for root hair development during vascular plant evolution. Interestingly, we also discovered preferential diversification in the structure and expression of root hair development <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, relative to other root hair- and root-expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, among these species. These differences enabled the definition of sets of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> functions that were acquired or lost in specific lineages during vascular plant evolution. In particular, we found substantial divergence in the structure and expression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s used for root hair patterning, suggesting that the Arabidopsis transcriptional regulatory mechanism is not shared by other species. To our knowledge, this study provides the first comprehensive view of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion in a single plant cell type across multiple species.</p>

Cyst Nematode Parasitism Induces Dynamic Changes in the Root Epigenome
<p>A growing body of evidence indicates that epi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic modifications can provide efficient, dynamic, and reversible cellular responses to a wide range of environmental stimuli. However, the significance of epi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic modifications in plant-pathogen interactions remains largely unexplored. In this study, we provide a comprehensive analysis of epigenome changes during the compatible interaction between the beet cyst nematode <i>Heterodera schachtii</i> and Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing was conducted to assess the dynamic changes in the methylome of Arabidopsis roots in response to <i>H. schachtii</i> infection. <i>H. schachtii</i> induced widespread hypomethylation of protein-coding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s and transposable elements (TEs), preferentially those adjacent to protein-coding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. The abundance of 24-nt siRNAs was associated with hypermethylation of TEs and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> promoters, with influence observed for methylation context and infection time points. mRNA sequencing revealed a significant enrichment for the differentially methylated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s among the differentially expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, specifically those with functions corresponding to primary metabolic processes and responses to stimuli. The differentially methylated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s overlapped with more than one-fourth of the syncytium differentially expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s and are of functional significance. Together, our results provide intriguing insights into the potential regulatory role of differential DNA methylation in shaping the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical interplay between cyst nematodes and host plants.</p>

Genome-Wide Prediction of Metabolic Enzymes, Pathways, and Gene Clusters in Plants
<p>Plant metabolism underpins many traits of ecological and agronomic importance. Plants produce numerous compounds to cope with their environments but the biosynthetic pathways for most of these compounds have not yet been elucidated. To engineer and improve metabolic traits, we need comprehensive and accurate knowledge of the organization and regulation of plant metabolism at the genome scale. Here, we present a computational pipeline to identify metabolic enzymes, pathways, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters from a sequenced genome. Using this pipeline, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>rated metabolic pathway databases for 22 species and identified metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters from 18 species. This unified resource can be used to conduct a wide array of comparative studies of plant metabolism. Using the resource, we discovered a widespread occurrence of metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters in plants: 11,969 clusters from 18 species. The prevalence of metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters offers an intriguing possibility of an untapped source for uncovering new metabolite biosynthesis pathways. For example, more than 1,700 clusters contain enzymes that could <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>rate a specialized metabolite scaffold (signature enzymes) and enzymes that modify the scaffold (tailoring enzymes). In four species with sufficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion data, we identified 43 highly coexpressed clusters that contain signature and tailoring enzymes, of which eight were characterized previously to be functional pathways. Finally, we identified patterns of genome organization that implicate local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> duplication and, to a lesser extent, single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> transposition as having played roles in the evolution of plant metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters.</p>

Transcriptional Gene Silencing Maintained by OTS1 SUMO Protease Requires a DNA-Dependent Polymerase V-Dependent Pathway
<p>The expression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s with aberrant structure is prevented at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation levels. Aberrant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> silencing at the posttranscriptional level is well studied; however, it is not well understood how aberrant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s are silenced at the transcriptional level. In this study, through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic screening a transgenic report line that harbors an aberrant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> (<i>35S-LUC</i>, lacking 3′-untranslated region [3′-UTR]) and lacks luciferase (LUC) activity, we identify that the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) protease <i>OTS1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> is required for maintaining the silence of the reporter <i>35S-LUC</i> and an endogenous mutator-like element <i>MULE-F19G14</i> at the transcriptional level, which requires DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Pol) V and DDR complex, but not Pol IV. The increased transcripts in <i>ots1</i> mutants are terminated by the 3′-UTRs of downstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. In addition to <i>ots1</i> mutations, mutations in several known or putative SUMO proteases and two SUMO E3 ligases, <i>SIZ1</i> and <i>MMS21</i>, have similar effects on this silencing regulation. Taken together, our results reveal that the enzymes involved in the SUMOylation process restrain aberrant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> transcription by using a downstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> 3′-UTR, and this regulation requires a functional Pol V-dependent pathway in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>).</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
The Evolution of Genes within Genes and the Control of DNA Replication in Microviruses
<p>Single-stranded DNA(ssDNA) viral life cycles must balance double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and ssDNA biosynthesis. Previously published in vitro results suggest that microvirus C and host cell SSB proteins play antagonistic roles to achieve this balance. To investigate this in vivo, microvirus DNA replication was characterized in cells expressing cloned C or <i>ssb</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, which would presumably alter the C:SSB protein ratios. Representatives of each microvirus clade (φX174, G4, and α3) were used in these studies. α3 DNA replication was significantly more complex. Results suggested that the recognized α3 C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> (C<sub>S</sub>: small) is one of two C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. A larger 5′ extended <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> could be translated from an upstream GTG start codon (C<sub>B</sub>: big). Wild-type α3 acquired resistance to elevated SSB levels by mutations that exclusively frameshifted the C<sub>B</sub> reading frame, whereas mutations in the origin of replication conferred resistance to elevated C protein levels. Expression of either the cloned C<sub>B</sub> or C<sub>S</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> complemented <i>am(C)</i> mutants, demonstrating functional redundancy. When the C<sub>S</sub> start codon was eliminated, strains were only viable if an additional amber mutation was placed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> C and propagated in an informational suppressing host. Thus, C<sub>B</sub> protein likely reaches toxic levels in the absence of C<sub>S</sub> translation. This phenomenon may have driven the evolution of the C<sub>S</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> within the larger C<sub>B</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> and could constitute a unique mechanism of regulation. Furthermore, cross-complementation data suggested that interactions between the α3 C and other viral proteins have evolved enough specificity to biochemically isolate its DNA replication from G4 and φX174.</p>

In addition to sex hormones, the X and Y sex chromosomes, and their unique complements of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, may contribute to sexually dimorphic AAA pathology.

Extracellular ATP Shapes a Defense-Related Transcriptome Both Independently and along with Other Defense Signaling Pathways
<p>ATP is not only an essential metabolite of cellular biochemistry but also acts as a signal in the extracellular milieu. In plants, extracellular ATP is monitored by the purinergic receptor P2K1. Recent studies have revealed that extracellular ATP acts as a damage-associated molecular pattern in plants, and its signaling through P2K1 is important for mounting an effective defense response against various pathogenic microorganisms. Biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens attack plants using different strategies, to which plants respond accordingly with salicylate-based or jasmonate/ethylene-based defensive signaling, respectively. Interestingly, defense mediated by P2K1 is effective against pathogens of both lifestyles, raising the question of the level of interplay between extracellular ATP signaling and that of jasmonate, ethylene, and salicylate. To address this issue, we analyzed ATP-induced transcriptomes in wild-type Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings and mutant seedlings defective in essential components in the signaling pathways of jasmonate, ethylene, and salicylate (classic defense hormones) as well as a mutant and an overexpression line of the P2K1 receptor. We found that P2K1 function is crucial for faithful ATP-induced transcriptional changes and that a subset of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s is more responsive in the P2K1 overexpression line. We also found that more than half of the ATP-responsive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s required signaling by one or more of the pathways for the classical defense hormones, with the jasmonate-based signaling being more critical than others. By contrast, the other ATP-responsive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s were unaffected by deficiencies in signaling for any of the classical defense hormones. These ATP-responsive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s were highly enriched for defense-related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> Ontology terms. We further tested the ATP-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in knockout mutants of transcription factors, demonstrating that MYCs acting downstream of the jasmonate receptor complex and calmodulin-binding transcription activators are nuclear transducers of P2K1-mediated extracellular ATP signaling.</p>

<p>An advanced functional understanding of omics data is important for elucidating the design logic of physiological processes in plants and effectively controlling desired traits in plants. We present the latest versions of the Predicted Arabidopsis Interactome Resource (PAIR) and of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> set linkage analysis (GSLA) tool, which enable the interpretation of an observed transcriptomic change (differentially expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s [DEGs]) in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) with respect to its functional impact for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical processes. PAIR version 5.0 integrates functional association data between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in multiple forms and infers 335,301 putative functional interactions. GSLA relies on this high-confidence inferred functional association network to expand our perception of the functional impacts of an observed transcriptomic change. GSLA then interprets the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical significance of the observed DEGs using established <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical concepts (annotation terms), describing not only the DEGs themselves but also their potential functional impacts. This unique analytical capability can help researchers gain deeper insights into their experimental results and highlight prospective directions for further investigation. We demonstrate the utility of GSLA with two case studies in which GSLA uncovered how molecular events may have caused physiological changes through their collective functional influence on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical processes. Furthermore, we showed that typical annotation-enrichment tools were unable to produce similar insights to PAIR/GSLA. The PAIR version 5.0-inferred interactome and GSLA Web tool both can be accessed at <ext-link>http://public.synergylab.cn/pair/</ext-link>.</p>

Arabidopsis Novel Glycine-Rich Plasma Membrane PSS1 Protein Enhances Disease Resistance in Transgenic Soybean Plants
<p>Nonhost resistance is defined as the immunity of a plant species to all nonadapted pathogen species. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) ecotype Columbia-0 is nonhost to the oomycete plant pathogen <i>Phytophthora sojae</i> and the fungal plant pathogen <i>Fusarium virguliforme</i> that are pathogenic to soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>). Previously, we reported <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>rating the <i>pss1</i> mutation in the <i>pen1-1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic background as well as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic mapping and characterization of the Arabidopsis nonhost resistance <i>Phytophthora sojae</i>-susceptible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> locus, <i>PSS1</i>. In this study, we identified six candidate <i>PSS1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s by comparing single-nucleotide polymorphisms of (1) the bulked DNA sample of seven F<sub>2:3</sub> families homozygous for the <i>pss1</i> allele and (2) the <i>pen1-1</i> mutant with Columbia-0. Analyses of T-DNA insertion mutants for each of these candidate <i>PSS1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s identified the <i>At3g59640</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> encoding a glycine-rich protein as the putative <i>PSS1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>. Later, complementation analysis confirmed the identity of <i>At3g59640</i> as the <i>PSS1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>. <i>PSS1</i> is induced following <i>P. sojae</i> infection as well as expressed in an organ-specific manner. Coexpression analysis of the available transcriptomic data followed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction suggested that <i>PSS1</i> is coregulated with <i>ATG8a</i> (<i>At4g21980</i>), a core <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> in autophagy. PSS1 contains a predicted single membrane-spanning domain. Subcellular localization study indicated that it is an integral plasma membrane protein. Sequence analysis suggested that soybean is unlikely to contain a PSS1-like defense function. Following the introduction of <i>PSS1</i> into the soybean cultivar Williams 82, the transgenic plants exhibited enhanced resistance to <i>F. virguliforme</i>, the pathogen that causes sudden death syndrome.</p>

A Nucleus-Localized Long Non-Coding RNA Enhances Drought and Salt Stress Tolerance
<p>Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion through a wide range of mechanisms and are considered as important regulators in many essential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical processes. A large number of lncRNA transcripts have been predicted or identified in plants in recent years. However, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical functions for most of them are still unknown. In this study, we identified an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) lncRNA, <i>DROUGHT INDUCED lncRNA</i> (<i>DRIR</i>), as a novel positive regulator of the plant response to drought and salt stress. <i>DRIR</i> was expressed at a low level under nonstress conditions but can be significantly activated by drought and salt stress as well as by abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. We identified a T-DNA insertion mutant, <i>drir<sup>D</sup></i>, which had higher expression of the <i>DRIR</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> than the wild-type plants. The <i>drir<sup>D</sup></i> mutant exhibits increased tolerance to drought and salt stress. Overexpressing <i>DRIR</i> in Arabidopsis also increased tolerance to drought and salt stress of the transgenic plants. The <i>drir<sup>D</sup></i> mutant and the overexpressing seedlings are more sensitive to ABA than the wild type in stomata closure and seedling growth. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis demonstrated that the expression of a large number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s was altered in <i>drir<sup>D</sup></i> and the overexpressing plants. These include <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s involved in ABA signaling, water transport, and other stress-relief processes. Our study reveals a mechanism whereby <i>DRIR</i> regulates the plant response to abiotic stress by modulating the expression of a series of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s involved in the stress response.</p>

Cytological and Transcriptomic Analyses Reveal Important Roles of <i>CLE19</i> in Pollen Exine Formation
<p>The CLAVATA3/ESR-RELATED (CLE) peptide signals are required for cell-cell communication in several plant growth and developmental processes. However, little is known regarding the possible functions of the CLEs in the anther. Here, we show that a T-DNA insertional mutant, and dominant-negative (DN) and overexpression (OX) transgenic plants of the <i>CLE19</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>, exhibited significantly reduced anther size and pollen grain number and abnormal pollen wall formation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Interestingly, the <i>DN</i>-<i>CLE19</i> pollen grains showed a more extensively covered surface, but <i>CLE19-OX</i> pollen exine exhibited clearly missing connections in the network and lacked separation between areas that normally form the lacunae. With a combination of cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic, and transcriptomic analyses on <i>cle19</i>, <i>DN</i>-<i>CLE19</i>, and <i>CLE19-OX</i> plants, we demonstrated that <i>CLE19-OX</i> plants produced highly vacuolated and swollen <i>aborted microspores</i> (<i>ams</i>)-like tapetal cells, lacked lipidic tapetosomes and elaioplasts, and had abnormal pollen primexine without obvious accumulation of sporopollenin precursors. Moreover, <i>CLE19</i> is important for the normal expression of more than 1,000 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, including the transcription factor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> <i>AMS</i>, 280 <i>AMS</i>-downstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, and other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s involved in pollen coat and pollen exine formation, lipid metabolism, pollen germination, and hormone metabolism. In addition, the <i>DN-CLE19(+/+) ams(−/−)</i> plants exhibited the <i>ams</i> anther phenotype and <i>ams(+/−)</i> partially suppressed the <i>DN-CLE19</i> trans<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>-induced pollen exine defects. These findings demonstrate that the proper amount of CLE19 signal is essential for the normal expression of <i>AMS</i> and its downstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> networks in the regulation of anther development and pollen exine formation.</p>

The <i>TRAF Mediated Gametogenesis Progression</i> (<i>TRAMGaP</i>) Gene Is Required for Megaspore Mother Cell Specification and Gametophyte Development
<p>In plants, the role of TRAF-like proteins with meprin and the TRAF homology (MATH) domain is far from clear. In animals, these proteins serve as adapter molecules to mediate signal transduction from Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor to downstream effector molecules. A seed-sterile mutant with a disrupted TRAF-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> (<i>At5g26290</i>) exhibiting aberrant gameto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>sis led us to investigate the developmental role of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The mutation was semidominant and resulted in pleiotropic phenotypes with such features as short siliques with fewer ovules, pollen and seed sterility, altered Megaspore Mother Cell (MMC) specification, and delayed programmed cell death in megaspores and the tapetum, features that overlapped those in other well-characterized mutants. Seed sterility and reduced transmission frequency of the mutant alleles pointed to a dual role, sporophytic and gametophytic, for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> on the male side. The mutant also showed altered expression of various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s involved in such cellular and developmental pathways as regulation of transcription, biosynthesis and transport of lipids, hormone-mediated signaling, and gametophyte development. The diverse phenotypes of the mutant and the altered expression of key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s related to gametophyte and seed development could be explained based on the functional similarly between <i>At5g26290</i> and MATH-BTB domain proteins that modulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion through the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome system. These results show a novel link between a TRAF-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> and reproductive development in plants.</p>

Triphosphate Tunnel Metalloenzyme Function in Senescence Highlights a Biological Diversification of This Protein Superfamily
<p>The triphosphate tunnel metalloenzyme (TTM) superfamily comprises a group of enzymes that hydrolyze organophosphate substrates. They exist in all domains of life, yet the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical role of most family members is unclear. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) encodes three <i>TTM</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. We have previously reported that AtTTM2 displays pyrophosphatase activity and is involved in pathogen resistance. Here, we report the biochemical activity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical function of <i>AtTTM1</i> and diversification of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical roles between <i>AtTTM1</i> and <i>2</i>. Biochemical analyses revealed that AtTTM1 displays pyrophosphatase activity similar to AtTTM2, making them the only TTMs characterized so far to act on a diphosphate substrate. However, knockout mutant analysis showed that <i>AtTTM1</i> is not involved in pathogen resistance but rather in leaf senescence. <i>AtTTM1</i> is transcriptionally up-regulated during leaf senescence, and knockout mutants of <i>AtTTM1</i> exhibit delayed dark-induced and natural senescence. The double mutant of <i>AtTTM1</i> and <i>AtTTM2</i> did not show synergistic effects, further indicating the diversification of their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical function. However, promoter swap analyses revealed that they functionally can complement each other, and confocal microscopy revealed that both proteins are tail-anchored proteins that localize to the mitochondrial outer membrane. Additionally, transient overexpression of either <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> induced senescence-like cell death upon dark treatment. Taken together, we show that two TTMs display the same biochemical properties but distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical functions that are governed by their transcriptional regulation. Moreover, this work reveals a possible connection of immunity-related programmed cell death and senescence through novel mitochondrial tail-anchored proteins.</p>

Multiplexed Gene Editing and Protein Overexpression Using a <i>Tobacco mosaic virus</i> Viral Vector
<p>Development of CRISPR/Cas9 transient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> editing screening tools in plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y has been hindered by difficulty of delivering high quantities of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ically active single guide RNAs (sgRNAs). Furthermore, it has been largely accepted that in vivo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>rated sgRNAs need to be devoid of extraneous nucleotides, which has limited sgRNA expression by delivery vectors. Here, we increased cellular concentrations of sgRNA by transiently delivering sgRNAs using a <i>Tobacco mosaic virus</i>-derived vector (TRBO) designed with 5′ and 3′ sgRNA proximal nucleotide-processing capabilities. To demonstrate proof-of-principle, we used the TRBO-sgRNA delivery platform to target GFP in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> (16c) plants, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> editing was accompanied by loss of GFP expression. Surprisingly, indel (insertions and deletions) percentages averaged nearly 70% within 7 d postinoculation using the TRBO-sgRNA constructs, which retained 5′ nucleotide overhangs. In contrast, and in accordance with current models, in vitro Cas9 cleavage assays only edited DNA when 5′ sgRNA nucleotide overhangs were removed, suggesting a novel processing mechanism is occurring in planta. Since the Cas9/TRBO-sgRNA platform demonstrated sgRNA flexibility, we targeted the <i>N. benthamiana NbAGO1</i> paralogs with one sgRNA and also multiplexed two sgRNAs using a single TRBO construct, resulting in indels in three <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. TRBO-mediated expression of an RNA transcript consisting of an sgRNA adjoining a GFP protein coding region produced indels and viral-based GFP overexpression. In conclusion, multiplexed delivery of sgRNAs using the TRBO system offers flexibility for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion and editing and uncovered novel aspects of CRISPR/Cas9 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y.</p>

Generation of a Collection of Mutant Tomato Lines Using Pooled CRISPR Libraries
<p>The high efficiency of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-mediated muta<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>sis in plants enables the development of high-throughput muta<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>sis strategies. By transforming pooled CRISPR libraries into tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>), collections of mutant lines were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>rated with minimal transformation attempts and in a relatively short period of time. Identification of the targeted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>(s) was easily determined by sequencing the incorporated guide RNA(s) in the primary transgenic events. From a single transformation with a CRISPR library targeting the immunity-associated leucine-rich repeat subfamily XII <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, heritable mutations were recovered in 15 of the 54 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s targeted. To increase throughput, a second CRISPR library was made containing three guide RNAs per construct to target 18 putative transporter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. This resulted in stable mutations in 15 of the 18 targeted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, with some primary transgenic plants having as many as five mutated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. Furthermore, the redundancy in this collection of plants allowed for the association of aberrant T0 phenotypes with the underlying targeted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. Plants with mutations in a homolog of an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) boron efflux transporter displayed boron deficiency phenotypes. The strategy described here provides a technically simple yet high-throughput approach for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>rating a collection of lines with targeted mutations and should be applicable to any plant transformation system.</p>

The OsMYB30 Transcription Factor Suppresses Cold Tolerance by Interacting with a JAZ Protein and Suppressing <i>β</i>-Amylase Expression
<p>Cold stress is one of the major limiting factors for rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) productivity. Several MYB transcriptional factors have been reported as important regulators in the cold stress response, but the molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. In this study, we characterized a cold-responsive R2R3-type MYB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>, <i>OsMYB30</i>, for its regulatory function in cold tolerance in rice. Functional analysis revealed that overexpression of <i>OsMYB30</i> in rice resulted in increased cold sensitivity, while the <i>osmyb30</i> knockout mutant showed increased cold tolerance. Microarray and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses revealed that a few β-amylase (<i>BMY</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s were down-regulated by OsMYB30. The <i>BMY</i> activity and maltose content, which were decreased and increased in the <i>OsMYB30</i> overexpression and <i>osmyb30</i> knockout mutant, respectively, were correlated with the expression patterns of the <i>BMY</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. OsMYB30 was shown to bind to the promoters of the <i>BMY</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. These results suggested that OsMYB30 exhibited a regulatory effect on the breakdown of starch through the regulation of the <i>BMY</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. In addition, application of maltose had a protective effect for cell membranes under cold stress conditions. Furthermore, we identified an OsMYB30-interacting protein, OsJAZ9, that had a significant effect in suppressing the transcriptional activation of OsMYB30 and in the repression of <i>BMY</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s mediated by OsMYB30. These results together suggested that OsMYB30 might be a novel regulator of cold tolerance through the negative regulation of the <i>BMY</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s by interacting with OsJAZ9 to fine-tune the starch breakdown and the content of maltose, which might contribute to the cold tolerance as a compatible solute.</p>

Genetic Bases of Fungal White Rot Wood Decay Predicted by Phylogenomic Analysis of Correlated Gene-Phenotype Evolution
<p>Fungal decomposition of plant cell walls (PCW) is a complex process that has diverse industrial applications and huge impacts on the carbon cycle. White rot (WR) is a powerful mode of PCW decay in which lignin and carbohydrates are both degraded. Mechanistic studies of decay coupled with comparative genomic analyses have provided clues to the enzymatic components of WR systems and their evolutionary origins, but the complete suite of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s necessary for WR remains undetermined. Here, we use phylogenomic comparative methods, which we validate through simulations, to identify shifts in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> family diversification rates that are correlated with evolution of WR, using data from 62 fungal genomes. We detected 409 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families that appear to be evolutionarily correlated with WR. The identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families encode well-characterized decay enzymes, e.g., fungal class II peroxidases and cellobiohydrolases, and enzymes involved in import and detoxification pathways, as well as 73 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families that have no functional annotation. About 310 of the 409 identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families are present in the genome of the model WR fungus <i>Phanerochaete chrysosporium</i> and 192 of these (62%) have been shown to be upregulated under ligninolytic culture conditions, which corroborates the phylogeny-based functional inferences. These results illuminate the complexity of WR and suggest that its evolution has involved a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>ral elaboration of the decay apparatus, including numerous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families with as-yet unknown exact functions.</p>

Evolutionary Dynamics of Abundant Stop Codon Readthrough
<p>Translational stop codon readthrough emerged as a major regulatory mechanism affecting hundreds of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in animal genomes, based on recent comparative genomics and ribosomal profiling evidence, but its evolutionary properties remain unknown. Here, we leverage comparative genomic evidence across 21 <i>Anopheles</i> mosquitoes to systematically annotate readthrough <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in the malaria vector <i>Anopheles gambiae</i>, and to provide the first study of abundant readthrough evolution, by comparison with 20 <i>Drosophila</i> species. Using improved comparative genomics methods for detecting readthrough, we identify evolutionary signatures of conserved, functional readthrough of 353 stop codons in the malaria vector, <i>Anopheles gambiae</i>, and of 51 additional <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> stop codons, including several cases of double and triple readthrough and of readthrough of two adjacent stop codons. We find that most differences between the readthrough repertoires of the two species arose from readthrough gain or loss in existing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, rather than birth of new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> death; that readthrough-associated RNA structures are sometimes gained or lost while readthrough persists; that readthrough is more likely to be lost at TAA and TAG stop codons; and that readthrough is under continued purifying evolutionary selection in mosquito, based on population <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic evidence. We also determine readthrough-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> properties that predate readthrough, and identify differences in the characteristic properties of readthrough <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s between clades. We estimate more than 600 functional readthrough stop codons in mosquito and 900 in fruit fly, provide evidence of readthrough control of peroxisomal targeting, and refine the phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic extent of abundant readthrough as following divergence from centipede.</p>

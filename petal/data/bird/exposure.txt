Association of Bystander Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Survival According to Ambulance Response Times After Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Bystander-initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) increases patient survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, but it is unknown to what degree bystander CPR remains <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ively associated with survival with increasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> to potential defibrillation. The main objective was to examine the association of bystander CPR with survival as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> to advanced treatment increases.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied 7623 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients between 2005 and 2011, identified through the nationwide Danish Cardiac Arrest Registry. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> from 911 call to emergency medical service arrival (response <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>) and survival according to whether bystander CPR was provided (yes or no). Reported are 30-day survival chances with 95% bootstrap confidence intervals.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>With increasing response <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>s, adjusted 30-day survival chances decreased for both patients with bystander CPR and those without. However, the contrast between the survival chances of patients with versus without bystander CPR increased over <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>: within 5 minutes, 30-day survival was 14.5% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 12.8–16.4) versus 6.3% (95% CI: 5.1–7.6), corresponding to 2.3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>s higher chances of survival associated with bystander CPR; within 10 minutes, 30-day survival chances were 6.7% (95% CI: 5.4–8.1) versus 2.2% (95% CI: 1.5–3.1), corresponding to 3.0 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>s higher chances of 30-day survival associated with bystander CPR. The contrast in 30-day survival became statistically insignificant when response <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> was >13 minutes (bystander CPR vs no bystander CPR: 3.7% [95% CI: 2.2–5.4] vs 1.5% [95% CI: 0.6–2.7]), but 30-day survival was still 2.5 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>s higher associated with bystander CPR. Based on the model and Danish out-of-hospital cardiac arrest statistics, an additional 233 patients could potentially be saved annually if response <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> was reduced from 10 to 5 minutes and 119 patients if response <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> was reduced from 7 (the median response <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> in this study) to 5 minutes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The absolute survival associated with bystander CPR declined rapidly with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>. Yet bystander CPR while waiting for an ambulance was associated with a more than doubling of 30-day survival even in case of long ambulance response <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>. Decreasing ambulance response <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> by even a few minutes could potentially lead to many additional lives saved every year.</p></sec>

The joint influence of photoperiod and temperature during growth cessation and development of dormancy in white spruce (<i>Picea glauca</i>)
<p>Timely responses to environmental cues enable the synchronization of phenological life-history transitions essential for the health and survival of north-temperate and boreal tree species. While <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoperiod</span></strong>ic cues will remain persistent under climate change, temperature cues may vary, contributing to possible asynchrony in signals influencing developmental and physiological transitions essential to forest health. Understanding the relative contribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoperiod</span></strong> and temperature as determinants of the transition from active growth to dormancy is important for informing adaptive forest management decisions that consider future climates. Using a combination of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoperiod</span></strong> (long = 20 h or short = 8 h day lengths) and temperature (warm = 22 °C/16 °C and cool = 8 °C/4 °C day/night, respectively) treatments, we used microscopy, physiology and modeling to comprehensively examine hallmark traits of the growth–dormancy transition—including bud formation, growth cessation, cold hardiness and gas exchange—within two provenances of white spruce [<i>Picea glauca</i> (Moench) Voss] spanning a broad latitude in Alberta, Canada. Following exposure to experimental treatments, seedlings were transferred to favorable conditions, and the depth of dormancy was assessed by determining the timing and ability of spruce seedlings to resume growth. Short <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoperiod</span></strong>s promoted bud development and growth cessation, whereas longer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoperiod</span></strong>s extended the growing season through the induction of lammas growth. In contrast, cool temperatures under both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoperiod</span></strong>ic conditions delayed bud development. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoperiod</span></strong> strongly predicted the development of cold hardiness, whereas temperature predicted photosynthetic rates associated with active growth. White spruce was capable of attaining endodormancy, but its release was environmentally determined. Dormancy depth varied substantially across experimental treatments suggesting that environmental cues experienced within one season could affect growth in the following season, which is particularly important for a determinate species such as white spruce. The joint influence of these environmental cues points toward the importance of including local constant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoperiod</span></strong> and shifting temperature cues into predictive models that consider how climate change may affect northern forests.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
ANGUSTIFOLIA Regulates Actin Filament Alignment for Nuclear Positioning in Leaves
<p>During dark adaptation, plant nuclei move centripetally toward the midplane of the leaf blade; thus, the nuclei on both the adaxial and abaxial sides become <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioned at the inner periclinal walls of cells. This centripetal nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning implies that a characteristic cell polarity exists within a leaf, but little is known about the mechanism underlying this process. Here, we show that ANGUSTIFOLIA (AN) and ACTIN7 regulate centripetal nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves. Two mutants defective in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning of nuclei in the dark were isolated and designated as <i>unusual nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning1</i> (<i>unp1</i>) and <i>unp2</i>. In the dark, nuclei of <i>unp1</i> were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioned at the anticlinal walls of adaxial and abaxial mesophyll cells and abaxial pavement cells, whereas the nuclei of <i>unp2</i> were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioned at the anticlinal walls of mesophyll and pavement cells on both the adaxial and abaxial sides. <i>unp1</i> was caused by a dominant-negative mutation in <i>ACTIN7</i>, and <i>unp2</i> resulted from a recessive mutation in <i>AN</i>. Actin filaments in <i>unp1</i> were fragmented and reduced in number, which led to pleiotropic defects in nuclear morphology, cytoplasmic streaming, and plant growth. The mutation in <i>AN</i> caused aberrant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning of nuclei-associated actin filaments at the anticlinal walls. AN was detected in the cytosol, where it interacted physically with plant-specific dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinases (DYRKPs) and itself. The DYRK inhibitor (1<i>Z</i>)-1-(3-ethyl-5-hydroxy-2(3<i>H</i>)-benzothiazolylidene)-2-propanone significantly inhibited dark-induced nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning. Collectively, these results suggest that the AN-DYRKP complex regulates the alignment of actin filaments during centripetal nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning in leaf cells.</p>

Prolonged, Uninterrupted Sedentary Behavior and Glycemic Biomarkers Among US Hispanic/Latino Adults
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Excessive sedentary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> is ubiquitous in developed nations and is associated with deleterious health outcomes. Few studies have examined whether the manner in which sedentary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> is accrued (in short or long bouts) carries any clinical relevance. The purpose of this study was to examine the association of prolonged, uninterrupted sedentary behavior with glycemic biomarkers in a cohort of US Hispanic/Latino adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied 12 083 participants from the HCHS/SOL (Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos), a population-based study of Hispanic/Latino adults 18 to 74 years of age. Homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance and glycosylated hemoglobin were measured from a fasting blood sample, and 2-hour glucose was measured after an oral glucose tolerance test. Sedentary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> was objectively measured with a hip-mounted accelerometer. Prolonged, uninterrupted sedentariness was expressed as mean sedentary bout length.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>After adjustment for potential confounders and moderate to vigorous physical activity, longer sedentary bout duration was dose-dependently associated with increased homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (<i>P</i> for trend<0.001) and 2-hour glucose levels (<i>P</i> for trend=0.015). These associations were not independent of total sedentary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>; however, a significant interaction between sedentary bout duration and total sedentary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> was observed. Evaluation of the joint association of total sedentary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> and sedentary bout duration showed that participants in the upper quartile for both sedentary characteristics (ie, high total sedentary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> and high sedentary bout duration) had the highest levels of homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (<i>P</i><0.001 versus low group for both sedentary characteristics) and 2-hour glucose (<i>P</i>=0.002 versus low group for both sedentary characteristics). High total sedentary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> or high sedentary bout duration alone were not associated with differences in any glycemic biomarkers.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Accruing sedentary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> in prolonged, uninterrupted bouts may be deleteriously associated with biomarkers of glucose regulation.</p></sec>

Midbrain dopamine neurons control judgment of time
<p>Our sense of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> is far from constant. For instance, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> flies when we are having fun, and it slows to a trickle when we are bored. Midbrain dopamine neurons have been implicated in variable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> estimation. However, a direct link between signals carried by dopamine neurons and temporal judgments is lacking. We measured and manipulated the activity of dopamine neurons as mice judged the duration of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> intervals. We found that pharmacogenetic suppression of dopamine neurons decreased behavioral sensitivity to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> and that dopamine neurons encoded information about trial-to-trial variability in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> estimates. Last, we found that transient activation or inhibition of dopamine neurons was sufficient to slow down or speed up <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> estimation, respectively. Dopamine neuron activity thus reflects and can directly control the judgment of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>.</p>

Impact of Regionalization of ST-Segment–Elevation Myocardial Infarction Care on Treatment Times and Outcomes for Emergency Medical Services–Transported Patients Presenting to Hospitals With Percutaneous Coronary Intervention
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Regional variations in reperfusion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>s and mortality in patients with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction are influenced by differences in coordinating care between emergency medical services (EMS) and hospitals. Building on the Accelerator-1 Project, we hypothesized that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> to reperfusion could be further reduced with enhanced regional efforts.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Between April 2015 and March 2017, we worked with 12 metropolitan regions across the United States with 132 percutaneous coronary intervention–capable hospitals and 946 EMS agencies.

Photoperiod and temperature responses of bud swelling and bud burst in four temperate forest tree species
<p>Spring phenology of temperate forest trees is optimized to maximize the length of the growing season while minimizing the risk of freezing damage. The release from winter dormancy is environmentally mediated by species-specific responses to temperature and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoperiod</span></strong>. We investigated the response of early spring phenology to temperature and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoperiod</span></strong> at different stages of dormancy release in cuttings from four temperate tree species in controlled environments. By tracking bud development, we were able to identify the onset of bud swelling and bud growth in <i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i> L., <i>Fagus sylvatica</i> L., <i>Quercus petraea</i> (Mattuschka) Liebl. and <i>Picea abies</i> (L.) H. Karst. At a given early stage of dormancy release, the onset and duration of the bud swelling prior to bud burst are driven by concurrent temperature and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoperiod</span></strong>, while the maximum growth rate is temperature dependent only, except for <i>Fagus</i>, where long <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoperiod</span></strong>s also increased bud growth rates. Similarly, the later bud burst was controlled by temperature and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoperiod</span></strong> (in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoperiod</span></strong> sensitive species <i>Fagus, Quercus</i> and <i>Picea</i>). We conclude that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoperiod</span></strong> is involved in the release of dormancy during the ecodormancy phase and may influence bud burst in trees that have experienced sufficient chilling. This study explored and documented the early bud swelling period that precedes and defines later phenological stages such as canopy greening in conventional phenological works. It is the early bud growth resumption that needs to be understood in order to arrive at a causal interpretation and modelling of tree phenology at a large scale. Classic spring phenology events mark visible endpoints of a cascade of processes as evidenced here.</p>

Mapping the stochastic sequence of individual ligand-receptor binding events to cellular activation: T cells act on the rare events
<p>T cell receptor (TCR) binding to agonist peptide major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) triggers signaling events that initiate T cell responses. This system is remarkably sensitive, requiring only a few binding events to successfully activate a cellular response. On average, activating pMHC ligands exhibit mean dwell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>s of at least a few seconds when bound to the TCR. However, a T cell accumulates pMHC-TCR interactions as a stochastic series of discrete, single-molecule binding events whose individual dwell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>s are broadly distributed. With activation occurring in response to only a handful of such binding events, individual cells are unlikely to experience the average binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>. Here, we mapped the ensemble of pMHC-TCR binding events in space and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> while simultaneously monitoring cellular activation. Our findings revealed that T cell activation hinges on rare, long–dwell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> binding events that are an order of magnitude longer than the average agonist pMHC-TCR dwell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>. Furthermore, we observed that short pMHC-TCR binding events that were spatially correlated and temporally sequential led to cellular activation. These observations indicate that T cell antigen discrimination likely occurs by sensing the tail end of the pMHC-TCR binding dwell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> distribution rather than its average properties.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Genome-Wide Analysis of the Arabidopsis Replication Timing Program
<p>Eukaryotes use a temporally regulated process, known as the replication timing program, to ensure that their genomes are fully and accurately duplicated during S phase. Replication timing programs are predictive of genomic features and activity and are considered to be functional readouts of chromatin organization. Although replication timing programs have been described for yeast and animal systems, much less is known about the temporal regulation of plant DNA replication or its relationship to genome sequence and chromatin structure. We used the thymidine analog, 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine, in combination with flow sorting and Repli-Seq to describe, at high-resolution, the genome-wide replication timing program for Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) Col-0 suspension cells. We identified genomic regions that replicate predominantly during early, mid, and late S phase, and correlated these regions with genomic features and with data for chromatin state, accessibility, and long-distance interaction. Arabidopsis chromosome arms tend to replicate early while pericentromeric regions replicate late. Early and mid-replicating regions are gene-rich and predominantly euchromatic, while late regions are rich in transposable elements and primarily heterochromatic. However, the distribution of chromatin states across the different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>s is complex, with each replication <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> corresponding to a mixture of states. Early and mid-replicating sequences interact with each other and not with late sequences, but early regions are more accessible than mid regions. The replication timing program in Arabidopsis reflects a bipartite genomic organization with early/mid-replicating regions and late regions forming separate, noninteracting compartments. The temporal order of DNA replication within the early/mid compartment may be modulated largely by chromatin accessibility.</p>

Genetic Architecture of Flowering-Time Variation in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i><xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The transition to reproductive development is a crucial step in the plant life cycle, and the timing of this transition is an important factor in crop yields. Here, we report new insights into the genetic control of natural variation in flowering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>, a nondomesticated pooid grass closely related to cereals such as wheat (<i>Triticum</i> spp.) and barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i> L.). A recombinant inbred line population derived from a cross between the rapid-flowering accession Bd21 and the delayed-flowering accession Bd1-1 were grown in a variety of environmental conditions to enable exploration of the genetic architecture of flowering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>. A genotyping-by-sequencing approach was used to develop SNP markers for genetic map construction, and quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that control differences in flowering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> were identified. Many of the flowering-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> QTLs are detected across a range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoperiod</span></strong> and vernalization conditions, suggesting that the genetic control of flowering within this population is robust. The two major QTLs identified in undomesticated <i>B. distachyon</i> colocalize with <i>VERNALIZATION1/PHYTOCHROME C</i> and <i>VERNALIZATION2</i>, loci identified as flowering regulators in the domesticated crops wheat and barley. This suggests that variation in flowering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> is controlled in part by a set of genes broadly conserved within pooid grasses.</p>

Dynamic Edematous Response of the Human Heart to Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Clinical protocols aimed to characterize the post–myocardial infarction (MI) heart by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) need to be standardized to take account of dynamic biological phenomena evolving early after the index ischemic event. Here, we evaluated the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> course of edema reaction in patients with ST-segment–elevation MI by CMR and assessed its implications for myocardium-at-risk (MaR) quantification both in patients and in a large-animal model.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A total of 16 patients with anterior ST-segment–elevation MI successfully treated by primary angioplasty and 16 matched controls were prospectively recruited. In total, 94 clinical CMR examinations were performed: patients with ST-segment–elevation MI were serially scanned (within the first 3 hours after reperfusion and at 1, 4, 7, and 40 days), and controls were scanned only once. T2 relaxation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> in the myocardium (T2 mapping) and the extent of edema on T2-weighted short-tau triple inversion-recovery (ie, CMR-MaR) were evaluated at all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> points. In the experimental study, 20 pigs underwent 40-minute ischemia/reperfusion followed by serial CMR examinations at 120 minutes and 1, 4, and 7 days after reperfusion. Reference MaR was assessed by contrast-multidetector computed tomography during the index coronary occlusion. Generalized linear mixed models were used to take account of repeated measurements.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In humans, T2 relaxation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> in the ischemic myocardium declines significantly from early after reperfusion to 24 hours, and then increases up to day 4, reaching a plateau from which it decreases from day 7. Consequently, edema extent measured by T2-weighted short-tau triple inversion-recovery (CMR-MaR) varied with the timing of the CMR examination. These findings were confirmed in the experimental model by showing that only CMR-MaR values for day 4 and day 7 postreperfusion, coinciding with the deferred edema wave, were similar to values measured by reference contrast-multidetector computed tomography.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Post-MI edema in patients follows a bimodal pattern that affects CMR estimates of MaR. Dynamic changes in post–ST-segment–elevation MI edema highlight the need for standardization of CMR timing to retrospectively delineate MaR and quantify myocardial salvage. According to the present clinical and experimental data, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> window between days 4 and 7 post-MI seems a good compromise solution for standardization. Further studies are needed to study the effect of other factors on these variables.</p></sec>

Optimizing a Drone Network to Deliver Automated External Defibrillators

Arc-continent collisions in the tropics set Earth’s climate state
<p>On multimillion-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> scales, Earth has experienced warm ice-free and cold glacial climates, but it is unknown whether transitions between these background climate states were the result of changes in carbon dioxide sources or sinks. Low-latitude arc-continent collisions are hypothesized to drive cooling by exhuming and eroding mafic and ultramafic rocks in the warm, wet tropics, thereby increasing Earth’s potential to sequester carbon through chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">weather</span></strong>ing. To better constrain global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">weather</span></strong>ability through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>, the paleogeographic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion of all major Phanerozoic arc-continent collisions was reconstructed and compared to the latitudinal distribution of ice sheets. This analysis reveals a strong correlation between the extent of glaciation and arc-continent collisions in the tropics. Earth’s climate state is set primarily by global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">weather</span></strong>ability, which changes with the latitudinal distribution of arc-continent collisions.</p>

Natural Variation in <i>Brachypodium</i> Links Vernalization and Flowering Time Loci as Major Flowering Determinants
<p>The domestication of plants is underscored by the selection of agriculturally favorable developmental traits, including flowering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>, which resulted in the creation of varieties with altered growth habits. Research into the pathways underlying these growth habits in cereals has highlighted the role of three main flowering regulators: <i>VERNALIZATION1</i> (<i>VRN1</i>), <i>VRN2</i>, and <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T</i> (<i>FT</i>). Previous reverse genetic studies suggested that the roles of <i>VRN1</i> and <i>FT</i> are conserved in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i> yet identified considerable ambiguity surrounding the role of <i>VRN2</i>. To investigate the natural diversity governing flowering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> pathways in a nondomesticated grass, the reference <i>B. distachyon</i> accession Bd21 was crossed with the vernalization-dependent accession ABR6. Resequencing of ABR6 allowed the creation of a single-nucleotide polymorphism-based genetic map at the F4 stage of the mapping population. Flowering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> was evaluated in F4:5 families in five environmental conditions, and three major loci were found to govern flowering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>. Interestingly, two of these loci colocalize with the <i>B. distachyon</i> homologs of the major flowering pathway genes <i>VRN2</i> and <i>FT</i>, whereas no linkage was observed at <i>VRN1</i>. Characterization of these candidates identified sequence and expression variation between the two parental genotypes, which may explain the contrasting growth habits. However, the identification of additional quantitative trait loci suggests that greater complexity underlies flowering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> in this nondomesticated system. Studying the interaction of these regulators in <i>B. distachyon</i> provides insights into the evolutionary context of flowering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> regulation in the Poaceae as well as elucidates the way humans have utilized the natural variation present in grasses to create modern temperate cereals.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Dynamic Convergent Evolution Drives the Passage Adaptation across 48 Years’ History of H3N2 Influenza Evolution
<p>Influenza viruses are often propagated in a diverse set of culturing media and additional substitutions known as passage adaptation can cause extra evolution in the target strain, leading to ineffective vaccines. Using 25,482 H3N2 HA1 sequences curated from Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data and National Center for Biotechnology Information databases, we found that passage adaptation is a very dynamic process that changes over <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> and evolves in a seesaw like pattern. After crossing the species boundary from bird to human in 1968, the influenza H3N2 virus evolves to be better adapted to the human environment and passaging them in embryonated eggs (i.e., an avian environment) leads to increasingly stronger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive selection. On the contrary, passage adaptation to the mammalian cell lines changes from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive selection to negative selection. Using two statistical tests, we identified 19 codon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ions around the receptor binding domain strongly contributing to passage adaptation in the embryonated egg. These sites show strong convergent evolution and overlap extensively with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ively selected sites identified in humans, suggesting that passage adaptation can confound many of the earlier studies on influenza evolution. Interestingly, passage adaptation in recent years seems to target a few codon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ions in antigenic surface epitopes, which makes it difficult to produce antigenically unaltered vaccines using embryonic eggs. Our study outlines another interesting scenario whereby both convergent and adaptive evolution are working in synchrony driving viral adaptation. Future studies from sequence analysis to vaccine production need to take careful consideration of passage adaptation.</p>

Time to Endovascular Treatment and Outcome in Acute Ischemic Stroke
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Randomized, clinical trials in selected acute ischemic stroke patients reported that for every hour delay of endovascular treatment (EVT), chances of functional independence diminish by up to 3.4%. These findings may not be fully generalizable to clinical practice because of strict in- and exclusion criteria in these trials. Therefore, we aim to assess the association of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> to EVT with functional outcome in current, everyday clinical practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The MR CLEAN Registry (Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in The Netherlands) is an ongoing, prospective, observational study in all centers that perform EVT in The Netherlands.

In the primary analysis we assessed the association of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> from stroke onset to start of EVT and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> from stroke onset to successful reperfusion with functional outcome (measured with the modified Rankin Scale), by means of ordinal logistic regression.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We analyzed 1488 patients with acute ischemic stroke who underwent EVT.

Every hour increase from stroke onset to EVT start resulted in a 5.3% decreased probability of functional independence (modified Rankin Scale, 0–2).

Social place-cells in the bat hippocampus
<p>Social animals have to know the spatial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ions of conspecifics. However, it is unknown how the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion of others is represented in the brain. We designed a spatial observational-learning task, in which an observer bat mimicked a demonstrator bat while we recorded hippocampal dorsal-CA1 neurons from the observer bat. A neuronal subpopulation represented the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion of the other bat, in allocentric coordinates. About half of these “social place-cells” represented also the observer’s own <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion—that is, were place cells. The representation of the demonstrator bat did not reflect self-movement or trajectory planning by the observer. Some neurons represented also the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion of inanimate moving objects; however, their representation differed from the representation of the demonstrator bat. This suggests a role for hippocampal CA1 neurons in social-spatial cognition.</p>

Submillihertz magnetic spectroscopy performed with a nanoscale quantum sensor
<p>Precise <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>keeping is critical to metrology, forming the basis by which standards of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>, length, and fundamental constants are determined. Stable clocks are particularly valuable in spectroscopy because they define the ultimate frequency precision that can be reached. In quantum metrology, the qubit coherence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> defines the clock stability, from which the spectral linewidth and frequency precision are determined. We demonstrate a quantum sensing protocol in which the spectral precision goes beyond the sensor coherence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> and is limited by the stability of a classical clock. Using this technique, we observed a precision in frequency estimation scaling in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> <i>T</i> as <i>T</i><sup>–3/2</sup> for classical oscillating fields. The narrow linewidth magnetometer based on single spins in diamond is used to sense nanoscale magnetic fields with an intrinsic frequency resolution of 607 microhertz, which is eight orders of magnitude narrower than the qubit coherence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>.</p>

ABI5-BINDING PROTEIN2 Coordinates CONSTANS to Delay Flowering by Recruiting the Transcriptional Corepressor TPR2
<p>ABI5-BINDING PROTEIN2 (AFP2) negatively regulates the abscisic acid signal by accelerating ABI5 degradation during seed germination in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The abscisic acid signal is reported to delay flowering by up-regulating <i>Flowering Locus C</i> expression, but the role of AFP2 in regulating flowering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> is unknown. Here, we found that flowering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> was markedly delayed and <i>CONSTANS</i> (<i>CO</i>) expression was reduced in a transgenic Arabidopsis line overexpressing <i>AFP2</i> under LD conditions. Conversely, the loss-of-function <i>afp2</i> mutant showed slightly earlier flowering, with higher <i>CO</i> expression. These data suggest that <i>AFP2</i> negatively regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoperiod</span></strong>-dependent flowering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> by modulating the CO signal. We then found that <i>AFP2</i> exhibited circadian expression rhythms that peaked during the night. Furthermore, the C-terminus of AFP2 interacted with CO, while its N-terminal ethylene response factor–associated amphiphilic repression motif interacted with the transcriptional corepressor TOPLESS-related protein2 (TPR2). Thus, AFP2 bridges CO and TPR2 to form the CO-AFP2-TPR2 complex. Biochemical and genetic analyses showed that AFP2 mediated CO degradation during the night. AFP2 also recruited histone deacetylase activity at <i>Flowering Locus T</i> chromatin through its interaction with TPR2. Taken together, our results reveal an elaborate mechanism by which AFP2 modulates flowering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> through coordinating the activity and stability of CO.</p>

Enhancer-Promoter Interaction of <i>SELF PRUNING 5G</i> Shapes Photoperiod Adaptation
<p>Tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) is a major vegetable fruit grown and consumed worldwide. Modern cultivated tomatoes are derived from their wild relative, <i>Solanum pimpinellifolium</i>, a short-day plant that originated from the Andean region of South America. The molecular underpinnings of the regional adaptation and expansion of domesticated tomato remain largely unclear. In this study, we examined flowering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> in wild and cultivated tomatoes under both long-day and short-day conditions. Using quantitative trait locus mapping in a recombinant inbred line population, we identified <i>SELF PRUNING 5G</i> (<i>SP5G</i>) as a major locus influencing daylength adaptation in tomato. Genetic diversity analysis revealed that the genomic region harboring <i>SP5G</i> shows signatures of a domestication sweep. We found that a 52-bp sequence within the 3′ untranslated region of <i>SP5G</i> is essential for the enhanced expression of this gene, leading to delayed flowering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> in tomatoes through a promoter-enhancer interaction that occurs only under long-day conditions. We further demonstrate that the absence of the 52-bp sequence attenuates the promoter-enhancer interaction and reduces <i>SP5G</i> expression in cultivated tomatoes, making their flowering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> insensitive to daylength. Our findings demonstrate that cis-regulatory variation at the enhancer region of the <i>SP5G</i> 3′ untranslated region confers reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoperiod</span></strong>ic response in cultivated tomatoes, uncovering a regulatory mechanism that could potentially be used to manipulate flowering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> in tomato through novel biotechnological approaches.</p>

Auxin Contributes to the Intraorgan Regulation of Gene Expression in Response to Shade
<p>Plants sense and respond to light via multiple photoreceptors including phytochrome. The decreased ratio of red to far-red light that occurs under a canopy triggers shade-avoidance responses, which allow plants to compete with neighboring plants. The leaf acts as a photoperceptive organ in this response. In this study, we investigated how the shade stimulus is spatially processed within the cotyledon. We performed transcriptome analysis on microtissue samples collected from vascular and nonvascular regions of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) cotyledons. In addition, we mechanically isolated and analyzed the vascular tissue. More genes were up-regulated by the shade stimulus in vascular tissues than in mesophyll and epidermal tissues. The genes up-regulated in the vasculature were functionally divergent and included many auxin-responsive genes, suggesting that various physiological/developmental processes might be controlled by shade stimulus in the vasculature. We then investigated the spatial regulation of these genes in the vascular tissues. A small vascular region within a cotyledon was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">irradi</span></strong>ated with far-red light, and the response was compared with that when the whole seedling was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">irradi</span></strong>ated with far-red light. Most of the auxin-responsive genes were not fully induced by the local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">irradi</span></strong>ation, suggesting that perception of the shade stimulus requires that a wider area be exposed to far-red light or that a certain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion in the mesophyll and epidermis of the cotyledon be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">irradi</span></strong>ated. This result was consistent with a previous report that auxin synthesis genes are up-regulated in the periphery of the cotyledon. Hence, auxin acts as an important intraorgan signaling factor that controls the vascular shade response within the cotyledon.</p>

SHORTROOT-Mediated Increase in Stomatal Density Has No Impact on Photosynthetic Efficiency
<p>The coordinated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning of veins, mesophyll cells, and stomata across a leaf is crucial for efficient gas exchange and transpiration and, therefore, for overall function. In monocot leaves, stomatal cell files are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioned at the flanks of underlying longitudinal leaf veins, rather than directly above or below. This pattern suggests either that stomatal formation is inhibited in epidermal cells directly in contact with the vein or that specification is induced in cell files beyond the vein. The SHORTROOT pathway specifies distinct cell types around the vasculature in subepidermal layers of both root and shoots, with cell type identity determined by distance from the vein. To test whether the pathway has the potential to similarly pattern epidermal cell types, we expanded the expression domain of the rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> ssp <i>japonica</i>) <i>OsSHR2</i> gene, which we show is restricted to developing leaf veins, to include bundle sheath cells encircling the vein. In transgenic lines, which were generated using the orthologous <i>ZmSHR1</i> gene to avoid potential silencing of <i>OsSHR2</i>, stomatal cell files were observed both in the normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion and in more distant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ions from the vein. Contrary to theoretical predictions, and to phenotypes observed in eudicot leaves, the increase in stomatal density did not enhance photosynthetic capacity or increase mesophyll cell density. Collectively, these results suggest that the SHORTROOT pathway may coordinate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning of veins and stomata in monocot leaves and that distinct mechanisms may operate in monocot and eudicot leaves to coordinate stomatal patterning with the development of underlying mesophyll cells.</p>

Transcription Factor WRKY75 Interacts with DELLA Proteins to Affect Flowering
<p>Flowering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> is tightly controlled by both endogenous and exogenous signals. Although several lines of evidence have suggested the involvement of WRKY transcription factors in floral initiation, the underlying mechanisms and signaling pathways involved remain elusive. Here, we newly identified Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) WRKY DNA binding protein75 (WRKY75) as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive regulator of flowering initiation. Mutation of <i>WRKY75</i> resulted in a delay in flowering, whereas overexpression of <i>WRKY75</i> significantly accelerated flowering in Arabidopsis. Gene expression analysis showed that the transcript abundance of the flowering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> integrator gene <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T</i> (<i>FT</i>) was lower in <i>wrky75</i> mutants than in the wild type, but greater in <i>WRKY75</i>-overexpressing plants. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that WRKY75 directly binds to the promoter of <i>FT</i>. Both in vivo and in vitro biochemical analyses demonstrated that WRKY75 interacts with DELLA proteins. We found that both REPRESSOR OF <i>ga1-3</i> (RGA) RGA-LIKE1 (RGL1) and GA INSENSITIVE (GAI) can repress the activation ability of WRKY75, thereby attenuating expression of its regulon. Genetic analyses indicated that <i>WRKY75</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ively regulates flowering in a FT-dependent manner and overexpression of <i>RGL1</i> or gain-of-function of <i>GAI</i> could partially rescue the early flowering phenotype of <i>WRKY75</i>-overexpressing plants. Taken together, our results demonstrate that WRKY75 may function as a new component of the GA-mediated signaling pathway to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ively regulate flowering in Arabidopsis.</p>

Characterization of Trichome-Expressed BAHD Acyltransferases in <i>Petunia axillaris</i> Reveals Distinct Acylsugar Assembly Mechanisms within the Solanaceae
<p>Acylsugars are synthesized in the glandular trichomes of the Solanaceae family and are implicated in protection against abiotic and biotic stress. Acylsugars are composed of either sucrose or glucose esterified with varying numbers of acyl chains of differing length. In tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>), acylsugar assembly requires four acylsugar acyltransferases (ASATs) of the BAHD superfamily. Tomato ASATs catalyze the sequential esterification of acyl-coenzyme A thioesters to the R4, R3, R3′, and R2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ions of sucrose, yielding a tetra-acylsucrose. <i>Petunia</i> spp. synthesize acylsugars that are structurally distinct from those of tomato. To explore the mechanisms underlying this chemical diversity, a <i>Petunia</i> <i>axillaris</i> transcriptome was mined for trichome preferentially expressed BAHDs. A combination of phylogenetic analyses, gene silencing, and biochemical analyses coupled with structural elucidation of metabolites revealed that acylsugar assembly is not conserved between tomato and petunia. In <i>P. axillaris</i>, tetra-acylsucrose assembly occurs through the action of four ASATs, which catalyze sequential addition of acyl groups to the R2, R4, R3, and R6 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ions. Notably, in <i>P. axillaris</i>, PaxASAT1 and PaxASAT4 catalyze the acylation of the R2 and R6 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ions of sucrose, respectively, and no clear orthologs exist in tomato. Similarly, petunia acylsugars lack an acyl group at the R3′ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion, and congruently, an ortholog of SlASAT3, which catalyzes acylation at the R3′ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion in tomato, is absent in <i>P. axillaris</i>. Furthermore, where putative orthologous relationships of ASATs are predicted between tomato and petunia, these are not supported by biochemical assays. Overall, these data demonstrate the considerable evolutionary plasticity of acylsugar biosynthesis.</p>

<i>EARLY FLOWERING3</i> Redundancy Fine-Tunes Photoperiod Sensitivity
<p>Three pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) loci controlling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoperiod</span></strong> sensitivity, <i>HIGH RESPONSE</i> (<i>HR</i>), <i>DIE NEUTRALIS</i> (<i>DNE</i>), and <i>STERILE NODES</i> (<i>SN</i>), have recently been shown to correspond to orthologs of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) circadian clock genes <i>EARLY FLOWERING3</i> (<i>ELF3</i>), <i>ELF4</i>, and <i>LUX ARRHYTHMO</i>, respectively. A fourth pea locus, <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoperiod</span></strong></i> (<i>PPD</i>), also contributes to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoperiod</span></strong> response in a similar manner to <i>SN</i> and <i>DNE</i>, and recessive <i>ppd</i> mutants on a spring-flowering <i>hr</i> mutant background show early, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoperiod</span></strong>-insensitive flowering. However, the molecular identity of <i>PPD</i> has so far remained elusive. Here, we show that the <i>PPD</i> locus also has a role in maintenance of diurnal and circadian gene expression rhythms and identify <i>PPD</i> as an <i>ELF3</i> co-ortholog, termed <i>ELF3b</i>. Genetic interactions between pea <i>ELF3</i> genes suggest that loss of <i>PPD</i> function does not affect flowering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> in the presence of functional <i>HR</i>, whereas <i>PPD</i> can compensate only partially for the lack of <i>HR</i>. These results provide an illustration of how gene duplication and divergence can generate potential for the emergence of more subtle variations in phenotype that may be adaptively significant.</p>

Adaptive evolution of fish hatching enzyme: one amino acid substitution results in differential salt dependency of the enzyme
<p>Embryos of medaka <i>Oryzias latipes</i> hatch in freshwater, while those of killifish <i>Fundulus heteroclitus</i> hatch in brackish water. Medaka and <i>Fundulus</i> possess two kinds of hatching enzymes, high choriolytic enzyme (HCE) and low choriolytic enzyme (LCE), which cooperatively digest their egg envelope at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> of hatching. Optimal salinity of medaka HCE was found in 0 mol l<sup>−1</sup> NaCl, and activity decreased with increasing salt concentrations. One of the two <i>Fundulus</i> HCEs, FHCE1, showed the highest activity in 0 mol l<sup>−1</sup> NaCl, and the other, FHCE2, showed the highest activity in 0.125 mol l<sup>−1</sup> NaCl. The results suggest that the salt dependencies of HCEs are well adapted to each salinity at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> of hatching. Different from HCE, LCEs of both species maintained the activity sufficient for egg envelope digestion in various salinities. The difference in amino acid sequence between FHCE1 and FHCE2 was found at only a single site at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion 36 (Gly/Arg), suggesting that this single substitution causes the different salt dependency between the two enzymes. Superim<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion of FHCE1 and FHCE2 with the 3-D structure model of medaka HCE revealed that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion 36 was located on the surface of HCE molecule, far from its active site cleft. The results suggest a hypothesis that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion 36 influences salt-dependent activity of HCE, not with recognition of primary structure around the cleavage site, but with recognition of higher ordered structure of egg envelope protein.</p>

Treatment With Tissue Plasminogen Activator in the Golden Hour and the Shape of the 4.5-Hour Time-Benefit Curve in the National United States Get With The Guidelines-Stroke Population
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Earlier tissue plasminogen activator treatment improves ischemic stroke outcome, but aspects of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>-benefit relationship still not well delineated are: (1) the degree of additional benefit accrued with treatment in the first 60 minutes after onset, and (2) the shape of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>-benefit curve through 4.5 hours.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We analyzed patients who had acute ischemic stroke treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator within 4.5 hours of onset from the Get With The Guidelines-Stroke US national program. Onset-to-treatment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> was analyzed as a continuous, potentially nonlinear variable and as a categorical variable comparing patients treated within 60 minutes of onset with later epochs.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 65 384 tissue plasminogen activator–treated patients, the median onset-to-treatment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> was 141 minutes (interquartile range, 110–173) and 878 patients (1.3%) were treated within the first 60 minutes. Treatment within 60 minutes, compared with treatment within 61 to 270 minutes, was associated with increased odds of discharge to home (adjusted odds ratio, 1.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.07–1.45), independent ambulation at discharge (adjusted odds ratio, 1.22; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–1.45), and freedom from disability (modified Rankin Scale 0–1) at discharge (adjusted odds ratio, 1.72; 95% confidence interval, 1.21–2.46), without increased hemorrhagic complications or in-hospital mortality. The pace of decline in benefit of tissue plasminogen activator from onset-to-treatment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>s of 20 through 270 minutes was mildly nonlinear for discharge to home, with more rapid benefit loss in the first 170 minutes than later, and linear for independent ambulation and in-hospital mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Thrombolysis started within the first 60 minutes after onset is associated with best outcomes for patients with acute ischemic stroke, and benefit declined more rapidly early after onset for the ability to be discharged home.

β<sub>2</sub>-Glycoprotein I/IgA Immune Complexes
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Antiphospholipid syndrome is characterized by recurrent thrombosis and gestational morbidity in patients with antiphospholipid autoantibodies (aPLs). Predictive value of the presence of aPLs is low, and new markers are necessary to identify aPL carriers at higher risk and take preventive measures on them. The presence of circulating immune complexes of IgA bound to β<sub>2</sub>-glycoprotein I (B2A-CIC) has been associated with occurrence of acute thrombotic events. In this work we study its possible predictive value for the appearance of acute thrombotic events in patients who are going to undergo transplant surgery, a well-known trigger of acute thrombotic events in aPL carriers.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed a follow-up study based on the Magnum 12+12 Cohort of patients who received a kidney transplant (n=1339). Three groups were established: group 1 patients who were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive for IgA anti-β<sub>2</sub>-glycoprotein I (aB2GP1) and B2A-CIC (n=125); group 2 patients who were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive only for IgA aB2GP1 (n=240); and control group, patients who were negative for IgA aB2GP1 (n=974). Levels of autoantibodies and B2A-CIC were quantified immediately before the transplant surgery and patients were followed up for 6 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In group 1, 46.4% of patients experienced any type of thrombosis versus 10.4% in group 2 (<i>P</i><0.001) and 8.6% in the control group (<i>P</i><0.001). The incidence of graft thrombosis in group 1 (31.2%) was significantly higher than that observed in group 2 (3.3%, <i>P</i><0.001) and the control group (2.6%, <i>P</i><0.001). In a multivariate analysis, the presence of B2A-CIC was an independent variable to experience any type of posttransplant thrombosis (hazard ratio, 6.72; 95% confidence interval, 4.81–9.37) and, prominently, for graft thrombosis (hazard ratio, 14.75; 95% confidence interval, 9.11–23.89). No significant differences were found between B2A-CIC–negative and control group patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The presence of B2A-CIC is a predictor of acute thrombotic events. Patients who were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive for IgA aB2GP1 only are at risk of experiencing thrombosis if they are B2A-CIC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive. If they are B2A-CIC–negative patients, they have the same risk as the control group.

Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Connection
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC) is a rare form of congenital heart disease. This study describes current surgical treatment strategies and experiences in a cohort of patients from 2 congenital cardiac centers in Shanghai and Guangdong in China.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This retrospective study included 768 patients operated on between 2005 and 2014. Although most patients (n=690) underwent conventional repair, a sutureless technique was used in 10% (n=78) of cases. A multilevel mixed-effects parametric survival model and a competing-risk analysis were used to analyze associated risk factors for death and recurrent pulmonary venous obstruction (PVO), respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to analyze the overall survival. The Nelson-Aalen cumulative risk curve was used to compare distributions of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> with recurrent PVO.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The mean surgical age and weight were 214.9±39.2 days and 5.4±3.6 kg, respectively. Obstructed TAPVC (PVO) was documented in 192 (25%) of the 768 patients. There were 38 intraoperative deaths and 13 late deaths. A younger age at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> of repair (<i>P</i>=0.001), mixed (<i>P</i>=0.004) and infracardiac (<i>P</i>=0.035) TAPVC, preoperative PVO (<i>P</i>=0.027), prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> (<i>P</i><0.001), and longer duration of ventilation (<i>P</i>=0.028) were associated with mortality. The median follow-up was 23.2 months (range; 1–112 months). Among the 717 survivors, recurrent PVO was observed in 111 patients (15%). Associated risk factors for recurrent PVO included preoperative PVO (<i>P</i><0.001), infracardiac TAPVC (<i>P</i><0.001), mixed TAPVC (<i>P</i>=0.013), and prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> (<i>P</i><0.001). Sutureless technique was associated with a lower restenosis rate compared with conventional repair in patients with preoperative PVO (<i>P</i>=0.038), except in newborn patients (<i>P</i>=0.443). Reintervention for restenosis was performed in 24 patients. The function of most survivors (91%) was classified according to the New York Heart Association as functional class I or II.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Surgical correction in patients with TAPVC with a biventricular anatomy can achieve an acceptable outcome. Risk factors such as a younger age at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> of repair, infracardiac and mixed TAPVC, and preoperative PVO were associated with a poorer prognosis.</p></sec>

Leaf Starch Turnover Occurs in Long Days and in Falling Light at the End of the Day
<p>We investigated whether starch degradation occurs at the same <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> as starch synthesis in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves in the light. Starch accumulated in a linear fashion for about 12 h after dawn, then accumulation slowed and content plateaued. Following decreases in light intensity, the rate of accumulation of starch declined in proportion to the decline in photosynthesis if the decrease occurred <10 h after dawn, but accumulation ceased or loss of starch occurred if the same decrease in light intensity was imposed more than 10 h after dawn. These changes in starch accumulation patterns after prolonged periods in the light occurred at both high and low starch contents and were not related to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>-dependent changes in either the rate of photosynthesis or the partitioning of assimilate between starch and Suc, as assessed from metabolite measurements and <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> pulse experiments. Instead, measurements of incorporation of <sup>13</sup>C from <sup>13</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> into starch and of levels of the starch degradation product maltose showed that substantial starch degradation occurred simultaneously with synthesis at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> points >14 h after dawn and in response to decreases in light intensity that occurred >10 h after dawn. Starch measurements in circadian clock mutants suggested that the clock influences the timing of onset of degradation. We conclude that the propensity for leaf starch to be degraded increases with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> after dawn. The importance of this phenomenon for efficient use of carbon for growth in long days and for prevention of starvation during twilight is discussed.</p>

The Genetic Control of Reproductive Development under High Ambient Temperature<xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>Ambient temperature has a large impact on reproductive development and grain yield in temperate cereals. However, little is known about the genetic control of development under different ambient temperatures. Here, we demonstrate that in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), high ambient temperatures accelerate or delay reproductive development depending on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoperiod</span></strong> response gene <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoperiod</span></strong>1</i> (<i>Ppd-H1</i>) and its upstream regulator <i>EARLY FLOWERING3</i> (<i>HvELF3</i>). A natural mutation in <i>Ppd-H1</i> prevalent in spring barley delayed floral development and reduced the number of florets and seeds per spike, while the wild-type <i>Ppd-H1</i> or a mutant <i>Hvelf3</i> allele accelerated floral development and maintained the seed number under high ambient temperatures. High ambient temperature delayed the expression phase and reduced the amplitude of clock genes and repressed the floral integrator gene <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T1</i> independently of the genotype. <i>Ppd-H1</i>-dependent variation in flowering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> under different ambient temperatures correlated with relative expression levels of the <i>BARLEY MADS</i>-box genes <i>VERNALIZATION1</i> (<i>HvVRN1</i>), <i>HvBM3</i>, and <i>HvBM8</i> in the leaf. Finally, we show that <i>Ppd-H1</i> interacts with regulatory variation at <i>HvVRN1. Ppd-H1</i> only accelerated floral development in the background of a spring <i>HvVRN1</i> allele with a deletion in the regulatory intron. The full-length winter <i>Hvvrn1</i> allele was strongly down-regulated, and flowering was delayed by high temperatures irrespective of <i>Ppd-H1</i>. Our findings demonstrate that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoperiod</span></strong>ic and vernalization pathways interact to control flowering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> and floret fertility in response to ambient temperature in barley.</p>

Natural Selection in the Great Apes
<p>Natural selection is crucial for the adaptation of populations to their environments. Here, we present the first global study of natural selection in the <i>Hominidae</i> (humans and great apes) based on genome-wide information from population samples representing all extant species (including most subspecies). Combining several neutrality tests we create a multi-species map of signatures of natural selection covering all major types of natural selection. We find that the estimated efficiency of both purifying and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive selection varies between species and is significantly correlated with their long-term effective population size. Thus, even the modest differences in population size among the closely related <i>Hominidae</i> lineages have resulted in differences in their ability to remove deleterious alleles and to adapt to changing environments. Most signatures of balancing and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive selection are species-specific, with signatures of balancing selection more often being shared among species. We also identify loci with evidence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive selection across several lineages. Notably, we detect signatures of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive selection in several genes related to brain function, anatomy, diet and immune processes. Our results contribute to a better understanding of human evolution by putting the evidence of natural selection in humans within its larger evolutionary context.

Evidence for Selection on Gene Expression in Cultivated Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>)
<p>Artificial selection has been used throughout plant domestication and breeding to develop crops that are adapted to diverse environments. Here, we investigate whether gene regulatory changes have been widespread targets of lineage-specific selection in cultivated lines Minghui 63 and Zhenshan 97 of rice, <i>Oryza sativa</i>. A line experiencing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive selection for either an increase or a decrease in genes' transcript abundances is expected to have an overabundance of expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) alleles that increase or decrease those genes' expression, respectively. Results indicate that several genes that share Gene Ontology terms or are members of the same coexpression module have eQTL alleles from one parent that consistently increase gene expression relative to the second parent. A second line of evidence for lineage-specific selection is an overabundance of <i>cis–trans</i> pairs of eQTL alleles that affect gene expression in the same direction (are reinforcing). Across all <i>cis–trans</i> pairs of eQTL, including pairs that both weakly and strongly affect gene expression, there is no evidence for selection. However, the frequency of genes with reinforcing eQTL increases with eQTL strength. Therefore, there is evidence that eQTL with strong effects were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ively selected during rice cultivation. Among 41 <i>cis–trans</i> pairs with strong <i>trans</i> eQTL, 31 have reinforcing eQTL. Several of the candidate genes under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive selection accurately predict phenotypic differences between Minghui 63 and Zhenshan 97. Overall, our results suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive selection for regulatory alleles may be a key factor in plant improvement.</p>

Changes in protein expression in the salt marsh mussel <i>Geukensia demissa</i>: evidence for a shift from anaerobic to aerobic metabolism during prolonged aerial exposure
<p>During aerial exposure (emersion), most sessile intertidal invertebrates experience cellular stress caused by hypoxia, and the amount and types of hypoxia-induced stress will differ as exposure <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> increases, likely leading to altered metabolic responses. We examined proteomic responses to increasing emersion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>s and decreasing recovery (immersion) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>s in the mussel <i>Geukensia demissa</i>, which occurs in salt marshes along the east coast of North America. Individuals are found above mean tide level, and can be emersed for over 18 h during spring tides. We acclimated mussels to full immersion at 15°C for 4 weeks, and compared changes in gill protein expression between groups of mussels that were continually immersed (control), were emersed for 6 h and immersed during recovery for 18 h (6E/18R), were emersed for 12 h and recovered for 12 h (12E/12R), or were emersed for 18 h with a 6 h recovery (18E/6R). We found clear differences in protein expression patterns among the treatments. Proteins associated with anaerobic fermentation increased in abundance in 6E/18R but not in 12E/12R or 18E/6R. Increases in oxidative stress proteins were most apparent in 12E/12R, and in 18E/6R changes in cytoskeletal protein expression predominated. We conclude that <i>G. demissa</i> alters its strategy for coping with emersion stress over <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>, relying on anaerobic metabolism for short- to medium-duration exposure, but switching to an air-gaping strategy for long-term exposure, which reduces hypoxia stress but may cause structural damage to gill tissue.</p>

The aim of this study was   to compare the long-term outcome of cemented and cementless humeral   components in arthroplasty of the shoulder.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>All patients who underwent primary arthroplasty of the shoulder   at our institution between 1970 and 2012 were included in the study.   There were 4636 patients with 1167 cemented humeral components and   3469 cementless components. Patients with the two types of fixation   were matched for nine different covariates using a propensity score   analysis. A total of 551 well-balanced pairs of patients with cemented   and cementless components were available after matching for comparison   of the outcomes. The clinical outcomes which were analysed included loosening   of the humeral component determined at revision surgery, periprosthetic   fractures, post-operative infection and operating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The overall five-, ten-, 15- and 20-year rates of survival were   98.9%, 97.2%, 95.5%, and 94.4%, respectively. Survival without loosening   at 20 years was 98% for cemented components and 92.4% for cementless   components. After propensity score matching including fixation as   determined by the design of the component, humeral loosening was   also found to be significantly higher in the cementless group. Survival   without humeral loosening at 20 years was 98.7% for cemented components   and 91.0% for cementless components. There was no significant difference   in the risk of intra- or post-operative fracture. The rate of survival   without deep infection and the mean operating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> were significantly   higher in the cemented group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Both types of fixation give rates of long-term survival of >   90%. Cemented components have better rates of survival without loosening   but this should be weighed against increased operating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> and   the risk of bony destruction of the proximal humerus at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>   of revision of a cemented humeral component.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:666–73.</p></sec>

Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound does not influence bone healing by distraction osteogenesis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this double-blind prospective randomised controlled   trial was to assess whether low intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS)   accelerated or enhanced the rate of bone healing in adult patients   undergoing distraction osteogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 62 adult patients undergoing limb lengthening or bone   transport by distraction osteogenesis were randomised to treatment   with either an active (n = 32) or a placebo (n = 30) ultrasound   device. A standardised corticotomy was performed in the proximal   tibial metaphysis and a circular Ilizarov frame was used in all   patients. The rate of distraction was also standardised. The primary   outcome measure was the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> to removal of the frame after adjusting   for the length of distraction in days/cm for both the per protocol   (PP) and the intention-to-treat (ITT) groups. The assessor was blinded   to the form of treatment. A secondary outcome was to identify covariates affecting   the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> to removal of the frame.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was no difference in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> to removal of the frame between   the PP (difference in favour of the control group was 10.1 days/cm,   95% confidence interval (CI) -3.2 to 23.4, p = 0.054) or ITT (difference   5.0 days/cm, 95% CI -8.2 to 18.21, p = 0.226) groups. The smoking   status was the only covariate which increased the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> to removal   of the frame (hazard ratio 0.47, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.97, p = 0.042).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>LIPUS does not influence the rate of bone healing in patients   who undergo distraction osteogenesis.

Risk factors for post-operative periprosthetic fractures following primary total hip arthroplasty with a proximally coated double-tapered cementless femoral component
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to identify patient- and surgery-related   risk factors for sustaining an early periprosthetic fracture following   primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) performed using a double-tapered   cementless femoral component (Bi-Metric femoral stem; Biomet Inc.,   Warsaw, Indiana).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 1598 consecutive hips, in 1441 patients receiving   primary THA between January 2010 and June 2015, were retrospectively   identified. Level of pre-operative osteoarthritis, femoral Dorr   type and cortical index were recorded. Varus/valgus placement of   the stem and canal fill ratio were recorded post-operatively. Periprosthetic   fractures were identified and classified according to the Vancouver   classification. Regression analysis was performed to identify risk   factors for early periprosthetic fracture.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean follow-up was 713 days (1 to 2058). A total of 48 periprosthetic   fractures (3.0%) were identified during the follow-up and median   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> until fracture was 16 days, (interquartile range 10 to 31.5).   Patients with femoral Dorr type C had a 5.2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>s increased risk   of post-operative periprosthetic fracture compared with type B,   while female patients had a near significant two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>s increased   risk over <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> for post-operative fracture.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Dorr type C is an independent risk factor for early periprosthetic   fracture, following THA using a double tapered cementless stem such   as the Bi-Metric. Surgeons should take bone morphology into consideration   when planning for primary THA and consider using cemented femoral   components in female patients with poor bone quality.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:451–7.</p></sec>

Spinopelvic mobility and acetabular component position for total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Posterior tilt of the pelvis with sitting provides biological   acetabular opening. Our goal was to study the post-operative interaction   of skeletal mobility and sagittal acetabular component <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This was a radiographic study of 160 hips (151 patients) who   prospectively had lateral spinopelvic hip radiographs for skeletal   and implant measurements. Intra-operative acetabular component <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion   was determined according to the pre-operative spinal mobility.

Forms of treatment included reconstructions, prostheses   and com<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>e reconstructions, both with and without vascularised   grafts. Survivorship was determined by the Kaplan-Meier method.   Clinical outcomes were assessed using the Musculoskeletal Tumor   Society (MSTS) scoring system, the Toronto Extremity Salvage Score   (TESS) and Quality of Life-C30 (QLQ-30) measures. Radiographic outcomes   were assessed using the International Society of Limb Salvage (ISOLS)   radiographic scoring system.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were 61 (54%) men with a mean age of 22 years (6 to 70)   and 52 (46%) women with a mean age of 26 years (3 to 85).

Lunate morphology as a risk factor of idiopathic ulnar impaction syndrome
<sec><title>Aims</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive ulnar variance is an established risk factor for idiopathic   ulnar impaction syndrome (UIS). However, not all patients with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive   ulnar variance develop symptomatic UIS and other factors, including   the morphology of the lunate, may be involved. The aim of this study   was to clarify the relationship between lunate morphology and idiopathic   UIS.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A cohort of 95 patients with idiopathic UIS (UIS group) was compared   with 95 asymptomatic controls with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive ulnar variance. The   shape of the lunate was measured using the capitate-triquetrum distance   (CTD), ulnar coverage ratio (UCR), radiolunate distance and radiolunate   angle. The association of radiographic parameters and lunate types   with the development of UIS was investigated in univariable and   multivariable analyses.

Appropriate hinge position for prevention of unstable lateral hinge fracture in open wedge high tibial osteotomy
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Open wedge high tibial osteotomy (OWHTO) for medial-compartment   osteoarthritis of the knee can be complicated by intra-operative   lateral hinge fracture (LHF). We aimed to establish the relationship   between hinge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion and fracture types, and suggest an appropriate   hinge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion to reduce the risk of this complication.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Consecutive patients undergoing OWHTO were evaluated on coronal   multiplanar reconstruction CT images.

Intra-operative digital imaging
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aims of this study were to examine the rate at which the   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning of the acetabular component, leg length discrepancy   and femoral offset are outside an acceptable range in total hip   arthroplasties (THAs) which either do or do not involve the use   of intra-operative digital imaging.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A retrospective case-control study was undertaken with 50 patients   before and 50 patients after the integration of an intra-operative   digital imaging system in THA.

Association of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection and Risk of Peripheral Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The effect of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) on the development of peripheral artery disease (PAD) remains unclear. We investigated whether HIV infection is associated with an increased risk of PAD after adjustment for traditional atherosclerotic risk factors in a large cohort of HIV-infected (HIV+) and demographically similar HIV-uninfected veterans.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied participants in the Veterans Aging Cohort Study from April 1, 2003 through December 31, 2014. We excluded participants with known prior PAD or prevalent cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary heart disease, and congestive heart failure) and analyzed the effect of HIV status on the risk of incident PAD events after adjusting for demographics, PAD risk factors, substance use, CD4 cell count, HIV-1 ribonucleic acid, and antiretroviral therapy. The primary outcome is incident peripheral artery disease events. Secondary outcomes include mortality and amputation in subjects with incident PAD events by HIV infection status, viral load, and CD4 count.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 91 953 participants, over a median follow up of 9.0 years, there were 7708 incident PAD events. Rates of incident PAD events per 1000 person-years were higher among HIV+ (11.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 11.5–12.4) than uninfected veterans (9.9; 95% CI, 9.6–10.1). After adjustment for demographics, PAD risk factors, and other covariates, HIV+ veterans had an increased risk of incident PAD events compared with uninfected veterans (hazard ratio [HR], 1.19; 95% CI, 1.13–1.25). This risk was highest among those with time-updated HIV viral load >500 copies/mL (HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.38–1.65) and CD4 cell counts <200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> (HR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.71–2.13). In contrast, HIV+ veterans with time updated CD4 cell count ≥500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> had no increased risk of PAD (HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.96–1.11). Mortality rates after incident PAD events are high regardless of HIV status. HIV infection did not affect rates of amputation after incident PAD events.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Infection with HIV is associated with a 19% increased risk of PAD beyond that explained by traditional atherosclerotic risk factors. However, for those with sustained CD4 cell counts <200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, the risk of incident PAD events is nearly 2-fold higher whereas for those with sustained CD4 cell counts ≥500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> there is no excess risk of incident PAD events compared with uninfected people.</p></sec>

Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Lowering With Evolocumab and Outcomes in Patients With Peripheral Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitor evolocumab reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and cardiovascular events in the FOURIER trial (Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects With Elevated Risk). We investigated the efficacy and safety of evolocumab in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) as well as the effect on major adverse limb events.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>FOURIER was a randomized trial of evolocumab versus placebo in 27 564 patients with atherosclerotic disease on statin therapy followed for a median of 2.2 years. Patients were identified as having PAD at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>line if they had intermittent claudication and an ankle brachial index of <0.85, or if they had a prior peripheral vascular procedure. The primary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospital admission for unstable angina, or coronary revascularization. The key secondary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. An additional outcome of interest was major adverse limb events defined as acute limb ischemia, major amputation, or urgent peripheral revascularization for ischemia.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Three thousand six hundred forty-two patients (13.2%) had PAD (1505 with no prior myocardial infarction or stroke). Evolocumab significantly reduced the primary end point consistently in patients with PAD (hazard ratio [HR] 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66–0.94; <i>P</i>=0.0098) and without PAD (HR 0.86; 95% CI, 0.80–0.93; <i>P</i>=0.0003; <i>P</i><sub>interaction</sub>=0.40). For the key secondary end point, the HRs were 0.73 (0.59–0.91; <i>P</i>=0.0040) for those with PAD and 0.81 (0.73–0.90; <i>P</i><0.0001) for those without PAD (<i>P</i><sub>interaction</sub>=0.41). Because of their higher risk, patients with PAD had larger absolute risk reductions for the primary end point (3.5% with PAD, 1.6% without PAD) and the key secondary end point (3.5% with PAD, 1.4% without PAD). Evolocumab reduced the risk of major adverse limb events in all patients (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.38–0.88; <i>P</i>=0.0093) with consistent effects in those with and without known PAD. There was a consistent relationship between lower achieved low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and lower risk of limb events (<i>P</i>=0.026 for the beta coefficient) that extended down to <10 mg/dL.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Patients with PAD are at high risk of cardiovascular events, and PCSK9 inhibition with evolocumab significantly reduced that risk with large absolute risk reductions.

Association of Statin Dose With Amputation and Survival in Patients With Peripheral Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Statin dose guidelines for patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) are largely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d on coronary artery disease and stroke data. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of statin intensity on PAD outcomes of amputation and mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using an observational cohort study design and a validated algorithm, we identified patients with incident PAD (2003–2014) in the national Veterans Affairs data. Highest statin intensity exposure (high-intensity versus low-to-moderate–intensity versus antiplatelet therapy but no statin use) was determined within 1 year of diagnosis of PAD. Outcomes of interest were lower extremity amputations and death. The association of statin intensity with incident amputation and mortality was assessed with Kaplan-Meier plots, Cox proportional hazards modeling, propensity score–matched analysis, and sensitivity and subgroup analyses, as well, to reduce confounding.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In 155 647 patients with incident PAD, more than a quarter (28%) were not on statins. Use of high-intensity statins was lowest in patients with PAD only (6.4%) in comparison with comorbid coronary/carotid disease (18.4%). Incident amputation and mortality risk declined significantly with any statin use in comparison with the antiplatelet therapy–only group. In adjusted Cox models, the high-intensity statin users were associated with lower amputation risk and mortality in comparison with antiplatelet therapy–only users (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.61–0.74 and hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.70–0.77, respectively). Low-to-moderate–intensity statins also had significant reductions in the risk of amputation and mortality (hazard ratio amputation, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.75– 0.86; hazard ratio death, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.81–0.86) in comparison with no statins (antiplatelet therapy only), but effect size was significantly weaker than the high-intensity statins (<i>P</i><0.001). The association of high-intensity statins with lower amputation and death risk remained significant and robust in propensity score–matched, sensitivity, and subgroup analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Statins, especially high-intensity formulations, are underused in patients with PAD. This is the first population-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d study to show that high-intensity statin use at the time of PAD diagnosis is associated with a significant reduction in limb loss and mortality in comparison with low-to-moderate–intensity statin users, and patients treated only with antiplatelet medications but not with statins, as well.</p></sec>

D<sub>4</sub> dopamine receptor high-resolution structures enable the discovery of selective agonists
<p>Dopamine receptors are implicated in the pathogenesis and treatment of nearly every neuropsychiatric disorder. Although thousands of drugs interact with these receptors, our molecular understanding of dopaminergic drug selectivity and design remains clouded. To illuminate dopamine receptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e, function, and ligand recognition, we determined crystal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es of the D<sub>4</sub> dopamine receptor in its inactive state bound to the antipsychotic drug nemonapride, with resolutions up to 1.95 angstroms. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es suggest a mechanism for the control of constitutive signaling, and their unusually high resolution enabled a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d campaign for new agonists of the D<sub>4</sub> dopamine receptor. The ability to efficiently exploit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e for specific probe discovery—rapidly moving from elucidating receptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e to discovering previously unrecognized, selective agonists—testifies to the power of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d approaches.</p>

Plant Phenotyping: An Active Vision Cell for Three-Dimensional Plant Shoot Reconstruction
<p>Three-dimensional (3D) computer-generated models of plants are urgently needed to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong> both phenotyping and simulation-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d studies such as photosynthesis modeling. However, the construction of accurate 3D plant models is challenging, as plants are complex objects with an intricate leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e, often consisting of thin and highly reflective surfaces that vary in shape and size, forming dense, complex, crowded scenes. We address these issues within an image-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d method by taking an active vision approach, one that investigates the scene to intelligently capture images, to image acquisition. Rather than use the same camera positions for all plants, our technique is to acquire the images needed to reconstruct the target plant, tuning camera placement to match the plant’s individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e. Our method also combines volumetric- and surface-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d reconstruction methods and determines the necessary images <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d on the analysis of voxel clusters. We describe a fully automatic plant modeling/phenotyping cell (or module) comprising a six-axis robot and a high-precision turntable. By using a standard color camera, we overcome the difficulties associated with laser-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d plant reconstruction methods. The 3D models produced are compared with those obtained from fixed cameras and evaluated by comparison with data obtained by x-ray microcomputed tomography across different plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es. Our results show that our method is successful in improving the accuracy and quality of data obtained from a variety of plant types.</p>

The apo-structure of the leucine sensor Sestrin2 is still elusive
<p>Sestrin2 is a GATOR2-interacting protein that directly binds leucine and is required for the inhibition of mTORC1 under leucine deprivation, indicating that it is a leucine sensor for the mTORC1 pathway. We recently reported the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of Sestrin2 in complex with leucine [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID, 5DJ4] and demonstrated that mutations in the leucine-binding pocket that alter the affinity of Sestrin2 for leucine result in a corresponding change in the leucine sensitivity of mTORC1 in cells. A lower resolution <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of human Sestrin2 (PDB ID, 5CUF), which was crystallized in the absence of exogenous leucine, showed Sestrin2 to be in a nearly identical conformation as the leucine-bound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e. On the basis of this observation, it has been argued that leucine binding does not affect the conformation of Sestrin2 and that Sestrin2 may not be a sensor for leucine. We show that simple analysis of the reported “apo”-Sestrin2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e reveals the clear presence of prominent, unmodeled electron density in the leucine-binding pocket that exactly accommodates the leucine observed in the higher resolution <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e. Refining the reported apo-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e with leucine eliminated the large <i>F</i><sub>obs</sub>-<i>F</i><sub>calc</sub> difference density at this position and improved the working and free R factors of the model. Consistent with this result, our own <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of Sestrin2 crystallized in the absence of exogenous leucine also contained electron density that is best explained by leucine. Thus, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of apo-Sestrin2 remains elusive.</p>

T-plastin is essential for basement membrane assembly and epidermal morphogenesis

Here, we identify the actin-bundling protein T-plastin (Pls3) as a regulator of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>ment</span></strong> membrane assembly and epidermal morphogenesis. In utero depletion of <i>Pls3</i> transcripts in mouse embryos caused <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>ment</span></strong> membrane and polarity defects in the epidermis but had little effect on cell adhesion and differentiation.

However, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>ment</span></strong> membrane itself was profoundly sensitive to subtle perturbations in the actin cytoskeleton.

Extra strengthening and work hardening in gradient nanotwinned metals
<p>Gradient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es exist ubiquitously in nature and are increasingly being introduced in engineering. However, understanding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al gradient–related mechanical behaviors in all gradient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es, including those in engineering materials, has been challenging. We explored the mechanical performance of a gradient nanotwinned <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e with highly tunable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al gradients in pure copper. A large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al gradient allows for superior work hardening and strength that can exceed those of the strongest component of the gradient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e. We found through systematic experiments and atomistic simulations that this unusual behavior is afforded by a unique patterning of ultrahigh densities of dislocations in the grain interiors. These observations not only shed light on gradient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es, but may also indicate a promising route for improving the mechanical properties of materials through gradient design.</p>

Comprehensive computational design of ordered peptide macrocycles
<p>Mixed-chirality peptide macrocycles such as cyclosporine are among the most potent therapeutics identified to date, but there is currently no way to systematically search the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al space spanned by such compounds. Natural proteins do not provide a useful guide: Peptide macrocycles lack regular secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es and hydrophobic cores, and can contain local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es not accessible with <sc>l</sc>-amino acids. Here, we enumerate the stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es that can be adopted by macrocyclic peptides composed of <sc>l</sc>- and <sc>d</sc>-amino acids by near-exhaustive backbone sampling followed by sequence design and energy landscape calculations.

A MicroRNA93–Interferon Regulatory Factor-9–Immunoresponsive Gene-1–Itaconic Acid Pathway Modulates M2-Like Macrophage Polarization to Revascularize Ischemic Muscle
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Currently, no therapies exist for treating and improving outcomes in patients with severe peripheral artery disease (PAD). MicroRNA93 (miR93) has been shown to favorably modulate angiogenesis and to reduce tissue loss in genetic PAD models. However, the cell-specific function, downstream mechanisms, or signaling involved in miR93-mediated ischemic muscle neovascularization is not clear. Macrophages were best known to modulate arteriogenic response in PAD, and the extent of arteriogenic response induced by macrophages is dependent on greater M2 to M1 activation/polarization state. In the present study, we identified a novel mechanism by which miR93 regulates macrophage polarization to promote angiogenesis and arteriogenesis to revascularize ischemic muscle in experimental PAD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In vitro (macrophages, endothelial cells, skeletal muscle cells under normal and hypoxia serum starvation conditions) and in vivo experiments in preclinical PAD models (unilateral femoral artery ligation and resection) were conducted to examine the role of miR93-interferon regulatory factor-9–immunoresponsive gene-1 (IRG1)–itaconic acid pathway in macrophage polarization, angiogenesis, arteriogenesis, and perfusion recovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In vivo, compared with wild-type controls, miR106b-93-25 cluster–deficient mice (miR106b-93-25<sup>−/−</sup>) showed decreased angiogenesis and arteriogenesis correlating with increased M1-like macrophages after experimental PAD. Intramuscular delivery of miR93 in miR106b-93-25<sup>−/−</sup> PAD mice increased angiogenesis, arteriogenesis, and the extent of perfusion, which correlated with more M2-like macrophages in the proximal and distal hind-limb muscles. In vitro, miR93 promotes and sustains M2-like polarization even under M1-like polarizing conditions (hypoxia serum starvation). Delivery of bone marrow–derived macrophages from miR106b-93-25<sup>−/−</sup> to wild-type ischemic muscle decreased angiogenesis, arteriogenesis, and perfusion, whereas transfer of wild-type macrophages to miR106b-93-25<sup>−/−</sup> had the opposite effect. Systematic analysis of top differentially upregulated genes from RNA sequencing between miR106b-93-25<sup>−/−</sup> and wild-type ischemic muscle showed that miR93 regulates IRG1 function to modulate itaconic acid production and macrophage polarization. The 3′ untranslated region luciferase assays performed to determine whether IRG1 is a direct target of miR93 revealed that IRG1 is not an miR93 target but that interferon regulatory factor-9, which can regulate IRG1 expression, is an miR93 target. In vitro, increased expression of interferon regulatory factor-9 and IRG1 and itaconic acid treatment significantly decreased endothelial angiogenic potential.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>miR93 inhibits interferon regulatory factor-9 to decrease IRG1–itaconic acid production to induce M2-like polarization in ischemic muscle to enhance angiogenesis, arteriogenesis, and perfusion recovery in experimental PAD.</p></sec>

Three-dimensional genome structures of single diploid human cells
<p>Three-dimensional genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es play a key role in gene regulation and cell functions. Characterization of genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es necessitates single-cell measurements.

We developed a single-cell chromatin conformation capture method, termed Dip-C, that combines a transposon-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d whole-genome amplification method to detect many chromatin contacts, called META (multiplex end-tagging amplification), and an algorithm to impute the two chromosome haplotypes linked by each contact.

Structural insights into ion conduction by channelrhodopsin 2
<p>The light-gated ion channel channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2) from <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> is a major optogenetic tool. Photon absorption starts a well-characterized photocycle, but the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al basis for the regulation of channel opening remains unclear. We present high-resolution <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es of ChR2 and the C128T mutant, which has a markedly increased open-state lifetime. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e reveals two cavities on the intracellular side and two cavities on the extracellular side. They are connected by extended hydrogen-bonding networks involving water molecules and side-chain residues. Central is the retinal Schiff <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong> that controls and synchronizes three gates that separate the cavities. Separate from this network is the DC gate that comprises a water-mediated bond between C128 and D156 and interacts directly with the retinal Schiff <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>. Comparison with the C128T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e reveals a direct connection of the DC gate to the central gate and suggests how the gating mechanism is affected by subtle tuning of the Schiff <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>’s interactions.</p>

High-Resolution Mapping of Chromatin Conformation in Cardiac Myocytes Reveals Structural Remodeling of the Epigenome in Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiovascular disease is associated with epigenomic changes in the heart; however, the endogenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of cardiac myocyte chromatin has never been determined.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To investigate the mechanisms of epigenomic function in the heart, genome-wide chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) and DNA sequencing were performed in adult cardiac myocytes following development of pressure overload–induced hypertrophy. Mice with cardiac-specific deletion of CTCF (a ubiquitous chromatin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al protein) were generated to explore the role of this protein in chromatin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e and cardiac phenotype. Transcriptome analyses by RNA-seq were conducted as a functional readout of the epigenomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al changes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Depletion of CTCF was sufficient to induce heart failure in mice, and human patients with heart failure receiving mechanical unloading via left ventricular assist devices show increased CTCF abundance. Chromatin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al analyses revealed interactions within the cardiac myocyte genome at 5-kb resolution, enabling examination of intra- and interchromosomal events, and providing a resource for future cardiac epigenomic investigations. Pressure overload or CTCF depletion selectively altered boundary strength between topologically associating domains and A/B compartmentalization, measurements of genome accessibility. Heart failure involved decreased stability of chromatin interactions around disease-causing genes. In addition, pressure overload or CTCF depletion remodeled long-range interactions of cardiac enhancers, resulting in a significant decrease in local chromatin interactions around these functional elements.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These findings provide a high-resolution chromatin architecture resource for cardiac epigenomic investigations and demonstrate that global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al remodeling of chromatin underpins heart failure.

Contemporary Assessment of Left Ventricular Diastolic Function in Older Adults
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although age-associated changes in left ventricular diastolic function are well recognized, limited data exist characterizing measures of diastolic function in older adults, including both reference ranges reflecting the older adult population and prognostically relevant values for incident heart failure (HF), as well as their associations with circulating biomarkers of HF risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Among 5801 elderly participants in the ARIC study (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities; age range, 67–90 years; mean age, 76±5 years; 42% male; 21% black), we determined the continuous association of diastolic measures (tissue Doppler imaging [TDI] e’, E/e’, and left atrial size) with concomitant N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide and subsequent HF hospitalization or death. We also determined sex-specific 10th and 90th percentile limits for these measures using quantile regression in 401 participants free of prevalent cardiovascular disease and risk factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Each measure of diastolic function was robustly associated with N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide and incident HF or death. ARIC-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d reference limits for TDI e’ (4.6 and 5.2 cm/s for septal and lateral TDI e’, respectively) were substantially lower than guideline cut points (7 and 10 cm/s, respectively), whereas E/e’ and left atrial size demonstrated good agreement with guideline cut points. TDI e’ was nonlinearly associated with incident HF or death, with inflection points for risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong>ive of ARIC-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d limits. ARIC-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d limits for diastolic function improved risk discrimination over guideline-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d cut points <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d on the integrated discrimination improvement (<i>P</i><0.001) and continuous net reclassification improvement (<i>P</i><0.001), reclassifying 42% of the study population as having normal diastolic function. We replicate these findings in the Copenhagen City Heart Study. With these limits, 46% had normal diastolic function and were at low risk of HF hospitalization or death (1%/y over a mean 1.7-year follow-up), 49% had 1 or 2 abnormal measures and were at intermediate risk (2.4%/y), and all 3 diastolic measures were abnormal in 5% who were at high risk (7.5%/y).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings suggest that left ventricular longitudinal relaxation velocity declines as a part of healthy aging and is largely prognostically benign. The use of age-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d normative values when considering an elderly population improves the risk discrimination of diastolic measures for incident HF or death.</p></sec>

Unequivocal determination of complex molecular structures using anisotropic NMR measurements
<p>Assignment of complex molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data can be prone to interpretational mistakes.

The structure and flexibility of conical HIV-1 capsids determined within intact virions
<p>HIV-1 contains a cone-shaped capsid encasing the viral genome.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Exploiting CELLULOSE SYNTHASE (CESA) Class Specificity to Probe Cellulose Microfibril Biosynthesis
<p>Cellulose microfibrils are the basic units of cellulose in plants. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of these microfibrils is at least partly determined by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of the cellulose synthase complex. In higher plants, this complex is composed of 18 to 24 catalytic subunits known as CELLULOSE SYNTHASE A (CESA) proteins. Three different classes of CESA proteins are required for cellulose synthesis and for secondary cell wall cellulose biosynthesis these classes are represented by CESA4, CESA7, and CESA8. To probe the relationship between CESA proteins and microfibril <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e, we created mutant cesa proteins that lack catalytic activity but retain sufficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al integrity to allow assembly of the cellulose synthase complex. Using a series of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants and genetic backgrounds, we found consistent differences in the ability of these mutant cesa proteins to complement the cellulose-deficient phenotype of the <i>cesa</i> null mutants. The best complementation was observed with catalytically inactive cesa4, while the equivalent mutation in cesa8 exhibited significantly lower levels of complementation. Using a variety of biophysical techniques, including solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance and Fourier transform infrared microscopy, to study these mutant plants, we found evidence for changes in cellulose microfibril <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e, but these changes largely correlated with cellulose content and reflected differences in the relative proportions of primary and secondary cell walls. Our results suggest that individual CESA classes have similar roles in determining cellulose microfibril <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e, and it is likely that the different effects of mutating members of different CESA classes are the consequence of their different catalytic activity and their influence on the overall rate of cellulose synthesis.</p>

A High-Throughput, Field-Based Phenotyping Technology for Tall Biomass Crops
<p>Recent advances in omics technologies have not been accompanied by equally efficient, cost-effective, and accurate phenotyping methods required to dissect the genetic architecture of complex traits. Even though high-throughput phenotyping platforms have been developed for controlled environments, field-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d aerial and ground technologies have only been designed and deployed for short-stature crops. Therefore, we developed and tested Phenobot 1.0, an auto-steered and self-propelled field-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d high-throughput phenotyping platform for tall dense canopy crops, such as sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>). Phenobot 1.0 was equipped with laterally positioned and vertically stacked stereo RGB cameras. Images collected from 307 diverse sorghum lines were reconstructed in 3D for feature extraction. User interfaces were developed, and multiple algorithms were evaluated for their accuracy in estimating plant height and stem diameter. Tested feature extraction methods included the following: (1) User-interactive Individual Plant Height Extraction (UsIn-PHe) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d on dense stereo three-dimensional reconstruction; (2) Automatic Hedge-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d Plant Height Extraction (Auto-PHe) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d on dense stereo 3D reconstruction; (3) User-interactive Dense Stereo Matching Stem Diameter Extraction; and (4) User-interactive Image Patch Stereo Matching Stem Diameter Extraction (IPaS-Di). Comparative genome-wide association analysis and ground-truth validation demonstrated that both UsIn-PHe and Auto-PHe were accurate methods to estimate plant height, while Auto-PHe had the additional advantage of being a completely automated process. For stem diameter, IPaS-Di generated the most accurate estimates of this biomass-related architectural trait. In summary, our technology was proven robust to obtain ground-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d high-throughput plant architecture parameters of sorghum, a tall and densely planted crop species.</p>

Systems Genetics Identifies a Novel Regulatory Domain of Amylose Synthesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>A deeper understanding of the regulation of starch biosynthesis in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) endosperm is crucial in tailoring digestibility without sacrificing grain quality. In this study, significant association peaks on chromosomes 6 and 7 were identified through a genomewide association study (GWAS) of debranched starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e from grains of a 320 <i>indica</i> rice diversity panel using genotyping data from the high-density rice array. A systems genetics approach that interrelates starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e data from GWAS to functional pathways from a gene regulatory network identified known genes with high correlation to the proportion of amylose and amylopectin. An SNP in the promoter region of <i>Granule Bound Starch Synthase I</i> was identified along with seven other SNPs to form haplotypes that discriminate samples into different phenotypic ranges of amylose. A GWAS peak on chromosome 7 between LOC_Os07g11020 and LOC_Os07g11520 indexed by a nonsynonymous SNP mutation on exon 5 of a bHLH transcription factor was found to elevate the proportion of amylose at the expense of reduced short-chain amylopectin. Linking starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e with starch digestibility by determining the kinetics of cooked grain amylolysis of selected haplotypes revealed strong association of starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e with estimated digestibility kinetics. Combining all results from grain quality genomics, systems genetics, and digestibility phenotyping, we propose target haplotypes for fine-tuning starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e in rice through marker-assisted breeding that can be used to alter the digestibility of rice grain, thus offering rice consumers a new diet-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d intervention to mitigate the impact of nutrition-related noncommunicable diseases.</p>

Ultrafast Approximation for Phylogenetic Bootstrap
<p>Nonparametric bootstrap has been a widely used tool in phylogenetic analysis to assess the clade <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong> of phylogenetic trees. However, with the rapidly growing amount of data, this task remains a computational bottleneck. Recently, approximation methods such as the RAxML rapid bootstrap (RBS) and the Shimodaira–Hasegawa-like approximate likelihood ratio test have been introduced to speed up the bootstrap. Here, we suggest an ultrafast bootstrap approximation approach (UFBoot) to compute the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong> of phylogenetic groups in maximum likelihood (ML) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d trees. To achieve this, we combine the resampling estimated log-likelihood method with a simple but effective collection scheme of candidate trees. We also propose a stopping rule that assesses the convergence of branch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong> values to automatically determine when to stop collecting candidate trees. UFBoot achieves a median speed up of 3.1 (range: 0.66–33.3) to 10.2 (range: 1.32–41.4) compared with RAxML RBS for real DNA and amino acid alignments, respectively. Moreover, our extensive simulations show that UFBoot is robust against moderate model violations and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong> values obtained appear to be relatively unbiased compared with the conservative standard bootstrap. This provides a more direct interpretation of the bootstrap <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong>. We offer an efficient and easy-to-use software (available at <ext-link>http://www.cibiv.at/software/iqtree</ext-link>) to perform the UFBoot analysis with ML tree inference.</p>

The bacterial Ras/Rap1 site-specific endopeptidase RRSP cleaves Ras through an atypical mechanism to disrupt Ras-ERK signaling
<p>The Ras–extracellular signal–regulated kinase pathway is critical for controlling cell proliferation, and its aberrant activation drives the growth of various cancers. Because many pathogens produce toxins that inhibit Ras activity, efforts to develop effective Ras inhibitors to treat cancer could be informed by studies of Ras inhibition by pathogens. <i>Vibrio vulnificus</i> causes fatal infections in a manner that depends on multifunctional autoprocessing repeats-in-toxin, a toxin that releases bacterial effector domains into host cells. One such domain is the Ras/Rap1-specific endopeptidase (RRSP), which site-specifically cleaves the Switch I domain of the small GTPases Ras and Rap1. We solved the crystal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of RRSP and found that its backbone shares a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al fold with the EreA/ChaN-like superfamily of enzymes. Unlike other proteases in this family, RRSP is not a metalloprotease. Through nuclear magnetic resonance analysis and nucleotide exchange assays, we determined that the processing of KRAS by RRSP did not release any fragments or cause KRAS to dissociate from its bound nucleotide but instead only locally affected its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e. However, this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al alteration of KRAS was sufficient to disable guanine nucleotide exchange factor–mediated nucleotide exchange and prevent KRAS from binding to RAF. Thus, RRSP is a bacterial effector that represents a previously unrecognized class of protease that disconnects Ras from its signaling network while inducing limited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al disturbance in its target.</p>

Structural basis for chemokine recognition by a G protein–coupled receptor and implications for receptor activation
<p>Chemokines orchestrate cell migration for development, immune surveillance, and disease by binding to cell surface heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide–binding protein (G protein)–coupled receptors (GPCRs). The array of interactions between the nearly 50 chemokines and their 20 GPCR targets generates an extensive signaling network to which promiscuity and biased agonism add further complexity. The receptor CXCR4 recognizes both monomeric and dimeric forms of the chemokine CXCL12, which is a distinct example of ligand bias in the chemokine family. We demonstrated that a constitutively monomeric CXCL12 variant reproduced the G protein–dependent and β-arrestin–dependent responses that are associated with normal CXCR4 signaling and lead to cell migration. In addition, monomeric CXCL12 made specific contacts with CXCR4 that are not present in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of the receptor in complex with a dimeric form of CXCL12, a biased agonist that stimulates only G protein–dependent signaling. We produced an experimentally validated model of an agonist-bound chemokine receptor that merged a nuclear magnetic resonance–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of monomeric CXCL12 bound to the amino terminus of CXCR4 with a crystal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of the transmembrane domains of CXCR4. The large CXCL12:CXCR4 protein-protein interface revealed by this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e identified previously uncharacterized functional interactions that fall outside of the classical “two-site model” for chemokine-receptor recognition. Our model suggests a mechanistic hypothesis for how interactions on the extracellular face of the receptor may stimulate the conformational changes required for chemokine receptor–mediated signal transduction.</p>

We determined the cryo–electron microscopy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of the full-length TRPM8 from the collared flycatcher at an overall resolution of ~4.1 ångstroms. Our TRPM8 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e reveals a three-layered architecture. The amino-terminal domain with a fold distinct among known TRP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es, together with the carboxyl-terminal region, forms a large two-layered cytosolic ring that extensively interacts with the transmembrane channel layer. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e suggests that the menthol-binding site is located within the voltage-sensor–like domain and thus provides a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al glimpse of the design principle of the molecular transducer for cold and menthol sensation.</p>

Single-stranded DNA and RNA origami
<p>Self-folding of an information-carrying polymer into a defined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e is foundational to biology and offers attractive potential as a synthetic strategy. Although multicomponent self-assembly has produced complex synthetic nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es, unimolecular folding has seen limited progress. We describe a framework to design and synthesize a single DNA or RNA strand to self-fold into a complex yet unknotted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e that approximates an arbitrary user-prescribed shape. We experimentally construct diverse multikilo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong> single-stranded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es, including a ~10,000-nucleotide (nt) DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e and a ~6000-nt RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e. We demonstrate facile replication of the strand in vitro and in living cells. The work here thus establishes unimolecular folding as a general strategy for constructing complex and replicable nucleic acid nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es, and expands the design space and material scalability for bottom-up nanotechnology.</p>

Bottom-up construction of a superstructure in a porous uranium-organic crystal
<p>Bottom-up construction of highly intricate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es from simple building blocks remains one of the most difficult challenges in chemistry. We report a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>ally complex, mesoporous uranium-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d metal-organic framework (MOF) made from simple starting components. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e comprises 10 uranium nodes and seven tricarboxylate ligands (both crystallographically nonequivalent), resulting in a 173.3-angstrom cubic unit cell enclosing 816 uranium nodes and 816 organic linkers—the largest unit cell found to date for any nonbiological material. The cuboctahedra organize into pentagonal and hexagonal prismatic secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es, which then form tetrahedral and diamond quaternary topologies with unprecedented complexity. This packing results in the formation of colossal icosidodecahedral and rectified hexakaidecahedral cavities with internal diameters of 5.0 nanometers and 6.2 nanometers, respectively—ultimately giving rise to the lowest-density MOF reported to date.</p>

A Family of NAI2-Interacting Proteins in the Biogenesis of the ER Body and Related Structures
<p>Plants produce different types of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived vesicles that accumulate and transport proteins, lipids, and metabolites. In the Brassicales, a distinct ER-derived <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e called the ER body is found throughout the epidermis of cotyledons, hypocotyls, and roots. NAI2 is a key factor for ER body formation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Homologs of NAI2 are found only in the Brassicales and therefore may have evolved specifically to enable ER body formation. Here, we report that three related Arabidopsis NAI2-interacting proteins (NAIP1, NAIP2, and NAIP3) play a critical role in the biogenesis of ER bodies and related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es. Analysis using GFP fusions revealed that all three NAIPs are components of the ER bodies found in the cotyledons, hypocotyls, and roots. Genetic analysis with <i>naip</i> mutants indicates that they have a critical and redundant role in ER body formation. NAIP2 and NAIP3 are also components of other vesicular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es likely derived from the ER that are formed independent of NAI2 and are present not only in the cotyledons, hypocotyls, and roots, but also in the rosettes. Thus, while NAIP1 is a specialized ER body component, NAIP2 and NAIP3 are components of different types of ER-derived <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es. Analysis of chimeric NAIP proteins revealed that their N-terminal domains play a major role in the functional specialization between NAIP1 and NAIP3. Unlike NAI2, NAIPs have homologs in all plants; therefore, NAIP-containing ER <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es, from which the ER bodies in the Brassicales may have evolved, are likely to be present widely in plants.</p>

Direct Comparison of Leaf Plasmodesma Structure and Function in Relation to Phloem-Loading Type
<p>The export of photosynthetically produced sugars from leaves depends on plasmodesmatal transport of sugar molecules from mesophyll to phloem. Traditionally, the density of plasmodesmata (PD) along this phloem-loading pathway has been used as a defining feature of different phloem-loading types, with species proposed to have either many or few PD between the phloem and surrounding cells of the leaf. However, quantitative determination of PD density has rarely been performed. Moreover, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of PD has not been considered, even though it could impact permeability, and functional data are only available for very few species. Here, a comparison of PD density, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e, and function using data from transmission electron microscopy and live-cell microscopy was conducted for all relevant cell–cell interfaces in leaves of nine species. These species represent the three principal phloem-loading types currently discussed in literature. Results show that relative PD density among the different cell-cell interfaces in one species, but not absolute PD density, is indicative of phloem-loading type. PD density data of single interfaces, even combined with PD diameter and length data, did not correlate with the intercellular diffusion capacity measured by the fluorescence loss in photobleaching method. This means that PD sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e not visible on standard transmission electron micrographs may have a strong influence on permeability. Furthermore, the results <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong> a proposed passive symplasmic loading mechanism in the tree species horse chestnut (<i>Aesculus hippocastanum</i>), white birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>), orchard apple (<i>Malus domestica</i>), and gray poplar (<i>Populus x canescens</i>) as functional cell coupling and PD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e differed from active symplasmic and apoplasmic phloem-loading species.</p>

A Multilevel Study of Melon Fruit Reticulation Provides Insight into Skin Ligno-Suberization Hallmarks
<p>The skin of fleshy fruit is typically covered by a thick cuticle. Some fruit species develop different forms of layers directly above their skin. Reticulation, for example, is a specialized suberin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d coating that ornaments some commercially important melon (<i>Cucumis melo</i>) fruit and is an important quality trait. Despite its importance, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al, molecular, and biochemical features associated with reticulation are not fully understood. Here, we performed a multilevel investigation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al attributes, chemical composition, and gene expression profiles on a set of reticulated and smooth skin melons. High-resolution microscopy, surface profiling, and histochemical staining assays show that reticulation comprises cells with heavily suberized walls accumulating large amounts of typical suberin monomers, as well as lignified cells localized underneath the specialized suberized cell layer. Reticulated skin was characterized by induced expression of biosynthetic genes acting in the core phenylpropanoid, suberin, lignin, and lignan pathways. Transcripts of genes associated with lipid polymer assembly, cell wall organization, and loosening were highly enriched in reticulated skin tissue. These signatures were exclusive to reticulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es and absent in both the smooth surfaces observed in between reticulated regions and in the skin of smooth fruit. Our data provide important insights into the molecular and metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>s of reticulation and its tight association with skin ligno-suberization during melon fruit development. Moreover, these insights are likely to contribute to melon breeding programs aimed at improving postharvest qualities associated with fleshy fruit surface layers.</p>

F-Actin Mediated Focusing of Vesicles at the Cell Tip Is Essential for Polarized Growth
<p>F-actin has been shown to be essential for tip growth in an array of plant models, including <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. One hypothesis is that diffusion can transport secretory vesicles, while actin plays a regulatory role during secretion. Alternatively, it is possible that actin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d transport is necessary to overcome vesicle transport limitations to sustain secretion. Therefore, a quantitative analysis of diffusion, secretion kinetics, and cell geometry is necessary to clarify the role of actin in polarized growth. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis, we first show that secretory vesicles move toward and accumulate at the tip in an actin-dependent manner. We then depolymerized F-actin to decouple vesicle diffusion from actin-mediated transport and measured the diffusion coefficient and concentration of vesicles. Using these values, we constructed a theoretical diffusion-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d model for growth, demonstrating that with fast-enough vesicle fusion kinetics, diffusion could <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong> normal cell growth rates. We further refined our model to explore how experimentally extrapolated vesicle fusion kinetics and the size of the secretion zone limit diffusion-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d growth. This model predicts that diffusion-mediated growth is dependent on the size of the region of exocytosis at the tip and that diffusion-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d growth would be significantly slower than normal cell growth. To further explore the size of the secretion zone, we used a cell wall degradation enzyme cocktail and determined that the secretion zone is smaller than 6 μm in diameter at the tip. Taken together, our results highlight the requirement for active transport in polarized growth and provide important insight into vesicle secretion during tip growth.</p>

A Virus-Induced Assay for Functional Dissection and Analysis of Monocot and Dicot Flowering Time Genes
<p>Virus-induced flowering (VIF) uses virus vectors to express <i>Flowering Locus T</i> (<i>FT</i>) to induce flowering in plants. This approach has recently attracted wide interest for its practical applications in accelerating breeding in crops and woody fruit trees. However, the insight into VIF and its potential as a powerful tool for dissecting florigenic proteins remained to be elucidated. Here, we describe the mechanism and further applications of <i>Potato virus X</i> (PVX)-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d VIF in the short-day <i>Nicotiana tabacum</i> cultivar Maryland Mammoth. Ectopic delivery of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>AtFT</i> by PVX/AtFT did not induce the expression of the endogenous <i>FT</i> ortholog <i>NtFT4</i>; however, it was sufficient to trigger flowering in Maryland Mammoth plants grown under noninductive long-day conditions. Infected tobacco plants developed no systemic symptoms, and the PVX-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d VIF did not cause transgenerational flowering. We showed that the PVX-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d VIF is a much more rapid method to examine the impacts of single amino acid mutations on AtFT for floral induction than making individual transgenic Arabidopsis lines for each mutation. We also used the PVX-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d VIF to demonstrate that adding a His- or FLAG-tag to the N or C terminus of AtFT could affect its florigenic activity and that this system can be applied to assay the function of <i>FT</i> genes from heterologous species, including tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) <i>SFT</i> and rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) <i>Hd3a</i>. Thus, the PVX-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d VIF represents a simple and efficient system to identify individual amino acids that are essential for FT-mediated floral induction and to test the ability of mono- and dicotyledonous <i>FT</i> genes and FT fusion proteins to induce flowering.</p>

Phylogeny-Based Systematization of Arabidopsis Proteins with Histone H1 Globular Domain
<p>H1 (or linker) histones are basic nuclear proteins that possess an evolutionarily conserved nucleosome-binding globular domain, GH1. They perform critical functions in determining the accessibility of chromatin DNA to trans-acting factors. In most metazoan species studied so far, linker histones are highly heterogenous, with numerous nonallelic variants cooccurring in the same cells. The phylogenetic relationships among these variants as well as their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al and functional properties have been relatively well established. This contrasts markedly with the rather limited knowledge concerning the phylogeny and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al and functional roles of an unusually diverse group of GH1-containing proteins in plants. The dearth of information and the lack of a coherent phylogeny-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d nomenclature of these proteins can lead to misunderstandings regarding their identity and possible relationships, thereby hampering plant chromatin research. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d on published data and our in silico and high-throughput analyses, we propose a systematization and coherent nomenclature of GH1-containing proteins of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> [L.] Heynh) that will be useful for both the identification and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al and functional characterization of homologous proteins from other plant species.</p>

Monitoring of Freezing Dynamics in Trees: A Simple Phase Shift Causes Complexity
<p>During winter, trees have to cope with harsh conditions, including extreme freeze-thaw stress. This study focused on ice nucleation and propagation, related water shifts and xylem cavitation, as well as cell damage and was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d on in situ monitoring of xylem (thermocouples) and surface temperatures (infrared imaging), ultrasonic emissions, and dendrometer analysis. Field experiments during late winter on <i>Picea abies</i> growing at the alpine timberline revealed three distinct freezing patterns: (1) from the top of the tree toward the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>, (2) from thin branches toward the main stem’s top and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>, and (3) from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong> toward the top. Infrared imaging showed freezing within branches from their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong> toward distal parts. Such complex freezing causes dynamic and heterogenous patterns in water potential and probably in cavitation. This study highlights the interaction between environmental conditions upon freezing and thawing and demonstrates the enormous complexity of freezing processes in trees. Diameter shrinkage, which indicated water fluxes within the stem, and acoustic emission analysis, which indicated cavitation events near the ice front upon freezing, were both related to minimum temperature and, upon thawing, related to vapor pressure deficit and soil temperature. These complex patterns, emphasizing the common mechanisms between frost and drought stress, shed new light on winter tree physiology.</p>

Dirigent Protein Mode of Action Revealed by the Crystal Structure of AtDIR6
<p>Dirigent proteins impart stereoselectivity to phenoxy radical coupling reactions in plants and, thus, play an essential role in the biosynthesis of biologically active natural products. This includes the regioselective and enantioselective coupling and subsequent cyclization of two coniferyl alcohol radicals to pinoresinol as the committed step of lignan biosynthesis. The reaction is controlled by dirigent proteins, which, depending on the species and protein, direct the reaction to either (+)- or (−)-pinoresinol. We present the crystal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of the (−)-pinoresinol forming DIRIGENT PROTEIN6 (AtDIR6) from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) with data to 1.4 Å resolution. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e shows AtDIR6 as an eight-stranded antiparallel β-barrel that forms a trimer with spatially well-separated cavities for substrate binding. The binding cavities are two lobed, exhibiting two opposing pockets, each lined with a set of hydrophilic and potentially catalytic residues, including essential aspartic acids. These residues are conserved between (+) and (−)-pinoresinol-forming DIRs and required for activity. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong>s a model in which two substrate radicals bind to each of the DIR monomers. With the aromatic rings fixed in the two pockets, the propionyl side chains face each other for radical-radical coupling, and stereoselectivity is determined by the exact positioning of the side chains. Extensive mutational analysis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong>s a previously unrecognized function for DIRs in catalyzing the cyclization of the bis-quinone methide reaction intermediate to yield (+)- or (−)-pinoresinol.</p>

Cardiovascular Consequences of Childhood Secondhand Tobacco Smoke Exposure: Prevailing Evidence, Burden, and Racial and Socioeconomic Disparities: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although public health programs have led to a substantial decrease in the prevalence of tobacco smoking, the adverse health effects of tobacco smoke exposure are by no means a thing of the past. In the United States, 4 of 10 school-aged children and 1 of 3 adolescents are involuntarily exposed to secondhand tobacco smoke (SHS), with children of minority ethnic backgrounds and those living in low-socioeconomic-status households being disproportionately affected (68% and 43%, respectively). Children are particularly vulnerable, with little control over home and social environment, and lack the understanding, agency, and ability to avoid SHS exposure on their own volition; they also have physiological or behavioral characteristics that render them especially susceptible to effects of SHS. Side-stream smoke (the smoke emanating from the burning end of the cigarette), a major component of SHS, contains a higher concentration of some toxins than mainstream smoke (inhaled by the smoker directly), making SHS potentially as dangerous as or even more dangerous than direct smoking. Compelling animal and human evidence shows that SHS exposure during childhood is detrimental to arterial function and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e, resulting in premature atherosclerosis and its cardiovascular consequences. Childhood SHS exposure is also related to impaired cardiac autonomic function and changes in heart rate variability. In addition, childhood SHS exposure is associated with clustering of cardiometabolic risk factors such as obesity, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance. Individualized interventions to reduce childhood exposure to SHS are shown to be at least modestly effective, as are broader-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d policy initiatives such as community smoking bans and increased taxation.</p></sec><sec><title>Purpose:</title><p>The purpose of this statement is to summarize the available evidence on the cardiovascular health consequences of childhood SHS exposure; this will <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">support</span></strong> ongoing efforts to further reduce and eliminate SHS exposure in this vulnerable population. This statement reviews relevant data from epidemiological studies, laboratory-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d experiments, and controlled behavioral trials concerning SHS and cardiovascular disease risk in children. Information on the effects of SHS exposure on the cardiovascular system in animal and pediatric studies, including vascular disruption and platelet activation, oxidation and inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, increased vascular stiffness, changes in vascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e, and autonomic dysfunction, is examined.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The epidemiological, observational, and experimental evidence accumulated to date demonstrates the detrimental cardiovascular consequences of SHS exposure in children.</p></sec><sec><title>Implications:</title><p>Increased awareness of the adverse, lifetime cardiovascular consequences of childhood SHS may facilitate the development of innovative individual, family-centered, and community health interventions to reduce and ideally eliminate SHS exposure in the vulnerable pediatric population. This evidence calls for a robust public health policy that embraces zero tolerance of childhood SHS exposure.</p></sec>

Aldehyde dehydrogenase, Ald4p, is a major component of mitochondrial fluorescent inclusion bodies in the yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>
<p>When <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> strain 3626 was cultured to the stationary phase in a medium that contained glucose, needle-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es that emitted autofluorescence were observed in almost all cells by fluorescence microscopy under UV excitation. The needle-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es completely overlapped with the profile of straight elongated mitochondria. Therefore, these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es were designated as mitochondrial fluorescent inclusion bodies (MFIBs). The MFIB-enriched mitochondrial fractions were successfully isolated and 2D-gel electrophoresis revealed that a protein of 54 kDa was only highly concentrated in the fractions. Determination of the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the 54-kDa protein identified it as a mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase, Ald4p. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that anti-Ald4p antibody specifically stained MFIBs. Freeze-substitution electron microscopy demonstrated that cells that retained MFIBs had electron-dense filamentous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es with a diameter of 10 nm in straight elongated mitochondria. Immunoelectron microscopy showed that Ald4p was localized to the electron-dense filamentous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es in mitochondria. These results together showed that a major component of MFIBs is Ald4p. In addition, we demonstrate that MFIBs are common features that appear in mitochondria of many species of yeast.</p>

Clathrate colloidal crystals
<p>DNA-programmable assembly has been used to deliberately synthesize hundreds of different colloidal crystals spanning dozens of symmetries, but the complexity of the achieved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es has so far been limited to small unit cells. We assembled DNA-modified triangular bipyramids (~250-nanometer long edge, 177-nanometer short edge) into clathrate architectures. Electron microscopy images revealed that at least three different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es form as large single-domain architectures or as multidomain materials. Ordered assemblies, iso<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al to clathrates, were identified with the help of molecular simulations and geometric analysis. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es are the most sophisticated architectures made via programmable assembly, and their formation can be understood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d on the shape of the nanoparticle building blocks and mode of DNA functionalization.</p>

Cryo-EM structures and atomic model of the HIV-1 strand transfer complex intasome
<p>Like all retroviruses, HIV-1 irreversibly inserts a viral DNA (vDNA) copy of its RNA genome into host target DNA (tDNA). The intasome, a higher-order nucleoprotein complex composed of viral integrase (IN) and the ends of linear vDNA, mediates integration. Productive integration into host chromatin results in the formation of the strand transfer complex (STC) containing catalytically joined vDNA and tDNA. HIV-1 intasomes have been refractory to high-resolution <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al studies. We used a soluble IN fusion protein to facilitate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al studies, through which we present a high-resolution cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of the core tetrameric HIV-1 STC and a higher-order form that adopts carboxyl-terminal domain rearrangements. The distinct STC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es highlight how HIV-1 can use the common retroviral intasome core architecture to accommodate different IN domain modules for assembly.</p>

Zika virus produces noncoding RNAs using a multi-pseudoknot structure that confounds a cellular exonuclease
<p>The outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) and associated fetal microcephaly mandates efforts to understand the molecular processes of infection. Related flaviviruses produce noncoding subgenomic flaviviral RNAs (sfRNAs) that are linked to pathogenicity in fetal mice. These viruses make sfRNAs by co-opting a cellular exonuclease via <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>ed RNAs called xrRNAs. We found that ZIKV-infected monkey and human epithelial cells, mouse neurons, and mosquito cells produce sfRNAs. The RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e that is responsible for ZIKV sfRNA production forms a complex fold that is likely found in many pathogenic flaviviruses. Mutations that disrupt the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e affect exonuclease resistance in vitro and sfRNA formation during infection. The complete ZIKV xrRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e clarifies the mechanism of exonuclease resistance and identifies features that may modulate function in diverse flaviviruses.</p>

Healthy Roots and Leaves: Comparative Genome Structure of Horseradish and Watercress
<p>Horseradish (<i>Armoracia rusticana</i>) and watercress (<i>Nasturtium officinale</i>) are economically important cruciferous vegetable species with limited genomic resources. We used comparative chromosome painting to identify the extent of chromosomal collinearity between horseradish and watercress, and to reconstruct the origin and evolution of the two tetraploid genomes (2<i>n</i> = 4<i>x</i> = 32). Our results show that horseradish and watercress genomes originated from a common ancestral (<i>n</i> = 8) genome, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>ally resembling the Ancestral Crucifer Karyotype (<i>n</i> = 8), which, however, contained two unique translocation chromosomes (AK6/8 and AK8/6). Except for a 2.4-Mb unequal chromosome translocation in watercress, both genomes are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>ally identical. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al similarity of the two parental subgenomes might suggest an autotetraploid origin of horseradish and watercress genomes. The subgenome stasis, apart from the single-chromosome translocation, indicates that homeologous recombination played a limited role in postpolyploid evolution in both tetraploid genomes. The octoploid genome of one-rowed watercress (<i>N. microphyllum</i>, 2<i>n</i> = 8<i>x</i> = 64), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>ally mirroring the tetraploid horseradish and watercress genomes, originated via autopolyploidization from the immediate tetraploid predecessor of watercress or hybridization between this and another now-extinct tetraploid <i>Nasturtium</i> species. These comparative cytogenomic maps in horseradish and watercress represent a first stepping stone for future whole-genome sequencing efforts and genetic improvement of both crop species.</p>

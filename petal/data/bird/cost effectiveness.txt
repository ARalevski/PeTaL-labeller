Nocebo effects can make you feel pain
<p>The mysterious phenomenon known as the nocebo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> describes negative expectancies. This is in contrast to positive expectancies that trigger placebo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s (<i>1</i>). In evolutionary terms, nocebo and placebo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s coexist to favor perceptual mechanisms that anticipate threat and dangerous events (nocebo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s) and promote appetitive and safety behaviors (placebo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s). In randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials, patients that receive placebos often report side <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s (nocebos) that are similar to those experienced by patients that receive the investigational treatment (<i>2</i>). Information provided during the informed consent process and divulgence of adverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s contribute to nocebo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s in clinical trials (<i>1</i>). Nocebo (and placebo) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s engage a complex set of neural circuits in the central nervous system that modulate the perception of touch, pressure, pain, and temperature (<i>1</i>, <i>3</i>, <i>4</i>). Commercial features of drugs such as price and labeling influence placebos (<i>5</i>, <i>6</i>). On page 105 of this issue, Tinnermann <i>et al.</i> (<i>7</i>) show that price also influences nocebo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s.</p>

Cost effectiveness of patellofemoral <i>versus</i> total knee arthroplasty in younger patients
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Patellofemoral arthroplasty (PFA) has experienced significant   improvements in implant survivorship with second generation designs.   This has renewed interest in PFA as an alternative to total knee   arthroplasty (TKA) for younger active patients with isolated patellofemoral   osteoarthritis (PF OA). We analysed the cost-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>iveness of PFA <i>versus</i> TKA   for the management of isolated PF OA in the United States-based   population.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We used a Markov transition state model to compare cost-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>iveness   between PFA and TKA. Simulated patients were aged 60 (base case)   and 50 years. Lifetime costs (2015 United States dollars), quality-adjusted   life year (QALY) gains and incremental cost-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>iveness ratio   (ICER) were calculated from a healthcare payer perspective. Annual rates   of revision were derived from the National Joint Registry for England,   Wales, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man. Deterministic and probabilistic   sensitivity analysis was performed for all parameters against a   $50 000/QALY willingness to pay. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>PFA was more expensive ($49 811 <i>versus</i> $46 632)   but more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive (14.3 QALYs <i>versus</i> 13.3 QALYs)   over a lifetime horizon. The ICER associated with the additional   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>iveness of PFA was $3097. The model was mainly sensitive to utility   values, with PFA remaining cost-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive when its utility exceeded   that of TKA by at least 1.0%. PFA provided incremental benefits   at no increased cost when annual rates of revision decreased by   24.5%. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Recent improvements in rates of implant of survival have made   PFA an economically beneficial joint-preserving procedure in younger   patients, delaying TKA until implant failure or tibiofemoral OA   progression. The present study quantified the minimum required marginal   benefit for PFA to be cost-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive compared with TKA and identified survivorship   targets for PFA to become both less expensive and more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive.   These benchmarks might be used to assess clinical outcomes of PFA   from an economic standpoint within the United States healthcare   system.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1028–36.</p></sec>

Antibody-Mediated Inhibition of Tspan12 Ameliorates Vasoproliferative Retinopathy Through Suppression of β-Catenin Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Anti-angiogenic biologicals represent an important concept for the treatment of vasoproliferative diseases. However, the need for continued treatment, the presence of nonresponders, and the risk of long-term side <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s limit the success of existing therapeutic agents. Although Tspan12 has been shown to regulate retinal vascular development, nothing is known about its involvement in neovascular disease and its potential as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of vasoproliferative diseases.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Rodent models of retinal neovascular disease, including the mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy and the very low density lipoprotein receptor knockout mouse model were analyzed for Tspan/β-catenin regulation. Screening of a phage display of a human combinatorial antibody (Ab) library was used for the development of a high-affinity Ab against Tspan12. Therapeutic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of the newly developed Ab on vascular endothelial cells were tested in vitro and in vivo in the oxygen-induced retinopathy and very low density lipoprotein receptor knockout mouse model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The newly developed anti-Tspan12 Ab exhibited potent inhibitory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s on endothelial cell migration and tube formation. Mechanistic studies confirmed that the Ab inhibited the interaction between Tspan12 and Frizzled-4 and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ively modulates β-catenin levels and target genes in vascular endothelial cells. Tspan12/β-catenin signaling was activated in response to acute and chronic stress in the oxygen-induced retinopathy and very low density lipoprotein receptor mouse model of proliferative retinopathy. Intravitreal application of the Ab showed significant therapeutic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s in both models without inducing negative side <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s on retina function. Moreover, combined intravitreal injection of the Ab with a known vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor, Aflibercept, resulted in significant enhancement of the therapeutic efficacy of each monotherapy. Combination therapy with the Tspan12 blocking antibody can be used to reduce anti-vascular endothelial growth factor doses, thus decreasing the risk of long-term off-target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Tspan12/β-catenin signaling is critical for the progression of vasoproliferative disease. The newly developed anti-Tspan12 antibody has therapeutic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s in vasoproliferative retinopathy and can enhance the potency of existing anti- vascular endothelial growth factor agents.</p></sec>

The Cost-Effectiveness of Antibiotic Prophylaxis for Patients at Risk of Infective Endocarditis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In March 2008, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommended stopping antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) for those at risk of infective endocarditis (IE) undergoing dental procedures in the United Kingdom, citing a lack of evidence of efficacy and cost-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>iveness. We have performed a new economic evaluation of AP on the basis of contemporary estimates of efficacy, adverse events, and resource implications.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A decision analytic cost-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>iveness model was used. Health service costs and benefits (measured as quality-adjusted life-years) were estimated. Rates of IE before and after the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance were available to estimate prophylactic efficacy. AP adverse event rates were derived from recent UK data, and resource implications were based on English Hospital Episode Statistics.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>AP was less costly and more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive than no AP for all patients at risk of IE. The results are sensitive to AP efficacy, but efficacy would have to be substantially lower for AP not to be cost-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive. AP was even more cost-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive in patients at high risk of IE. Only a marginal reduction in annual IE rates (1.44 cases in high-risk and 33 cases in all at-risk patients) would be required for AP to be considered cost-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive at £20 000 ($26 600) per quality-adjusted life-year. Annual cost savings of £5.5 to £8.2 million ($7.3–$10.9 million) and health gains >2600 quality-adjusted life-years could be achieved from reinstating AP in England.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>AP is cost-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive for preventing IE, particularly in those at high risk. These findings support the cost-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>iveness of guidelines recommending AP use in high-risk individuals.</p></sec>

Effect of Childhood Obesity Prevention Programs on Blood Pressure
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Childhood overweight and obesity are associated with elevated blood pressure (BP). However, little is known about how childhood obesity lifestyle prevention programs affect BP. We assessed the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of childhood obesity prevention programs on BP in children in developed countries.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We searched databases up to April 22, 2013, for relevant randomized, controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, and natural experiments. Studies were included if they applied a diet or physical activity intervention(s) and were followed for ≥1 year (or ≥6 months for school-based intervention studies); they were excluded if they targeted only overweight/obese subjects or those with a medical condition. In our meta-analysis, intervention <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s were calculated for systolic BP and diastolic BP with the use of weighted random-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s models. Of the 23 included intervention studies (involving 18 925 participants), 21 involved a school setting. Our meta-analysis included 19 studies reporting on systolic BP and 18 on diastolic BP. The pooled intervention <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> was −1.64 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, −2.56 to −0.71; <i>P</i>=0.001) for systolic BP and −1.44 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, −2.28 to −0.60; <i>P</i>=0.001) for diastolic BP. The combined diet and physical activity interventions led to a significantly greater reduction in both systolic BP and diastolic BP than the diet-only or physical activity–only intervention. Thirteen interventions (46%) had a similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> on both adiposity-related outcomes and BP, whereas 11 interventions (39%) showed a significant desirable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> on BP but not on adiposity-related outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Obesity prevention programs have a moderate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> on reducing BP, and those targeting both diet and physical activity seem to be more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive.</p></sec>

Potent Thrombolytic Effect of <i>N</i>-Acetylcysteine on Arterial Thrombi
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Platelet cross-linking during arterial thrombosis involves von Willebrand Factor (VWF) multimers. Therefore, proteolysis of VWF appears promising to disaggregate platelet-rich thrombi and restore vessel patency in acute thrombotic disorders such as ischemic stroke, acute coronary syndrome, or acute limb ischemia. <i>N</i>-Acetylcysteine (NAC, a clinically approved mucolytic drug) can reduce intrachain disulfide bonds in large polymeric proteins. In the present study, we postulated that NAC might cleave the VWF multimers inside occlusive thrombi, thereby leading to their dissolution and arterial recanalization.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Experimental models of thrombotic stroke induced by either intra-arterial thrombin injection or ferric chloride application followed by measurement of cerebral blood flow using a combination of laser Doppler flowmetry and MRI were performed to uncover the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of NAC on arterial thrombi. To investigate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of NAC on larger vessels, we also performed ferric chloride–induced carotid artery thrombosis. In vitro experiments were performed to study the molecular bases of NAC thrombolytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>, including platelet aggregometry, platelet-rich thrombi lysis assays, thromboelastography (ROTEM), and high-shear VWF string formation using microfluidic devices. We also investigated the putative prohemorrhagic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of NAC in a mouse model of intracranial hemorrhage induced by in situ collagenase type VII injection.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We demonstrated that intravenous NAC administration promotes lysis of arterial thrombi that are resistant to conventional approaches such as recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator, direct thrombin inhibitors, and antiplatelet treatments. Through in vitro and in vivo experiments, we provide evidence that the molecular target underlying the thrombolytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of NAC is principally the VWF that cross-link platelets in arterial thrombi. Coadministration of NAC and a nonpeptidic GpIIb/IIIa inhibitor further improved its thrombolytic efficacy, essentially by accelerating thrombus dissolution and preventing rethrombosis. Thus, in a new large-vessel thromboembolic stroke model in mice, this cotreatment significantly improved ischemic lesion size and neurological outcome. It is important to note that NAC did not worsen hemorrhagic stroke outcome, suggesting that it exerts thrombolytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s without significantly impairing normal hemostasis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We provide evidence that NAC is an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive and safe alternative to currently available antithrombotic agents to restore vessel patency after arterial occlusion.</p></sec>

Interferon Regulatory Factor 4 Inhibits Neointima Formation by Engaging Krüppel-Like Factor 4 Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The mechanisms underlying neointima formation remain unclear. Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), which are key innate immune regulators, play important roles in cardiometabolic diseases. However, the function of IRF4 in arterial restenosis is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>IRF4 expression was first detected in human and mouse restenotic arteries. Then, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of IRF4 on neointima formation were evaluated with universal IRF4-deficient mouse and rat carotid artery injury models. We performed immunostaining to identify IRF4-expressing cells in the lesions. Smooth muscle cell (SMC)–specific IRF4-knockout (KO) and -transgenic (TG) mice were generated to evaluate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of SMC-IRF4 on neointima formation. We used microarray, bioinformatics analysis, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay to identify the downstream signals of IRF4 and to verify the targets in vitro. We compared SMC-IRF4-KO/Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4)–TG mice with SMC-IRF4-KO mice and SMC-specific IRF4-TG/KLF4-KO mice with SMC-specific IRF4-TG mice to investigate whether the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of IRF4 on neointima formation is KLF4-dependent. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of IRF4 on SMC phenotype switching was also evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>IRF4 expression in both the human and mouse restenotic arteries is eventually downregulated. Universal IRF4 ablation potentiates neointima formation in both mice and rats. Immunostaining indicated that IRF4 was expressed primarily in SMCs in restenotic arteries. After injury, SMC-IRF4-KO mice developed a thicker neointima than control mice. This change was accompanied by increased SMC proliferation and migration. However, SMC-specific IRF4-TG mice exhibited the opposite phenotype, demonstrating that IRF4 exerts protective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s against neointima formation. The mechanistic study indicated that IRF4 promotes KLF4 expression by directly binding to its promoter. Genetic overexpression of KLF4 in SMCs largely reversed the neointima-promoting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of IRF4 ablation, whereas ablation of KLF4 abolished the protective function of IRF4, indicating that the protective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of IRF4 against neointima formation are KLF4-dependent. In addition, IRF4 promoted SMC dedifferentiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>IRF4 protects arteries against neointima formation by promoting the expression of KLF4 by directly binding to its promoter. Our findings suggest that this previously undiscovered IRF4-KLF4 axis plays a key role in vasculoproliferative pathology and may be a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of arterial restenosis.</p></sec>

Reproduction-related variation in carbon allocation to woody tissues in <i>Fagus crenata</i> using a natural <sup>13</sup>C approach
<p>The contribution of new photo-assimilates and stored carbon (C) to plant growth remains poorly understood, especially during reproduction. In order to elucidate how mast seeding affects C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation to both reproductive and vegetative tissues, we measured biomass increase in each tissue, branch starch concentration and stable C isotope composition (δ<sup>13</sup>C) in bulk leaves, current-year shoots, 3-year branches and tree rings in fruiting and non-fruiting trees for 2 years, as well as in fruits. We isolated the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of reproduction on C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation to vegetative growth by comparing <sup>13</sup>C enrichment in woody tissues in fruiting and non-fruiting specimens. Compared with 2‰ <sup>13</sup>C enrichment in shoots relative to leaves from non-fruiting trees, fruiting reduced the enrichment to 1‰ and this reduction disappeared in the following year with no fruiting, indicating that new photo-assimilates are preferentially used for woody tissues even with fruiting burden. In contrast, fruits had up to 2.5‰ <sup>13</sup>C enrichment at mid-summer, which dropped thereafter, indicating that fruit production relies on C storage early in the growing season then shifts to current photo-assimilates. At this tipping point, growth of shoots and cupules had almost finished and nuts had a second rapid growth period thereafter. Together with shorter shoots but higher biomass increment per length in fruiting trees than non-fruiting trees, these results indicate that the C limitation due to fruit burden is minimized by fine-tuning of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation of old C stores and new photo-assimilates, along with the growth pattern in various tissues. Furthermore, fruiting had no significant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> on starch concentration in 3-year-old branches, which became fully depleted during leaf and flower flushing but were quickly replenished. These results indicate that reproduction affects C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation to branches but not its source or storage. These reproduction-related variations in the fate of C have implications for evaluating forest ecosystem C cycles during climate change.</p>

Cardioprotective Role of Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells in Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a heterogeneous population of cells that expand in cancer, inflammation, and infection and negatively regulate inflammation and the immune response. Heart failure (HF) is a complex clinical syndrome wherein inflammation induction and incomplete resolution can potentially contribute to HF development and progression. However, the role of MDSCs in HF remains unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The percentage of MDSCs in patients with HF and in mice with pressure overload–induced HF using isoproterenol infusion or transverse aortic constriction (TAC) was detected by flow cytometry.

Furthermore, MDSCs derived from patients with HF inhibited T-cell proliferation and interferon-γ secretion. Similar results were observed in TAC- and isoproterenol-induced HF in mice. Pharmaceutical depletion of MDSCs significantly exacerbated isoproterenol- and TAC-induced pathological cardiac remodeling and inflammation, whereas adoptive transfer of MDSCs prominently rescued isoproterenol- and TAC-induced HF.

Effect of Losartan on Right Ventricular Dysfunction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of angiotensin II receptor blockers on right ventricular (RV) function is still unknown. Angiotensin II receptor blockers are beneficial in patients with acquired left ventricular dysfunction, and recent findings have suggested a favorable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> in symptomatic patients with systemic RV dysfunction. The current study aimed to determine the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of losartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker, on subpulmonary RV dysfunction in adults after repaired tetralogy of Fallot.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The REDEFINE trial (Right Ventricular Dysfunction in Tetralogy of Fallot: Inhibition of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System) is an investigator-initiated, multicenter, prospective, 1:1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Adults with repaired tetralogy of Fallot and RV dysfunction (RV ejection fraction [EF] <50%) but without severe valvular dysfunction were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned between losartan (150 mg daily) and placebo with target treatment duration between 18 and 24 months. The primary outcome was RV EF change, determined by cardiovascular MRI in intention-to-treat analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 95 included patients, 47 patients received 150 mg losartan daily (age, 38.0±12.4 years; 74% male), and 48 patients received placebo (age, 40.6±11.4 years; 63% male). Overall, RV EF did not change in patients <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ated to losartan (n=42) (44.4±5.1% to 45.2±5.0%) and placebo (n=46) (43.2±6.3% to 43.6±6.9%). Losartan did not significantly improve RV EF in comparison with placebo (+0.51%; 95% confidence interval, –1.0 to +2.0; <i>P</i>=0.50). No significant treatment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s were found on secondary outcomes: left ventricular EF, peak aerobic exercise capacity, and N-terminal pro–brain natriuretic peptide (<i>P</i>>0.30 for all). In predefined subgroup analyses, losartan did not have a statistically significant impact on RV EF in subgroups with symptoms, restrictive RV, RV EF<40%, pulmonary valve replacement, or QRS fragmentation. However, in a post hoc analysis, losartan was associated with improved RV EF in a subgroup (n=30) with nonrestrictive RV and incomplete remodeling (QRS fragmentation and previous pulmonary valve replacement) (+2.7%; 95% confidence interval, +0.1 to +5.4; <i>P</i>=0.045).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Losartan had no significant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> on RV dysfunction or secondary outcome parameters in repaired tetralogy of Fallot.

An empirical study of the wound effect on sap flux density measured with thermal dissipation probes
<p>The insertion of thermal dissipation (TD) sensors on tree stems for sap flux density (SFD) measurements can lead to SFD underestimations due to a wound formation close to the drill hole. However, the wound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> has not been assessed experimentally for this method yet. Here, we propose an empirical approach to investigate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of the wound healing on measured sap flux with TD probes. The approach was performed for both, diffuse-porous (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i> (Linnaeus)) and ring-porous (<i>Quercus petraea</i> (Lieblein)) species. Thermal dissipation probes were installed on different dates along the growing season to document the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of the dynamic wound formation. The trees were cut in autumn and additional sensors were installed in the cut stems, therefore, without potential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of wound development. A range of water pressures was applied to the stem segments and SFDs were simultaneously measured by TD sensors as well as gravimetrically in the laboratory. The formation of wounds around sensors installed in living tree stems led to underestimation of SFD by 21.4 ± 3 and 47.5 ± 3.8% in beech and oak, respectively. The differences between SFD underestimations of diffuse-porous beech and ring-porous oak were, however, not statistically significant. Sensors with 5-, 11- and 22-week-old wounds also showed no significant differences, which implies that the influence of wound formation on SFD estimates was completed within the first few weeks after perforation. These results were confirmed by time courses of SFD measurements in the field. Field SFD values decreased immediately after sensor installation and reached stable values after ~2 weeks with similar underestimations to the ones observed in the laboratory. We therefore propose a feasible approach to correct directly field observations of SFD for potential underestimations due to the wound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>.</p>

Cell structural changes in the mesophyll of Norway spruce needles by elevated ozone and elevated temperature in open-field exposure during cold acclimation
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of elevated ozone (1.4× ambient) and temperature (ambient +1.3 °C) alone and in combination were studied on the needle cell structure of soil-grown Norway spruce seedlings in the late growing season and winter. Temperature treatment continued over winter and lengthened the snow-free period. Elevated temperature caused microscopic changes related to photosynthesis (decreased chloroplast size and increased number), carbon storage (reduced starch and increased cytoplasmic lipids) and defence (decreased mitochondrial size and proportion per cytoplasm, increased peroxisomes and plastoglobuli, altered appearance of tannins). The results suggest increased oxidative stress by elevated temperature and altered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation of limited carbon reserve to defence. The number of peroxisomes and plastoglobuli remained high in the outer cells of needles of ozone-exposed seedlings but decreased in the inner cells. This may indicate defence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation to cells close to the stomata and surface, which are experiencing more oxidative stress. Ozone reduced winter hardiness based on seasonal changes in chloroplast shape and location in the cells. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of ozone became evident at the end of the growing season, indicating the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of cumulative ozone dose or that the seedlings were vulnerable to ozone at the later phases of winter hardening. Elevated temperature increased cellular damage in early winter and visible damage in spring, and the damage was enhanced by ozone. In conclusion, the study suggests that modest air temperature elevation increases stress at the cell structural level in spruce seedlings and is enhanced by low ozone elevation. Future climatic conditions where snow cover is formed later or is lacking but temperatures are low can increase the risk of severe seedling damage, and current and future predicted ozone concentrations increase this risk.</p>

Aerosol-driven droplet concentrations dominate coverage and water of oceanic low-level clouds
<p>A lack of reliable estimates of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) aerosols over oceans has severely limited our ability to quantify their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s on cloud properties and extent of cooling by reflecting solar radiation—a key uncertainty in anthropogenic climate forcing. We introduce a methodology for ascribing cloud properties to CCN and isolating the aerosol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s from meteorological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s. Its application showed that for a given meteorology, CCN explains three-fourths of the variability in the radiative cooling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of clouds, mainly through affecting shallow cloud cover and water path. This reveals a much greater sensitivity of cloud radiative forcing to CCN than previously reported, which means too much cooling if incorporated into present climate models. This suggests the existence of compensating aerosol warming <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s yet to be discovered, possibly through deep clouds.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Leaf Amino Acid Supply Affects Photosynthetic and Plant Nitrogen Use Efficiency under Nitrogen Stress
<p>The coordinated distribution of nitrogen to source leaves and sinks is essential for supporting leaf metabolism while also supplying sufficient nitrogen to seeds for development. This study aimed to understand how regulated amino acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation to leaves affects photosynthesis and overall plant nitrogen use efficiency in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and how soil nitrogen availability influences these processes. Arabidopsis plants with a knockout of <i>AAP2</i>, encoding an amino acid permease involved in xylem-to-phloem transfer of root-derived amino acids, were grown in low-, moderate-, and high-nitrogen environments. We analyzed nitrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation to shoot tissues, photosynthesis, and photosynthetic and plant nitrogen use efficiency in these knockout plants. Our results demonstrate that, independent of nitrogen conditions, <i>aap2</i> plants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ate more nitrogen to leaves than wild-type plants. Increased leaf nitrogen supply positively affected chlorophyll and Rubisco levels, photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency, and carbon assimilation and transport to sinks. The <i>aap2</i> plants outperformed wild-type plants with respect to growth, seed yield and carbon storage pools, and nitrogen use efficiency in both high and deficient nitrogen environments. Overall, this study demonstrates that increasing nitrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation to leaves represents an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive strategy for improving carbon fixation and photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency. The results indicate that an optimized coordination of nitrogen and carbon partitioning processes is critical for high oilseed production in Arabidopsis, including in plants exposed to limiting nitrogen conditions.</p>

A Novel α-Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide Analogue Protects Against End-Organ Damage in Experimental Hypertension, Cardiac Hypertrophy, and Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Research into the therapeutic potential of α-calcitonin gene–related peptide (α-CGRP) has been limited because of its peptide nature and short half-life. Here, we evaluate whether a novel potent and long-lasting (<i>t</i><sub>½</sub> ≥7 hours) acylated α-CGRP analogue (αAnalogue) could alleviate and reverse cardiovascular disease in 2 distinct murine models of hypertension and heart failure in vivo.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The ability of the αAnalogue to act selectively via the CGRP pathway was shown in skin by using a CGRP receptor antagonist. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of the αAnalogue on angiotensin II–induced hypertension was investigated over 14 days. Blood pressure was measured by radiotelemetry. The ability of the αAnalogue to modulate heart failure was studied in an abdominal aortic constriction model of murine cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure over 5 weeks. Extensive ex vivo analysis was performed via RNA analysis, Western blot, and histology.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The angiotensin II–induced hypertension was attenuated by cotreatment with the αAnalogue (50 nmol·kg<sup>–1</sup>·d<sup>–1</sup>, SC, at a dose selected for lack of long-term hypotensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s at baseline). The αAnalogue protected against vascular, renal, and cardiac dysfunction, characterized by reduced hypertrophy and biomarkers of fibrosis, remodeling, inflammation, and oxidative stress. In a separate study, the αAnalogue reversed angiotensin II–induced hypertension and associated vascular and cardiac damage. The αAnalogue was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive over 5 weeks in a murine model of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. It preserved heart function, assessed by echocardiography, while protecting against adverse cardiac remodeling and apoptosis. Moreover, treatment with the αAnalogue was well tolerated with neither signs of desensitization nor behavioral changes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These findings, in 2 distinct models, provide the first evidence for the therapeutic potential of a stabilized αAnalogue, by mediating (1) antihypertensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s, (2) attenuating cardiac remodeling, and (3) increasing angiogenesis and cell survival to protect against and limit damage associated with the progression of cardiovascular diseases.

Prospective Study of Adenosine on Atrioventricular Nodal Conduction in Pediatric and Young Adult Patients After Heart Transplantation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Supraventricular tachycardia is common after heart transplantation. Adenosine, the standard therapy for treating supraventricular tachycardia in children and adults without transplantation, is relatively contraindicated after transplantation because of a presumed risk of prolonged atrioventricular block in denervated hearts.

Low-Dose Paclitaxel–Coated Versus Uncoated Percutaneous Transluminal Balloon Angioplasty for Femoropopliteal Peripheral Artery Disease

High-Fiber Diet and Acetate Supplementation Change the Gut Microbiota and Prevent the Development of Hypertension and Heart Failure in Hypertensive Mice
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Dietary intake of fruit and vegetables is associated with lower incidence of hypertension, but the mechanisms involved have not been elucidated. Here, we evaluated the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of a high-fiber diet and supplementation with the short-chain fatty acid acetate on the gut microbiota and the prevention of cardiovascular disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Gut microbiome, cardiorenal structure/function, and blood pressure were examined in sham and mineralocorticoid excess–treated mice with a control diet, high-fiber diet, or acetate supplementation. We also determined the renal and cardiac transcriptome of mice treated with the different diets.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We found that high consumption of fiber modified the gut microbiota populations and increased the abundance of acetate-producing bacteria independently of mineralocorticoid excess. Both fiber and acetate decreased gut dysbiosis, measured by the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes, and increased the prevalence of <i>Bacteroides acidifaciens</i>. Compared with mineralocorticoid-excess mice fed a control diet, both high-fiber diet and acetate supplementation significantly reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressures, cardiac fibrosis, and left ventricular hypertrophy. Acetate had similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s and markedly reduced renal fibrosis.

Protective Effects of Ticagrelor on Myocardial Injury After Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor antagonist ticagrelor has been shown to be clinically superior to clopidogrel. Although the underlying mechanisms remain elusive, ticagrelor may exert off-target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s through adenosine-related mechanisms. We aimed to investigate whether ticagrelor reduces myocardial injury to a greater extent than clopidogrel after myocardial infarction (MI) at a similar level of platelet inhibition and to determine the underlying mechanisms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Pigs received the following before MI induction: (1) placebo-control; (2) a loading dose of clopidogrel (600 mg); (3) a loading dose of ticagrelor (180 mg); or (4) a loading dose of ticagrelor followed by an adenosine A1/A2-receptor antagonist [8-(<i>p</i>-sulfophenyl)theophylline, 4 mg/kg intravenous] to determine the potential contribution of adenosine in ticagrelor-related cardioprotection. Animals received the corresponding maintenance doses of the antiplatelet agents during the following 24 hours and underwent 3T-cardiac MRI analysis. Platelet inhibition was monitored by ADP-induced platelet aggregation. In the myocardium, we assessed the expression and activation of proteins known to modulate edema formation, including aquaporin-4 and AMP-activated protein kinase and its downstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ors CD36 and endothelial nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Clopidogrel and ticagrelor exerted a high and consistent antiplatelet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> (68.2% and 62.2% of platelet inhibition, respectively, on challenge with 20 μmol/L ADP) that persisted up to 24 hours post-MI (<i>P</i><0.05). All groups showed comparable myocardial area-at-risk and cardiac worsening after MI induction. 3T-Cardiac MRI analysis revealed that clopidogrel- and ticagrelor-treated animals had a significantly smaller extent of MI than placebo-control animals (15.7 g left ventricle and 12.0 g left ventricle versus 22.8 g left ventricle, respectively). Yet, ticagrelor reduced infarct size to a significantly greater extent than clopidogrel (further 23.5% reduction; <i>P</i>=0.0026), an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> supported by troponin-I assessment and histopathologic analysis (<i>P</i>=0.0021). Furthermore, in comparison with clopidogrel, ticagrelor significantly diminished myocardial edema by 24.5% (<i>P</i>=0.004), which correlated with infarct mass (<i>r</i>=0.73; <i>P</i><0.001). 8-(<i>p</i>-Sulfophenyl)theophylline administration abolished the cardioprotective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of ticagrelor over clopidogrel. At a molecular level, aquaporin-4 expression decreased and the expression and activation of AMP-activated protein kinase signaling and cyclooxygenase-2 increased in the ischemic myocardium of ticagrelor- versus clopidogrel-treated animals (<i>P</i><0.05). These protein changes were not observed in those animals administered the adenosine receptor blocker 8-(<i>p</i>-sulfophenyl)theophylline.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Ticagrelor, beyond its antiplatelet efficacy, exerts cardioprotective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s by reducing necrotic injury and edema formation via adenosine-dependent mechanisms.</p></sec>

Acclimation of <i>Betula alleghaniensis</i> Britton to moderate soil water deficit: small morphological changes make for important consequences in crown display

We carried out an integrated examination of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation of biomass, leaf physiology, branching pattern and in situ 3D crown display. Potted seedlings were subjected to moderate soil water deficit for four consecutive months during their second growing season. Individuals under soil water deficit showed a 40% decrease in biomass accumulation but no change in the relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation of biomass to the different plant compartments. Net CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rates at leaf level decreased under water deficit (~15%) but could not alone explain the total reduction in growth, excluding the carbon starvation hypothesis. The observed reduction in net CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rates was related to a decrease in stomatal conductance and chlorophyll content. <i>STAR</i><sub>zen</sub> (in situ silhouette to total leaf area ratio; a proxy for light interception efficiency) decreased under soil water deficit due to shifts in biomass <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation within the branch compartment from long upper axes to short bottom axes. Despite the fact that the understanding of the processes involved in growth reduction and branching pattern alteration will need more attention in future research, we conclude that under water deficit yellow birch at young stages will: (i) experience a substantial loss of growth and biomass; and (ii) acclimate through architectural plasticity rather than through changes in the relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation of root biomass to enhance its water management.</p>

Combined effects of defoliation and water stress on pine growth and non-structural carbohydrates
<p>Climate change is expected to increase both pest insect damage and the occurrence of severe drought. There is therefore a need to better understand the combined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of biotic and abiotic damage on tree growth in order to predict the multi-factorial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of climate change on forest ecosystem productivity. Indeed, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of stress interactions on tree growth is an increasingly important topic that greatly lacks experiments and data, and it is unlikely that the impact of combined stresses can be extrapolated from the outcomes of studies that focused on a single stress. We developed an original manipulative study under real field conditions where we applied artificial defoliation and induced water stress on 10-year-old (∼10 m high) maritime pine trees (<i>Pinus pinaster</i> Ait.). Tree response to combined stresses was quantitatively assessed following tree secondary growth and carbohydrate pools. Such a design allowed us to address the crucial question of combined stresses on trees under stand conditions, sharing soil supplies with neighboring trees. Our initial hypotheses were that (i) moderate defoliation can limit the impact of water stress on tree growth through reduced transpiration demand by a tree canopy partly defoliated and that (ii) defoliation results in reduced non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) pools, affecting tree tolerance to drought. Our results showed additive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of defoliation and water stress on tree growth and contradict our initial hypothesis. Indeed, under stand conditions, we found that partial defoliation does not limit the impact of water stress through reduced transpiration. Our study also highlighted that, even if NSC in all organs were affected by defoliation, tree response to water stress was not triggered. We found that stem NSC were maintained or increased during the entire growing season, supporting literature-based hypotheses such as an active maintenance of the hydraulic system or another limiting resource for tree growth under defoliation. We also observed a significant decrease in root carbohydrates, which suggests a shift in the root carbon balance under defoliation. The decrease in carbohydrate supply under defoliation may not counterbalance the carbon use for mineral and water uptakes or a translocation to other tissues.</p>

Simulated browsing affects leaf shedding phenology and litter quality of oak and birch saplings
<p>Herbivore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s on leaf litter can have a strong impact on ecosystem nutrient cycling. Although such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s are well described for insect herbivory, research on the impacts of browsing by mammalian herbivores on leaf litter dynamics and nutrient cycling has been more limited, particularly at the level of the individual plant. Clipping treatments (66% shoot removal twice, plus unclipped) were applied to analyse the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of browsing on the phenology (start date and pattern of leaf shedding) and leaf litter quality (nitrogen (N), soluble sugars, starch and total non-structural carbohydrate concentrations, plus C : N ratios) of <i>Betula pubescens</i> Ehrh. and <i>Quercus petraea</i> [Matt.] Liebl. saplings. Clipping decreased leaf litter biomass and delayed leaf senescence and shedding, but did not change the phenological timing of litterfall between senescence and shedding. The quality of leaf litter of both species was increased by simulated browsing, through an increase in N and carbohydrate concentrations (mainly soluble sugars) and a decreased C : N ratio. This is the first evidence we are aware of that browsing may cause changes in leaf shedding phenology, delaying the process without altering its pattern. Our results also indicate that simulated browsing increases the quality of leaf litter. However, the potential positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of browsing on N cycling through litter quality may be offset by its negative impact on the amount of N shed per tree.</p>

Essential roles of AMPA receptor GluA1 phosphorylation and presynaptic HCN channels in fast-acting antidepressant responses of ketamine
<p>Although the molecular mechanism is not clear, the clinically tested drug ketamine has rapid antidepressant action that does not require the multiple weeks of treatment needed for other antidepressant drugs to have an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>. We showed that ketamine potentiated Schaffer collateral–CA1 cell excitatory synaptic transmission in hippocampal slice preparations from rodents and enhanced the phosphorylation of the GluA1 subunit on Ser<sup>845</sup> of the AMPA-type glutamate receptor in the hippocampal area CA1. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s persisted when γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors were pharmacologically blocked. Ketamine reduced behavioral despair in wild-type mice but had no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> in GluA1 S845A knock-in mutant mice. Presynaptic (CA3 pyramidal cell), but not postsynaptic (CA1 pyramidal cell), deletion of <i>N</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate (NMDA)–type glutamate receptors eliminated the ketamine-induced enhancement of excitatory synaptic transmission in hippocampal slices and the antidepressant actions of ketamine in mice. The synaptic and behavioral actions of ketamine were completely occluded by inhibition or deletion of the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide–gated channel 1 (HCN1). Our results implicate presynaptic NMDA receptor inhibition followed by reduced activity of presynaptic HCN1 channels, which would result in an increase in glutamate release and postsynaptic glutamate receptor activity, as a mechanism of ketamine action. These data provide a mechanism for changes in synaptic activity that could explain the fast-acting antidepressant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of this drug.</p>

Manifold roles of β-arrestins in GPCR signaling elucidated with siRNA and CRISPR/Cas9
<p>G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) use diverse mechanisms to regulate the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK1/2. β-Arrestins (βArr1/2) are ubiquitous inhibitors of G protein signaling, promoting GPCR desensitization and internalization and serving as scaffolds for ERK1/2 activation. Studies using CRISPR/Cas9 to delete βArr1/2 and G proteins have cast doubt on the role of β-arrestins in activating specific pools of ERK1/2. We compared the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of siRNA-mediated knockdown of βArr1/2 and reconstitution with βArr1/2 in three different parental and CRISPR-derived βArr1/2 knockout HEK293 cell pairs to assess the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of βArr1/2 deletion on ERK1/2 activation by four G<sub>s</sub>-coupled GPCRs. In all parental lines with all receptors, ERK1/2 stimulation was reduced by siRNAs specific for βArr2 or βArr1/2. In contrast, variable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s were observed with CRISPR-derived cell lines both between different lines and with activation of different receptors. For β<sub>2</sub> adrenergic receptors (β<sub>2</sub>ARs) and β<sub>1</sub>ARs, βArr1/2 deletion increased, decreased, or had no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> on isoproterenol-stimulated ERK1/2 activation in different CRISPR clones. ERK1/2 activation by the vasopressin V<sub>2</sub> and follicle-stimulating hormone receptors was reduced in these cells but was enhanced by reconstitution with βArr1/2. Loss of desensitization and receptor internalization in CRISPR βArr1/2 knockout cells caused β<sub>2</sub>AR-mediated stimulation of ERK1/2 to become more dependent on G proteins, which was reversed by reintroducing βArr1/2. These data suggest that βArr1/2 function as a regulatory hub, determining the balance between mechanistically different pathways that result in activation of ERK1/2, and caution against extrapolating results obtained from βArr1/2- or G protein–deleted cells to GPCR behavior in native systems.</p>

Inflammatory but not mitogenic contexts prime synovial fibroblasts for compensatory signaling responses to p38 inhibition
<p>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disorder that causes joint pain, swelling, and loss of function. Development of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive new drugs has proven challenging in part because of the complexities and interconnected nature of intracellular signaling networks that complicate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of pharmacological interventions. We characterized the kinase signaling pathways that are activated in RA and evaluated the multivariate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of targeted inhibitors. Synovial fluids from RA patients activated the kinase signaling pathways JAK, JNK, p38, and MEK in synovial fibroblasts (SFs), a stromal cell type that promotes RA progression. Kinase inhibitors enhanced signaling of “off-target” pathways in a manner dependent on stimulatory context. Inhibitors of p38, which have been widely explored in clinical trials for RA, resulted in undesirable increases in nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), JNK, and MEK signaling in SFs in inflammatory, but not mitogenic, contexts. This was mediated by the transcription factor CREB, which functions in part within a negative feedback loop in MAPK signaling. CREB activation was induced predominately by p38 in response to inflammatory stimuli, but by MEK in response to mitogenic stimuli; hence, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of drugs targeting p38 or MEK were markedly different in SFs cultured under mitogenic or inflammatory conditions. Together, these findings illustrate how stimulatory context can alter dominance in pathway cross-talk even for a fixed network topology, thereby providing a rationale for why p38 inhibitors deliver limited benefits in RA and demonstrating the need for careful consideration of p38-targeted drugs in inflammation-related disorders.</p>

The effect of partisanship and political advertising on close family ties
<p>Research on growing American political polarization and antipathy primarily studies public institutions and political processes, ignoring private <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s, including strained family ties. Using anonymized smartphone-location data and precinct-level voting, we show that Thanksgiving dinners attended by residents from opposing-party precincts were 30 to 50 minutes shorter than same-party dinners. This decline from a mean of 257 minutes survives extensive spatial and demographic controls. Reductions in the duration of Thanksgiving dinner in 2016 tripled for travelers from media markets with heavy political advertising—an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> not observed in 2015—implying a relationship to election-related behavior. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s appear asymmetric: Although fewer Democratic-precinct residents traveled in 2016 than in 2015, Republican-precinct residents shortened their Thanksgiving dinners by more minutes in response to political differences.

Flexo-photovoltaic effect
<p>It is highly desirable to discover photovoltaic mechanisms that enable enhanced efficiency of solar cells. Here we report that the bulk photovoltaic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>, which is free from the thermodynamic Shockley-Queisser limit but usually manifested only in noncentrosymmetric (piezoelectric or ferroelectric) materials, can be realized in any semiconductor, including silicon, by mediation of flexoelectric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>. We used either an atomic force microscope or a micrometer-scale indentation system to introduce strain gradients, thus creating very large photovoltaic currents from centrosymmetric single crystals of strontium titanate, titanium dioxide, and silicon. This strain gradient–induced bulk photovoltaic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>, which we call the flexo-photovoltaic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>, functions in the absence of a p-n junction.

Retrieval practice protects memory against acute stress

We aimed to determine whether a highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive learning technique could strengthen memory against the negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of stress. To bolster memory, we used retrieval practice, or the act of taking practice tests. Participants first learned stimuli by either restudying or engaging in retrieval practice. Twenty-four hours later, we induced stress in half of the participants and assessed subsequent memory performance. Participants who learned by restudying demonstrated the typical stress-related memory impairment, whereas those who learned by retrieval practice were immune to the deleterious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of stress. These results suggest that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of stress on memory retrieval may be contingent on the strength of the memory representations themselves.</p>

Genetics of Variable Disease Expression Conferred by Inverse Gene-For-Gene Interactions in the Wheat-<i>Parastagonospora nodorum</i> Pathosystem
<p>The wheat-<i>Parastagonospora nodorum</i> pathosystem involves the recognition of pathogen-secreted necrotrophic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ors (NEs) by corresponding wheat NE sensitivity genes. This inverse gene-for-gene recognition leads to necrotrophic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>or-triggered susceptibility and ultimately septoria nodorum blotch disease. Here, we used multiple pathogen isolates to individually evaluate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of the host gene-NE interactions <i>Tan spot necrosis1</i>-Stagonospora nodorum ToxinA (<i>Tsn1</i>-SnToxA), <i>Stagonospora nodorum necrosis1</i>-Stagonospora nodorum Toxin1 (<i>Snn1</i>-SnTox1), and <i>Stagonospora nodorum necrosis3-B genome homeolog1</i>-Stagonospora nodorum Toxin3 (<i>Snn3-B1</i>-SnTox3), alone and in various combinations, to determine the relative importance of these interactions in causing disease. Genetic analysis of a recombinant inbred wheat population inoculated separately with three <i>P. nodorum</i> isolates, all of which produce all three NEs, indicated that the <i>Tsn1</i>-SnToxA and <i>Snn3-B1</i>-SnTox3 interactions contributed to disease caused by all four isolates, but their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s varied and ranged from epistatic to additive. The <i>Snn1</i>-SnTox1 interaction was associated with increased disease for one isolate, but for other isolates, there was evidence that this interaction inhibited the expression of other host gene-NE interactions. RNA sequencing analysis in planta showed that <i>SnTox1</i> was differentially expressed between these three isolates after infection. Further analysis of NE gene-knockout isolates showed that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of some interactions could be masked or inhibited by other compatible interactions, and the regulation of this occurs at the level of NE gene transcription. Collectively, these results show that the inverse gene-for-gene interactions leading to necrotrophic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>or-triggered susceptibility in the wheat-<i>P. nodorum</i> pathosystem vary in their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s depending on the genetic backgrounds of the pathogen and host, and interplay among the interactions is complex and intricately regulated.</p>

Different Modes of Negative Regulation of Plant Immunity by Calmodulin-Related Genes
<p>Plant immune responses activated through the perception of microbe-associated molecular patterns, leading to pattern-triggered immunity, are tightly regulated. This results in low immune responses in the absence of pathogens and a rapid return to the resting state following an activation event. Here, we show that two <i>CALMODULIN-LIKE</i> genes, <i>CML46</i> and <i>CML47</i>, negatively regulate salicylic acid accumulation and immunity in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The double mutant <i>cml46 cml47</i> is highly resistant to the pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>maculicola</i> (<i>Pma</i>). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of <i>cml46 cml47</i> on <i>Pma</i> growth are genetically additive to that of <i>cbp60a</i>, a known negative regulator in the <i>CALMODULIN-BINDING PROTEIN60</i> (<i>CBP60</i>) family. Transcriptome profiling revealed the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of <i>cbp60a</i> and <i>cml46 cml47</i> on both common and separate sets of genes, with the majorities of these differentially expressed genes being <i>Pma</i> responsive. <i>CBP60g</i>, a positive regulator of immunity in the <i>CBP60</i> family, was found to be transcriptionally regulated by <i>CBP60a</i>, <i>CML46</i>, and <i>CML47</i>. Analysis of the flg22-induced mRNA levels of <i>CBP60g</i> in <i>cbp60a</i> and <i>cml46 cml47</i> revealed that <i>cml46 cml47</i> plants have higher induced expression while <i>cbp60a</i> plants retain elevated levels longer than wild-type plants. Assays for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of flg22 treatment on <i>Pma</i> growth showed that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> is stronger in <i>cml46 cml47</i> plants and lasts longer in <i>cbp60a</i> plants. Thus, the expression pattern of <i>CBP60g</i> is reflected in flg22-induced resistance to <i>Pma</i>.</p>

Epistasis and Pleiotropy Affect the Modularity of the Genotype–Phenotype Map of Cross-Resistance in HIV-1
<p>The genotype–phenotype (GP) map is a central concept in evolutionary biology as it describes the mapping of molecular genetic variation onto phenotypic trait variation. Our understanding of that mapping remains partial, especially when trying to link functional clustering of pleiotropic gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s with patterns of phenotypic trait co-variation. Only on rare occasions have studies been able to fully explore that link and tend to show poor correspondence between modular structures within the GP map and among phenotypes. By dissecting the structure of the GP map of the replicative capacity of HIV-1 in 15 drug environments, we provide a detailed view of that mapping from mutational pleiotropic variation to phenotypic co-variation, including epistatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of a set of amino-acid substitutions in the reverse transcriptase and protease genes. We show that epistasis increases the pleiotropic degree of single mutations and provides modularity to the GP map of drug resistance in HIV-1. Moreover, modules of epistatic pleiotropic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s within the GP map match the phenotypic modules of correlated replicative capacity among drug classes. Epistasis thus increases the evolvability of cross-resistance in HIV by providing more drug- and class-specific pleiotropic profiles to the main <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of the mutations. We discuss the implications for the evolution of cross-resistance in HIV.</p>

The Genotype–Phenotype Map of Yeast Complex Traits: Basic Parameters and the Role of Natural Selection
<p>Most phenotypic traits are controlled by many genes, but a global picture of the genotype–phenotype map (GPM) is lacking. For example, in no species do we know generally how many genes affect a trait and how large these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s are. It is also unclear to what extent GPMs are shaped by natural selection. Here we address these fundamental questions using the reverse genetic data of 220 morphological traits in 4,718 budding yeast strains, each of which lacks a nonessential gene. We show that 1) the proportion of genes affecting a trait varies from <1% to >30%, averaging 6%, 2) most traits are impacted by many more small-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> genes than large-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> genes, and 3) the mean <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of all nonessential genes on a trait decreases precipitously as the estimated importance of the trait to fitness increases. An analysis of 3,116 yeast gene expression traits in 754 gene-deletion strains reveals a similar pattern. These findings illustrate the power of genome-wide reverse genetics in genotype–phenotype mapping, uncover an enormous range of genetic complexity of phenotypic traits, and suggest that the GPM of cellular organisms has been shaped by natural selection for mutational robustness.</p>

Strong Epistatic Interactions within a Single Protein
<p>A central question in protein molecular evolution is whether an amino acid that occurs at a given site makes an independent contribution to fitness or whether its contribution depends on other amino acid sites in the protein sequence, a phenomenon known as intragenic epistasis. In the absence of intragenic epistasis, natural selection acts on a protein mutation independent of its genetic background, and the experimentally determined fitness for a mutation should be the same across all genetic backgrounds. We tested this hypothesis by using site-directed mutagenesis to introduce a well-characterized deleterious single amino acid substitution in 56 different hepatitis C virus NS3 protease variants. The catalytic efficiency of the mutated proteases was determined and compared with the corresponding wild-type protein. Fitness <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s ranged from lethality to significantly beneficial. Although primarily deleterious and lethal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s were observed (41 and 5 out of 56 tested variants, respectively), deleterious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s ranged from near neutral (−26.7% reduction of fitness) to near lethal (−98.5%). Our findings demonstrate that the introduced amino acid substitution has different fitness <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s in different protein variants and provide independent support for the relevant role of intragenic epistasis in protein evolution.</p>

Knowledge of the distribution of fitness <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s (DFE) of mutations is fundamental for understanding evolutionary dynamics, molecular-level genetic variation, complex genetic disease, the accumulation of deleterious mutations, and the molecular clock. We present comprehensive DFEs for point and codon mutants of the <i>Escherichia coli TEM-1</i> β-lactamase gene and missense mutations in the TEM-1 protein. These DFEs provide insight into the inherent benefits of the genetic code’s architecture, support for the hypothesis that mRNA stability dictates codon usage at the beginning of genes, an extensive framework for understanding protein mutational tolerance, and evidence that mutational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s on protein thermodynamic stability shape the DFE.

The role of light in mediating the effects of ocean acidification on coral calcification
<p>We tested the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of light and <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> on the calcification and survival of <i>Pocillopora damicornis</i> recruits settled from larvae released in southern Taiwan. In March 2011, recruits were incubated at 31, 41, 70, 122 and 226 μmol photons m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> under ambient (493 μatm) and high <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> (878 μatm). After 5 days, calcification was measured gravimetrically and survivorship estimated as the number of living recruits. Calcification was affected by the interaction of <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> with light, and at 493 μatm <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> the response to light intensity resembled a positive parabola. At 878 μatm <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub>, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of light on calcification differed from that observed at 493 μatm <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub>, with the result that there were large differences in calcification between 493 μatm and 878 μatm <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> at intermediate light intensities (<i>ca</i>. 70 μmol photons m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>), but similar rates of calcification at the highest and lowest light intensities. Survivorship was affected by light and <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub>, and was highest at 122 μmol photons m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> in both <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> treatments, but was unrelated to calcification. In June 2012 the experiment was repeated, and again the results suggested that exposure to high <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> decreased calcification of <i>P. damicornis</i> recruits at intermediate light intensities, but not at lower or higher intensities. Together, our findings demonstrate that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> on coral recruits can be light dependent, with inhibitory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of high <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> on calcification at intermediate light intensities that disappear at both higher and lower light intensities.</p>

Improving Assessment of Drug Safety Through Proteomics
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Early detection of adverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of novel therapies and understanding of their mechanisms could improve the safety and efficiency of drug development. We have retrospectively applied large-scale proteomics to blood samples from ILLUMINATE (Investigation of Lipid Level Management to Understand its Impact in Atherosclerotic Events), a trial of torcetrapib (a cholesterol ester transfer protein inhibitor), that involved 15 067 participants at high cardiovascular risk. ILLUMINATE was terminated at a median of 550 days because of significant absolute increases of 1.2% in cardiovascular events and 0.4% in mortality with torcetrapib. The aims of our analysis were to determine whether a proteomic analysis might reveal biological mechanisms responsible for these harmful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s and whether harmful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of torcetrapib could have been detected early in the ILLUMINATE trial with proteomics.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A nested case-control analysis of paired plasma samples at baseline and at 3 months was performed in 249 participants assigned to torcetrapib plus atorvastatin and 223 participants assigned to atorvastatin only. Within each treatment arm, cases with events were matched to controls 1:1. Main outcomes were a survey of 1129 proteins for discovery of biological pathways altered by torcetrapib and a 9-protein risk score validated to predict myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, or death.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Plasma concentrations of 200 proteins changed significantly with torcetrapib. Their pathway analysis revealed unexpected and widespread changes in immune and inflammatory functions, as well as changes in endocrine systems, including in aldosterone function and glycemic control. At baseline, 9-protein risk scores were similar in the 2 treatment arms and higher in participants with subsequent events. At 3 months, the absolute 9-protein derived risk increased in the torcetrapib plus atorvastatin arm compared with the atorvastatin-only arm by 1.08% (<i>P</i>=0.0004). Thirty-seven proteins changed in the direction of increased risk of 49 proteins previously associated with cardiovascular and mortality risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Heretofore unknown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of torcetrapib were revealed in immune and inflammatory functions. A protein-based risk score predicted harm from torcetrapib within just 3 months. A protein-based risk assessment embedded within a large proteomic survey may prove to be useful in the evaluation of therapies to prevent harm to patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Antiarrhythmic Drugs for Nonshockable-Turned-Shockable Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) commonly presents with nonshockable rhythms (asystole and pulseless electric activity). It is unknown whether antiarrhythmic drugs are safe and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive when nonshockable rhythms evolve to shockable rhythms (ventricular fibrillation/pulseless ventricular tachycardia [VF/VT]) during resuscitation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Adults with nontraumatic OHCA, vascular access, and VF/VT anytime after ≥1 shock(s) were prospectively randomized, double-blind, to receive amiodarone, lidocaine, or placebo by paramedics. Patients presenting with initial shock-refractory VF/VT were previously reported. The current study was a prespecified analysis in a separate cohort that initially presented with nonshockable OHCA and was randomized on subsequently developing shock-refractory VF/VT. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes included discharge functional status and adverse drug-related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 37 889 patients with OHCA, 3026 with initial VF/VT and 1063 with initial nonshockable-turned-shockable rhythms were treatment-eligible, were randomized, and received their assigned drug. Baseline characteristics among patients with nonshockable-turned-shockable rhythms were balanced across treatment arms, except that recipients of a placebo included fewer men and were less likely to receive bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Active-drug recipients in this cohort required fewer shocks, supplemental doses of their assigned drug, and ancillary antiarrhythmic drugs than recipients of a placebo (<i>P</i><0.05). In all, 16 (4.1%) amiodarone, 11 (3.1%) lidocaine, and 6 (1.9%) placebo-treated patients survived to hospital discharge (<i>P</i>=0.24). No significant interaction between treatment assignment and discharge survival occurred with the initiating OHCA rhythm (asystole, pulseless electric activity, or VF/VT). Survival in each of these categories was consistently higher with active drugs, although the trends were not statistically significant. Adjusted absolute differences (95% confidence interval) in survival from nonshockable-turned-shockable arrhythmias with amiodarone versus placebo were 2.3% (−0.3, 4.8), <i>P</i>=0.08, and for lidocaine versus placebo 1.2% (−1.1, 3.6), <i>P</i>=0.30. More than 50% of these survivors were functionally independent or required minimal assistance. Drug-related adverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s were infrequent.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Outcome from nonshockable-turned-shockable OHCA is poor but not invariably fatal. Although not statistically significant, point estimates for survival were greater after amiodarone or lidocaine than placebo, without increased risk of adverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s or disability and consistent with previously observed favorable trends from treatment of initial shock-refractory VF/VT with these drugs. Together the findings may signal a clinical benefit that invites further investigation.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Evaluating the Impact and Cost-Effectiveness of Statin Use Guidelines for Primary Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease and Stroke
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Statins are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive in the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guideline expands recommended statin use, but its cost-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>iveness has not been compared with other guidelines.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used the Cardiovascular Disease Policy Model to estimate the cost-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>iveness of the ACC/AHA guideline relative to current use, Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines, and universal statin use in all men 45 to 74 years of age and women 55 to 74 years of age over a 10-year horizon from 2016 to 2025. Sensitivity analyses varied costs, risks, and benefits. Main outcomes were incremental cost-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>iveness ratios and numbers needed to treat for 10 years per quality-adjusted life-year gained.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Each approach produces substantial benefits and net cost savings relative to the status quo. Full adherence to the Adult Treatment Panel III guideline would result in 8.8 million more statin users than the status quo, at a number needed to treat for 10 years per quality-adjusted life-year gained of 35. The ACC/AHA guideline would potentially result in up to 12.3 million more statin users than the Adult Treatment Panel III guideline, with a marginal number needed to treat for 10 years per quality-adjusted life-year gained of 68. Moderate-intensity statin use in all men 45 to 74 years of age and women 55 to 74 years of age would result in 28.9 million more statin users than the ACC/AHA guideline, with a marginal number needed to treat for 10 years per quality-adjusted life-year gained of 108. In all cases, benefits would be greater in men than women. Results vary moderately with different risk thresholds for instituting statins and statin toxicity estimates but depend greatly on the disutility caused by daily medication use (pill burden).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>At a population level, the ACC/AHA guideline for expanded statin use for primary prevention is projected to treat more people, to save more lives, and to cost less compared with Adult Treatment Panel III in both men and women. Whether individuals benefit from long-term statin use for primary prevention depends more on the disutility associated with pill burden than their degree of cardiovascular risk.</p></sec>

Mediterranean Diet Improves High-Density Lipoprotein Function in High-Cardiovascular-Risk Individuals
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The biological functions of high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) contribute to explaining the cardioprotective role of the lipoprotein beyond quantitative HDL cholesterol levels. A few small-scale interventions with a single antioxidant have improved some HDL functions. However, to date, no long-term, large-scale, randomized controlled trial has been conducted to assess the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of an antioxidant-rich dietary pattern (such as a traditional Mediterranean diet [TMD]) on HDL function in humans.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This study was performed in a random subsample of volunteers from the PREDIMED Study (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea; n=296) after a 1-year intervention. We compared the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of 2 TMDs, one enriched with virgin olive oil (TMD-VOO; n=100) and the other enriched with nuts (TMD-Nuts; n=100), with respect to a low-fat control diet (n=96). We assessed the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of both TMDs on the role of HDL particles on reverse cholesterol transport (cholesterol efflux capacity, HDL ability to esterify cholesterol, and cholesteryl ester transfer protein activity), HDL antioxidant properties (paraoxonase-1 arylesterase activity and total HDL antioxidant capacity on low-density lipoproteins), and HDL vasodilatory capacity (HDL ability to induce the release of nitric oxide in endothelial cells). We also studied the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of a TMD on several HDL quality-related characteristics (HDL particle oxidation, resistance against oxidative modification, main lipid and protein composition, and size distribution).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Both TMDs increased cholesterol efflux capacity relative to baseline (<i>P</i>=0.018 and <i>P</i>=0.013 for TMD-VOO and TMD-Nuts, respectively). The TMD-VOO intervention decreased cholesteryl ester transfer protein activity (relative to baseline, <i>P</i>=0.028) and increased HDL ability to esterify cholesterol, paraoxonase-1 arylesterase activity, and HDL vasodilatory capacity (relative to control, <i>P</i>=0.039, <i>P</i>=0.012, and <i>P</i>=0.026, respectively). Adherence to a TMD induced these beneficial changes by improving HDL oxidative status and composition. The 3 diets increased the percentage of large HDL particles (relative to baseline, <i>P</i><0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The TMD, especially when enriched with virgin olive oil, improved HDL atheroprotective functions in humans.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.controlled-trials.com</ext-link>.

Left Ventricular Dysfunction Switches Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Toward an Inflammatory Phenotype and Impairs Their Reparative Properties Via Toll-Like Receptor-4
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Little is known about the potentially unfavorable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) activation on the heart. MSCs can respond to tissue injury by anti- or proinflammatory activation. We aimed to study the potential negative interaction between left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) and MSC activation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We isolated MSCs from cardiac and subcutaneous fat tissues of mice with LVD 28 days after myocardial infarction or sham operation. To evaluate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of LVD on MSCs, we characterized cardiac MSCs and subcutaneous MSCs in vitro. Subsequently, we injected MSCs or saline into the infarcted myocardium of mice and evaluated LV remodeling and function 28 days after myocardial infarction. To test the hypothesis that toll-like receptor 4 (<i>TLR4</i>) mediates proinflammatory polarization of MSCs, we characterized cardiac MSCs from <i>TLR4</i><sup>-/-</sup> and wild-type (WT) mice after inflammatory stimulation in vitro. Next, we transplanted cardiac MSCs from <i>TLR4</i><sup>-/-</sup> and WT male mice into the infarcted myocardium of female WT mice and evaluated infarct size, MSC retention, inflammation, remodeling, and function after 7 days.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>LVD switched cardiac MSCs toward an inflammatory phenotype, with increased secretion of inflammatory cytokines as well as chemokines. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of LVD on subcutaneous MSCs was less remarkable. Although transplantation of cardiac MSCs and subcutaneous MSCs from LVD and sham hearts did not improve LV remodeling and function, cardiac MSCs from LVD exacerbated anterior wall thinning 28 days after myocardial infarction. The inflammatory polarization of cardiac MSCs by LVD was mediated by <i>TLR4</i>, as we found less secretion of inflammatory cytokines and higher secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines from activated cardiac MSCs of <i>TLR4</i>-deficient mice, compared with WT cardiac MSCs. Significantly, <i>TLR4</i> deficiency preserved the expression of CD47 (don’t eat me signal) on cardiac MSCs after both <i>TLR4</i> stimulation in vitro and transplantation into the infarcted heart. Compared with WT cardiac MSCs and saline, <i>TLR4</i> <sup>-/-</sup> cardiac MSCs survived in the cardiac tissue and maintained their reparative properties, reduced infarct size, increased scar thickness, and attenuated LV dilatation 7 days after myocardial infarction.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The environment of the failing and infarcted myocardium drives resident and transplanted MSCs toward a proinflammatory phenotype and restricts their survival and reparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s in a mechanism mediated by <i>TLR4</i>.</p></sec>

Cardiovascular Consequences of Childhood Secondhand Tobacco Smoke Exposure: Prevailing Evidence, Burden, and Racial and Socioeconomic Disparities: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although public health programs have led to a substantial decrease in the prevalence of tobacco smoking, the adverse health <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of tobacco smoke exposure are by no means a thing of the past. In the United States, 4 of 10 school-aged children and 1 of 3 adolescents are involuntarily exposed to secondhand tobacco smoke (SHS), with children of minority ethnic backgrounds and those living in low-socioeconomic-status households being disproportionately affected (68% and 43%, respectively). Children are particularly vulnerable, with little control over home and social environment, and lack the understanding, agency, and ability to avoid SHS exposure on their own volition; they also have physiological or behavioral characteristics that render them especially susceptible to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of SHS. Side-stream smoke (the smoke emanating from the burning end of the cigarette), a major component of SHS, contains a higher concentration of some toxins than mainstream smoke (inhaled by the smoker directly), making SHS potentially as dangerous as or even more dangerous than direct smoking. Compelling animal and human evidence shows that SHS exposure during childhood is detrimental to arterial function and structure, resulting in premature atherosclerosis and its cardiovascular consequences. Childhood SHS exposure is also related to impaired cardiac autonomic function and changes in heart rate variability. In addition, childhood SHS exposure is associated with clustering of cardiometabolic risk factors such as obesity, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance. Individualized interventions to reduce childhood exposure to SHS are shown to be at least modestly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive, as are broader-based policy initiatives such as community smoking bans and increased taxation.</p></sec><sec><title>Purpose:</title><p>The purpose of this statement is to summarize the available evidence on the cardiovascular health consequences of childhood SHS exposure; this will support ongoing efforts to further reduce and eliminate SHS exposure in this vulnerable population. This statement reviews relevant data from epidemiological studies, laboratory-based experiments, and controlled behavioral trials concerning SHS and cardiovascular disease risk in children. Information on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of SHS exposure on the cardiovascular system in animal and pediatric studies, including vascular disruption and platelet activation, oxidation and inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, increased vascular stiffness, changes in vascular structure, and autonomic dysfunction, is examined.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The epidemiological, observational, and experimental evidence accumulated to date demonstrates the detrimental cardiovascular consequences of SHS exposure in children.</p></sec><sec><title>Implications:</title><p>Increased awareness of the adverse, lifetime cardiovascular consequences of childhood SHS may facilitate the development of innovative individual, family-centered, and community health interventions to reduce and ideally eliminate SHS exposure in the vulnerable pediatric population. This evidence calls for a robust public health policy that embraces zero tolerance of childhood SHS exposure.</p></sec>

Outcome of the Swedish Nationwide Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Screening Program
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>A general abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening program, targeting 65-year-old men, has gradually been introduced in Sweden since 2006 and reached nationwide coverage in 2015. The aim of this study was to determine the outcome of this program.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data on the number of invited and examined men, screening-detected AAAs, AAAs operated on, and surgical outcome were retrieved from all 21 Swedish counties for the years 2006 through 2014. AAA-specific mortality data were retrieved from the Swedish Cause of Death Registry. A linear regression analysis was used to estimate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> on AAA-specific mortality among all men ≥65 years of age for the observed time period. The long-term <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s were projected by using a validated Markov model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 302 957 men aged 65 years invited, 84% attended. The prevalence of screening-detected AAA was 1.5%. After a mean of 4.5 years, 29% of patients with AAA had been operated on, with a 30-day mortality rate of 0.9% (1.3% after open repair and 0.3% after endovascular repair, <i>P</i><0.001). The introduction of screening was associated with a significant reduction in AAA-specific mortality (mean, 4.0% per year of screening, <i>P</i>=0.020). The number needed to screen and the number needed to operate on to prevent 1 premature death were 667 and 1.5, respectively. With a total population of 9.5 million, the Swedish national AAA-screening program was predicted to annually prevent 90 premature deaths from AAA and to gain 577 quality-adjusted life-years. The incremental cost-efficiency ratio was estimated to be €7770 per quality-adjusted life-years.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Screening 65-year-old men for AAA is an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive preventive health measure and is highly cost-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive in a contemporary setting.

Existence, Functional Impairment, and Lung Repair Potential of Endothelial Colony-Forming Cells in Oxygen-Induced Arrested Alveolar Growth
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Bronchopulmonary dysplasia and emphysema are life-threatening diseases resulting from impaired alveolar development or alveolar destruction. Both conditions lack <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive therapies. Angiogenic growth factors promote alveolar growth and contribute to alveolar maintenance. Endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) represent a subset of circulating and resident endothelial cells capable of self-renewal and de novo vessel formation. We hypothesized that resident ECFCs exist in the developing lung, that they are impaired during arrested alveolar growth in experimental bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and that exogenous ECFCs restore disrupted alveolar growth.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Human fetal and neonatal rat lungs contain ECFCs with robust proliferative potential, secondary colony formation on replating, and de novo blood vessel formation in vivo when transplanted into immunodeficient mice. In contrast, human fetal lung ECFCs exposed to hyperoxia in vitro and neonatal rat ECFCs isolated from hyperoxic alveolar growth–arrested rat lungs mimicking bronchopulmonary dysplasia proliferated less, showed decreased clonogenic capacity, and formed fewer capillary-like networks. Intrajugular administration of human cord blood–derived ECFCs after established arrested alveolar growth restored lung function, alveolar and lung vascular growth, and attenuated pulmonary hypertension. Lung ECFC colony- and capillary-like network-forming capabilities were also restored. Low ECFC engraftment and the protective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of cell-free ECFC-derived conditioned media suggest a paracrine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>.

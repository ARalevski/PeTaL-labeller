An empirical study of the wound effect on sap flux density measured with thermal dissipation probes
<p>The insertion of thermal dissipation (TD) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong>s on tree stems for sap flux density (SFD) measurements can lead to SFD underestimations due to a wound formation close to the drill hole. However, the wound effect has not been assessed experimentally for this method yet. Here, we propose an empirical approach to investigate the effect of the wound healing on measured sap flux with TD probes. The approach was performed for both, diffuse-porous (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i> (Linnaeus)) and ring-porous (<i>Quercus petraea</i> (Lieblein)) species. Thermal dissipation probes were installed on different dates along the growing season to document the effects of the dynamic wound formation. The trees were cut in autumn and additional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong>s were installed in the cut stems, therefore, without potential effects of wound development. A range of water pressures was applied to the stem segments and SFDs were simultaneously measured by TD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong>s as well as gravimetrically in the laboratory. The formation of wounds around <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong>s installed in living tree stems led to underestimation of SFD by 21.4 ± 3 and 47.5 ± 3.8% in beech and oak, respectively. The differences between SFD underestimations of diffuse-porous beech and ring-porous oak were, however, not statistically significant. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong>s with 5-, 11- and 22-week-old wounds also showed no significant differences, which implies that the influence of wound formation on SFD estimates was completed within the first few weeks after perforation. These results were confirmed by time courses of SFD measurements in the field. Field SFD values decreased immediately after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong> installation and reached stable values after ~2 weeks with similar underestimations to the ones observed in the laboratory. We therefore propose a feasible approach to correct directly field observations of SFD for potential underestimations due to the wound effect.</p>

cAMPr: A single-wavelength fluorescent sensor for cyclic AMP
<p>Genetically encoded fluorescent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong>s enable cell-specific measurements of ions and small molecules in real time. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is one of the most important signaling molecules in virtually all cell types and organisms. We describe cAMPr, a new single-wavelength cAMP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong>. We developed cAMPr in bacteria and embryonic stem cells and validated the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong> in mammalian neurons in vitro and in <i>Drosophila</i> circadian pacemaker neurons in intact brains. Comparison with other single-wavelength cAMP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong>s showed that cAMPr improved the quantitative detection of cAMP abundance. In addition, cAMPr is compatible with both single-photon and two-photon imaging. This enabled us to use cAMPr together with the red fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong> RCaMP1h to simultaneously monitor Ca<sup>2+</sup> and cAMP in <i>Drosophila</i> brains. Thus, cAMPr is a new and versatile genetically encoded cAMP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong>.</p>

Mechanism of transmembrane signaling by sensor histidine kinases
<p>One of the major and essential classes of transmembrane (TM) receptors, present in all domains of life, is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong> histidine kinases, parts of two-component signaling systems (TCSs). The structural mechanisms of TM signaling by these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong>s are poorly understood. We present crystal structures of the periplasmic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong> domain, the TM domain, and the cytoplasmic HAMP domain of the <i>Escherichia coli</i> nitrate/nitrite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong> histidine kinase NarQ in the ligand-bound and mutated ligand-free states. The structures reveal that the ligand binding induces rearrangements and pistonlike shifts of TM helices. The HAMP domain protomers undergo leverlike motions and convert these pistonlike motions into helical rotations. Our findings provide the structural framework for complete understanding of TM TCS signaling and for development of antimicrobial treatments targeting TCSs.</p>

Measuring the ratio of CO<sub>2</sub> efflux to O<sub>2</sub> influx in tree stem respiration
<p>In recent studies, the ratio of tree stem CO<sub>2</sub> efflux to O<sub>2</sub> influx has been defined as the apparent respiratory quotient (ARQ). The metabolism of carbohydrates, the putative respiratory substrate in trees, is expected to yield an ARQ of 1.0. However, previous studies have reported ARQ values ranging between 0.23 and 0.90. These interesting results may indicate internal transport of respired CO<sub>2</sub> within stems; yet no simple field applicable methods for ARQ measurement have been available. Here, we report on the assembly of a closed circulating system called ‘<i>Hampadah</i>’, which uses CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> analyzers to measure air samples from stem chambers. We tested the performance of the <i>Hampadah</i> with samples from 36 trees (<i>Tetragastris panamensis</i> (Engl.) Kuntze). Additionally, we showed the feasibility of measuring ARQ directly from stem chambers, using portable CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong>s, in both discrete and continuous modes of operation. The <i>Hampadah</i> measurement proved to be consistent with CO<sub>2</sub> gas standards (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.999) and with O<sub>2</sub> determined by O<sub>2</sub>/Ar measurements with a mass spectrometer (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.998). The <i>Hampadah</i> gave highly reproducible results for ARQ determination of field samples (±0.01 for duplicates). The portable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong>s measurement showed good correlation with the <i>Hampadah</i> in measuring CO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub> and ARQ (<i>n</i> = 5, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.97, 0.98 and 0.91, respectively). We have demonstrated here that the <i>Hampadah</i> and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong>s’ methods enable accurate ARQ measurements for both laboratory and field research.</p>

Intracellular cavity of sensor domain controls allosteric gating of TRPA1 channel
<p>Transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) is a temperature-sensitive ion channel activated by various pungent and irritant compounds that can produce pain in humans. Its activation involves an allosteric mechanism whereby electrophilic agonists evoke interactions within cytosolic domains and open the channel pore through an integrated nexus formed by intracellular membrane proximal regions that are densely packed beneath the lower segment of the S1–S4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong> domain. Studies indicate that this part of the channel may contain residues that form a water-accessible cavity that undergoes changes in solvation during channel gating. We identified conserved polar residues facing the putative lower crevice of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong> domain that were crucial determinants of the electrophilic, voltage, and calcium sensitivity of the TRPA1 channel. This part of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong> may also comprise a domain capable of binding to membrane phosphoinositides through which gating of the channel is regulated in a state-dependent manner.</p>

Structure of the cold- and menthol-sensing ion channel TRPM8
<p>Transient receptor potential melastatin (TRPM) cation channels are polymodal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong>s that are involved in a variety of physiological processes. Within the TRPM family, member 8 (TRPM8) is the primary cold and menthol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong> in humans. We determined the cryo–electron microscopy structure of the full-length TRPM8 from the collared flycatcher at an overall resolution of ~4.1 ångstroms. Our TRPM8 structure reveals a three-layered architecture. The amino-terminal domain with a fold distinct among known TRP structures, together with the carboxyl-terminal region, forms a large two-layered cytosolic ring that extensively interacts with the transmembrane channel layer. The structure suggests that the menthol-binding site is located within the voltage-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong>–like domain and thus provides a structural glimpse of the design principle of the molecular transducer for cold and menthol sensation.</p>

Genetic Obesity and the Risk of Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Observational studies have identified an association between body mass index (BMI) and incident atrial fibrillation (AF).

The apo-structure of the leucine sensor Sestrin2 is still elusive
<p>Sestrin2 is a GATOR2-interacting protein that directly binds leucine and is required for the inhibition of mTORC1 under leucine deprivation, indicating that it is a leucine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong> for the mTORC1 pathway. We recently reported the structure of Sestrin2 in complex with leucine [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID, 5DJ4] and demonstrated that mutations in the leucine-binding pocket that alter the affinity of Sestrin2 for leucine result in a corresponding change in the leucine sensitivity of mTORC1 in cells. A lower resolution structure of human Sestrin2 (PDB ID, 5CUF), which was crystallized in the absence of exogenous leucine, showed Sestrin2 to be in a nearly identical conformation as the leucine-bound structure. On the basis of this observation, it has been argued that leucine binding does not affect the conformation of Sestrin2 and that Sestrin2 may not be a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong> for leucine. We show that simple analysis of the reported “apo”-Sestrin2 structure reveals the clear presence of prominent, unmodeled electron density in the leucine-binding pocket that exactly accommodates the leucine observed in the higher resolution structure. Refining the reported apo-structure with leucine eliminated the large <i>F</i><sub>obs</sub>-<i>F</i><sub>calc</sub> difference density at this position and improved the working and free R factors of the model. Consistent with this result, our own structure of Sestrin2 crystallized in the absence of exogenous leucine also contained electron density that is best explained by leucine. Thus, the structure of apo-Sestrin2 remains elusive.</p>

Architecture of the complete oxygen-sensing FixL-FixJ two-component signal transduction system
<p>The symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacterium <i>Bradyrhizobium japonicum</i> is critical to the agro-industrial production of soybean because it enables the production of high yields of soybeans with little use of nitrogenous fertilizers. The FixL and FixJ two-component system (TCS) of this bacterium ensures that nitrogen fixation is only stimulated under conditions of low oxygen. When it is not bound to oxygen, the histidine kinase FixL undergoes autophosphorylation and transfers phosphate from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to the response regulator FixJ, which, in turn, stimulates the expression of genes required for nitrogen fixation. We purified full-length <i>B. japonicum</i> FixL and FixJ proteins and defined their structures individually and in complex using small-angle x-ray scattering, crystallographic, and in silico modeling techniques. Comparison of active and inactive forms of FixL suggests that intramolecular signal transduction is driven by local changes in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong> domain and in the coiled-coil region connecting the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong> and histidine kinase domains. We also found that FixJ exhibits conformational plasticity not only in the monomeric state but also in tetrameric complexes with FixL during phosphotransfer. This structural characterization of a complete TCS contributes both a mechanistic and evolutionary understanding to TCS signal relay, specifically in the context of the control of nitrogen fixation in root nodules.</p>

Dust grains fall from Saturn’s D-ring into its equatorial upper atmosphere
<p>The sizes of Saturn’s ring particles range from meters (boulders) to nanometers (dust).

During the Grand Finale orbits of the Cassini spacecraft, its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">instrument</span></strong>s measured tiny dust grains that compose the innermost D-ring of Saturn. The nanometer-sized dust experiences collisions with exospheric (upper atmosphere) hydrogen and molecular hydrogen, which forces it to fall from the ring into the ionosphere and lower atmosphere. We used the Magnetospheric Imaging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">instrument</span></strong> to detect and characterize this dust transport and also found that diffusion dominates above and near the altitude of peak ionospheric density. This mechanism results in a mass deposition into the equatorial atmosphere of ~5 kilograms per second, constraining the age of the D-ring.</p>

Improving mechanical sensor performance through larger damping
<p>Mechanical resonances are used in a wide variety of devices, from smartphone accelerometers to computer clocks and from wireless filters to atomic force microscopes. Frequency stability, a critical performance metric, is generally assumed to be tantamount to resonance quality factor (the inverse of the linewidth and of the damping). We show that the frequency stability of resonant nanomechanical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong>s can be improved by lowering the quality factor. At high bandwidths, quality-factor reduction is completely mitigated by increases in signal-to-noise ratio. At low bandwidths, notably, increased damping leads to better stability and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong> resolution, with improvement proportional to damping. We confirm the findings by demonstrating temperature resolution of 60 microkelvin at 300-hertz bandwidth. These results open the door to high-performance ultrasensitive resonators in gaseous or liquid environments, single-cell nanocalorimetry, nanoscale gas chromatography, atmospheric-pressure nanoscale mass spectrometry, and new approaches in crystal oscillator stability.</p>

Phase separation of a yeast prion protein promotes cellular fitness
<p>Despite the important role of prion domains in neurodegenerative disease, their physiological function has remained enigmatic. Previous work with yeast prions has defined prion domains as sequences that form self-propagating aggregates. Here, we uncovered an unexpected function of the canonical yeast prion protein Sup35. In stressed conditions, Sup35 formed protective gels via pH-regulated liquid-like phase separation followed by gelation. Phase separation was mediated by the N-terminal prion domain and regulated by the adjacent pH <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong> domain. Phase separation promoted yeast cell survival by rescuing the essential Sup35 translation factor from stress-induced damage.

Second messenger–mediated tactile response by a bacterial rotary motor

Surface-induced motor interference stimulated the production of the second messenger cyclic diguanylate by the motor-associated diguanylate cyclase DgcB. This led to the allosteric activation of the glycosyltransferase HfsJ to promote rapid synthesis of a polysaccharide adhesin and surface anchoring. Although the membrane-embedded motor unit was essential for surface sensing, mutants that lack external flagellar structures were hypersensitive to mechanical stimuli. Thus, the bacterial flagellar motor acts as a tetherless <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong> reminiscent of mechanosensitive channels.</p>

Phytochrome B integrates light and temperature signals in <i>Arabidopsis</i>

Increased rates of thermal reversion upon exposing <i>Arabidopsis</i> seedlings to warm environments reduce both the abundance of the biologically active Pfr-Pfr dimer pool of phyB and the size of the associated nuclear bodies, even in daylight. Mathematical analysis of stem growth for seedlings expressing wild-type phyB or thermally stable variants under various combinations of light and temperature revealed that phyB is physiologically responsive to both signals. We therefore propose that in addition to its photoreceptor functions, phyB is a temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong> in plants.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
A Synthetic Oxygen Sensor for Plants Based on Animal Hypoxia Signaling
<p>Due to the involvement of oxygen in many essential metabolic reactions, all living organisms have developed molecular systems that allow adaptive physiological and metabolic transitions depending on oxygen availability. In mammals, the expression of hypoxia-response genes is controlled by the heterodimeric Hypoxia-Inducible Factor. The activity of this transcriptional regulator is linked mainly to the oxygen-dependent hydroxylation of conserved proline residues in its α-subunit, carried out by prolyl-hydroxylases, and subsequent ubiquitination via the E3 ligase von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor, which targets Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-α to the proteasome. By exploiting bioengineered versions of this mammalian oxygen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong>, we designed and optimized a synthetic device that drives gene expression in an oxygen-dependent fashion in plants. Transient assays in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mesophyll protoplasts indicated that a combination of the yeast Gal4/upstream activating sequence system and the mammalian oxygen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong> machinery can be used effectively to engineer a modular, oxygen-inducible transcriptional regulator. This synthetic device also was shown to be selectively controlled by oxygen in whole plants when its components were expressed stably in Arabidopsis seedlings. We envision the exploitation of our genetically encoded controllers to generate plants able to switch gene expression selectively depending on oxygen availability, thereby providing a proof of concept for the potential of synthetic biology to assist agricultural practices in environments with variable oxygen provision.</p>

Simultaneous high-resolution pH and spectrophotometric recordings of oxygen binding in blood microvolumes

A major challenge has been to monitor oxygen binding characteristics and concomitant pH changes as they occur <i>in vivo</i>, in limited sample volumes. Here we report a technique allowing highly resolved and simultaneous monitoring of pH and blood pigment saturation in minute blood volumes. We equipped a gas diffusion chamber with a broad-range fibre-optic spectrophotometer and a micro-pH optode and recorded changes of pigment oxygenation along oxygen partial pressure (<i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>) and pH gradients to test the setup. Oxygen binding parameters derived from measurements in only 15 μl of haemolymph from the cephalopod <i>Octopus vulgaris</i> showed low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">instrument</span></strong>al error (0.93%) and good agreement with published data. Broad-range spectra, each resolving 2048 data points, provided detailed insight into the complex absorbance characteristics of diverse blood types. After consideration of photobleaching and intrinsic fluorescence, pH optodes yielded accurate recordings and resolved a sigmoidal shift of 0.03 pH units in response to changing <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> from 0 to 21 kPa. Highly resolved continuous recordings along pH gradients conformed to stepwise measurements at low rates of pH changes. In this study we showed that a diffusion chamber upgraded with a broad-range spectrophotometer and an optical pH <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong> accurately characterizes oxygen binding with minimal sample consumption and manipulation. We conclude that the modified diffusion chamber is highly suitable for experimental biologists who demand high flexibility, detailed insight into oxygen binding as well as experimental and biological accuracy combined in a single setup.</p>

A Mobile Auxin Signal Connects Temperature Sensing in Cotyledons with Growth Responses in Hypocotyls
<p>Plants have a remarkable capacity to adjust their growth and development to elevated ambient temperatures. Increased elongation growth of roots, hypocotyls, and petioles in warm temperatures are hallmarks of seedling thermomorphogenesis. In the last decade, significant progress has been made to identify the molecular signaling components regulating these growth responses. Increased ambient temperature utilizes diverse components of the light sensing and signal transduction network to trigger growth adjustments. However, it remains unknown whether temperature sensing and responses are universal processes that occur uniformly in all plant organs. Alternatively, temperature sensing may be confined to specific tissues or organs, which would require a systemic signal that mediates responses in distal parts of the plant. Here, we show that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings show organ-specific transcriptome responses to elevated temperatures and that thermomorphogenesis involves both autonomous and organ-interdependent temperature sensing and signaling. Seedling roots can sense and respond to temperature in a shoot-independent manner, whereas shoot temperature responses require both local and systemic processes. The induction of cell elongation in hypocotyls requires temperature sensing in cotyledons, followed by the generation of a mobile auxin signal. Subsequently, auxin travels to the hypocotyl, where it triggers local brassinosteroid-induced cell elongation in seedling stems, which depends upon a distinct, permissive temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong> in the hypocotyl.</p>

ANAC017 Coordinates Organellar Functions and Stress Responses by Reprogramming Retrograde Signaling
<p>Mitochondria adjust their activities in response to external and internal stimuli to optimize growth via the mitochondrial retrograde response signaling pathway. The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) NAC domain transcription factor ANAC017 has previously been identified as a regulator of the mitochondrial retrograde response. We show here that overexpression of <i>ANAC017</i> in Arabidopsis leads to growth retardation, altered leaf development with decreased cell size and viability, and early leaf senescence. RNA sequencing analyses revealed that increased <i>ANAC017</i> expression leads to higher expression of genes related to mitochondrial stress, cell death/autophagy, and leaf senescence under nonlimiting growth conditions as well as extensive repression of chloroplast function. Gene regulatory network analysis indicated that a complex hierarchy of transcription factors exists downstream of ANAC017. These involve a set of up-regulated ANAC and WRKY transcription factors associated with organellar signaling and senescence. The network also includes a number of ethylene- and gibberellic acid-related transcription factors with established functions in stress responses and growth regulation, which down-regulate their target genes. A number of BASIC LEUCINE-ZIPPER MOTIF transcription factors involved in the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response or balancing of energy homeostasis via the SNF1-RELATED PROTEIN KINASE1 were also down-regulated by <i>ANAC017</i> overexpression. Our results show that the endoplasmic reticulum membrane tethering of the constitutively expressed ANAC017, and its controlled release, are crucial to fine-tune a fast reactive but potentially harmful signaling cascade. Thus, ANAC017 is a master regulator of cellular responses with mitochondria acting as central <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong>s.</p>

Linking Duplication of a Calcium Sensor to Salt Tolerance in <i>Eutrema salsugineum</i>
<p>The SALT-OVERLY-SENSITIVE (SOS) pathway in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) functions to prevent the toxic accumulation of sodium in the cytosol when plants are grown in salt-affected soils. In this pathway, the CALCINEURIN B-LIKE10 (AtCBL10) calcium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong> interacts with the AtSOS2 kinase to activate the AtSOS1 plasma membrane sodium/proton exchanger. <i>CBL10</i> has been duplicated in Eutrema (<i>Eutrema salsugineum</i>), a salt-tolerant relative of Arabidopsis. Because Eutrema maintains growth in salt-affected soils that kill most crop plants, the duplication of <i>CBL10</i> provides a unique opportunity to functionally test the outcome of gene duplication and its link to plant salt tolerance. In Eutrema, individual down-regulation of the duplicated <i>CBL10</i> genes (<i>EsCBL10a</i> and <i>EsCBL10b</i>) decreased growth in the presence of salt and, in combination, led to an even greater decrease, suggesting that both genes function in response to salt and have distinct functions. Cross-species complementation assays demonstrated that <i>EsCBL10b</i> has an enhanced ability to activate the SOS pathway while <i>EsCBL10a</i> has a function not performed by <i>AtCBL10</i> or <i>EsCBL10b</i>. Chimeric EsCBL10a/EsCBL10b proteins revealed that the specific functions of the EsCBL10 proteins resulted from changes in the amino terminus. The duplication of <i>CBL10</i> increased calcium-mediated signaling capacity in Eutrema and conferred increased salt tolerance to salt-sensitive Arabidopsis.</p>

SENSITIVE TO SALT1, An Endoplasmic Reticulum-Localized Chaperone, Positively Regulates Salt Resistance
<p>Salt stress seriously affects plant growth and development. Through genetic screening, we identified and characterized an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>sensitive to salt1</i> (<i>ses1</i>) mutant. <i>SES1</i> was ubiquitously expressed and induced by salt treatment. The salt-sensitive phenotype of <i>ses1</i> was due neither to the overaccumulation of Na<sup>+</sup> nor to the suppression of salt tolerance-associated genes. <i>SES1</i> encoded an uncharacterized endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized protein. Coinciding with its subcellular distribution, <i>ses1</i> exhibited overactivation of unfolded protein response genes and was largely influenced by severe ER stress. Biochemical evidence revealed that SES1 functions as an important molecular chaperone to alleviate salt-induced ER stress. Furthermore, the ER stress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong> basic leucine zipper factor17 transactivated <i>SES1</i> by binding directly to its promoter region. These results provide insights into salt stress responses and ER homeostasis and shed light on the mechanism by which <i>SES1</i> modulates salt resistance.</p>

Singlet Oxygen Plays an Essential Role in the Root’s Response to Osmotic Stress
<p>The high osmotic potentials in plants subjected to drought stress can be mimicked by the application of high molecular weight polyethylene glycol. Here, we quantified the effects of exposure to polyethylene glycol on the growth of the main and lateral roots of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings. The effects on root growth were highly correlated with the appearance of singlet oxygen, as visualized using the singlet oxygen-specific probe singlet oxygen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong> green. The production of singlet oxygen was followed by cell death, as indicated by the intracellular accumulation of propidium iodide due to the loss of membrane integrity. Cell death began in the epidermal region of the root tip and spread in a dynamic manner to meristematic sections. In parallel, gene expression changes specific to the presence of singlet oxygen were observed. The accumulation of other reactive oxygen species, namely hydrogen, peroxide, nitric oxide, and superoxide, did not correlate with cell death. In addition, both the singlet oxygen scavenger His and the lipoxygenase inhibitor salicylhydroxamic acid specifically inhibited singlet oxygen accumulation and cell death. These results suggest a light-independent, type-I source of singlet oxygen production. Serpin-protease interactions were used as a model to assess the possibility of vacuolar-type cell death. Osmotic stress induced the accumulation of complexes between the cytoplasmic serpin AtSERPIN1 and its cognate vacuolar proteases, indicating that vacuolar integrity was compromised. These findings imply that singlet oxygen plays an essential role in conveying the root response to osmotic stress.</p>

<p>Glc regulates many vital processes, including plant growth, development, metabolism, and responses to biotic and abiotic stress. However, the molecular mechanism by which Glc acts as a signal to regulate salinity tolerance remains unclear. In this study, we found that the apple (<i>Malus domestica</i> Borkh.) Glc <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong> hexokinase1 (MdHXK1) contributes to Glc-mediated salinity tolerance. A combination of split ubiquitin system, pull-down, co-immunoprecipitation, and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays demonstrated that MdHXK1 interacts with and phosphorylates the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger MdNHX1 at its Ser-275 residue. Phosphorylation improved the stability of MdNHX1 and enhanced its Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> transport activity in <i>MdNHX1</i> overexpression transgenic apple and yeast complementation cells. Furthermore, Ser-275 of MdNHX1 was found to be crucial for MdHXK1-mediated phosphorylation. Finally, a series of transgenic analyses demonstrated that salt tolerance mediated by MdHXK1 partially depended on MdNHX1. Overall, our findings provide insights into how sugar recruits and regulates MdNHX1 in response to high salinity in plants.</p>

Lipopolysaccharides Trigger Two Successive Bursts of Reactive Oxygen Species at Distinct Cellular Locations
<p>Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are major components of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria and are an important microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP) that triggers immune responses in plants and animals. A previous genetic screen in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) identified LIPOOLIGOSACCHARIDE-SPECIFIC REDUCED ELICITATION (LORE), a B-type lectin <i>S</i>-domain receptor kinase, as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong> of LPS. However, the LPS-activated LORE signaling pathway and associated immune responses remain largely unknown. In this study, we found that LPS trigger biphasic production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in Arabidopsis. The first transient ROS burst was similar to that induced by another MAMP, flagellin, whereas the second long-lasting burst was induced only by LPS. The LPS-triggered second ROS burst was found to be conserved in a variety of plant species. Microscopic observation of the generation of ROS revealed that the LPS-triggered second ROS burst was largely associated with chloroplasts, and functional chloroplasts were indispensable for this response. The lipid A moiety, the most conserved portion of LPS, appears to be responsible for the second ROS burst. Surprisingly, the LPS- and lipid A-triggered second ROS burst was only partially dependent on LORE. Together, our findings provide insight on the LPS-triggered ROS production and the associated signaling pathway.</p>

STOREKEEPER RELATED1/G-Element Binding Protein (STKR1) Interacts with Protein Kinase SnRK1
<p>Sucrose nonfermenting related kinase1 (SnRK1) is a conserved energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong> kinase that regulates cellular adaptation to energy deficit in plants. Activation of SnRK1 leads to the down-regulation of ATP-consuming biosynthetic processes and the stimulation of energy-generating catabolic reactions by transcriptional reprogramming and posttranslational modifications. Although considerable progress has been made during the last years in understanding the SnRK1 signaling pathway, many of its components remain unidentified. Here, we show that the catalytic α-subunits KIN10 and KIN11 of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) SnRK1 complex interact with the STOREKEEPER RELATED1/G-Element Binding Protein (STKR1) inside the plant cell nucleus. Overexpression of STKR1 in transgenic Arabidopsis plants led to reduced growth, a delay in flowering, and strongly attenuated senescence. Metabolite profiling revealed that the transgenic lines exhausted their carbohydrates during the dark period to a greater extent than the wild type and accumulated a range of amino acids. At the global transcriptome level, genes affected by STKR1 overexpression were broadly associated with systemic acquired resistance, and transgenic plants showed enhanced resistance toward a virulent strain of the biotrophic oomycete pathogen <i>Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis</i> Noco2. We discuss a possible connection of STKR1 function, SnRK1 signaling, and plant immunity.</p>

The Energy-Signaling Hub SnRK1 Is Important for Sucrose-Induced Hypocotyl Elongation
<p>Emerging seedlings respond to environmental conditions such as light and temperature to optimize their establishment. Seedlings grow initially through elongation of the hypocotyl, which is regulated by signaling pathways that integrate environmental information to regulate seedling development. The hypocotyls of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) also elongate in response to sucrose. Here, we investigated the role of cellular sugar-sensing mechanisms in the elongation of hypocotyls in response to Suc. We focused upon the role of SnRK1, which is a sugar-signaling hub that regulates metabolism and transcription in response to cellular energy status. We also investigated the role of TPS1, which synthesizes the signaling sugar trehalose-6-P that is proposed to regulate SnRK1 activity. Under light/dark cycles, we found that Suc-induced hypocotyl elongation did not occur in <i>tps1</i> mutants and overexpressors of KIN10 (AKIN10/SnRK1.1), a catalytic subunit of SnRK1. We demonstrate that the magnitude of Suc-induced hypocotyl elongation depends on the day length and light intensity. We identified roles for auxin and gibberellin signaling in Suc-induced hypocotyl elongation under short photoperiods. We found that Suc-induced hypocotyl elongation under light/dark cycles does not involve another proposed sugar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong>, HEXOKINASE1, or the circadian oscillator. Our study identifies novel roles for KIN10 and TPS1 in mediating a signal that underlies Suc-induced hypocotyl elongation in light/dark cycles.</p>

Gene Regulation and Survival under Hypoxia Requires Starch Availability and Metabolism
<p>Plants respond to hypoxia, often caused by submergence, by expressing a specific set of genes that contribute to acclimation to this unfavorable environmental condition. Genes induced by low oxygen include those encoding enzymes for carbohydrate metabolism and fermentation, pathways that are required for survival. Sugar availability is therefore of crucial importance for energy production under hypoxia. Here, we show that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants require starch for surviving submergence as well as for ensuring the rapid induction of genes encoding enzymes required for anaerobic metabolism. The starchless <i>pgm</i> mutant is highly susceptible to submergence and also fails to induce anaerobic genes at the level of the wild type. Treating wild-type plants under conditions inducing sugar starvation results in a weak induction of alcohol dehydrogenase and other anaerobic genes. Induction of gene expression under hypoxia requires transcription factors belonging to group VII ethylene response factors (ERF-VII) that, together with plant Cys oxidases, act as an oxygen-sensing mechanism. We show that repression of this pathway by sugar starvation occurs downstream of the hypoxia-dependent stabilization of ERF-VII proteins and independently of the energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong> protein kinases SnRK1.1 (SNF1-related kinase 1.1).</p>

Abscisic Acid-Induced Reactive Oxygen Species Are Modulated by Flavonols to Control Stomata Aperture
<p>Abscisic acid (ABA) increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) in guard cells to close Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) stomata. In tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>), we find that ABA-increased ROS is followed by stomatal closure and that both responses are blocked by inhibitors of ROS-producing respiratory burst oxidase enzymes. ABA-induced ROS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong> fluorescence accumulates in the nucleus, chloroplasts, and endomembranes. The accumulation of flavonol antioxidants in guard cells, but not surrounding pavement cells, was visualized by confocal microscopy using a flavonol-specific fluorescent dye. Decreased flavonols in guard cells in the <i>anthocyanin reduced</i> (<i>are</i>) mutant and elevated levels in the <i>anthocyanin without</i> (<i>aw</i>) mutant were quantified by confocal microscopy and in leaf extracts by mass spectrometry. Consistent with flavonols acting as antioxidants, higher levels of ROS were detected in guard cells of the tomato <i>are</i> mutant and lower levels were detected in <i>aw</i> both at homeostasis and after treatment with ABA. These results demonstrate the inverse relationship between flavonols and ROS. Guard cells of <i>are</i> show greater ABA-induced closure than the wild type, reduced light-dependent guard cell opening, and reduced water loss, with <i>aw</i> having opposite responses. Ethylene treatment of wild-type tomato plants increased flavonol accumulation in guard cells; however, no flavonol increases were observed in <i>Neverripe</i> (<i>Nr</i>), an ethylene receptor mutant. Consistent with lower levels of ROS due to elevated flavonols, ethylene treatments decreased ABA-induced stomatal closure in the wild type, but not <i>Nr</i>, with ethylene responses attenuated in the <i>are</i> mutant. Together, these results are consistent with flavonols dampening the ABA-dependent ROS burst that drives stomatal closure and facilitating stomatal opening to modulate leaf gas exchange.</p>

Cytokinin Biosynthesis Promotes Cortical Cell Responses during Nodule Development
<p>Legume mutants have shown the requirement for receptor-mediated cytokinin signaling in symbiotic nodule organogenesis. While the receptors are central regulators, cytokinin also is accumulated during early phases of symbiotic interaction, but the pathways involved have not yet been fully resolved. To identify the source, timing, and effect of this accumulation, we followed transcript levels of the cytokinin biosynthetic pathway genes in a sliding developmental zone of <i>Lotus japonicus</i> roots. <i>LjIpt2</i> and <i>LjLog4</i> were identified as the major contributors to the first cytokinin burst. The genetic dependence and Nod factor responsiveness of these genes confirm that cytokinin biosynthesis is a key target of the common symbiosis pathway. The accumulation of <i>LjIpt2</i> and <i>LjLog4</i> transcripts occurs independent of the <i>LjLhk1</i> receptor during nodulation. Together with the rapid repression of both genes by cytokinin, this indicates that <i>LjIpt2</i> and <i>LjLog4</i> contribute to, rather than respond to, the initial cytokinin buildup. Analysis of the cytokinin response using the synthetic cytokinin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong>, <i>TCSn</i>, showed that this response occurs in cortical cells before spreading to the epidermis in <i>L. japonicus</i>. While mutant analysis identified redundancy in several biosynthesis families, we found that mutation of <i>LjIpt4</i> limits nodule numbers. Overexpression of <i>LjIpt3</i> or <i>LjLog4</i> alone was insufficient to produce the robust formation of spontaneous nodules. In contrast, overexpressing a complete cytokinin biosynthesis pathway leads to large, often fused spontaneous nodules. These results show the importance of cytokinin biosynthesis in initiating and balancing the requirement for cortical cell activation without uncontrolled cell proliferation.</p>

POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON HOMEOSTASIS1, OsPRI1, Facilitates Iron Homeostasis

However, it is unclear how OsHRZ1 transmits signals. In this study, we reveal that POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON HOMEOSTASIS1 (OsPRI1) interacts with OsHRZ1. A loss-of-function mutation to <i>OsPRI1</i> increased the sensitivity of plants to Fe-deficient conditions and down-regulated the expression of Fe-deficiency-responsive genes. Yeast one-hybrid and electrophoretic mobility shift assay results suggested that OsPRI1 binds to the <i>OsIRO2</i> and <i>OsIRO3</i> promoters. In vitro ubiquitination experiments indicated that OsPRI1 is ubiquitinated by OsHRZ1. Cell-free degradation assays revealed that the stability of OsPRI1 decreased in wild-type roots but increased in the <i>hrz1-2</i> mutant, suggesting OsHRZ1 is responsible for the instability of OsPRI1. The <i>hrz1-2</i> seedlings were insensitive to Fe-deficient conditions. When the <i>pri1-1</i> mutation was introduced into <i>hrz1-2</i> mutants, the <i>pri1hrz1</i> double mutant was more sensitive to Fe deficiency than the <i>hrz1-2</i> mutant. Additionally, the expression levels of Fe-deficiency-responsive genes were lower in the <i>hrz1pri1</i> double mutant than in the <i>hrz1-2</i> mutant. Collectively, these results imply that OsPRI1, which is ubiquitinated by OsHRZ1, mediates rice responses to Fe deficiency by positively regulating <i>OsIRO2</i> and <i>OsIRO3</i> expression as part of the <i>OsHRZ1-OsPRI1-OsIRO2/3</i> signal transduction cascade.</p>

Light Controls Cytokinin Signaling via Transcriptional Regulation of Constitutively Active Sensor Histidine Kinase CKI1
<p>In plants, the multistep phosphorelay (MSP) pathway mediates a range of regulatory processes, including those activated by cytokinins. The cross talk between cytokinin response and light has been known for a long time. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the interaction between light and cytokinin signaling remains elusive. In the screen for upstream regulators we identified a <i>LONG PALE HYPOCOTYL</i> (<i>LPH</i>) gene whose activity is indispensable for spatiotemporally correct expression of <i>CYTOKININ INDEPENDENT1</i> (<i>CKI1</i>), encoding the constitutively active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong> His kinase that activates MSP signaling. <i>lph</i> is a new allele of <i>HEME OXYGENASE1</i> (<i>HY1</i>) that encodes the key protein in the biosynthesis of phytochromobilin, a cofactor of photoconvertible phytochromes. Our analysis confirmed the light-dependent regulation of the <i>CKI1</i> expression pattern. We show that <i>CKI1</i> expression is under the control of phytochrome A (phyA), functioning as a dual (both positive and negative) regulator of <i>CKI1</i> expression, presumably via the phyA-regulated transcription factors (TF) PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR3 and CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1. Changes in <i>CKI1</i> expression observed in <i>lph</i>/<i>hy1</i>-<i>7</i> and <i>phy</i> mutants correlate with misregulation of MSP signaling, changed cytokinin sensitivity, and developmental aberrations that were previously shown to be associated with cytokinin and/or CKI1 action. Besides that, we demonstrate a novel role of phyA-dependent <i>CKI1</i> expression in the hypocotyl elongation and hook development during skotomorphogenesis. Based on these results, we propose that the light-dependent regulation of <i>CKI1</i> provides a plausible mechanistic link underlying the well-known interaction between light- and cytokinin-controlled plant development.</p>

Calmodulin (CaM) and closely related calmodulin-like (CML) polypeptides are principal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong>s of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. CaM/CMLs decode and relay information encrypted by the second messenger via differential interactions with a wide spectrum of targets to modulate their diverse biochemical activities. The plant-specific IQ67 DOMAIN (IQD) family emerged as possibly the largest class of CaM-interacting proteins with undefined molecular functions and biological roles. Here, we show that the 33 members of the IQD family in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) differentially localize, using green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged proteins, to multiple and distinct subcellular sites, including microtubule (MT) arrays, plasma membrane subdomains, and nuclear compartments. Intriguingly, the various IQD-specific localization patterns coincide with the subcellular patterns of IQD-dependent recruitment of CaM, suggesting that the diverse IQD members sequester Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM signaling modules to specific subcellular sites for precise regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent processes. Because MT localization is a hallmark of most IQD family members, we quantitatively analyzed GFP-labeled MT arrays in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> cells transiently expressing GFP-IQD fusions and observed IQD-specific MT patterns, which point to a role of IQDs in MT organization and dynamics. Indeed, stable overexpression of select IQD proteins in Arabidopsis altered cellular MT orientation, cell shape, and organ morphology. Because IQDs share biochemical properties with scaffold proteins, we propose that IQD families provide an assortment of platform proteins for integrating CaM-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling at multiple cellular sites to regulate cell function, shape, and growth.</p>

A Universal Stress Protein Involved in Oxidative Stress Is a Phosphorylation Target for Protein Kinase CIPK6
<p>Calcineurin B-like interacting protein kinases (CIPKs) decode calcium signals upon interaction with the calcium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong>s calcineurin B like proteins into phosphorylation events that result into adaptation to environmental stresses. Few phosphorylation targets of CIPKs are known and therefore the molecular mechanisms underlying their downstream output responses are not fully understood. Tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) Cipk6 regulates immune and susceptible Programmed cell death in immunity transforming Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals into reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling. To investigate SlCipk6-induced molecular mechanisms and identify putative substrates, a yeast two-hybrid approach was carried on and a protein was identified that contained a Universal stress protein (Usp) domain present in bacteria, protozoa and plants, which we named “SlRd2”. SlRd2 was an ATP-binding protein that formed homodimers in planta. SlCipk6 and SlRd2 interacted using coimmunoprecipitation and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaves and the complex localized in the cytosol. SlCipk6 phosphorylated SlRd2 in vitro, thus defining, to our knowledge, a novel target for CIPKs. Heterologous SlRd2 overexpression in yeast conferred resistance to highly toxic LiCl, whereas SlRd2 expression in <i>Escherichia coli</i> <i>UspA</i> mutant restored bacterial viability in response to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment. Finally, transient expression of SlCipk6 in transgenic <i>N</i>. <i>benthamiana</i> SlRd2 overexpressors resulted in reduced ROS accumulation as compared to wild-type plants. Taken together, our results establish that SlRd2, a tomato UspA, is, to our knowledge, a novel interactor and phosphorylation target of a member of the CIPK family, SlCipk6, and functionally regulates SlCipk6-mediated ROS generation.</p>

Carotenogenesis Is Regulated by 5′UTR-Mediated Translation of Phytoene Synthase Splice Variants
<p>Phytoene synthase (PSY) catalyzes the highly regulated, frequently rate-limiting synthesis of the first biosynthetically formed carotene. While <i>PSY</i> constitutes a small gene family in most plant taxa, the Brassicaceae, including Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), predominantly possess a single <i>PSY</i> gene. This monogenic situation is compensated by the differential expression of two alternative splice variants (ASV), which differ in length and in the exon/intron retention of their 5′UTRs. ASV1 contains a long 5′UTR (untranslated region) and is involved in developmentally regulated carotenoid formation, such as during deetiolation. ASV2 contains a short 5′UTR and is preferentially induced when an immediate increase in the carotenoid pathway flux is required, such as under salt stress or upon sudden light intensity changes. We show that the long 5′UTR of ASV1 is capable of attenuating the translational activity in response to high carotenoid pathway fluxes. This function resides in a defined 5′UTR stretch with two predicted interconvertible RNA conformations, as known from riboswitches, which might act as a flux <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong>. The translation-inhibitory structure is absent from the short 5′UTR of ASV2 allowing to bypass translational inhibition under conditions requiring rapidly increased pathway fluxes. The mechanism is not found in the rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) <i>PSY1</i> 5′UTR, consistent with the prevalence of transcriptional control mechanisms in taxa with multiple <i>PSY</i> genes. The translational control mechanism identified is interpreted in terms of flux adjustments needed in response to retrograde signals stemming from intermediates of the plastid-localized carotenoid biosynthesis pathway.</p>

<i>pheno</i>Seeder - A Robot System for Automated Handling and Phenotyping of Individual Seeds
<p>The enormous diversity of seed traits is an intriguing feature and critical for the overwhelming success of higher plants. In particular, seed mass is generally regarded to be key for seedling development but is mostly approximated by using scanning methods delivering only two-dimensional data, often termed seed size. However, three-dimensional traits, such as the volume or mass of single seeds, are very rarely determined in routine measurements. Here, we introduce a device named <i>pheno</i>Seeder, which enables the handling and phenotyping of individual seeds of very different sizes. The system consists of a pick-and-place robot and a modular setup of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong>s that can be versatilely extended. Basic biometric traits detected for individual seeds are two-dimensional data from projections, three-dimensional data from volumetric measures, and mass, from which seed density is also calculated. Each seed is tracked by an identifier and, after phenotyping, can be planted, sorted, or individually stored for further evaluation or processing (e.g. in routine seed-to-plant tracking pipelines). By investigating seeds of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), rapeseed (<i>Brassica napus</i>), and barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), we observed that, even for apparently round-shaped seeds of rapeseed, correlations between the projected area and the mass of seeds were much weaker than between volume and mass. This indicates that simple projections may not deliver good proxies for seed mass. Although throughput is limited, we expect that automated seed phenotyping on a single-seed basis can contribute valuable information for applications in a wide range of wild or crop species, including seed classification, seed sorting, and assessment of seed quality.</p>

Unusual Diversity of Myoglobin Genes in the Lungfish
<p>Myoglobin is a respiratory protein that serves as a model system in a variety of biological fields. Its main function is to deliver and store O<sub>2</sub> in the heart and skeletal muscles, but myoglobin is also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">instrument</span></strong>al in homeostasis of nitric oxide (NO) and detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Almost every vertebrate harbors a single myoglobin gene; only some cyprinid fishes have two recently duplicated myoglobin genes. Here we show that the West African lungfish <i>Protopterus annectens</i> has at least seven distinct myoglobin genes (<i>PanMb1–7</i>), which diverged early in the evolution of lungfish and showed an enhanced evolutionary rate. These myoglobins are lungfish specific, and no other globin gene was found amplified. The myoglobins are differentially expressed in various lungfish tissues, and the brain is the main site of myoglobin expression. The typical myoglobin-containing tissues, the skeletal muscle and the heart, have much lower myoglobin mRNA levels. Muscle and heart express distinct myoglobins (<i>PanMb1</i> and <i>PanMb3</i>, respectively). In cell culture, lungfish myoglobins improved cellular survival under hypoxia albeit with different efficiencies and reduced the production of reactive oxygen species. Only <i>Mb2</i> and <i>Mb6</i> enhanced the energy status of the cells. The unexpected diversity of myoglobin hints to a functional diversification of this gene: some myoglobins may have adapted to the O<sub>2</sub> requirements of the specific tissue and help the lungfish to survive hypoxic periods; other myoglobins may have taken over the roles of neuroglobin and cytoglobin, which appear to be missing in the West African lungfish.</p>

Deep-diving sea lions exhibit extreme bradycardia in long-duration dives
<p>Heart rate and peripheral blood flow distribution are the primary determinants of the rate and pattern of oxygen store utilisation and ultimately breath-hold duration in marine endotherms. Despite this, little is known about how otariids (sea lions and fur seals) regulate heart rate (<i>f</i><sub>H</sub>) while diving. We investigated dive <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> in five adult female California sea lions (<i>Zalophus californianus</i>) during foraging trips by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">instrument</span></strong>ing them with digital electrocardiogram (ECG) loggers and time depth recorders. In all dives, dive <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> (number of beats/duration; 50±9 beats min<sup>−1</sup>) decreased compared with surface rates (113±5 beats min<sup>−1</sup>), with all dives exhibiting an instantaneous <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> below resting (<54 beats min<sup>−1</sup>) at some point during the dive. Both dive <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> and minimum instantaneous <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> significantly decreased with increasing dive duration. Typical instantaneous <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> profiles of deep dives (>100 m) consisted of: (1) an initial rapid decline in <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> resulting in the lowest instantaneous <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> of the dive at the end of descent, often below 10 beats min<sup>−1</sup> in dives longer than 6 min in duration; (2) a slight increase in <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> to ~10–40 beats min<sup>−1</sup> during the bottom portion of the dive; and (3) a gradual increase in <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> during ascent with a rapid increase prior to surfacing. Thus, <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> regulation in deep-diving sea lions is not simply a progressive bradycardia. Extreme bradycardia and the presumed associated reductions in pulmonary and peripheral blood flow during late descent of deep dives should (a) contribute to preservation of the lung oxygen store, (b) increase dependence of muscle on the myoglobin-bound oxygen store, (c) conserve the blood oxygen store and (d) help limit the absorption of nitrogen at depth. This <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> profile during deep dives of sea lions may be characteristic of deep-diving marine endotherms that dive on inspiration as similar <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> profiles have been recently documented in the emperor penguin, another deep diver that dives on inspiration.</p>

The olfactory neuron AWC promotes avoidance of normally palatable food following chronic dietary restriction
<p>Changes in metabolic state alter foraging behavior and food preference in animals. Here, I show that normally attractive food becomes repulsive to <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> if animals are chronically undernourished as a result of alimentary tract defects. This behavioral plasticity is achieved in two ways: increased food leaving and induction of aversive behavior towards food. A particularly strong food avoider is defective in the chitin synthase that makes the pharyngeal lining. Food avoidance induced by underfeeding is mediated by cGMP signaling in the olfactory neurons AWC and AWB, and the gustatory neurons ASJ and ASK. Food avoidance is enhanced by increased population density and is reduced if the animals are unable to correctly interpret their nutritional state as a result of defects in the AMP kinase or TOR/S6kinase pathways. The TGF-β/DBL-1 pathway suppresses food avoidance and the cellular basis for this is distinct from its role in aversive olfactory learning of harmful food. This study suggests that nutritional state feedback via nutrient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong>s, population size and olfactory neurons guides food preference in <i>C. elegans</i>.</p>

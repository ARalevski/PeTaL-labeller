Hospital Variation in Time to Epinephrine for Nonshockable In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>For patients with in-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al cardiac arrests attributable to nonshockable rhythms, delays in epinephrine administration beyond 5 minutes is associated with worse survival. However, the extent of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al variation in delayed epinephrine administration and its effect on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al-level outcomes is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Within Get With The Guidelines-Resuscitation, we identified 103 932 adult patients (≥18 years) at 548 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>als with an in-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al cardiac arrest attributable to a nonshockable rhythm who received at least 1 dose of epinephrine between 2000 and 2014. We constructed 2-level hierarchical regression models to quantify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al variation in rates of delayed epinephrine administration (>5 minutes) and its association with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al rates of survival to discharge and survival with functional recovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, 13 213 (12.7%) patients had delays to epinephrine, and this rate varied markedly across <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>als (range, 0%–53.8%). The odds of delay in epinephrine administration were 58% higher at 1 randomly selected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al in comparison with a similar patient at another randomly selected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al (median odds ratio, 1.58; 95% confidence interval, 1.51–1.64). The median risk-standardized survival rate was 12.0% (range, 5.4%–31.9%), and the risk-standardized survival with functional recovery was 7.4% (range, 0.9%–30.8%). There was an inverse correlation between a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al’s rate of delayed epinephrine administration and its risk-standardized rate of survival to discharge (ρ=–0.22, <i>P</i><0.0001) and survival with functional recovery (ρ=–0.14, <i>P</i>=0.001). In comparison with a median survival rate of 12.9% (interquartile range, 11.1%–15.4%) at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>als in the lowest quartile of epinephrine delay, risk-standardized survival was 16% lower at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>als in the quartile with the highest rate of epinephrine delays (10.8%; interquartile range, 9.7%–12.7%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Delays in epinephrine administration following in-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al cardiac arrest are common and variy across <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>als. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>als with high rates of delayed epinephrine administration had lower rates of overall survival for in-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al cardiac arrest attributable to nonshockable rhythm.

Association of Pediatric Medical Emergency Teams With Hospital Mortality
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Implementation of medical emergency teams has been identified as a potential strategy to reduce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al deaths, because these teams respond to patients with acute physiological decline in an effort to prevent in-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al cardiac arrest.

Association Between Hospital Volume, Processes of Care, and Outcomes in Patients Admitted With Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al volume is frequently used as a structural metric for assessing quality of care, but its utility in patients admitted with acute heart failure (HF) is not well characterized. Accordingly, we sought to determine the relationship between admission volume, process-of-care metrics, and short- and long-term outcomes in patients admitted with acute HF.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients enrolled in the Get With The Guidelines-HF registry with linked Medicare inpatient data at 342 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>als were assessed. Volume was assessed both as a continuous variable, and quartiles based on the admitting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al annual HF case volume, as well: 5 to 38 (quartile 1), 39 to 77 (quartile 2), 78 to 122 (quartile 3), 123 to 457 (quartile 4). The main outcome measures were (1) process measures at discharge (achievement of HF achievement, quality, reporting, and composite metrics); (2) 30-day mortality and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al readmission; and (3) 6-month mortality and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al readmission. Adjusted logistic and Cox proportional hazards models were used to study these associations with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al volume.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 125 595 patients with HF were included. Patients admitted to high-volume <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>als had a higher burden of comorbidities. On multivariable modeling, lower-volume <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>als were significantly less likely to be adherent to HF process measures than higher-volume <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>als. Higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al volume was not associated with a difference in in-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al (odds ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.94–1.05; <i>P</i>=0.78) or 30-day mortality (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.97–1.01; <i>P</i>=0.26), or 30-day readmissions (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.97–1.00; <i>P</i>=0.10). There was a weak association of higher volumes with lower 6-month mortality (hazard ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97–0.99; <i>P</i>=0.001) and lower 6-month all-cause readmissions (hazard ratio, 0.98; 95%, CI 0.97–1.00; <i>P</i>=0.025).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our analysis of a large contemporary prospective national quality improvement registry of older patients with HF indicates that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al volume as a structural metric correlates with process measures, but not with 30-day outcomes, and only marginally with outcomes up to 6 months of follow-up. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al profiling should focus on participation in systems of care, adherence to process metrics, and risk-standardized outcomes rather than on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al volume itself.</p></sec>

NT-proBNP (N-Terminal pro-B-Type Natriuretic Peptide)-Guided Therapy in Acute Decompensated Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The concept of natriuretic peptide guidance has been extensively studied in patients with chronic heart failure (HF), with only limited success. The effect of NT-proBNP (N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide)-guided therapy in patients with acute decompensated HF using a relative NT-proBNP target has not been investigated. This study aimed to assess whether NT-proBNP-guided therapy of patients with acute decompensated HF using a relative NT-proBNP target would lead to improved outcomes compared with conventional therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial to study the impact of in-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al guidance for acute decompensated HF treatment by a predefined NT-proBNP target (>30% reduction from admission to discharge) versus conventional treatment. Patients with acute decompensated HF with NT-proBNP levels >1700 ng/L were eligible. After achieving clinical stability, 405 patients were randomized to either NT-proBNP-guided or conventional treatment (1:1). The primary end point was dual: a composite of all-cause mortality and HF readmissions in 180 days and the number of days alive out of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al in 180 days. Secondary end points were all-cause mortality within 180 days, HF readmissions within 180 days, and a composite of all-cause mortality and HF readmissions within 90 days.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Significantly more patients in the NT-proBNP-guided therapy group were discharged with an NT-proBNP reduction of >30% (80% versus 64%, <i>P</i>=0.001).

Risk of Cerebrovascular Events in 178 962 Five-Year Survivors of Cancer Diagnosed at 15 to 39 Years of Age
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Survivors of teenage and young adult cancer are at risk of cerebrovascular events, but the magnitude of and extent to which this risk varies by cancer type, decade of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s, age at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s, and attained age remains uncertain. This is the largest-ever cohort study to evaluate the risks of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>alization for a cerebrovascular event among long-term survivors of teenage and young adult cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The population-based TYACSS (Teenage and Young Adult Cancer Survivor Study) (N=178,962) was linked to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al Episode Statistics data for England to investigate the risks of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>alization for a cerebrovascular event among 5-year survivors of cancer diagnosed when 15 to 39 years of age. Observed numbers of first <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>alizations for cerebrovascular events were compared with that expected from the general population using standardized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>alization ratios (SHRs) and absolute excess risks per 10 000 person-years. Cumulative incidence was calculated with death considered a competing risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, 2782 cancer survivors were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>alized for a cerebrovascular event—40% higher than expected (SHR=1.4, 95% confidence interval, 1.3–1.4). Survivors of central nervous system (CNS) tumors (SHR=4.6, 95% confidence interval, 4.3–5.0), head and neck tumors (SHR=2.6, 95% confidence interval, 2.2–3.1), and leukemia (SHR=2.5, 95% confidence interval, 1.9–3.1) were at greatest risk. Males had significantly higher absolute excess risks than females (absolute excess risks =7 versus 3), especially among head and neck tumor survivors (absolute excess risks =30 versus 11). By 60 years of age, 9%, 6%, and 5% of CNS tumor, head and neck tumor, and leukemia survivors, respectively, had been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>alized for a cerebrovascular event. Beyond 60 years of age, every year, 0.4% of CNS tumor survivors were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>alized for a cerebral infarction (versus 0.1% expected), whereas at any age, every year, 0.2% of head and neck tumor survivors were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>alized for a cerebral infarction (versus 0.06% expected).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Survivors of a CNS tumor, head and neck tumor, and leukemia are particularly at risk of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>alization for a cerebrovascular event.

Outlier facilities were larger, treating more patients with acute myocardial infarction and performing more PCIs than nonoutlier <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>als (<i>P</i><0.05 for each). Among 507 672 patients with acute myocardial infarction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>alized at these institutions, 108 428 (21%) were treated at an outlier <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al after public report.

Diagnosis and Treatment of Fetal Cardiac Disease
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>The goal of this statement is to review available literature and to put forth a scientific statement on the current practice of fetal cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">medicin</span></strong>e, including the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s and management of fetal cardiovascular disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>A writing group appointed by the American Heart Association reviewed the available literature pertaining to topics relevant to fetal cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">medicin</span></strong>e, including the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of congenital heart disease and arrhythmias, assessment of cardiac function and the cardiovascular system, and available treatment options. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association classification of recommendations and level of evidence for practice guidelines were applied to the current practice of fetal cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">medicin</span></strong>e. Recommendations relating to the specifics of fetal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s, including the timing of referral for study, indications for referral, and experience suggested for performance and interpretation of studies, are presented. The components of a fetal echocardiogram are described in detail, including descriptions of the assessment of cardiac anatomy, cardiac function, and rhythm. Complementary modalities for fetal cardiac assessment are reviewed, including the use of advanced ultrasound techniques, fetal magnetic resonance imaging, and fetal magnetocardiography and electrocardiography for rhythm assessment. Models for parental counseling and a discussion of parental stress and depression assessments are reviewed. Available fetal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">therapi</span></strong>es, including medical management for arrhythmias or heart failure and closed or open intervention for diseases affecting the cardiovascular system such as twin–twin transfusion syndrome, lung masses, and vascular tumors, are highlighted. Catheter-based intervention strategies to prevent the progression of disease in utero are also discussed. Recommendations for delivery planning strategies for fetuses with congenital heart disease including models based on classification of disease severity and delivery room treatment will be highlighted.

Hospital Variation in Adherence Rates to Secondary Prevention Medications and the Implications on Quality
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Medication adherence is important to improve the long-term outcomes after acute myocardial infarction (MI). We hypothesized that there is significant variation among US <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>als in terms of medication adherence after MI, and that patients treated at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>als with higher medication adherence after MI will have better long-term cardiovascular outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We identified 19 704 Medicare patients discharged after acute MI from 347 US <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>als participating in the ACTION Registry-GWTG (Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Network Registry-Get With the Guidelines) from January 2, 2007, to October 1, 2010. Using linked Medicare Part D prescription filling data, medication adherence was defined as proportion of days covered >80% within 90 days after discharge.

Adherence to these medications up to 90 days varied significantly among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>als: β-blockers (proportion of days covered >80%; 59% to 75%), statins (55% to 69%), thienopyridines (64% to 77%), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (57% to 69%). Compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>als in the lowest quartile of 90-day composite medication adherence, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>als with the highest adherence had lower unadjusted and adjusted 2-year major adverse cardiovascular event risk (27.5% versus 35.3%; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.88; 95% confidence interval, 0.80–0.96).

Thirty-Day Readmissions After Endovascular or Surgical Therapy for Critical Limb Ischemia
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Thirty-day readmission rates have gained increasing importance as a key quality metric. A significant number of patients are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>alized for the management of critical limb ischemia (CLI), but limited data are available on the incidence, predictors, and causes of 30-day readmission after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>alization for CLI.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>alizations for a primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of CLI during which patients underwent endovascular or surgical therapy (revascularization and/or amputation) and were discharged alive were identified in the 2013 to 2014 Nationwide Readmissions Databases. Incidence, reasons, and costs of 30-day unplanned readmissions were determined. Hierarchical logistic regression models were used to identify independent predictors of 30-day readmissions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We included 60 998 (national estimate, 135 110) index CLI <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>alizations (mean age, 68.9±11.9 years; 40.8% women; 24.6% for rest pain, 37.2% for ulcer, and 38.2% for gangrene). The 30-day readmission rate was 20.4%. Presentation with ulcer or gangrene, age ≥65 years, female sex, large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al size, teaching <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al status, known coronary artery disease, heart failure, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, anemia, coagulopathy, obesity, major bleeding, acute myocardial infarction, vascular complications, and sepsis were identified as independent predictors of 30-day readmission. Mode of revascularization was not independently associated with readmissions. Infections (23.5%), persistent or recurrent manifestations of peripheral artery disease (22.2%), cardiac conditions (11.4%), procedural complications (11.0%), and endocrine issues (5.7%) were the most common reasons for readmission. The inflation-adjusted aggregate costs of 30-day readmissions for CLI during the study period were $624 million.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Approximately 1 in 5 patients <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>alized for CLI and undergoing revascularization is readmitted within 30 days. Risk of readmission is influenced by CLI presentation, patient demographics, comorbidities, and in-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al complications, but not by the mode of revascularization.</p></sec>

Impact of Regionalization of ST-Segment–Elevation Myocardial Infarction Care on Treatment Times and Outcomes for Emergency Medical Services–Transported Patients Presenting to Hospitals With Percutaneous Coronary Intervention
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Regional variations in reperfusion times and mortality in patients with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction are influenced by differences in coordinating care between emergency medical services (EMS) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>als. Building on the Accelerator-1 Project, we hypothesized that time to reperfusion could be further reduced with enhanced regional efforts.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Between April 2015 and March 2017, we worked with 12 metropolitan regions across the United States with 132 percutaneous coronary intervention–capable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>als and 946 EMS agencies. Data were collected in the ACTION (Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Network)-Get With The Guidelines Registry for quarterly Mission: Lifeline reports. The primary end point was the change in the proportion of EMS-transported patients with first medical contact to device time ≤90 minutes from baseline to final quarter. We also compared treatment times and mortality with patients treated in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>als not participating in the project during the corresponding time period.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>During the study period, 10 730 patients were transported to percutaneous coronary intervention–capable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>als, including 974 in the baseline quarter and 972 in the final quarter who met inclusion criteria. Median age was 61 years; 27% were women, 6% had cardiac arrest, and 6% had shock on admission; 10% were black, 12% were Latino, and 10% were uninsured. By the end of the intervention, all process measures reflecting coordination between EMS and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>als had improved, including the proportion of patients with a first medical contact to device time of ≤90 minutes (67%–74%; <i>P</i><0.002), a first medical contact to device time to catheterization laboratory activation of ≤20 minutes (38%–56%; <i>P</i><0.0001), and emergency department dwell time of ≤20 minutes (33%–43%; <i>P</i><0.0001). Of the 12 regions, 9 regions reduced first medical contact to device time, and 8 met or exceeded the national goal of 75% of patients treated in ≤90 minutes.

We identified women whose infants had critical, noncritical, or no heart defects, and tracked the women over time for future <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>alizations for cardiovascular disease, with follow-up extending up to 25 years past pregnancy. We calculated the incidence of cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>alization per 1000 person-years, and used Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between infant heart defects and risk of maternal cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>alization.

Geographic Variation in Cardiac Rehabilitation Participation in Medicare and Veterans Affairs Populations
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac rehabilitation is strongly recommended after myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention, or coronary artery bypass surgery, but it is historically underused. We sought to evaluate variation in cardiac rehabilitation participation across the United States.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>From administrative data from the Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system and a 5% Medicare sample, we used International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision codes to identify patients <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>alized for myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention, or coronary artery bypass surgery from 2007 to 2011. After excluding patients who died in ≤30 days of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>alization, we calculated the percentage of patients who participated in ≥1 outpatient visits for cardiac rehabilitation during the 12 months after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>alization. We estimated adjusted and standardized rates of participation in cardiac rehabilitation by state using hierarchical logistic regression models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, participation in cardiac rehabilitation was 16.3% (23 403/143 756) in Medicare and 10.3% (9123/88 826) in VA. However, participation rates varied widely across states, ranging from 3.2% to 41.8% in Medicare and 1.2% to 47.6% in VA. Similar regional variation was observed in both populations. Patients in the West North Central region (Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota) had the highest participation, whereas those in the Pacific region (Alaska, California, Hawaii, Oregon, and Washington) had the lowest participation in both Medicare (33.7% versus 10.6%) and VA (16.6% versus 5.1%) populations.

Polygenic Risk Score Identifies Subgroup With Higher Burden of Atherosclerosis and Greater Relative Benefit From Statin Therapy in the Primary Prevention Setting
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Relative risk reduction with statin therapy has been consistent across nearly all subgroups studied to date. However, in analyses of 2 randomized controlled primary prevention trials (ASCOT [Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial–Lipid-Lowering Arm] and JUPITER [Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin]), statin therapy led to a greater relative risk reduction among a subgroup at high genetic risk. Here, we aimed to confirm this observation in a third primary prevention randomized controlled trial. In addition, we assessed whether those at high genetic risk had a greater burden of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied participants from a randomized controlled trial of primary prevention with statin therapy (WOSCOPS [West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study]; n=4910) and 2 observational cohort studies (CARDIA [Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults] and BioImage; n=1154 and 4392, respectively). For each participant, we calculated a polygenic risk score derived from up to 57 common DNA sequence variants previously associated with coronary heart disease. We compared the relative efficacy of statin therapy in those at high genetic risk (top quintile of polygenic risk score) versus all others (WOSCOPS), as well as the association between the polygenic risk score and coronary artery calcification (CARDIA) and carotid artery plaque burden (BioImage).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among WOSCOPS trial participants at high genetic risk, statin therapy was associated with a relative risk reduction of 44% (95% confidence interval [CI], 22–60; <i>P</i><0.001), whereas in all others, the relative risk reduction was 24% (95% CI, 8–37; <i>P</i>=0.004) despite similar low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering. In a study-level meta-analysis across the WOSCOPS, ASCOT, and JUPITER primary prevention, relative risk reduction in those at high genetic risk was 46% versus 26% in all others (<i>P</i> for heterogeneity=0.05). Across all 3 studies, the absolute risk reduction with statin therapy was 3.6% (95% CI, 2.0–5.1) among those in the high genetic risk group and 1.3% (95% CI, 0.6–1.9) in all others. Each 1-SD increase in the polygenic risk score was associated with 1.32-fold (95% CI, 1.04–1.68) greater likelihood of having coronary artery calcification and 9.7% higher (95% CI, 2.2–17.8) burden of carotid plaque.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Those at high genetic risk have a greater burden of subclinical atherosclerosis and derive greater relative and absolute benefit from statin therapy to prevent a first coronary heart disease event.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Medical Therapy for Secondary Prevention and Long-Term Outcome in Patients With Myocardial Infarction With Nonobstructive Coronary Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) occurs in 5% to 10% of all patients with myocardial infarction. Clinical trials of secondary prevention treatment in MINOCA patients are lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the associations between treatment with statins, renin-angiotensin system blockers, β-blockers, dual antiplatelet therapy, and long-term cardiovascular events.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This is an observational study of MINOCA patients recorded in the SWEDEHEART registry (the Swedish Web-system for Enhancement and Development of Evidence-based care in Heart disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapy) between July 2003 and June 2013 and followed until December 2013 for outcome events in the Swedish Cause of Death Register and National Patient Register. Of 199 162 myocardial infarction admissions, 9466 consecutive unique patients with MINOCA were identified. Among those, the 9136 patients surviving the first 30 days after discharge constituted the study population. Mean age was 65.3 years, and 61% were women. No patient was lost to follow-up. A stratified propensity score analysis was performed to match treated and untreated groups. The association between treatment and outcome was estimated by comparing between treated and untreated groups by using Cox proportional hazards models. The exposures were treatment at discharge with statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, β-blockers, and dual antiplatelet therapy. The primary end point was major adverse cardiac events defined as all-cause mortality, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>alization for myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and heart failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>At discharge, 84.5%, 64.1%, 83.4%, and 66.4% of the patients were on statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, β-blockers, and dual antiplatelet therapy, respectively. During the follow-up of a mean of 4.1 years, 2183 (23.9%) patients experienced a major adverse cardiac event. The hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for major adverse cardiac events were 0.77 (0.68–0.87), 0.82 (0.73–0.93), and 0.86 (0.74–1.01) in patients on statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, and β-blockers, respectively. For patients on dual antiplatelet therapy followed for 1 year, the hazard ratio was 0.90 (0.74–1.08).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The results indicate long-term beneficial effects of treatment with statins and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers on outcome in patients with MINOCA, a trend toward a positive effect of β-blocker treatment, and a neutral effect of dual antiplatelet therapy.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Autophagy Deficiency Compromises Alternative Pathways of Respiration following Energy Deprivation in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>Under heterotrophic conditions, carbohydrate oxidation inside the mitochondrion is the primary energy source for cellular metabolism. However, during energy-limited conditions, alternative substrates are required to support <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation. Amino acid oxidation in plant cells plays a key role in this by generating electrons that can be transferred to the mitochondrial electron transport chain via the electron transfer flavoprotein/ubiquinone oxidoreductase system. Autophagy, a catabolic mechanism for macromolecule and protein recycling, allows the maintenance of amino acid pools and nutrient remobilization. Although the association between autophagy and alternative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>atory substrates has been suggested, the extent to which autophagy and primary metabolism interact to support plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation remains unclear. To investigate the metabolic importance of autophagy during development and under extended darkness, Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants with disruption of autophagy (<i>atg</i> mutants) were used. Under normal growth conditions, <i>atg</i> mutants showed lower growth and seed production with no impact on photosynthesis. Following extended darkness, <i>atg</i> mutants were characterized by signatures of early senescence, including decreased chlorophyll content and maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II coupled with increases in dark <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation. Transcript levels of genes involved in alternative pathways of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation and amino acid catabolism were up-regulated in <i>atg</i> mutants. The metabolite profiles of dark-treated leaves revealed an extensive metabolic reprogramming in which increases in amino acid levels were partially compromised in <i>atg</i> mutants. Although an enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation in <i>atg</i> mutants was observed during extended darkness, autophagy deficiency compromises protein degradation and the generation of amino acids used as alternative substrates to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">respir</span></strong>ation.</p>

Whether VTE risk is associated with more severe symptomatic atherosclerosis and more intensive antiplatelet therapy reduces VTE risk beyond aspirin monotherapy is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>TRA2P-TIMI 50 (Thrombin Receptor Antagonist in Secondary Prevention of Atherothrombotic Ischemic Events–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) (vorapaxar) and PEGASUS-TIMI 54 (Prevention of Cardiovascular Events in Patients With Prior Heart Attack Using Ticagrelor Compared to Placebo on a Background of Aspirin–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 54) (ticagrelor) were blinded, randomized placebo-controlled trials of antiplatelet therapy for the prevention of ischemic events in stable patients with symptomatic atherosclerosis. Two blinded vascular specialists systematically identified symptomatic venous thromboembolic events in both trials.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 47 611 patients with stable vascular disease followed for 3 years in both studies there were 343 VTE events in 301 patients (Kaplan-Meier rate at 3 years, 0.9% for placebo). The risk of VTE was independently associated with age, body mass index, polyvascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and malignancy. The burden of atherosclerosis manifested as an increasing number of symptomatic vascular territories was associated with a graded increase in the 3-year rates of VTE (0.76% for 1, 1.53% for 2, and 2.45% for 3 territories). More intensive antiplatelet therapy (vorapaxar and ticagrelor pooled) significantly reduced the risk of VTE by 29% compared with background antiplatelet therapy, from 0.93% to 0.64% at 3 years (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% confidence interval, 0.56–0.89; <i>P</i>=0.003).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The rate of VTE in patients with atherosclerosis is ≈0.3% per year while on treatment with ≥1 antiplatelet agent, with increased risk independently associated with the number of symptomatic vascular territories. More intensive antiplatelet therapy reduces the risk of VTE. These data suggest a relationship between atherosclerosis burden and VTE risk, and they support inclusion of VTE as a prospective end point in long-term secondary prevention trials evaluating the risks and benefits of antiplatelet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">therapi</span></strong>es in patients with atherosclerosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Prospective Countywide Surveillance and Autopsy Characterization of Sudden Cardiac Death
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Studies of out-of-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death (SCD) use emergency medical services records, death certificates, or definitions that infer cause of death; thus, the true incidence of SCD is unknown. Over 90% of SCDs occur out-of-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al; nonforensic autopsies are rarely performed, and therefore causes of death are presumed. We conducted a medical examiner–based investigation to determine the precise incidence and autopsy-defined causes of all SCDs in an entire metropolitan area. We hypothesized that postmortem investigation would identify actual sudden arrhythmic deaths among presumed SCDs.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Between February 1, 2011, and March 1, 2014, we prospectively identified all incident deaths attributed to out-of-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al cardiac arrest (emergency medical services primary impression, cardiac arrest) between 18 to 90 years of age in San Francisco County for autopsy, toxicology, and histology via medical examiner surveillance of consecutive out-of-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al deaths, all reported by law. We obtained comprehensive records to determine whether out-of-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al cardiac arrest deaths met World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for SCD. We reviewed death certificates filed quarterly for missed SCDs. Autopsy-defined sudden arrhythmic deaths had no extracardiac cause of death or acute heart failure. A multidisciplinary committee adjudicated final cause.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>All 20 440 deaths were reviewed; 12 671 were unattended and reported to the medical examiner. From these, we identified 912 out-of-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al cardiac arrest deaths; 541 (59%) met WHO SCD criteria (mean 62.8 years, 69% male) and 525 (97%) were autopsied. Eighty-nine additional WHO-defined SCDs occurred within 3 weeks of active medical care with the death certificate signed by the attending physician, ineligible for autopsy but included in the countywide WHO-defined SCD incidence of 29.6/100 000 person-years, highest in black men (<i>P</i><0.0001). Of 525 WHO-defined SCDs, 301 (57%) had no cardiac history. Leading causes of death were coronary disease (32%), occult overdose (13.5%), cardiomyopathy (10%), cardiac hypertrophy (8%), and neurological (5.5%). Autopsy-defined sudden arrhythmic deaths were 55.8% (293/525) of overall, 65% (78/120) of witnessed, and 53% (215/405) of unwitnessed WHO-defined SCDs (<i>P</i>=0.024); 286 of 293 (98%) had structural cardiac disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Forty percent of deaths attributed to stated cardiac arrest were not sudden or unexpected, and nearly half of presumed SCDs were not arrhythmic. These findings have implications for the accuracy of SCDs as defined by WHO criteria or emergency medical services records in aggregate mortality data, clinical trials, and cohort studies.</p></sec>

Association of Statin Dose With Amputation and Survival in Patients With Peripheral Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Statin dose guidelines for patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) are largely based on coronary artery disease and stroke data. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of statin intensity on PAD outcomes of amputation and mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using an observational cohort study design and a validated algorithm, we identified patients with incident PAD (2003–2014) in the national Veterans Affairs data. Highest statin intensity exposure (high-intensity versus low-to-moderate–intensity versus antiplatelet therapy but no statin use) was determined within 1 year of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of PAD. Outcomes of interest were lower extremity amputations and death. The association of statin intensity with incident amputation and mortality was assessed with Kaplan-Meier plots, Cox proportional hazards modeling, propensity score–matched analysis, and sensitivity and subgroup analyses, as well, to reduce confounding.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In 155 647 patients with incident PAD, more than a quarter (28%) were not on statins. Use of high-intensity statins was lowest in patients with PAD only (6.4%) in comparison with comorbid coronary/carotid disease (18.4%). Incident amputation and mortality risk declined significantly with any statin use in comparison with the antiplatelet therapy–only group. In adjusted Cox models, the high-intensity statin users were associated with lower amputation risk and mortality in comparison with antiplatelet therapy–only users (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.61–0.74 and hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.70–0.77, respectively). Low-to-moderate–intensity statins also had significant reductions in the risk of amputation and mortality (hazard ratio amputation, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.75– 0.86; hazard ratio death, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.81–0.86) in comparison with no statins (antiplatelet therapy only), but effect size was significantly weaker than the high-intensity statins (<i>P</i><0.001). The association of high-intensity statins with lower amputation and death risk remained significant and robust in propensity score–matched, sensitivity, and subgroup analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Statins, especially high-intensity formulations, are underused in patients with PAD. This is the first population-based study to show that high-intensity statin use at the time of PAD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s is associated with a significant reduction in limb loss and mortality in comparison with low-to-moderate–intensity statin users, and patients treated only with antiplatelet medications but not with statins, as well.</p></sec>

Efficacy and Safety of the Use of Non–Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants in Patients With Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation and Concomitant Aspirin Therapy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Current guidelines recommend non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) as the first-choice therapy in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation because these drugs have several benefits over the vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). It is unknown whether these benefits remain when NOACs have to be combined with aspirin therapy. To assess the efficacy and safety of NOACs compared with VKAs in patients with atrial fibrillation and concomitant aspirin therapy, we conducted a systematic review and study–based meta-analysis of published randomized controlled trials.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A systematic electronic literature search was done in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL Register of Controlled Trials for studies including published data of patients ≥18 years of age with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, randomized to either VKAs or NOACs, or receiving aspirin therapy at any time during the study that report all-cause stroke or systemic embolism, vascular death, myocardial infarction, major bleeding, or intracranial hemorrhage as an outcome. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each outcome were extracted from the individual studies and pooled with random-effects meta-analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>This study-based meta-analysis was restricted to the subgroups of patients on aspirin therapy (n=21 722) from 4 randomized controlled trials comparing VKAs and NOACs (n=71 681) in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. In this meta-analysis including patients on mainly low-dose aspirin, NOACs were found to be more effective (outcome of stroke or systemic embolism: HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.67–0.91; vascular death: HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.76–0.93) and as safe as VKAs with respect to major bleeding (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.69–1.01). NOACs were safer with respect to the reduction of intracranial hemorrhage (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.26–0.56).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This study-based meta-analysis shows that it may be both safer and more effective to use NOACs compared with VKAs to treat patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and concomitant aspirin therapy.</p></sec>

Increase in Endovascular Therapy in Get With The Guidelines-Stroke After the Publication of Pivotal Trials
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Beginning in December 2014, a series of pivotal trials showed that endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) was highly effective, prompting calls to reorganize stroke systems of care. However, there are few data on how these trials influenced the frequency of EVT in clinical practice. We used data from the Get With The Guidelines-Stroke program to determine how the frequency of EVT changed in US practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We analyzed prospectively collected data from a cohort of 2 437 975 patients with ischemic stroke admitted to 2222 participating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>als between April 2003 and the third quarter of 2016. Weighted linear regression with 2 linear splines and a knot at January 2015 was used to compare the slope of the change in EVT use before and after the pivotal trials were published. Potentially eligible patients were defined as last known well to arrival time ≤4.5 hours and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score ≥6.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The frequency of EVT use was slowly increasing before January 2015 but then sharply accelerated thereafter. In the third quarter 2016, EVT was provided to 3.3% of all patients with ischemic stroke at all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>als, representing 15.1% of all patients who were potentially eligible for EVT based on stroke duration and severity. At EVT-capable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>als, 7.5% of all patients with ischemic stroke were treated in the third quarter of 2016, including 27.3% of the potentially eligible patients. From 2013 to 2016, case volumes nearly doubled at EVT-capable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>als. Mean case volume per EVT-capable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al was 37.6 per year in the last 4 quarters. EVT case volumes increased in nearly all US states from 2014 to the last 4 quarters, but with persistent geographic variation unexplained by differences in potential patient eligibility.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>EVT use is increasing rapidly; however, there are still opportunities to treat more patients. Reorganizing stroke systems to route patients to adequately resourced EVT-capable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>als might increase treatment of eligible patients, improve outcomes, and reduce disparities.</p></sec>

Conscious Sedation Versus General Anesthesia for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Conscious sedation is used during transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with limited evidence as to the safety and efficacy of this practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The National Cardiovascular Data Registry Society of Thoracic Surgeons/American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry was used to characterize the anesthesia choice and clinical outcomes of all US patients undergoing elective percutaneous transfemoral TAVR between April 1, 2014, and June 30, 2015. Raw and inverse probability of treatment-weighted analyses were performed to compare patients undergoing TAVR with general anesthesia with patients undergoing TAVR with conscious sedation on an intention-to-treat basis for the primary outcome of in-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al mortality, and secondary outcomes including 30-day mortality, in-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al and 30-day death/stroke, procedural success, intensive care unit and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al length-of-stay, and rates of discharge to home. Post hoc falsification end point analyses were performed to evaluate for residual confounding.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Conscious sedation was used in 1737/10 997 (15.8%) cases with a significant trend of increasing usage over the time period studied (<i>P</i> for trend<0.001). In raw analyses, intraprocedural success with conscious sedation and general anesthesia was similar (98.2% versus 98.5%, <i>P</i>=0.31). The conscious sedation group was less likely to experience in-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al (1.6% versus 2.5%, <i>P</i>=0.03) and 30-day death (2.9% versus 4.1%, <i>P</i>=0.03). Conversion from conscious sedation to general anesthesia was noted in 102 of 1737 (5.9%) of conscious sedation cases. After inverse probability of treatment-weighted adjustment for 51 covariates, conscious sedation was associated with lower procedural success (97.9% versus 98.6%, <i>P</i><0.001) and a reduced rate of mortality at the in-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al (1.5% versus 2.4%, <i>P</i><0.001) and 30-day (2.3% versus 4.0%, <i>P</i><0.001) time points. Conscious sedation was associated with reductions in procedural inotrope requirement, intensive care unit and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al length of stay (6.0 versus 6.5 days, <i>P</i><0.001), and combined 30-day death/stroke rates (4.8% versus 6.4%, <i>P</i><0.001). Falsification end point analyses of vascular complications, bleeding, and new pacemaker/defibrillator implantation demonstrated no significant differences between groups after adjustment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In US practice, conscious sedation is associated with briefer length of stay and lower in-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al and 30-day mortality in comparison with TAVR with general anesthesia in both unadjusted and adjusted analyses. These results suggest the safety of conscious sedation in this population, although comparative effectiveness analyses using observational data cannot definitively establish the superiority of one technique over another.</p></sec>

Phenotypic Characterization of <i>EIF2AK4</i> Mutation Carriers in a Large Cohort of Patients Diagnosed Clinically With Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare disease with an emerging genetic basis. Heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding the bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 (<i>BMPR2</i>) are the commonest genetic cause of PAH, whereas biallelic mutations in the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 4 gene (<i>EIF2AK4</i>) are described in pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis. Here, we determine the frequency of these mutations and define the genotype-phenotype characteristics in a large cohort of patients diagnosed clinically with PAH.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Whole-genome sequencing was performed on DNA from patients with idiopathic and heritable PAH and with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis recruited to the National Institute of Health Research BioResource–Rare Diseases study. Heterozygous variants in <i>BMPR2</i> and biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> variants with a minor allele frequency of <1:10 000 in control data sets and predicted to be deleterious (by combined annotation-dependent depletion, PolyPhen-2, and <i>sorting intolerant from tolerant</i> predictions) were identified as potentially causal. Phenotype data from the time of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s were also captured.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Eight hundred sixty-four patients with idiopathic or heritable PAH and 16 with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis were recruited. Mutations in <i>BMPR2</i> were identified in 130 patients (14.8%). Biallelic mutations in <i>EIF2AK4</i> were identified in 5 patients with a clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis. Furthermore, 9 patients with a clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of PAH carried biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutations. These patients had a reduced transfer coefficient for carbon monoxide (K<sc>co</sc>; 33% [interquartile range, 30%–35%] predicted) and younger age at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s (29 years; interquartile range, 23–38 years) and more interlobular septal thickening and mediastinal lymphadenopathy on computed tomography of the chest compared with patients with PAH without <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutations. However, radiological assessment alone could not accurately identify biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutation carriers. Patients with PAH with biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutations had a shorter survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutations are found in patients classified clinically as having idiopathic and heritable PAH. These patients cannot be identified reliably by computed tomography, but a low K<sc>co</sc> and a young age at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s suggests the underlying molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s.

An Evidence-Based Medicine Approach to Antihyperglycemic Therapy in Diabetes Mellitus to Overcome Overtreatment
<p>Overtreatment is pervasive in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">medicin</span></strong>e and leads to potential patient harms and excessive costs in health care. Although evidence-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">medicin</span></strong>e is often derided as practice by rote algorithmic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">medicin</span></strong>e, the appropriate application of key evidence-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">medicin</span></strong>e principles in clinical decision making is fundamental to preventing overtreatment and promoting high-value, individualized patient-centered care. Specifically, this article discusses the importance of (1) using absolute rather than relative estimates of benefits to inform treatment decisions; (2) considering the time horizon to benefit of treatments; (3) balancing potential harms and benefits; and (4) using shared decision making by physicians to incorporate the patient’s values and preferences into treatment decisions. Here, we illustrate the application of these principles to considering the decision of whether or not to recommend intensive glycemic control to patients to minimize microvascular and cardiovascular complications in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Through this lens, this example will illustrate how an evidence-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">medicin</span></strong>e approach can be used to individualize glycemic goals and prevent overtreatment, and can serve as a template for applying evidence-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">medicin</span></strong>e to inform treatment decisions for other conditions to optimize health and individualize patient care.</p>

Association Between Duration of Resuscitation and Favorable Outcome After Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Little evidence guides the appropriate duration of resuscitation in out-of-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al cardiac arrest, and case features justifying longer or shorter durations are ill defined. We estimated the impact of resuscitation duration on the probability of favorable functional outcome in out-of-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al cardiac arrest using a large, multicenter cohort.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This was a secondary analysis of a North American, single-blind, multicenter, cluster-randomized, clinical trial (ROC-PRIMED [Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium Pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al Resuscitation Using an Impedance Valve and Early Versus Delayed]) of consecutive adults with nontraumatic, emergency medical services–treated out-of-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al cardiac arrest. Primary exposure was duration of resuscitation in minutes (onset of professional resuscitation to return of spontaneous circulation [ROSC] or termination of resuscitation). Primary outcome was survival to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al discharge with favorable outcome (modified Rankin scale [mRS] score of 0–3). Subjects were additionally classified as survival with unfavorable outcome (mRS score of 4–5), ROSC without survival (mRS score of 6), or without ROSC. Subject accrual was plotted as a function of resuscitation duration, and the dynamic probability of favorable outcome at discharge was estimated for the whole cohort and subgroups. Adjusted logistic regression models tested the association between resuscitation duration and survival with favorable outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The primary cohort included 11 368 subjects (median age, 69 years [interquartile range, 56–81 years]; 7121 men [62.6%]). Of these, 4023 (35.4%) achieved ROSC, 1232 (10.8%) survived to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al discharge, and 905 (8.0%) had an mRS score of 0 to 3 at discharge. Distribution of cardiopulmonary resuscitation duration differed by outcome (<i>P</i><0.00001). For cardiopulmonary resuscitation duration up to 37.0 minutes (95% confidence interval, 34.9–40.9 minutes), 99% with an eventual mRS score of 0 to 3 at discharge achieved ROSC. The dynamic probability of an mRS score of 0 to 3 at discharge declined over elapsed resuscitation duration, but subjects with initial shockable cardiac rhythm, witnessed cardiac arrest, and bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation were more likely to survive with favorable outcome after prolonged efforts (30–40 minutes). After adjustment for pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al (odds ratio, 0.93; 95% confidence interval, 0.92–0.95) and inpatient (odds ratio, 0.97; 95% confidence interval, 0.95–0.99) covariates, resuscitation duration was associated with survival to discharge with an mRS score of 0 to 3.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Shorter resuscitation duration was associated with likelihood of favorable outcome at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al discharge.

Rescue of exhausted CD8 T cells by PD-1–targeted therapies is CD28-dependent
<p>Programmed cell death–1 (PD-1)–targeted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">therapi</span></strong>es enhance T cell responses and show efficacy in multiple cancers, but the role of costimulatory molecules in this T cell rescue remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the CD28/B7 costimulatory pathway is essential for effective PD-1 therapy during chronic viral infection. Conditional gene deletion showed a cell-intrinsic requirement of CD28 for CD8 T cell proliferation after PD-1 blockade. B7-costimulation was also necessary for effective PD-1 therapy in tumor-bearing mice. In addition, we found that CD8 T cells proliferating in blood after PD-1 therapy of lung cancer patients were predominantly CD28-positive. Taken together, these data demonstrate CD28-costimulation requirement for CD8 T cell rescue and suggest an important role for the CD28/B7 pathway in PD-1 therapy of cancer patients.</p>

Residual Inflammatory Risk on Treatment With PCSK9 Inhibition and Statin Therapy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The combination of statin therapy and PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibition markedly lowers low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and reduces cardiovascular event rates. Whether residual inflammatory risk as measured by on-treatment high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) remains an important clinical issue in such patients is uncertain.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We evaluated residual inflammatory risk among 9738 patients participating in the SPIRE-1 and SPIRE-2 cardiovascular outcomes trials (Studies of PCSK9 Inhibition and the Reduction in Vascular Events), who were receiving both statin therapy and bococizumab, according to on-treatment levels of hsCRP (hsCRP<sub>OT</sub>) and LDL-C<sub>OT</sub> measured 14 weeks after drug initiation. The primary end point was nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>alization for unstable angina requiring urgent revascularization, or cardiovascular death.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>At 14 weeks, the mean percentage change in LDL-C among statin-treated patients who additionally received bococizumab was −60.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], −61.2 to −59.8; <i>P</i><0.001; median change, −65.4%) as compared to 6.6% (95% CI, −1.0 to 14.1; <i>P</i>=0.09; median change, 0.0%) for hsCRP. Incidence rates for future cardiovascular events for patients treated with both statin therapy and bococizumab according to hsCRP<sub>OT</sub> <1, 1 to 3, and >3 mg/L were 1.96, 2.50, and 3.59 events per 100 person-years, respectively, corresponding to multivariable adjusted hazard ratios of 1.0, 1.16 (95% CI, 0.81–1.66), and 1.62 (95% CI, 1.14–2.30) (<i>P</i>-trend=0.001) after adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk factors and LDL-C<sub>OT</sub>. Comparable adjusted hazard ratios for LDL-C<sub>OT</sub> (<30, 30–50, >50 mg/dL) were 1.0, 0.87, and 1.21, respectively (<i>P</i>-trend=0.16). Relative risk reductions with bococizumab were similar across hsCRP<sub>OT</sub> groups (<i>P</i>-interaction=0.87).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In this post hoc analysis of the SPIRE trials of bococizumab in a stable outpatient population, evidence of residual inflammatory risk persisted among patients treated with both statin therapy and proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 inhibition.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Empagliflozin and Clinical Outcomes in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Established Cardiovascular Disease, and Chronic Kidney Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial (Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients). Urinary glucose excretion with empagliflozin decreases with declining renal function, resulting in less potency for glucose lowering in patients with kidney disease. We investigated the effects of empagliflozin on clinical outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, established cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, established cardiovascular disease, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥30 mL·min<sup>−1</sup>·1.73 m<sup>−2</sup> at screening were randomized to receive empagliflozin 10 mg, empagliflozin 25 mg, or placebo once daily in addition to standard of care. We analyzed cardiovascular death, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>alization for heart failure, all-cause <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>alization, and all-cause mortality in patients with prevalent kidney disease (defined as eGFR <60 mL·min<sup>−1</sup>·1.73 m<sup>−2</sup> and/or urine albumin-creatinine ratio >300 mg/g) at baseline. Additional analyses were performed in subgroups by baseline eGFR (<45, 45–<60, 60–<90, ≥90 mL·min<sup>−1</sup>·1.73 m<sup>−2</sup>) and baseline urine albumin-creatinine ratio (>300, 30–≤300, <30 mg/g).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 7020 patients treated, 2250 patients had prevalent kidney disease at baseline, of whom 67% had a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of type 2 diabetes mellitus for >10 years, 58% were receiving insulin, and 84% were taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. In patients with prevalent kidney disease at baseline, empagliflozin reduced the risk of cardiovascular death by 29% compared with placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52–0.98), the risk of all-cause mortality by 24% (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.59–0.99), the risk of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>alization for heart failure by 39% (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.42–0.87), and the risk of all-cause <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>alization by 19% (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.72–0.92). Effects of empagliflozin on these outcomes were consistent across categories of eGFR and urine albumin-creatinine ratio at baseline and across the 2 doses studied. The adverse event profile of empagliflozin in patients with eGFR <60 mL·min<sup>−1</sup>·1.73 m<sup>−2</sup> was consistent with the overall trial population.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Empagliflozin improved clinical outcomes and reduced mortality in vulnerable patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, established cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Recurrent Hospitalization Among Patients With Atrial Fibrillation Undergoing Intracoronary Stenting Treated With 2 Treatment Strategies of Rivaroxaban or a Dose-Adjusted Oral Vitamin K Antagonist Treatment Strategy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Patients with atrial fibrillation who undergo intracoronary stenting traditionally are treated with a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) plus dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), yet this treatment leads to high risks of bleeding. We hypothesized that a regimen of rivaroxaban plus a P2Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitor monotherapy or rivaroxaban plus DAPT could reduce bleeding and thereby have a favorable impact on all-cause mortality and the need for re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>alization.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Stented subjects with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (n=2124) were randomized 1:1:1 to administration of reduced-dose rivaroxaban 15 mg daily plus a P2Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitor for 12 months (group 1); rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily with stratification to a prespecified duration of DAPT of 1, 6, or 12 months (group 2); or the reference arm of dose-adjusted VKA daily with a similar DAPT stratification (group 3). The present post hoc analysis assessed the end point of all-cause mortality or recurrent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>alization for an adverse event, which was further classified as the result of bleeding, a cardiovascular cause, or another cause blinded to treatment assignment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The risk of all-cause mortality or recurrent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>alization was 34.9% in group 1 (hazard ratio=0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.66–0.94; <i>P</i>=0.008 versus group 3; number needed to treat=15), 31.9% in group 2 (hazard ratio=0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.62–0.90; <i>P</i>=0.002 versus group 3; number needed to treat=10), and 41.9% in group 3 (VKA+DAPT).

Heart Failure Stages Among Older Adults in the Community
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although heart failure (HF) disproportionately affects older adults, little data exist regarding the prevalence of American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association HF stages among older individuals in the community. Additionally, the role of contemporary measures of longitudinal strain and diastolic dysfunction in defining HF stages is unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>HF stages were classified in 6118 participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study (67–91 years of age) at the fifth study visit as follows: A (asymptomatic with HF risk factors but no cardiac structural or functional abnormalities), B (asymptomatic with structural abnormalities, defined as left ventricular hypertrophy, dilation or dysfunction, or significant valvular disease), C1 (clinical HF without prior <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>alization), and C2 (clinical HF with earlier <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>alization).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Using the traditional definitions of HF stages, only 5% of examined participants were free of HF risk factors or structural heart disease (Stage 0), 52% were categorized as Stage A, 30% Stage B, 7% Stage C1, and 6% Stage C2. Worse HF stage was associated with a greater risk of incident HF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>alization or death at a median follow-up of 608 days. Left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction was preserved in 77% and 65% in Stages C1 and C2, respectively. Incorporation of longitudinal strain and diastolic dysfunction into the Stage B definition reclassified 14% of the sample from Stage A to B and improved the net reclassification index (<i>P</i>=0.028) and integrated discrimination index (<i>P</i>=0.016). Abnormal LV structure, systolic function (based on LV ejection fraction and longitudinal strain), and diastolic function (based on e’, E/e’, and left atrial volume index) were each independently and additively associated with risk of incident HF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>alization or death in Stage A and B participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The majority of older adults in the community are at risk for HF (Stages A or B), appreciably more compared with previous reports in younger community-based samples. LV ejection fraction is robustly preserved in at least two-thirds of older adults with prevalent HF (Stage C), highlighting the burden of HF with preserved LV ejection fraction in the elderly. LV diastolic function and longitudinal strain provide incremental prognostic value beyond conventional measures of LV structure and LV ejection fraction in identifying persons at risk for HF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>alization or death.</p></sec>

Outcomes After Acute Myocardial Infarction in HIV-Infected Patients
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>We aimed to assess in-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al case fatality and 1-year prognosis in HIV-infected patients with acute myocardial infarction.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>From the PMSI (Program de Medicalisation des Systèmes d’informatique) database, data from 277 303 consecutive acute myocardial infarction patients <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>alized from January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2009, were analyzed. Surviving patients were followed up for 1 year after discharge. HIV-infected patients were compared with uninfected patients. Among the cohort, HIV-infected patients (n=608) accounted for 0.22%. All-cause <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al and 1-year mortality rates were lower in the HIV-infected group than in uninfected patients (3.1% versus 8.1% [<i>P</i><0.001] and 1.4% versus 5.5% [<i>P</i><0.001], respectively). From the database, we then analyzed a cohort derived from a matching procedure, with 1 HIV patient matched with 2 patients without HIV, based on age and sex (n=1824). Ischemic cardiomyopathy was more frequent in the HIV group (7.6% versus 4.2%, <i>P</i>=0.003). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>alization and 1-year mortality rates were similar in the 2 groups (3.1% versus 2.1% [<i>P</i>=0.168] and 1.4% versus 1.7% [<i>P</i>=0.642], respectively). However, at 12 months, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>alizations for episodes of heart failure were significantly more frequent in HIV-infected than in uninfected patients (3.3% versus 1.4%, respectively; <i>P</i>=0.020). HIV infection, diabetes mellitus, history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, and undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention were associated in univariate analysis with occurrence of heart failure. By multivariable analysis, HIV infection (odds ratio 2.82, 95% confidence interval 1.32–6.01), diabetes mellitus, and undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention remained independent predictors of heart failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>The present study demonstrates that after acute myocardial infarction, HIV status influences long-term risk, although the short-term risk in HIV patients is comparable to that in uninfected patients.</p></sec>

The   protocol used conservative thresholds for C-reactive protein to   direct the medical attendant to aspirate the joint. The protocol   incorporated a clear set of laboratory and clinical criteria that   allowed a patient to be discharged home if all were met. Patients were   included if they presented to our emergency department within 120   days post-operatively with concerns for swelling, pain or infection   and were excluded if they had an unambiguous infection or if their   chief complaint was non-orthopaedic in nature.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Concern for infection was the single most common (32%) reason   for presentation. A total of 296 patients made an emergency visit   and were included following THA or TKA. In the pre-protocol cohort,   11 of 27 patients were formally re-admitted to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al with   concern for infection but only five (45%) patients had actual infections   and received additional treatment. In comparison, in the post-protocol   cohort, 11 patients were admitted for suspected infection, nine   (82%) of whom were truly infected (p = 0.04).

Synovasure ‘quick test’ is not as accurate as the laboratory-based α-defensin immunoassay
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>α-defensin is a biomarker which has been described as having   a high degree of accuracy in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of periprosthetic joint   infection (PJI). Current meta-analyses are based on the α-defensin   laboratory-based immunoassay rather than the quick on-table lateral   flow test kit. This study is the first meta-analysis to compare the   accuracy of the α-defensin laboratory-based immunoassay and the   lateral flow test kit for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of PJI.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A systematic review was performed according to the Preferred   Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.   Inclusion criteria were all clinical studies where the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s   of PJI was uncertain. All studies selected used the Musculoskeletal   Infection Society (MSIS) or modified MSIS criteria. Two independent   reviewers reviewed the studies and extracted data.

Of these, seven studies   (640 patients) evaluated the laboratory-based α-defensin immunoassay   and three (119 patients) the lateral flow test. The pooled sensitivity   and specificity of the qualitative α-defensin laboratory immunoassay   was 0.953 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87 to 0.984) and 0.965 (95%   CI 0.943 to 0.979) respectively. The pooled positive likelihood   ratio (PLR) and negative likelihood ratio (NLR) were 34.86 (95%   CI 19.34 to 62.85) and 0.02 (95% CI 0.00 to 0.11). The pooled sensitivity   and specificity of the lateral flow test were 0.774 (95% CI 0.637   to 0.870) and 0.913 (95% CI 0.828 to 0.958), respectively.

Average age-adjusted rates of ADHF were highest in blacks (38.1 per 1000 black men, 30.5 per 1000 black women), with rates differing by HF type and sex. ADHF rates increased over the 10 years (average annual percentage change: black women +4.3%, black men +3.7%, white women +1.9%, white men +2.6%), mostly reflecting more acute HFpEF. Age-adjusted 28-day and 1-year case fatality proportions were ≈10% and 30%, respectively, similar across race-sex groups and HF types.

Sex Differences in the Presentation and Perception of Symptoms Among Young Patients With Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Some studies report that women are less likely to present with chest pain for acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

Structured patient interviews during the index AMI <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>alization were used to collect information on symptom presentation, perception of symptoms, and care-seeking behaviors. We compared patient characteristics and presentation information by sex. Multivariable hierarchical logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between sex and symptom presentation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The majority of women (87.0%) and men (89.5%) presented with chest pain (defined as pain, pressure, tightness, or discomfort). Women were more likely to present with ≥3 associated symptoms than men (eg, epigastric symptoms, palpitations, and pain or discomfort in the jaw, neck, arms, or between the shoulder blades; 61.9% for women versus 54.8% for men, <i>P</i><0.001). In adjusted analyses, women with an ST-segment–elevation AMI were more likely than men to present without chest pain (odds ratio, 1.51; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–2.22). In comparison with men, women were more likely to perceive symptoms as stress/anxiety (20.9% versus 11.8%, <i>P</i><0.001) but less likely to attribute symptoms to muscle pain (15.4% versus 21.2%, <i>P</i>=0.029).

Genetic and Functional Profiling of CD16-Dependent Natural Killer Activation Identifies Patients at Higher Risk of Cardiac Allograft Vasculopathy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac transplantation is an effective therapy for end-stage heart failure. Because cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the major cause of late mortality after heart transplant (HT), there is a need to identify markers that reflect inflammatory or cytotoxic immune mechanisms contributing to its onset. Noninvasive and early stratification of patients at risk remains a challenge for adapting individualized therapy. The CD16 (Fc-gamma receptor 3A [FCGR3A]) receptor was recently identified as a major determinant of antibody-mediated natural killer (NK) cell activation in HT biopsies; however, little is known about the role of CD16 in promoting allograft vasculopathy. This study aimed to investigate whether markers that reflect CD16-dependent circulating NK cell activation may identify patients at higher risk of developing CAV after HT.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Blood samples were collected from 103 patients undergoing routine coronarography angiography for CAV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s (median 5 years since HT). Genomic and phenotypic analyses of FCGR3A/CD16 Fc-receptor profiles were compared in CAV-positive (n=52) and CAV-free patients (n=51). The levels of CD16 expression and rituximab-dependent cell cytotoxic activity of peripheral NK cells in HT recipients were evaluated using a noninvasive NK-cellular humoral activation test.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Enhanced levels of CD16 expression and antibody-dependent NK cell cytotoxic function of HT recipients were associated with the FCGR3A-VV genotype. The frequency of the FCGR3A-VV genotype was significantly higher in the CAV<sup>+</sup> group (odds ratio, 3.9; <i>P</i>=0.0317) than in the CAV<sup>-</sup> group. The FCGR3A-VV genotype was identified as an independent marker correlated with the presence of CAV at the time of coronary angiography by using multivariate logistic regression models. The FCGR3A-VV genotype was also identified as a baseline-independent predictor of CAV risk (odds ratio, 4.7; <i>P</i>=0.023).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This study unravels a prominent role for the CD16-dependent NK cell activation pathway in the complex array of factors that favor the progression of transplant arteriosclerosis. It highlights the clinical potential of a noninvasive evaluation of FCGR3A/CD16 in the early stratification of CAV risk. The recognition of CD16 as a major checkpoint that controls immune surveillance may promote the design of individualized NK cell–targeted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">therapi</span></strong>es to limit vascular damage in highly responsive sensitized patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Latent Rheumatic Heart Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Screening echocardiography has emerged as a potentially powerful tool for early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of rheumatic heart disease (RHD). The utility of screening echocardiography hinges on the rate of RHD progression and the ability of penicillin prophylaxis to improve outcome. We report the longitudinal outcomes of a cohort of children with latent RHD and identify risk factors for unfavorable outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This was a prospective natural history study conducted under the Ugandan RHD registry. Children with latent RHD and ≥1 year of follow-up were included. All echocardiograms were re-reviewed by experts (2012 World Heart Federation criteria) for inclusion and evidence of change. Bi- and multivariable logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and Cox proportional hazards models, as well, were developed to search for risk factors for unfavorable outcome and compare progression-free survival between those treated and not treated with penicillin. Propensity and other matching methods with sensitivity analysis were implemented for the evaluation of the penicillin effect.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Blinded review confirmed 227 cases of latent RHD: 164 borderline and 63 definite (42 mild, 21 moderate/severe). Median age at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s was 12 years and median follow-up was 2.3 years (interquartile range, 2.0–2.9). Penicillin prophylaxis was prescribed in 49.3% with overall adherence of 84.7%. Of children with moderate-to-severe definite RHD, 47.6% had echo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cardiographi</span></strong>c progression (including 2 deaths), and 9.5% had echo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cardiographi</span></strong>c regression. Children with mild definite and borderline RHD showed 26% and 9.8% echo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cardiographi</span></strong>c progression and 45.2% and 46.3% echo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cardiographi</span></strong>c improvement, respectively. Of those with mild definite RHD or borderline RHD, more advanced disease category, younger age, and morphological mitral valve features were risk factors for an unfavorable outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Latent RHD is a heterogeneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s with variable disease outcomes. Children with moderate to severe latent RHD have poor outcomes. Children with both borderline and mild definite RHD are at substantial risk of progression. Although long-term outcome remains unclear, the initial change in latent RHD may be evident during the first 1 to 2 years following <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s. Natural history data are inherently limited, and a randomized clinical trial is needed to definitively determine the impact of penicillin prophylaxis on the trajectory of latent RHD.</p></sec>

Direct Comparison of Cardiac Myosin-Binding Protein C With Cardiac Troponins for the Early Diagnosis of Acute Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac myosin-binding protein C (cMyC) is a cardiac-restricted protein that is more abundant than cardiac troponins (cTn) and is released more rapidly after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). We evaluated cMyC as an adjunct or alternative to cTn in the early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of AMI.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Unselected patients (N=1954) presenting to the emergency department with symptoms suggestive of AMI, concentrations of cMyC, and high-sensitivity (hs) and standard-sensitivity cTn were measured at presentation. The final <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of AMI was independently adjudicated using all available clinical and biochemical information without knowledge of cMyC. The prognostic end point was long-term mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Final <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s was AMI in 340 patients (17%). Concentrations of cMyC at presentation were significantly higher in those with versus without AMI (median, 237 ng/L versus 13 ng/L, <i>P</i><0.001). Discriminatory power for AMI, as quantified by the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC), was comparable for cMyC (AUC, 0.924), hs-cTnT (AUC, 0.927), and hs-cTnI (AUC, 0.922) and superior to cTnI measured by a contemporary sensitivity assay (AUC, 0.909). The combination of cMyC with hs-cTnT or standard-sensitivity cTnI (but not hs-cTnI) led to an increase in AUC to 0.931 (<i>P</i><0.0001) and 0.926 (<i>P</i>=0.003), respectively. Use of cMyC more accurately classified patients with a single blood test into rule-out or rule-in categories: Net Reclassification Improvement +0.149 versus hs-cTnT, +0.235 versus hs-cTnI (<i>P</i><0.001). In early presenters (chest pain <3 h), the improvement in rule-in/rule-out classification with cMyC was larger compared with hs-cTnT (Net Reclassification Improvement +0.256) and hs-cTnI (Net Reclassification Improvement +0.308; both <i>P</i><0.001). Comparing the C statistics, cMyC was superior to hs-cTnI and standard sensitivity cTnI (<i>P</i><0.05 for both) and similar to hs-cTnT at predicting death at 3 years.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>cMyC at presentation provides discriminatory power comparable to hs-cTnT and hs-cTnI in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of AMI and may perform favorably in patients presenting early after symptom onset.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Atrial Fibrillation and Ventricular Arrhythmias
<p>Sex-specific differences in the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, clinical treatment, and clinical outcomes of atrial fibrillation (AF), sustained ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death are recognized. Sex hormones cause differences in cardiac electrophysiological parameters between men and women that may affect the risk for arrhythmias. The incidence and prevalence of AF is lower in women than in men. However, because women live longer and AF prevalence increases with age, the absolute number of women with AF exceeds that of men. Women with AF are more symptomatic, present with more atypical symptoms, and report worse quality of life in comparison with men. Female sex is an independent risk factor for death or stroke attributable to AF. Oral anticoagulation therapy for stroke prevention has similar efficacy for men and women, but older women treated with warfarin have a higher residual risk of stroke in comparison with men. Women with AF are less likely to receive rhythm control antiarrhythmic drug therapy, electric cardioversion, or catheter ablation in comparison with men. The incidence and prevalence of sustained ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death are lower in women than in men. Women receiving implantable cardioverter defibrillators for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death are less likely to experience sustained ventricular arrhythmias in comparison with men. In contrast, women receiving a cardiac resynchronization therapy implantable cardioverter defibrillator for the treatment of heart failure are more likely to benefit than men. Women are less likely to be referred for implantable cardioverter defibrillator therapy despite current guideline recommendations. Women are more likely to experience a significant complication related to implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantation in comparison with men. Whether sex differences in treatment decisions reflect patient preferences or treatment biases requires further study.</p>

Optimizing a Drone Network to Deliver Automated External Defibrillators
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Public access defibrillation programs can improve survival after out-of-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al cardiac arrest, but automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are rarely available for bystander use at the scene. Drones are an emerging technology that can deliver an AED to the scene of an out-of-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al cardiac arrest for bystander use. We hypothesize that a drone network designed with the aid of a mathematical model combining both optimization and queuing can reduce the time to AED arrival.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We applied our model to 53 702 out-of-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al cardiac arrests that occurred in the 8 regions of the Toronto Regional RescuNET between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2014. Our primary analysis quantified the drone network size required to deliver an AED 1, 2, or 3 minutes faster than historical median 911 response times for each region independently. A secondary analysis quantified the reduction in drone resources required if RescuNET was treated as a large coordinated region.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The region-specific analysis determined that 81 bases and 100 drones would be required to deliver an AED ahead of median 911 response times by 3 minutes. In the most urban region, the 90th percentile of the AED arrival time was reduced by 6 minutes and 43 seconds relative to historical 911 response times in the region. In the most rural region, the 90th percentile was reduced by 10 minutes and 34 seconds. A single coordinated drone network across all regions required 39.5% fewer bases and 30.0% fewer drones to achieve similar AED delivery times.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>An optimized drone network designed with the aid of a novel mathematical model can substantially reduce the AED delivery time to an out-of-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>al cardiac arrest event.</p></sec>

Patients with T1DM were categorized according to number of risk factors not at target: glycohemoglobin, blood pressure, albuminuria, smoking, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Risk of all-cause mortality, acute myocardial infarction, heart failure <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hospit</span></strong>alization, and stroke was examined in relation to the number of risk factors at target.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The mean follow-up was 10.4 years in the diabetes group.

Age-Specific Trends in Incidence, Mortality, and Comorbidities of Heart Failure in Denmark, 1995 to 2012
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The cumulative burden and importance of cardiovascular risk factors have changed over the past decades. Specifically, obesity rates have increased among younger people, whereas cardiovascular health has improved in the elderly.

Association Between a Prolonged PR Interval and Outcomes of Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy

We first tested the association between a prolonged PR interval and outcomes among patients stratified by device type. Next, we performed a comparative effectiveness analysis of CRT-D versus ICD among patients when stratified by PR interval.

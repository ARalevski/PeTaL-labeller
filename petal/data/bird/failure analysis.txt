Defining modes of failure after joint-preserving surgery of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Joint-preserving surgery of the hip (JPSH) has evolved considerably   and now includes a number of procedures, including arthroscopy,   surgical dislocation, and redirectional osteotomies of the femur   and acetabulum. There are a number of different factors which lead   to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e of JPSH. Consequently, it is of interest to assess the   various modes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e in order to continue to identify best practice   and the indications for these procedures. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Using a retrospective observational study design, we reviewed   1013 patients who had undergone JPSH by a single surgeon between   2005 and 2015. There were 509 men and 504 women with a mean age   of 39 years (16 to 78). Of the 1013 operations, 783 were arthroscopies,   122 surgical dislocations, and 108 peri-acetabular osteotomies (PAO).   We analysed the overall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e rates and modes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e. Re-operations   were categorised into four groups: Mode 1 was arthritis progression   or organ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e leading to total hip arthroplasty (THA); Mode 2   was an Incorrect diagnosis/procedure; Mode 3 resulted from malcorrection   of femur (type A), acetabulum (type B), or labrum (type C) and Mode 4   resulted from an unintended consequence of the initial surgical   intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At a mean follow-up of 2.5 years, there had been 104 re-operations   (10.2%) with a mean patient age of 35.5 years (17 to 64). There   were 64 Mode 1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>es (6.3%) at a mean of 3.2 years following   JPSH with a mean patient age of 46.8 years (18 to 64). There were   17 Mode 2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>es (1.7%) at a mean of 2.2 years post-JPSH with   a mean patient age of 28.9 years (17 to 42) (2% scopes; 1% surgical   dislocations). There were 19 Mode 3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>es (1.9%) at a mean of   2.0 years post-JPSH, with a mean patient age of 29.9 years (18 to   51) (2% scopes; 2% surgical dislocations; 5% PAO). There were 4   Mode 4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>es (0.4%) at a mean of 1.8 years post-JPSH with a mean   patient age of 31.5 years (15 to 43).

Standardisation of the modes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e may help identify the best   practice. Application of these modes to large clinical series, such   as registries, will assist in further establishing how to improve   the efficacy of JPSH.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:303–9.</p></sec>

Weight Loss and Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Associations of obesity with incidence of heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e have been observed, but the causality is uncertain. We hypothesized that gastric bypass surgery leads to a lower incidence of heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e compared with intensive lifestyle modification in obese people.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We included obese people without previous heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e from a Swedish nationwide registry of people treated with a structured intensive lifestyle program and the Scandinavian Obesity Surgery Registry. All analyses used inverse probability weights based on baseline body mass index and a propensity score estimated from baseline variables. Treatment groups were well balanced in terms of weight, body mass index, and most potential confounders. Associations of treatment with heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e incidence, as defined in the National Patient Register, were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed with Cox regression.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The 25 804 gastric bypass surgery patients had on average lost 18.8 kg more weight after 1 year and 22.6 kg more after 2 years than the 13 701 lifestyle modification patients. During a median of 4.1 years, surgery patients had lower heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e incidence than lifestyle modification patients (hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% confidence interval, 0.36–0.82). A 10-kg achieved weight loss after 1 year was related to a hazard ratio for heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e of 0.77 (95% confidence interval, 0.60–0.97) in both treatment groups combined. Results were robust in sensitivity analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Gastric bypass surgery was associated with approximately one half the incidence of heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e compared with intensive lifestyle modification in this study of 2 large nationwide registries.

Left Ventricular Assist Device Malfunctions
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Reports of left ventricular assist device (LVAD) malfunction have focused on pump thrombosis. However, the device consists of the pump, driveline, and peripherals, all of which are potentially subject to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Prospectively collected data were reviewed for all LVAD device malfunctions (DMs) occurring in rotary LVADs implanted at a single center between April 2004 and May 2016. Durable LVADs included 108 Heartmate II (HM II) and 105 HeartWare VAD (HVAD). DM data were categorized according to device type and into categories related to the component that failed: (1) controller, (2) peripheral components, and (3) implantable blood pump or its integral electric driveline. Pump-related events were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed as pump-specific (suspected or confirmed thrombosis) or nonpump-specific (driveline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e). DM rates were reported as events per 1000 patient-days, and Cox proportional hazard models were used for time-to-event analyses. Cumulative rates of malfunction were examined for the main components of each type of LVAD.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Types of DM included controller <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e (30%), battery <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e (19%), or patient cable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e (14%), whereas only 13% were because of pump <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e. DMs were more common in the HM II device (3.73 per 1000 patient-days versus 3.06 per 1000 patient-days for the HVAD, <i>P</i><0.01). A higher rate of pump-specific malfunctions was discovered in those implanted with an HM II versus an HVAD (0.55 versus 0.39, respectively; <i>P</i><0.01) and peripheral malfunctions (2.32 versus 1.78 for the HM II and HVAD, respectively; <i>P</i><0.01); no difference occurred in the incidence of controller DM between the 2 LVADs. Patients with HVAD were 90% free of a pump-specific malfunction at 3 years compared with 56% for the HM II (log-rank <i>P</i><0.003). Only 74% of the patients with HM II were free of pump thrombosis at 3 years compared with 90% of the patients with HVAD. Freedom from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e of the integrated driveline was 79% at 3 years for the HM II but 100% for the HVAD (log-rank <i>P</i><0.02).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Device malfunction is much broader than pump <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e alone and occurs for different components at different rates based on the type of LVAD.</p></sec>

Age-Specific Trends in Incidence, Mortality, and Comorbidities of Heart Failure in Denmark, 1995 to 2012
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The cumulative burden and importance of cardiovascular risk factors have changed over the past decades. Specifically, obesity rates have increased among younger people, whereas cardiovascular health has improved in the elderly. Little is known regarding how these changes have impacted the incidence and the mortality rates of heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the age-specific trends in the incidence and 1-year mortality rates following a first-time diagnosis of heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e in Denmark between 1995 and 2012.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We included all Danish individuals >18 years of age with a first-time in-hospital diagnosis of heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e. Data were collected from 3 nationwide Danish registries. Annual incidence rates of heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e and 1-year standardized mortality rates were calculated under the assumption of a Poisson distribution.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We identified 210 430 individuals with a first-time diagnosis of heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e between 1995 and 2012; the annual incidence rates per 10 000 person-years declined among older individuals (rates in 1995 versus 2012: 164 versus 115 in individuals >74 years, 63 versus 35 in individuals 65–74 years, and 20 versus 17 in individuals 55–64 years; <i>P</i><0.0001 for all) but increased among the younger (0.4 versus 0.7 in individuals 18–34 years, 1.3 versus 2.0 in individuals 35–44 years, and 5.0 versus 6.4 in individuals 45–54 years; <i>P</i><0.0001 for all). The proportion of patients with incident heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e ≤50 years of age doubled from 3% in 1995 to 6% in 2012 (<i>P</i><0.0001). Sex- and age-adjusted incidence rate ratios for 2012 versus 1996 were 0.69 (95% confidence interval, 0.67–0.71; <i>P</i><0.0001) among people >50 years of age, and 1.52 (95% confidence interval, 1.33–1.73; <i>P</i><0.0001) among individuals ≤50 years of age; it remained essentially unchanged on additional adjustment for diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, and hypertension.

Small vulnerable sets determine large network cascades in power grids
<p>The understanding of cascading <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>es in complex systems has been hindered by the lack of realistic large-scale modeling and analysis that can account for variable system conditions. Using the North American power grid, we identified, quantified, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed the set of network components that are vulnerable to cascading <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>es under any out of multiple conditions. We show that the vulnerable set consists of a small but topologically central portion of the network and that large cascades are disproportionately more likely to be triggered by initial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>es close to this set. These results elucidate aspects of the origins and causes of cascading <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>es relevant for grid design and operation and demonstrate vulnerability analysis methods that are applicable to a wider class of cascade-prone networks.</p>

Worsening Renal Function in Patients With Acute Heart Failure Undergoing Aggressive Diuresis Is Not Associated With Tubular Injury
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Worsening renal function (WRF) in the setting of aggressive diuresis for acute heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e treatment may reflect renal tubular injury or simply indicate a hemodynamic or functional change in glomerular filtration. Well-validated tubular injury biomarkers, <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, and kidney injury molecule 1, are now available that can quantify the degree of renal tubular injury. The ROSE-AHF trial (Renal Optimization Strategies Evaluation–Acute Heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e) provides an experimental platform for the study of mechanisms of WRF during aggressive diuresis for acute heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e because the ROSE-AHF protocol dictated high-dose loop diuretic therapy in all patients. We sought to determine whether tubular injury biomarkers are associated with WRF in the setting of aggressive diuresis and its association with prognosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients in the multicenter ROSE-AHF trial with baseline and 72-hour urine tubular injury biomarkers were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed (n=283). WRF was defined as a ≥20% decrease in glomerular filtration rate estimated with cystatin C.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Consistent with protocol-driven aggressive dosing of loop diuretics, participants received a median 560 mg IV furosemide equivalents (interquartile range, 300–815 mg), which induced a urine output of 8425 mL (interquartile range, 6341–10 528 mL) over the 72-hour intervention period. Levels of <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase and kidney injury molecule 1 did not change with aggressive diuresis (both <i>P</i>>0.59), whereas levels of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin decreased slightly (−8.7 ng/mg; interquartile range, −169 to 35 ng/mg; <i>P</i><0.001). WRF occurred in 21.2% of the population and was not associated with an increase in any marker of renal tubular injury: neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (<i>P</i>=0.21), <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase (<i>P</i>=0.46), or kidney injury molecule 1 (<i>P</i>=0.22). Increases in neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase, and kidney injury molecule 1 were paradoxically associated with improved survival (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.80 per 10 percentile increase; 95% confidence interval, 0.69–0.91; <i>P</i>=0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Kidney tubular injury does not appear to have an association with WRF in the context of aggressive diuresis of patients with acute heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e.

Although takotsubo cardiomyopathy occurred 20 (range 13–39) months before the study, the majority (88%) of patients had persisting symptoms compatible with heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e (median of 13 [range 0–76] in the Minnesota Living with Heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e Questionnaire) and cardiac limitation on exercise testing (reduced peak oxygen consumption, 24±1.3 versus 31±1.3 mL/kg/min, <i>P</i><0.001; increased VE/V<sc>co</sc><sub>2</sub> slope, 31±1 versus 26±1, <i>P</i>=0.002).

Cardioprotective Role of Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-Associated Factor 2 by Suppressing Apoptosis and Necroptosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Programmed cell death, including apoptosis, mitochondria-mediated necrosis, and necroptosis, is critically involved in ischemic cardiac injury, pathological cardiac remodeling, and heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e progression.

Development and Evolution of a Hierarchical Clinical Composite End Point for the Evaluation of Drugs and Devices for Acute and Chronic Heart Failure
<p>Traditional approaches to the assessment of new treatments for heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e have generally evaluated individual components of the syndrome at fixed points in time or have relied on surrogate physiological measures that are poorly correlated with the clinical status of patients. Conventional time-to-event trials that focus on morbidity and mortality represent an important methodological advance, but they generally assign undue weight to clinical events of less importance and are insensitive to difference in functional capacity among individuals who do not experience a clinical event during follow-up. Twenty years ago, a hierarchical clinical composite was developed to address these limitations; it aims to assess the clinical course of patients as a physician would in practice by combining a symptomatic assessment of the patient at each visit with an evaluation of the clinical stability of the patient between visits. The composite does not generate a numeric score by summing arbitrarily assigned weights to certain symptoms or events; instead, the composite ranks relevant measures and outcomes according to clinical priority. In doing so, the clinical composite minimizes the biases created by noncompleting patients in the assessment of symptoms or exercise tolerance while expanding the range of patients who contribute to the treatment difference in a typical morbidity and mortality trial. When applied appropriately, the hierarchical clinical composite end point has <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reliabl</span></strong>y distinguished effective from ineffective treatments. The composite may have particular advantages in the evaluation of new devices and transcatheter interventions in chronic heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e and of new drugs for acute heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e. Recent modifications enhance its discriminant characteristics and its ability to accurately assess the efficacy of novel interventions for heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e.</p>

Long-Chain Monounsaturated Fatty Acids and Incidence of Congestive Heart Failure in 2 Prospective Cohorts
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Decades-old animal experiments suggested that dietary long-chain monounsaturated fatty acids (LCMUFAs) caused cardiotoxicity, leading, for example, development of Canola oil (Canadian oil low in erucic acid) from rapeseed. However, potential cardiotoxicity in humans and contemporary dietary sources of LCMUFAs are unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We prospectively investigated the associations of plasma phospholipid LCMUFAs (20:1, 22:1, and 24:1), assessed as objective biomarkers of exposure, with incidence congestive heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e in 2 independent cohorts: 3694 older adults (mean age, 75.2±5.2 years) in the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS; 1992–2006) and 3577 middle-aged adults (mean age, 54.1±5.8 years) in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, Minnesota subcohort (ARIC; 1987–2008). We further examined dietary correlates of circulating LCMUFAs in CHS and ARIC and US dietary sources of LCMUFAs in the 2003–2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). In CHS, 997 congestive heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e events occurred during 39 238 person-years; in ARIC, 330 events congestive heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e events occurred during 64 438 person-years. After multivariable adjustment, higher levels of 22:1 and 24:1 were positively associated with greater incident congestive heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e in both CHS and ARIC; hazard ratios were 1.34 (95% confidence interval, 1.02–1.76) and 1.57 (95% confidence interval, 1.11–2.23) for highest versus lowest quintiles of 22:1, respectively, and 1.75 (95% confidence interval, 1.23–2.50) and 1.92 (95% confidence interval, 1.22–3.03) for 24:1, respectively (<i>P</i> for trend ≤0.03 each).

Targeting Chondroitin Sulfate Glycosaminoglycans to Treat Cardiac Fibrosis in Pathological Remodeling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity, and the search for novel therapeutic approaches continues. In the monogenic disease mucopolysaccharidosis VI, loss-of-function mutations in arylsulfatase B lead to myocardial accumulation of chondroitin sulfate (CS) glycosaminoglycans, manifesting as myriad cardiac symptoms. Here, we studied changes in myocardial CS in nonmucopolysaccharidosis failing hearts and assessed its generic role in pathological cardiac remodeling.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Healthy and diseased human and rat left ventricles were subjected to histological and immunostaining methods to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>e glycosaminoglycan distribution. Glycosaminoglycans were extracted and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed for quantitative and compositional changes with Alcian blue assay and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry. Expression changes in 20 CS-related genes were studied in 3 primary human cardiac cell types and THP-1–derived macrophages under each of 9 in vitro stimulatory conditions. In 2 rat models of pathological remodeling induced by transverse aortic constriction or isoprenaline infusion, recombinant human arylsulfatase B (rhASB), clinically used as enzyme replacement therapy in mucopolysaccharidosis VI, was administered intravenously for 7 or 5 weeks, respectively. Cardiac function, myocardial fibrosis, and inflammation were assessed by echocardiography and histology.

Relative composition of CS disaccharides remained unchanged. Transforming growth factor–β induced CS upregulation in cardiac fibroblasts. CS accumulation was also observed in both the pressure-overload and the isoprenaline models of pathological remodeling in rats. Early treatment with rhASB in the transverse aortic constriction model and delayed treatment in the isoprenaline model proved rhASB to be effective at preventing cardiac deterioration and augmenting functional recovery. Functional improvement was accompanied by reduced myocardial inflammation and overall fibrosis. Tumor necrosis factor–α was identified as a direct binding partner of CS glycosaminoglycan chains, and rhASB reduced tumor necrosis factor–α—induced inflammatory gene activation in vitro in endothelial cells and macrophages.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>CS glycosaminoglycans accumulate during cardiac pathological remodeling and mediate myocardial inflammation and fibrosis. rhASB targets CS effectively as a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e.</p></sec>

Nicotinamide Riboside Preserves Cardiac Function in a Mouse Model of Dilated Cardiomyopathy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Myocardial metabolic impairment is a major feature in chronic heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e. As the major coenzyme in fuel oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation and a substrate for enzymes signaling energy stress and oxidative stress response, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) is emerging as a metabolic target in a number of diseases including heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e. Little is known on the mechanisms regulating homeostasis of NAD<sup>+</sup> in the failing heart.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To explore possible alterations of NAD<sup>+</sup> homeostasis in the failing heart, we quantified the expression of NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthetic enzymes in the human failing heart and in the heart of a mouse model of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) triggered by Serum Response Factor transcription factor depletion in the heart (SRF<sup>HKO</sup>) or of cardiac hypertrophy triggered by transverse aorta constriction. We studied the impact of NAD<sup>+</sup> precursor supplementation on cardiac function in both mouse models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We observed a 30% loss in levels of NAD<sup>+</sup> in the murine failing heart of both DCM and transverse aorta constriction mice that was accompanied by a decrease in expression of the nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase enzyme that recycles the nicotinamide precursor, whereas the nicotinamide riboside kinase 2 (NMRK2) that phosphorylates the nicotinamide riboside precursor is increased, to a higher level in the DCM (40-fold) than in transverse aorta constriction (4-fold). This shift was also observed in human failing heart biopsies in comparison with nonfailing controls. We show that the <i>Nmrk2</i> gene is an AMP-activated protein kinase and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α responsive gene that is activated by energy stress and NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion in isolated rat cardiomyocytes. Nicotinamide riboside efficiently rescues NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis in response to FK866-mediated inhibition of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase and stimulates glycolysis in cardiomyocytes. Accordingly, we show that nicotinamide riboside supplementation in food attenuates the development of heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e in mice, more robustly in DCM, and partially after transverse aorta constriction, by stabilizing myocardial NAD<sup>+</sup> levels in the failing heart. Nicotinamide riboside treatment also robustly increases the myocardial levels of 3 metabolites, nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide, methylnicotinamide, and N1-methyl-4-pyridone-5-carboxamide, that can be used as validation biomarkers for the treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The data show that nicotinamide riboside, the most energy-efficient among NAD precursors, could be useful for treatment of heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e, notably in the context of DCM, a disease with few therapeutic options.</p></sec>

In a prospective, parallel group, randomized controlled trial, we examined the effect of 2 years of supervised high-intensity exercise training on LV stiffness.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Sixty-one (48% male) healthy, sedentary, middle-aged participants (53±5 years) were randomly assigned to either 2 years of exercise training (n=34) or attention control (control; n=27). Right heart catheterization and 3-dimensional echocardiography were performed with preload manipulations to define LV end-diastolic pressure-volume relationships and Frank-Starling curves. LV stiffness was calculated by curve fit of the diastolic pressure-volume curve. Maximal oxygen uptake (Vo<sub>2</sub>max) was measured to quantify changes in fitness.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Fifty-three participants completed the study. Adherence to prescribed exercise sessions was 88±11%. Vo<sub>2</sub>max increased by 18% (exercise training: pre 29.0±4.8 to post 34.4±6.4; control: pre 29.5±5.3 to post 28.7±5.4, group×time <i>P</i><0.001) and LV stiffness was reduced (right/downward shift in the end-diastolic pressure-volume relationships; preexercise training stiffness constant 0.072±0.037 to postexercise training 0.051±0.0268, <i>P</i>=0.0018), whereas there was no change in controls (group×time <i>P</i><0.001; pre stiffness constant 0.0635±0.026 to post 0.062±0.031, <i>P</i>=0.83). Exercise increased LV end-diastolic volume (group×time <i>P</i><0.001), whereas pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was unchanged, providing greater stroke volume for any given filling pressure (loading×group×time <i>P</i>=0.007).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In previously sedentary healthy middle-aged adults, 2 years of exercise training improved maximal oxygen uptake and decreased cardiac stiffness.

A Novel α-Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide Analogue Protects Against End-Organ Damage in Experimental Hypertension, Cardiac Hypertrophy, and Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Research into the therapeutic potential of α-calcitonin gene–related peptide (α-CGRP) has been limited because of its peptide nature and short half-life. Here, we evaluate whether a novel potent and long-lasting (<i>t</i><sub>½</sub> ≥7 hours) acylated α-CGRP analogue (αAnalogue) could alleviate and reverse cardiovascular disease in 2 distinct murine models of hypertension and heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e in vivo.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The ability of the αAnalogue to act selectively via the CGRP pathway was shown in skin by using a CGRP receptor antagonist. The effect of the αAnalogue on angiotensin II–induced hypertension was investigated over 14 days. Blood pressure was measured by radiotelemetry. The ability of the αAnalogue to modulate heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e was studied in an abdominal aortic constriction model of murine cardiac hypertrophy and heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e over 5 weeks. Extensive ex vivo analysis was performed via RNA analysis, Western blot, and histology.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The angiotensin II–induced hypertension was attenuated by cotreatment with the αAnalogue (50 nmol·kg<sup>–1</sup>·d<sup>–1</sup>, SC, at a dose selected for lack of long-term hypotensive effects at baseline). The αAnalogue protected against vascular, renal, and cardiac dysfunction, characterized by reduced hypertrophy and biomarkers of fibrosis, remodeling, inflammation, and oxidative stress. In a separate study, the αAnalogue reversed angiotensin II–induced hypertension and associated vascular and cardiac damage. The αAnalogue was effective over 5 weeks in a murine model of cardiac hypertrophy and heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e. It preserved heart function, assessed by echocardiography, while protecting against adverse cardiac remodeling and apoptosis. Moreover, treatment with the αAnalogue was well tolerated with neither signs of desensitization nor behavioral changes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These findings, in 2 distinct models, provide the first evidence for the therapeutic potential of a stabilized αAnalogue, by mediating (1) antihypertensive effects, (2) attenuating cardiac remodeling, and (3) increasing angiogenesis and cell survival to protect against and limit damage associated with the progression of cardiovascular diseases. This indicates the therapeutic potential of the CGRP pathway and the possibility that this injectable CGRP analogue may be effective in cardiac disease.</p></sec>

High-Resolution Mapping of Chromatin Conformation in Cardiac Myocytes Reveals Structural Remodeling of the Epigenome in Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiovascular disease is associated with epigenomic changes in the heart; however, the endogenous structure of cardiac myocyte chromatin has never been determined.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To investigate the mechanisms of epigenomic function in the heart, genome-wide chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) and DNA sequencing were performed in adult cardiac myocytes following development of pressure overload–induced hypertrophy. Mice with cardiac-specific deletion of CTCF (a ubiquitous chromatin structural protein) were generated to explore the role of this protein in chromatin structure and cardiac phenotype. Transcriptome analyses by RNA-seq were conducted as a functional readout of the epigenomic structural changes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Depletion of CTCF was sufficient to induce heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e in mice, and human patients with heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e receiving mechanical unloading via left ventricular assist devices show increased CTCF abundance. Chromatin structural analyses revealed interactions within the cardiac myocyte genome at 5-kb resolution, enabling examination of intra- and interchromosomal events, and providing a resource for future cardiac epigenomic investigations. Pressure overload or CTCF depletion selectively altered boundary strength between topologically associating domains and A/B compartmentalization, measurements of genome accessibility. Heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e involved decreased stability of chromatin interactions around disease-causing genes. In addition, pressure overload or CTCF depletion remodeled long-range interactions of cardiac enhancers, resulting in a significant decrease in local chromatin interactions around these functional elements.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These findings provide a high-resolution chromatin architecture resource for cardiac epigenomic investigations and demonstrate that global structural remodeling of chromatin underpins heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e. The newly identified principles of endogenous chromatin structure have key implications for epigenetic therapy.</p></sec>

Potential Deaths Averted and Serious Adverse Events Incurred From Adoption of the SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) Intensive Blood Pressure Regimen in the United States
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) demonstrated a 27% reduction in all-cause mortality with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) goal of <120 versus <140 mm Hg among US adults at high cardiovascular disease risk but without diabetes mellitus, stroke, or heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e. To quantify the potential benefits and risks of SPRINT intensive goal implementation, we estimated the deaths prevented and excess serious adverse events incurred if the SPRINT intensive SBP treatment goal were implemented in all eligible US adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>SPRINT eligibility criteria were applied to the 1999 to 2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and linked with the National Death Index through December 2011. SPRINT eligibility included age ≥50 years, SBP of 130 to 180 mm Hg (depending on the number of antihypertensive medications being taken), and high cardiovascular disease risk. Exclusion criteria were diabetes mellitus, history of stroke, >1 g proteinuria, heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e, estimated glomerular filtration rate <20 mL·min<sup>−1</sup>·1.73 m<sup>−2</sup>, or dialysis. Annual mortality rates were calculated by dividing the Kaplan-Meier 5-year mortality by 5. Hazard ratios for all-cause mortality and heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e and absolute risks for serious adverse events in SPRINT were used to estimate the number of potential deaths and heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e cases prevented and serious adverse events incurred with intensive SBP treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The mean age was 68.6 years, and 83.2% and 7.4% were non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black, respectively. The annual mortality rate was 2.20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.91–2.48), and intensive SBP treatment was projected to prevent ≈107 500 deaths per year (95% CI, 93 300–121 200) and give rise to 56 100 (95% CI, 50 800–61 400) episodes of hypotension, 34 400 (95% CI, 31 200–37 600) episodes of syncope, 43 400 (95% CI, 39 400–47 500) serious electrolyte disorders, and 88 700 (95% CI, 80 400–97 000) cases of acute kidney injury per year. The analysis-of-extremes approach indicated that the range of estimated lower- and upper-bound number of deaths prevented per year with intensive SBP control was 34 600 to 179 600. Intensive SBP control was projected to prevent 46 100 (95% CI, 41 800–50 400) cases of heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e annually.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>If fully implemented in eligible US adults, intensive SBP treatment could prevent ≈107 500 deaths per year. A consequence of this treatment strategy, however, could be an increase in serious adverse events.</p></sec>

Range of Risk Factor Levels
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) have a high risk of cardiovascular complications, but it is unknown to what extent fulfilling all cardiovascular treatment goals is associated with residual risk of mortality and cardiovascular outcomes in those with T1DM compared with the general population.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We included all patients ≥18 years of age with T1DM who were registered in the Swedish National Diabetes Register from January 1, 1998, through December 31, 2014, a total of 33 333 patients, each matched for age and sex with 5 controls without diabetes mellitus randomly selected from the population. Patients with T1DM were categorized according to number of risk factors not at target: glycohemoglobin, blood pressure, albuminuria, smoking, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Risk of all-cause mortality, acute myocardial infarction, heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e hospitalization, and stroke was examined in relation to the number of risk factors at target.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The mean follow-up was 10.4 years in the diabetes group. Overall, 2074 of 33 333 patients with diabetes mellitus and 4141 of 166 529 controls died. Risk for all outcomes increased stepwise for each additional risk factor not at target. Adjusted hazard ratios for patients achieving all risk factor targets compared with controls were 1.31 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.93–1.85) for all-cause mortality, 1.82 (95% CI, 1.15–2.88) for acute myocardial infarction, 1.97 (95% CI, 1.04–3.73) for heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e hospitalization, and 1.17 (95% CI, 0.51–2.68) for stroke. The hazard ratio for patients versus controls with none of the risk factors meeting target was 7.33 (95% CI, 5.08–10.57) for all-cause mortality, 12.34 (95% CI, 7.91–19.48) for acute myocardial infarction, 15.09 (95% CI, 9.87–23.09) for heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e hospitalization, and 12.02 (95% CI, 7.66–18.85) for stroke.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>A steep-graded association exists between decreasing number of cardiovascular risk factors at target and major adverse cardiovascular outcomes among patients with T1DM.

Impact of Practice-Based Management of Pulmonary Artery Pressures in 2000 Patients Implanted With the CardioMEMS Sensor
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Elevated pulmonary artery (PA) pressures in patients with heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e are associated with a high risk for hospitalization and mortality. Recent clinical trial evidence demonstrated a direct relationship between lowering remotely monitored PA pressures and heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e hospitalization risk reduction with a novel implantable PA pressure monitoring system (CardioMEMS HF System, St. Jude Medical). This study examines PA pressure changes in the first 2000 US patients implanted in general practice use.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Deidentified data from the remote monitoring Merlin.net (St. Jude Medical) database were used to examine PA pressure trends from the first consecutive 2000 patients with at least 6 months of follow-up. Changes in PA pressures were evaluated with an area under the curve methodology to estimate the total sum increase or decrease in pressures (mm Hg-day) during the follow-up period relative to the baseline pressure. As a reference, the PA pressure trends were compared with the historic CHAMPION clinical trial (CardioMEMS Heart Sensor Allows Monitoring of Pressure to Improve Outcomes in New York Heart Association [NYHA] Functional Class III Heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e Patients). The area under the curve results are presented as mean±2 SE, and <i>P</i> values comparing the area under the curve of the general-use cohort with outcomes in the CHAMPION trial were computed by the <i>t</i> test with equal variance.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Patients were on average 70±12 years old; 60% were male; 34% had preserved ejection fraction; and patients were followed up for an average of 333±125 days. At implantation, the mean PA pressure for the general-use patients was 34.9±10.2 mm Hg compared with 31.3±10.9 mm Hg for CHAMPION treatment and 32.0±10.5 mm Hg for CHAMPION control groups. The general-use patients had an area under the curve of −32.8 mm Hg-day at the 1-month time mark, −156.2 mm Hg-day at the 3-month time mark, and −434.0 mm Hg-day after 6 months of hemodynamic guided care, which was significantly lower than the treatment group in the CHAMPION trial.

Can we predict which dysplastic hips will require acetabular augmentation during total hip arthroplasty based on pre-operative radiographs?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether an innovative   templating technique could predict the need for acetabular augmentation   during primary total hip arthroplasty for patients with dysplastic   hips.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We developed a simple templating technique to estimate acetabular   component coverage at total hip arthroplasty, the True Cup: False   Cup (TC:FC) ratio. We reviewed all patients with dysplastic hips   who underwent primary total hip arthroplasty between 2005 and 2012.   Traditional radiological methods of assessing the degree of acetabular dysplasia   (Sharp’s angle, Tönnis angle, centre-edge angle) as well as the   TC:FC ratio were measured from the pre-operative radiographs. A   comparison of augmented and non-augmented hips was undertaken to   determine any difference in pre-operative radiological indices between   the two cohorts. The intra- and inter-observer reliability for all   radiological indices used in the study were also calculated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of the 128 cases reviewed, 33 (26%) needed acetabular augmentation.   We found no difference in the median Sharp’s angle (p = 0.10), Tönnis   angle (p = 0.28), or centre-edge angle (p = 0.07) between the two   groups. A lower TC:FC ratio was observed in the augmented group   compared with the non-augmented group (median = 0.66 <i>versus</i> 0.88, p < 0.001).   Intra-observer reliability was found to be high for all radiological   indices analysed (interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) > 0.7).

A new and reliable classification system for fractures of the navicular and associated injuries to the midfoot
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Fractures of the navicular can occur in isolation but, owing   to the intimate anatomical and biomechanical relationships, are   often associated with other injuries to the neighbouring bones and   joints in the foot. As a result, they can lead to long-term morbidity   and poor function. Our aim in this study was to identify patterns   of injury in a new classification system of traumatic fractures   of the navicular, with consideration being given to the commonly associated   injuries to the midfoot.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We undertook a retrospective review of 285 consecutive patients   presenting over an eight- year period with a fracture of the navicular.   Five common patterns of injury were identified and classified according   to the radiological features. Type 1 fractures are dorsal avulsion   injuries related to the capsule of the talonavicular joint. Type   2 fractures are isolated avulsion injuries to the tuberosity of   the navicular. Type 3 fractures are a variant of tarsometatarsal   fracture/dislocations creating instability of the medial ray. Type   4 fractures involve the body of the navicular with no associated   injury to the lateral column and type 5 fractures occur in conjunction   with disruption of the midtarsal joint with crushing of the medial   or lateral, or both, columns of the foot.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In order to test the reliability and reproducibility of this   new classification, a cohort of 30 patients with a fracture of the   navicular were classified by six independent assessors at two separate   times, six months apart. Interobserver reliability and intraobserver   reproducibility both had substantial agreement, with kappa values   of 0.80 and 0.72, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We propose a logical, all-inclusive, and mutually exclusive classification   system for fractures of the navicular that gives associated injuries   involving the lateral column due consideration.

Kelch-like ECT2-interacting protein KLEIP regulates late-stage pulmonary maturation via Hif-2α in mice
<p>Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) caused by preterm delivery is a major clinical problem with limited mechanistic insight. Late-stage embryonic lung development is driven by hypoxia and the hypoxia-inducible transcription factors Hif-1α and Hif-2α, which act as important regulators for lung development. Expression of the BTB-and kelch-domain-containing (BTB-kelch) protein KLEIP (Kelch-like ECT2-interacting protein; also named Klhl20) is controlled by two hypoxia response elements, and KLEIP regulates stabilization and transcriptional activation of Hif-2α. Based on the available data, we hypothesized an essential role for KLEIP in murine lung development and function. Therefore, we have performed a functional, histological, mechanistic and interventional study in embryonic and neonatal <i>KLEIP</i><sup>−/−</sup> mice. Here, we show that about half of the <i>KLEIP<sup>−/−</sup></i> neonates die due to respiratory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e that is caused by insufficient aeration, reduced septal thinning, reduced glycogenolysis, type II pneumocyte immaturity and reduced surfactant production. Expression analyses in embryonic day (E) 18.5 lungs identified KLEIP in lung capillaries, and showed strongly reduced mRNA and protein levels for Hif-2α and VEGF; such reduced levels are associated with embryonic endothelial cell apoptosis and lung bleedings. Betamethasone injection in pregnant females prevented respiratory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e in <i>KLEIP<sup>−/−</sup></i> neonates, normalized lung maturation, vascularization, aeration and function, and increased neonatal Hif-2α expression. Thus, the experimental study shows that respiratory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e in <i>KLEIP<sup>−/−</sup></i> neonates is determined by insufficient angiocrine Hif-2α–VEGF signaling and that betamethasone activates this newly identified signaling cascade in late-stage embryonic lung development.</p>

Atrial Fibrillation Burden in Young Patients With Congenital Heart Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) are assumed to be vulnerable to atrial fibrillation (AF) as a result of residual shunts, anomalous vessel anatomy, progressive valvulopathy, hypertension, and atrial scars from previous heart surgery. However, the risk of developing AF and the complications associated with AF in children and young adults with CHD have not been compared with those in control subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data from the Swedish Patient and Cause of Death registers were used to identify all patients with a diagnosis of CHD who were born from 1970 to 1993. Each patient with CHD was matched by birth year, sex, and county with 10 control subjects from the Total Population Register in Sweden. Follow-up data were collected until 2011.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 21 982 patients (51.6% men) with CHD and 219 816 matched control subjects, 654 and 328 developed AF, respectively. The mean follow-up was 27 years. The risk of developing AF was 21.99 times higher (95% confidence interval, 19.26–25.12) in patients with CHD than control subjects. According to a hierarchical CHD classification, patients with conotruncal defects had the highest risk (hazard ratio, 84.27; 95% confidence interval, 56.86–124.89). At the age of 42 years, 8.3% of all patients with CHD had a recorded diagnosis of AF. Heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e was the quantitatively most important complication in patients with CHD and AF, with a 10.7% (70 of 654) recorded diagnosis of heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The risk of AF in children and young adults with CHD was 22 times higher than that in matched control subjects. Up to the age of 42 years, 1 of 12 patients with CHD had developed AF, and 1 of 10 patients with CHD with AF had developed heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e. The patient groups with the most complex congenital defects carried the greatest risk of AF and could be considered for targeted monitoring.</p></sec>

Pregnancy Outcomes in Women With Rheumatic Mitral Valve Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac disease is 1 of the major causes of maternal mortality. We studied pregnancy outcomes in women with rheumatic mitral valve disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The Registry of Pregnancy and Cardiac Disease is an international prospective registry, and consecutive pregnant women with cardiac disease were included. Pregnancy outcomes in all women with rheumatic mitral valve disease and no prepregnancy valve replacement is described in the present study (n=390). A maternal cardiac event was defined as cardiac death, arrhythmia requiring treatment, heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e, thromboembolic event, aortic dissection, endocarditis, acute coronary syndrome, and hospitalization for other cardiac reasons or cardiac intervention. Associations between patient characteristics and cardiac outcomes were checked in a 3-level model (patient–center–country).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Most patients came from emerging countries (75%). Mitral stenosis (MS) with or without mitral regurgitation (MR) was present in 273 women, isolated MR in 117. The degree of MS was mild in 20.9%, moderate in 39.2%, severe in 19.8%, and severity not classified in the remainder. Maternal death during pregnancy occurred in 1 patient with severe MS. Hospital admission occurred in 23.1% of the women with MS, and the main reason was heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e (mild MS 15.8%, moderate 23.4%, severe 48.1%; <i>P</i><0.001). Heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e occurred in 23.1% of patients with moderate or severe MR. An intervention during pregnancy was performed in 16 patients, 14 had percutaneous balloon mitral commissurotomy, and 2 had surgical valve replacement (1 for MS, 1 for MR). In multivariable modeling, prepregnancy New York Heart Association class >1 was an independent predictor of maternal cardiac events. Follow-up at 6 months postpartum was available for 53%, and 3 more patients died (1 with severe MS, 1 with moderate MS, 1 with moderate to severe MR).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Although mortality was only 1.9% during pregnancy, ≈50% of the patients with severe rheumatic MS and 23% of those with significant MR developed heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e during pregnancy. Prepregnancy counseling and considering mitral valve interventions in selected patients are important to prevent these complications.</p></sec>

Diagnostic Accuracy of the Aortic Dissection Detection Risk Score Plus D-Dimer for Acute Aortic Syndromes
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Acute aortic syndromes (AASs) are rare and severe cardiovascular emergencies with unspecific symptoms. For AASs, both misdiagnosis and overtesting are key concerns, and standardized diagnostic strategies may help physicians to balance these risks. D-dimer (DD) is highly sensitive for AAS but is inadequate as a stand-alone test. Integration of pretest probability assessment with DD testing is feasible, but the safety and efficiency of such a diagnostic strategy are currently unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a multicenter prospective observational study involving 6 hospitals in 4 countries from 2014 to 2016, consecutive outpatients were eligible if they had ≥1 of the following: chest/abdominal/back pain, syncope, perfusion deficit, and if AAS was in the differential diagnosis. The tool for pretest probability assessment was the aortic dissection detection risk score (ADD-RS, 0–3) per current guidelines. DD was considered negative (DD−) if <500 ng/mL. Final case adjudication was based on conclusive diagnostic imaging, autopsy, surgery, or 14-day follow-up. Outcomes were the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e rate and efficiency of a diagnostic strategy for ruling out AAS in patients with ADD-RS=0/DD− or ADD-RS ≤1/DD−.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 1850 patients were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed. Of these, 438 patients (24%) had ADD-RS=0, 1071 patients (58%) had ADD-RS=1, and 341 patients (18%) had ADD-RS >1. Two hundred forty-one patients (13%) had AAS: 125 had type A aortic dissection, 53 had type B aortic dissection, 35 had intramural aortic hematoma, 18 had aortic rupture, and 10 had penetrating aortic ulcer. A positive DD test result had an overall sensitivity of 96.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 93.6–98.6) and a specificity of 64% (95% CI, 61.6–66.4) for the diagnosis of AAS; 8 patients with AAS had DD−. In 294 patients with ADD-RS=0/DD−, 1 case of AAS was observed. This yielded a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e rate of 0.3% (95% CI, 0.1–1.9) and an efficiency of 15.9% (95% CI, 14.3–17.6) for the ADD-RS=0/DD− strategy. In 924 patients with ADD-RS ≤1/DD−, 3 cases of AAS were observed. This yielded a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e rate of 0.3% (95% CI, 0.1–1) and an efficiency of 49.9% (95% CI, 47.7–52.2) for the ADD-RS ≤1/DD− strategy.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Integration of ADD-RS (either ADD-RS=0 or ADD-RS ≤1) with DD may be considered to standardize diagnostic rule out of AAS.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Additional analyses were performed in subgroups by baseline eGFR (<45, 45–<60, 60–<90, ≥90 mL·min<sup>−1</sup>·1.73 m<sup>−2</sup>) and baseline urine albumin-creatinine ratio (>300, 30–≤300, <30 mg/g).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 7020 patients treated, 2250 patients had prevalent kidney disease at baseline, of whom 67% had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus for >10 years, 58% were receiving insulin, and 84% were taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. In patients with prevalent kidney disease at baseline, empagliflozin reduced the risk of cardiovascular death by 29% compared with placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52–0.98), the risk of all-cause mortality by 24% (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.59–0.99), the risk of hospitalization for heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e by 39% (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.42–0.87), and the risk of all-cause hospitalization by 19% (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.72–0.92).

Novel Desmin Mutation p.Glu401Asp Impairs Filament Formation, Disrupts Cell Membrane Integrity, and Causes Severe Arrhythmogenic Left Ventricular Cardiomyopathy/Dysplasia
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Desmin (<i>DES</i>) mutations cause severe skeletal and cardiac muscle disease with heterogeneous phenotypes. Recently, <i>DES</i> mutations were described in patients with inherited arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia, although their cellular and molecular pathomechanisms are not precisely known. Our aim is to describe clinically and functionally the novel <i>DES</i>-p.Glu401Asp mutation as a cause of inherited left ventricular arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy/dysplasia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We identified the novel <i>DES</i> mutation p.Glu401Asp in a large Spanish family with inherited left ventricular arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy/dysplasia and a high incidence of adverse cardiac events. A full clinical evaluation was performed on all mutation carriers and noncarriers to establish clinical and genetic cosegregation. In addition, desmin, and intercalar disc–related proteins expression were histologically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed in explanted cardiac tissue affected by the <i>DES</i> mutation. Furthermore, mesenchymal stem cells were isolated and cultured from 2 family members with the <i>DES</i> mutation (1 with mild and 1 with severe symptomatology) and a member without the mutation (control) and differentiated ex vivo to cardiomyocytes. Then, important genes related to cardiac differentiation and function were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Finally, the p.Glu401Asp mutated <i>DES</i> gene was transfected into cell lines and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed by confocal microscopy.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of the 66 family members screened for the <i>DES</i>-p.Glu401Asp mutation, 23 of them were positive, 6 were obligate carriers, and 2 were likely carriers. One hundred percent of genotype-positive patients presented data consistent with inherited arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy/dysplasia phenotype with variable disease severity expression, high-incidence of sudden cardiac death, and absence of skeletal myopathy or conduction system disorders. Immunohistochemistry was compatible with inherited arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy/dysplasia, and the functional study showed an abnormal growth pattern and cellular adhesion, reduced desmin RNA expression, and some other membrane proteins, as well, and desmin aggregates in transfected cells expressing the mutant desmin.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The <i>DES</i>-p.Glu401Asp mutation causes predominant inherited left ventricular arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy/dysplasia with a high incidence of adverse clinical events in the absence of skeletal myopathy or conduction system disorders.

Targeting Transmembrane BAX Inhibitor Motif Containing 1 Alleviates Pathological Cardiac Hypertrophy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac hypertrophy and its resultant heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e are among the most common causes of mortality worldwide. Abnormal protein degradation, especially the impaired lysosomal degradation of large organelles and membrane proteins, is involved in the progression of cardiac hypertrophy. However, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We investigated cardiac transmembrane BAX inhibitor motif containing 1 (TMBIM1) mRNA and protein expression levels in samples from patients with heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e and mice with aortic banding (AB)–induced cardiac hypertrophy. We generated cardiac-specific <i>Tmbim1</i> knockout mice and cardiac-specific <i>Tmbim1</i>-overexpressing transgenic mice and then challenged them with AB surgery. We used microarray, confocal image, and coimmunoprecipitation analyses to identify the downstream targets of TMBIM1 in cardiac hypertrophy. <i>Tmbim1</i>/<i>Tlr4</i> double-knockout mice were generated to investigate whether the effects of TMBIM1 on cardiac hypertrophy were Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) dependent. Finally, lentivirus-mediated <i>TMBIM1</i> overexpression in a monkey AB model was performed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of TMBIM1.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>TMBIM1 expression was significantly downregulated on hypertrophic stimuli in both human and mice heart samples. Silencing cardiac <i>Tmbim1</i> aggravated AB-induced cardiac hypertrophy. This effect was blunted by <i>Tmbim1</i> overexpression. Transcriptome profiling revealed that the TLR4 signaling pathway was disrupted dramatically by manipulation of <i>Tmbim1</i>. The effects of TMBIM1 on cardiac hypertrophy were shown to be dependent on TLR4 in double-knockout mice. Fluorescent staining indicated that TMBIM1 promoted the lysosome-mediated degradation of activated TLR4. Coimmunoprecipitation assays confirmed that TMBIM1 directly interacted with tumor susceptibility gene 101 via a PTAP motif and accelerated the formation of multivesicular bodies that delivered TLR4 to the lysosomes. Finally, lentivirus-mediated <i>TMBIM1</i> overexpression reversed AB-induced cardiac hypertrophy in monkeys.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>TMBIM1 protects against pathological cardiac hypertrophy through promoting the lysosomal degradation of activated TLR4. Our findings reveal the central role of TMBIM1 as a multivesicular body regulator in the progression of pathological cardiac hypertrophy, as well as the role of vesicle trafficking in signaling regulation during cardiac hypertrophy. Moreover, targeting TMBIM1 could be a novel therapeutic strategy for treating cardiac hypertrophy and heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e.</p></sec>

Cardiovascular Outcomes and Risks After Initiation of a Sodium Glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitor
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Clinical trials have shown cardiovascular benefits and potential risks from sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i). Trials may have limited ability to address individual end points or safety concerns.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed a population-based cohort study among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with established cardiovascular disease newly initiated on antihyperglycemic agents within the US Department of Defense Military Health System between April 1, 2013, and December 31, 2016. Incidence rates, hazard ratios (HRs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for time to first composite end point of all-cause mortality and hospitalization for heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e event, major adverse cardiovascular events (defined as all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke), and individual end points were evaluated using conditional Cox models comparing new SGLT2i users with other antihyperglycemic agents. The exploratory safety end point was below-knee lower extremity amputation. Intent-to-treat and on-treatment analyses were performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>After propensity matching, 25 258 patients were followed for a median of 1.6 years.

Long-Term Potassium Monitoring and Dynamics in Heart Failure and Risk of Mortality
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The prognostic value of long-term potassium monitoring and dynamics in heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e has not been characterized completely. We sought to determine the association between serum potassium values collected at follow-up with all-cause mortality in a prospective and consecutive cohort of patients discharged from a previous acute heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e admission.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Serum potassium was measured at every physician-patient encounter, including hospital admissions and ambulatory settings. The multivariable-adjusted association of serum potassium with mortality was assessed by using comprehensive state-of-the-art regression methods that can accommodate time-dependent exposure modeling.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The study sample included 2164 patients with a total of 16 116 potassium observations. Mean potassium at discharge was 4.3±0.48 mEq/L. Hypokalemia (<3.5 mEq/L), normokalemia (3.5–5.0 mEq/L), and hyperkalemia (>5 mEq/L) were observed at the index admission in 77 (3.6%), 1965 (90.8%), and 122 (5.6%) patients, respectively. At a median follow-up of 2.8 years (range, 0.03–12.8 years), 1090 patients died (50.4%). On a continuous scale, the multivariable-adjusted association of potassium values and mortality revealed a nonlinear association (U-shaped) with higher risk at both ends of its distribution (omnibus <i>P</i>=0.001). Likewise, the adjusted hazard ratios for hypokalemia and hyperkalemia, normokalemia as reference, were 2.35 (95% confidence interval, 1.40–3.93; <i>P</i>=0.001) and 1.55 (95% confidence interval, 1.11–2.16; <i>P</i>=0.011), respectively (omnibus <i>P</i>=0.0003).

Functional Characterization of the <i>GUCY1A3</i> Coronary Artery Disease Risk Locus
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>A chromosomal locus at 4q32.1 has been genome-wide significantly associated with coronary artery disease risk. The locus encompasses <i>GUCY1A3</i>, which encodes the α<sub>1</sub> subunit of the soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC), a key enzyme in the nitric oxide/cGMP signaling pathway. The mechanism linking common variants in this region with coronary risk is not known.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Gene expression and protein expression were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed with quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting, respectively. Putative allele-specific transcription factors were identified with in silico analyses and validated via allele-specific quantification of antibody-precipitated chromatin fractions. Regulatory properties of the lead risk variant region were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed with reporter gene assays. To assess the effect of zinc finger E box-binding homeobox 1 transcription factor (ZEB1), siRNA-mediated knockdown and overexpression experiments were performed. Association of <i>GUCY1A3</i> genotype and cellular phenotypes was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed with vascular smooth muscle cell migration assays and platelet aggregation analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Whole-blood <i>GUCY1A3</i> mRNA levels were significantly lower in individuals homozygous for the lead (rs7692387) risk variant. Likewise, reporter gene assays demonstrated significantly lower <i>GUCY1A3</i> promoter activity for constructs carrying this allele. In silico analyses located a DNase I hypersensitivity site to rs7692387 and predicted binding of the transcription factor ZEB1 rather to the nonrisk allele, which was confirmed experimentally. Knockdown of <i>ZEB1</i> resulted in more profound reduction of nonrisk allele promoter activity and a significant reduction of endogenous <i>GUCY1A3</i> expression. Ex vivo–studied platelets from homozygous nonrisk allele carriers displayed enhanced inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation by the nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside and the phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor sildenafil compared with homozygous risk allele carriers. Moreover, pharmacological stimulation of sGC led to reduced migration only in vascular smooth muscle cells homozygous for the nonrisk allele. In the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel, higher levels of <i>GUCY1A3</i> expression correlated with less atherosclerosis in the aorta.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Rs7692387 is located in an intronic site that modulates <i>GUCY1A3</i> promoter activity. The transcription factor ZEB1 binds preferentially to the nonrisk allele, leading to an increase in <i>GUCY1A3</i> expression, higher sGC levels, and higher sGC activity after stimulation. Finally, human and mouse data link augmented sGC expression to lower risk of atherosclerosis.</p></sec>

Delayed Repolarization Underlies Ventricular Arrhythmias in Rats With Heart Failure and Preserved Ejection Fraction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) represents approximately half of heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e, and its incidence continues to increase. The leading cause of mortality in HFpEF is sudden death, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Dahl salt-sensitive rats were fed a high-salt diet (8% NaCl) from 7 weeks of age to induce HFpEF (n=38). Rats fed a normal-salt diet (0.3% NaCl) served as controls (n=13). Echocardiograms were performed to assess systolic and diastolic function from 14 weeks of age. HFpEF-verified and control rats underwent programmed electrical stimulation. Corrected QT interval was measured by surface ECG. The mechanisms of ventricular arrhythmias (VA) were probed by optical mapping, whole-cell patch clamp to measure action potential duration and ionic currents, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting to investigate changes in ion channel expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>After 7 weeks of a high-salt diet, 31 of 38 rats showed diastolic dysfunction and preserved ejection fraction along with signs of heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e and hence were diagnosed with HFpEF. Programmed electric stimulation demonstrated increased susceptibility to VA in HFpEF rats (<i>P</i><0.001 versus controls). The arrhythmogenicity index was increased (<i>P</i><0.001) and the corrected QT interval on ECG was prolonged (<i>P</i><0.001) in HFpEF rats. Optical mapping of HFpEF hearts demonstrated prolonged action potentials (<i>P</i><0.05) and multiple reentry circuits during induced VA. Single-cell recordings of cardiomyocytes isolated from HFpEF rats confirmed a delay of repolarization (<i>P</i>=0.001) and revealed downregulation of transient outward potassium current (<i>I</i><sub>to</sub>; <i>P</i><0.05). The rapid components of the delayed rectifier potassium current (<i>I</i><sub>Kr</sub>) and the inward rectifier potassium current (<i>I</i><sub>K1</sub>) were also downregulated (<i>P</i><0.05), but the current densities were much lower than for <i>I</i><sub>to</sub>. In accordance with the reduction of <i>I</i><sub>to</sub>, both <i>Kcnd3</i> transcript and Kv4.3 protein levels were decreased in HFpEF rat hearts.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Susceptibility to VA was markedly increased in rats with HFpEF. Underlying abnormalities include QT prolongation, delayed repolarization from downregulation of potassium currents, and multiple reentry circuits during VA. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that potassium current downregulation leads to abnormal repolarization in HFpEF, which in turn predisposes to VA and sudden cardiac death.</p></sec>

Age and Outcomes of Primary Prevention Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators in Patients With Nonischemic Systolic Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The DANISH study (Danish Study to Assess the Efficacy of ICDs [Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators] in Patients With Non-Ischemic Systolic Heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e on Mortality) did not demonstrate an overall effect on all-cause mortality with ICD implantation. However, the prespecified subgroup analysis suggested a possible age-dependent association between ICD implantation and mortality with survival benefit seen only in the youngest patients. The nature of this relationship between age and outcome of a primary prevention ICD in patients with nonischemic systolic heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e warrants further investigation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>All 1116 patients from the DANISH study were included in this prespecified subgroup analysis. We assessed the relationship between ICD implantation and mortality by age, and an optimal age cutoff was estimated nonparametrically with selection impact curves. Modes of death were divided into sudden cardiac death and nonsudden death and compared between patients younger and older than this age cutoff with the use of χ<sup>2</sup> analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Median age of the study population was 63 years (range, 21–84 years). There was a linearly decreasing relationship between ICD and mortality with age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.003–1.06; <i>P</i>=0.03). An optimal age cutoff for ICD implantation was present at ≤70 years. There was an association between reduced all-cause mortality and ICD in patients ≤70 years of age (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.51–0.96; <i>P</i>=0.03) but not in patients >70 years of age (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.68–1.62; <i>P</i>=0.84). For patients ≤70 years old, the sudden cardiac death rate was 1.8 (95% CI, 1.3–2.5) and nonsudden death rate was 2.7 (95% CI, 2.1–3.5) events per 100 patient-years, whereas for patients >70 years old, the sudden cardiac death rate was 1.6 (95% CI, 0.8–3.2) and nonsudden death rate was 5.4 (95% CI, 3.7–7.8) events per 100 patient-years. This difference in modes of death between the 2 age groups was statistically significant (<i>P</i>=0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In patients with systolic heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e not caused by ischemic heart disease, the association between the ICD and survival decreased linearly with increasing age. In this study population, an age cutoff for ICD implantation at ≤70 years yielded the highest survival for the population as a whole.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Epigenome-Wide Association Study Identifies Cardiac Gene Patterning and a Novel Class of Biomarkers for Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Biochemical DNA modification resembles a crucial regulatory layer among genetic information, environmental factors, and the transcriptome. To identify epigenetic susceptibility regions and novel biomarkers linked to myocardial dysfunction and heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e, we performed the first multi-omics study in myocardial tissue and blood of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and controls.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Infinium human methylation 450 was used for high-density epigenome-wide mapping of DNA methylation in left-ventricular biopsies and whole peripheral blood of living probands. RNA deep sequencing was performed on the same samples in parallel. Whole-genome sequencing of all patients allowed exclusion of promiscuous genotype-induced methylation calls.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In the screening stage, we detected 59 epigenetic loci that are significantly associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (false discovery corrected <i>P</i>≤0.05), with 3 of them reaching epigenome-wide significance at <i>P</i>≤5×10<sup>−8</sup>. Twenty-seven (46%) of these loci could be replicated in independent cohorts, underlining the role of epigenetic regulation of key cardiac transcription regulators. Using a staged multi-omics study design, we link a subset of 517 epigenetic loci with dilated cardiomyopathy and cardiac gene expression. Furthermore, we identified distinct epigenetic methylation patterns that are conserved across tissues, rendering these CpGs novel epigenetic biomarkers for heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The present study provides to our knowledge the first epigenome-wide association study in living patients with heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e using a multi-omics approach.</p></sec>

Prognostic Value of N-Terminal Pro-B-Type Natriuretic Peptide, Troponin-T, and Growth-Differentiation Factor 15 in Adult Congenital Heart Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The number of patients with adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) is rapidly increasing. To optimize patient management, there is a great need to accurately identify high-risk patients. Still, no biomarker has been firmly established as a clinically useful prognostic tool in this group. We studied the association of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), high-sensitive troponin-T, and growth-differentiation factor 15 with cardiovascular events in ACHD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Clinically stable patients with ACHD who routinely visited the outpatient clinic between April 2011 and April 2013 underwent clinical assessment, electrocardiography, echocardiography, and biomarker measurement (NT-proBNP, high-sensitive troponin-T, and growth-differentiation factor 15) at the time of study inclusion. Patients were prospectively followed for the occurrence of cardiovascular events (death, heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e, hospitalization, arrhythmia, thromboembolic events, and reintervention). Survival curves were derived by the Kaplan-Meier method, and Cox regression was performed to investigate the relation between biomarkers and events with adjustment for multiple clinical and echocardiographic variables.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In total, 595 patients were included (median age, 33 years; interquartile range, 25–41 years; 58% male; 90% New York Heart Association class I). Patients were followed during a median of 42 (interquartile range, 37–46) months. Of the 3 evaluated biomarkers, NT-proBNP in the upper quartile (>33.3 pmol/L) was most strongly associated with cardiovascular events (n=165, adjusted hazard ratio, 9.05 [3.24–25.3], <i>P</i><0.001) and with death or heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e (n=50, adjusted hazard ratio, 16.0 [2.04–126], <i>P</i><0.001). When NT-proBNP was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed as a continuous variable, similar findings were retrieved. The cumulative proportion of patients with death and heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e was only 1% in the lowest 2 NT-proBNP quartiles. Elevated NT-proBNP (>14 pmol/L), elevated high-sensitive troponin-T (>14 ng/L), and elevated growth-differentiation factor 15 (>1109 ng/L) identified those patients at highest risk of cardiovascular events (log-rank <i>P</i><0.0001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>NT-proBNP provides prognostic information beyond a conventional risk marker model in patients with ACHD and can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reliabl</span></strong>y exclude the risk of death and heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e. Elevated levels of NT-proBNP, high-sensitive troponin-T, and growth-differentiation factor 15 identify patients at highest risk of cardiovascular events. These biomarkers therefore may play an important role in the monitoring and management of patients with ACHD.</p></sec>

Cardiac Fibroblast–Specific Activating Transcription Factor 3 Protects Against Heart Failure by Suppressing MAP2K3-p38 Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Hypertensive ventricular remodeling is a common cause of heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating ventricular remodeling remain poorly understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used a discovery-driven/nonbiased approach to identify increased activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) expression in hypertensive heart. We used loss/gain of function approaches to understand the role of ATF3 in heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e. We also examined the mechanisms through transcriptome, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analysis, and in vivo and in vitro experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>ATF3 expression increased in murine hypertensive heart and human hypertrophic heart. Cardiac fibroblast cells are the primary cell type expressing high ATF3 levels in response to hypertensive stimuli. ATF3 knockout (ATF3KO) markedly exaggerated hypertensive ventricular remodeling, a state rescued by lentivirus-mediated/miRNA-aided cardiac fibroblast–selective ATF3 overexpression. Conversely, conditional cardiac fibroblast cell–specific ATF3 transgenic overexpression significantly ameliorated ventricular remodeling and heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e. We identified Map2K3 as a novel ATF3 target. ATF3 binds with the Map2K3 promoter, recruiting HDAC1, resulting in Map2K3 gene–associated histone deacetylation, thereby inhibiting Map2K3 expression. Genetic Map2K3 knockdown rescued the profibrotic/hypertrophic phenotype in ATF3KO cells. Last, we demonstrated that p38 is the downstream molecule of Map2K3 mediating the profibrotic/hypertrophic effects in ATF3KO animals. Inhibition of p38 signaling reduced transforming growth factor-β signaling-related profibrotic and hypertrophic gene expression, and blocked exaggerated cardiac remodeling in ATF3KO cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our study provides the first evidence that ATF3 upregulation in cardiac fibroblasts in response to hypertensive stimuli protects the heart by suppressing Map2K3 expression and subsequent p38-transforming growth factor-β signaling. These results suggest that positive modulation of cardiac fibroblast ATF3 may represent a novel therapeutic approach against hypertensive cardiac remodeling.</p></sec>

Inhibiting Insulin-Mediated β<sub>2</sub>-Adrenergic Receptor Activation Prevents Diabetes-Associated Cardiac Dysfunction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and obesity independently increase the risk of heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e by incompletely understood mechanisms. We propose that hyperinsulinemia might promote adverse consequences in the hearts of subjects with type-2 DM and obesity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>High-fat diet feeding was used to induce obesity and DM in wild-type mice or mice lacking β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor (β<sub>2</sub>AR) or β-arrestin2. Wild-type mice fed with high-fat diet were treated with a β-blocker carvedilol or a GRK2 (G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2) inhibitor. We examined signaling and cardiac contractile function.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>High-fat diet feeding selectively increases the expression of phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D) in mouse hearts, in concert with reduced protein kinase A phosphorylation of phospholamban, which contributes to systolic and diastolic dysfunction. The expression of PDE4D is also elevated in human hearts with DM. The induction of PDE4D expression is mediated by an insulin receptor, insulin receptor substrate, and GRK2 and β-arrestin2-dependent transactivation of a β<sub>2</sub>AR-extracellular regulated protein kinase signaling cascade. Thus, pharmacological inhibition of β<sub>2</sub>AR or GRK2, or genetic deletion of β<sub>2</sub>AR or β-arrestin2, all significantly attenuate insulin-induced phosphorylation of extracellular regulated protein kinase and PDE4D induction to prevent DM-related contractile dysfunction.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These studies elucidate a novel mechanism by which hyperinsulinemia contributes to heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e by increasing PDE4D expression and identify β<sub>2</sub>AR or GRK2 as plausible therapeutic targets for preventing or treating heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e in subjects with type 2 DM.</p></sec>

Detailed Echocardiographic Phenotyping in Breast Cancer Patients
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiovascular disease in patients with breast cancer is of growing concern. The longitudinal effects of commonly used therapies, including doxorubicin and trastuzumab, on cardiac remodeling and function remain unknown in this population. We aimed to define the changes in echocardiographic parameters of structure, function, and ventricular-arterial coupling, and their associations with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e symptoms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a longitudinal prospective cohort study of 277 breast cancer participants receiving doxorubicin (Dox), trastuzumab (Tras), or both (Dox+Tras), we obtained 1249 echocardiograms over a median follow-up of 2.0 (interquartile range, 1.0–3.0) years. Left ventricular structure, diastolic and contractile function, and ventricular-arterial coupling measures were quantified in a core laboratory blinded to participant characteristics. We evaluated changes in echocardiographic parameters over time, and used repeated-measures regression models to define their association with LVEF decline and recovery. Linear regression models defined the association between early changes in these parameters and subsequent changes in LVEF and heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e symptoms.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, 177 (64%) received Dox, 51 (18%) received Tras, and 49 (18%) received Dox+Tras. With Dox, there was a sustained, modest decrease in LVEF over the follow-up duration (1-year change in LVEF –3.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI], –4.4% to –2.8%; 3-year change –3.8%; 95% CI, –5.1% to –2.5%). With Tras, a similar LVEF decline was observed at 1 year (–4.5%; 95% CI, –6.0% to –2.9%) and 3 years (–2.8%; 95%CI, –5.3 to –0.4%). Participants receiving Dox+Tras demonstrated the greatest declines at 1 year (–6.6%; 95% CI, –8.2 to –5.0%), with partial recovery at 3 years (–2.8%; 95% CI, –4.8 to –0.8%). LVEF declines and recovery were associated primarily with changes in systolic volumes, longitudinal and circumferential strain, and ventricular-arterial coupling indices, effective arterial elastance (Ea) and the coupling ratio Ea/Ees<sub>sb</sub>, without evidence for effect modification across therapies. Early changes in volumes, strain, and Ea/Ees<sub>sb</sub> at 4 to 6 months were associated with 1- and 2-year LVEF changes. Similarly, early changes in strain and Ea were associated with worsening heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e symptoms at 1 year.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Doxorubicin and trastuzumab resulted in modest, persistent declines in LVEF at 3 years. Changes in volumes, strain, and ventricular-arterial coupling were consistently associated with concurrent and subsequent LVEF declines and recovery across therapies.</p></sec>

3D printed polyamide membranes for desalination
<p>Polyamide thickness and roughness have been identified as critical properties that affect thin-film composite membrane performance for reverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">osmosi</span></strong>s. Conventional formation methodologies lack the ability to control these properties independently with high resolution or precision. An additive approach is presented that uses electrospraying to deposit monomers directly onto a substrate, where they react to form polyamide. The small droplet size coupled with low monomer concentrations result in polyamide films that are smoother and thinner than conventional polyamides, while the additive nature of the approach allows for control of thickness and roughness. Polyamide films are formed with a thickness that is controllable down to 4-nanometer increments and a roughness as low as 2 nanometers while still exhibiting good permselectivity relative to a commercial benchmarking membrane.</p>

A SWELL Channel Indeed
<p>Water constitutes about two-thirds of the mass of most living organisms. It serves as a solvent in the cell cytoplasm and exterior, and like other molecules, it moves down its concentration gradient by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">osmosi</span></strong>s. Indeed, the diffusion of water is responsible for the dilemma in <i>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</i>, Samuel Taylor Coleridge's epic poem: “Water, water, everywhere, Nor any drop to drink.” If the mariner were to drink seawater, with its high concentration of dissolved salts, the water in his cells would diffuse out (down its concentration gradient), dehydrating the cells and killing the seafarer. Two recent studies, by Qiu <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) and by Voss <i>et al.</i> on page 634 in this issue (<i>2</i>), advance our understanding of how animal cells deal with such osmotic challenges.</p>

Skeletal muscle fuel selection occurs at the mitochondrial level
<p>Mammals exponentially increase the rate of carbohydrate oxidation as exercise intensity rises, while birds combust lipid almost exclusively while flying at high percentages of aerobic capacity. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuel</span></strong> oxidized by contracting muscle depends on many factors: whole-body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuel</span></strong> storage mass, mobilization, blood transport, cellular uptake, and substrate selection at the level of the mitochondrion. We examined the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuel</span></strong> preferences of mitochondria isolated from mammalian and avian locomotory muscles using two approaches. First, the influence of substrates on the kinetics of respiration (<i>K</i><sub>m,ADP</sub> and <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>) was evaluated. For all substrates and combinations, <i>K</i><sub>m,ADP</sub> was generally twofold higher in avian mitochondria. Second, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuel</span></strong> competition between pyruvate, glutamate and/or palmitoyl-<sc>l</sc>-carnitine at three levels of ATP free energy was determined using the principle of mass balance and the measured rates of O<sub>2</sub> consumption and metabolite accumulation/utilization. Avian mitochondria strongly spared pyruvate from oxidation when another substrate was available and fatty acid was the dominant substrate, regardless of energy state. Mammalian mitochondria exhibited some preference for fatty acid over pyruvate at lower flux (higher energy state), but exhibited a much greater tendency to select pyruvate and glutamate when available. Studies in sonicated mitochondria revealed twofold higher electron transport chain electron conductance in avian mitochondria. We conclude that substantial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuel</span></strong> selection occurs at the level of the mitochondrial matrix and that avian flight muscle mitochondria are particularly biased toward the selection of fatty acid, possibly by facilitating high β-oxidation flux by maintaining a more oxidized matrix.</p>

Ultralow-loading platinum-cobalt fuel cell catalysts derived from imidazolate frameworks
<p>Achieving high catalytic performance with the lowest possible amount of platinum is critical for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuel</span></strong> cell cost reduction. Here we describe a method of preparing highly active yet stable electrocatalysts containing ultralow-loading platinum content by using cobalt or bimetallic cobalt and zinc zeolitic imidazolate frameworks as precursors. Synergistic catalysis between strained platinum-cobalt core-shell nanoparticles over a platinum-group metal (PGM)–free catalytic substrate led to excellent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuel</span></strong> cell performance under 1 atmosphere of O<sub>2</sub> or air at both high-voltage and high-current domains. Two catalysts achieved oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) mass activities of 1.08 amperes per milligram of platinum (A mg<sub>Pt</sub><sup>−1</sup>) and 1.77 A mg<sub>Pt</sub><sup>−1</sup> and retained 64% and 15% of initial values after 30,000 voltage cycles in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuel</span></strong> cell. Computational modeling reveals that the interaction between platinum-cobalt nanoparticles and PGM-free sites improves ORR activity and durability.</p>

Rotary and linear molecular motors driven by pulses of a chemical fuel
<p>Many biomolecular motors catalyze the hydrolysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuel</span></strong></span></strong>s, such as adenosine triphosphate, and use the energy released to direct motion through information ratchet mechanisms. Here we describe chemically-driven artificial rotary and linear molecular motors that operate through a fundamentally different type of mechanism. The directional rotation of [2]- and [3]catenane rotary molecular motors and the transport of substrates away from equilibrium by a linear molecular pump are induced by acid-base oscillations. The changes simultaneously switch the binding site affinities and the labilities of barriers on the track, creating an energy ratchet. The linear and rotary molecular motors are driven by aliquots of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuel</span></strong></span></strong>, trichloroacetic acid. A single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuel</span></strong> pulse generates 360° unidirectional rotation of up to 87% of crown ethers in a [2]catenane rotary motor.</p>

Direct atomic-level insight into the active sites of a high-performance PGM-free ORR catalyst
<p>Platinum group metal–free (PGM-free) metal-nitrogen-carbon catalysts have emerged as a promising alternative to their costly platinum (Pt)–based counterparts in polymer electrolyte <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuel</span></strong> cells (PEFCs) but still face some major challenges, including (i) the identification of the most relevant catalytic site for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and (ii) demonstration of competitive PEFC performance under automotive-application conditions in the hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>)–air <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuel</span></strong> cell.

Current densities recorded in the kinetic region of cathode operation, at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuel</span></strong> cell voltages greater than ~0.75 V, were the same as those obtained with a Pt cathode at a loading of 0.1 milligram of Pt per centimeter squared. The proposed catalytic active site, carbon-embedded nitrogen-coordinated iron (FeN<sub>4</sub>), was directly visualized with aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy, and the contributions of these active sites associated with specific lattice-level carbon structures were explored computationally.</p>

Aperture effects in squid jet propulsion
<p>Squid are the largest jet propellers in nature as adults, but as paralarvae they are some of the smallest, faced with the inherent inefficiency of jet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">propuls</span></strong>ion at a low Reynolds number. In this study we describe the behavior and kinematics of locomotion in 1 mm paralarvae of <i>Dosidicus gigas</i>, the smallest squid yet studied. They swim with hop-and-sink behavior and can engage in fast jets by reducing the size of the mantle aperture during the contraction phase of a jetting cycle. We go on to explore the general effects of a variable mantle and funnel aperture in a theoretical model of jet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">propuls</span></strong>ion scaled from the smallest (1 mm mantle length) to the largest (3 m) squid. Aperture reduction during mantle contraction increases <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">propuls</span></strong>ive efficiency at all squid sizes, although 1 mm squid still suffer from low efficiency (20%) because of a limited speed of contraction. Efficiency increases to a peak of 40% for 1 cm squid, then slowly declines. Squid larger than 6 cm must either reduce contraction speed or increase aperture size to maintain stress within maximal muscle tolerance. Ecological pressure to maintain maximum velocity may lead them to increase aperture size, which reduces efficiency. This effect might be ameliorated by nonaxial flow during the refill phase of the cycle. Our model's predictions highlight areas for future empirical work, and emphasize the existence of complex behavioral options for maximizing efficiency at both very small and large sizes.</p>

The rise, collapse, and compaction of Mt. Mantap from the 3 September 2017 North Korean nuclear test
<p>Surveillance of clandestine nuclear tests relies on a global seismic network, but the potential of spaceborne monitoring has been underexploited. We used satellite radar imagery to determine the complete surface displacement field of up to 3.5 meters of divergent horizontal motion with 0.5 meters of subsidence associated with North Korea’s largest underground nuclear test. Combining insight from geodetic and seismological remote sensing, we found that the aftermath of the initial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">explos</span></strong>ive deformation involved subsidence associated with subsurface collapse and aseismic compaction of the damaged rocks of the test site. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">explos</span></strong>ive yield from the nuclear detonation with best-fitting source parameters for 450-meter depth was 191 kilotonnes of TNT equivalent.

An unusual white dwarf star may be a surviving remnant of a subluminous Type Ia supernova
<p>Subluminous Type Ia supernovae, such as the Type Iax–class prototype SN 2002cx, are described by a variety of models such as the failed detonation and partial deflagration of an accreting carbon-oxygen white dwarf star or the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">explos</span></strong>ion of an accreting, hybrid carbon-oxygen-neon core. These models predict that bound remnants survive such events with, according to some simulations, a high kick velocity. We report the discovery of a high proper motion, low-mass white dwarf (LP 40-365) that travels at a velocity greater than the Galactic escape velocity and whose peculiar atmosphere is dominated by intermediate-mass elements. Strong evidence indicates that this partially burnt remnant was ejected following a subluminous Type Ia supernova event. This supports the viability of single-degenerate supernova progenitors.</p>

Atomic-layered Au clusters on α-MoC as catalysts for the low-temperature water-gas shift reaction
<p>The water-gas shift (WGS) reaction (where carbon monoxide plus water yields dihydrogen and carbon dioxide) is an essential process for hydrogen generation and carbon monoxide removal in various energy-related chemical operations. This equilibrium-limited reaction is favored at a low working temperature. Potential application in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuel</span></strong> cells also requires a WGS catalyst to be highly active, stable, and energy-efficient and to match the working temperature of on-site hydrogen generation and consumption units. We synthesized layered gold (Au) clusters on a molybdenum carbide (α-MoC) substrate to create an interfacial catalyst system for the ultralow-temperature WGS reaction. Water was activated over α-MoC at 303 kelvin, whereas carbon monoxide adsorbed on adjacent Au sites was apt to react with surface hydroxyl groups formed from water splitting, leading to a high WGS activity at low temperatures.</p>

Fructose-driven glycolysis supports anoxia resistance in the naked mole-rat
<p>The African naked mole-rat’s (<i>Heterocephalus glaber</i>) social and subterranean lifestyle generates a hypoxic niche. Under experimental conditions, naked mole-rats tolerate hours of extreme hypoxia and survive 18 minutes of total oxygen deprivation (anoxia) without apparent injury. During anoxia, the naked mole-rat switches to anaerobic metabolism <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuel</span></strong>ed by fructose, which is actively accumulated and metabolized to lactate in the brain. Global expression of the GLUT5 fructose transporter and high levels of ketohexokinase were identified as molecular signatures of fructose metabolism. Fructose-driven glycolytic respiration in naked mole-rat tissues avoids feedback inhibition of glycolysis via phosphofructokinase, supporting viability. The metabolic rewiring of glycolysis can circumvent the normally lethal effects of oxygen deprivation, a mechanism that could be harnessed to minimize hypoxic damage in human disease.</p>

iPTF16geu: A multiply imaged, gravitationally lensed type Ia supernova
<p>We report the discovery of a multiply imaged, gravitationally lensed type Ia supernova, iPTF16geu (SN 2016geu), at redshift <i>z</i> = 0.409. This phenomenon was identified because the light from the stellar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">explos</span></strong>ion was magnified more than 50 times by the curvature of space around matter in an intervening galaxy. We used high-spatial-resolution observations to resolve four images of the lensed supernova, approximately 0.3 arc seconds from the center of the foreground galaxy. The observations probe a physical scale of ~1 kiloparsec, smaller than is typical in other studies of extragalactic gravitational lensing. The large magnification and symmetric image configuration imply close alignment between the lines of sight to the supernova and to the lens. The relative magnifications of the four images provide evidence for substructures in the lensing galaxy.</p>

Imaging rotational dynamics of nanoparticles in liquid by 4D electron microscopy

We have extended 4D EM to include liquid cells without the time resolution being limited by the response of the detector. Our approach permits the imaging of the motion and morphological dynamics of a single, same particle on nanometer and ultrashort time scales. As a first application, we studied the rotational dynamics of gold nanoparticles in aqueous solution. A full transition from the conventional diffusive rotation to superdiffusive rotation and further to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ballist</span></strong>ic rotation was observed with increasing asymmetry of the nanoparticle morphology.

Seismic constraints on caldera dynamics from the 2015 Axial Seamount eruption
<p>Seismic observations in volcanically active calderas are challenging.

Beginning on 24 April 2015, the seismic network captured an eruption that culminated in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">explos</span></strong>ive acoustic signals where lava erupted on the seafloor. Extensive seismic activity preceding the eruption shows that inflation is accommodated by the reactivation of an outward-dipping caldera ring fault, with strong tidal triggering indicating a critically stressed system. The ring fault accommodated deflation during the eruption and provided a pathway for a dike that propagated south and north beneath the caldera’s east wall. Once north of the caldera, the eruption stepped westward, and a dike propagated along the extensional north rift.</p>

First flu is forever
<p>Influenza is a threat that has been with humans throughout history, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuel</span></strong>ed by a constant race between host immunity and viral evolution. Control strategies rely on annual immunizations and require frequent updates of the vaccine, an expensive, cumbersome, and not always foolproof process. Efforts are therefore under way to develop vaccines that confer broadly cross-protective immunity to diverse influenza strains. Cross-immunity is pervasive in nature; in multistrain viral diseases such as influenza or dengue, response to a primary infection can profoundly influence response to the next strain encountered. Even unrelated viruses can be recognized by the same cross-reactive T cells. On page 722 of this issue (<i>1</i>), Gostic <i>et al.</i> show that severe infection with a bird flu virus depends on the individual's first encounter with influenza in childhood.</p>

Super-dry reforming of methane intensifies CO<sub>2</sub> utilization via Le Chatelier’s principle
<p>Efficient CO<sub>2</sub> transformation from a waste product to a carbon source for chemicals and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuel</span></strong>s will require reaction conditions that effect its reduction. We developed a “super-dry” CH<sub>4</sub> reforming reaction for enhanced CO production from CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>. We used Ni/MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> as a CH<sub>4</sub>-reforming catalyst, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> as a solid oxygen carrier, and CaO/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> as a CO<sub>2</sub> sorbent. The isothermal coupling of these three different processes resulted in higher CO production as compared with that of conventional dry reforming, by avoiding back reactions with water. The reduction of iron oxide was intensified through CH<sub>4</sub> conversion to syngas over Ni and CO<sub>2</sub> extraction and storage as CaCO<sub>3</sub>. CO<sub>2</sub> is then used for iron reoxidation and CO production, exploiting equilibrium shifts effected with inert gas sweeping (Le Chatelier’s principle). Super-dry reforming uses up to three CO<sub>2</sub> molecules per CH<sub>4</sub> and offers a high CO space-time yield of 7.5 millimole CO per second per kilogram of iron at 1023 kelvin.</p>

Physiological and ecological drivers of early spring blooms of a coastal phytoplankter

Changes in bloom timing have been detected in some cases, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive, contributing to uncertainty in long-term predictions of climate change impacts. Here we describe a 13-year hourly time series from the New England shelf of data on the coastal phytoplankter <i>Synechococcus</i>, during which the timing of its spring bloom varied by 4 weeks. We show that multiyear trends are due to temperature-induced changes in cell division rate, with earlier blooms driven by warmer spring water temperatures. <i>Synechococcus</i> loss rates shift in tandem with division rates, suggesting a balance between growth and loss that has persisted despite phenological shifts and environmental change.</p>

These data not only indicate that DNA vaccination could be a successful approach to protect against ZIKV infection, but also suggest a protective threshold of vaccine-induced neutralizing activity that prevents viremia after acute infection.</p>

Ballistic miniband conduction in a graphene superlattice
<p>Rational design of long-period artificial lattices yields effects unavailable in simple solids. The moiré pattern in highly aligned graphene/hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) heterostructures is a lateral superlattice with high electron mobility and an unusual electronic dispersion whose miniband edges and saddle points can be reached by electrostatic gating. We investigated the dynamics of electrons in moiré minibands by measuring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ballist</span></strong>ic transport between adjacent local contacts in a magnetic field, known as the transverse electron focusing effect. At low temperatures, we observed caustics of skipping orbits extending over hundreds of superlattice periods, reversals of the cyclotron revolution for successive minibands, and breakdown of cyclotron motion near van Hove singularities. At high temperatures, electron-electron collisions suppress focusing. Probing such miniband conduction properties is a necessity for engineering novel transport behaviors in superlattice devices.</p>

Electron optics with p-n junctions in ballistic graphene
<p>Electrons transmitted across a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ballist</span></strong>ic semiconductor junction are expected to undergo refraction, analogous to light rays across an optical boundary. In graphene, the linear dispersion and zero-gap band structure admit highly transparent p-n junctions by simple electrostatic gating.

We find agreement with the predicted Snell’s law for electrons, including the observation of both positive and negative refraction. Resonant transmission across the p-n junction provides a direct measurement of the angle-dependent transmission coefficient. Comparing experimental data with simulations reveals the crucial role played by the effective junction width, providing guidance for future device design. Our results pave the way for realizing electron optics based on graphene p-n junctions.</p>

RNA Polymerase II Read-Through Promotes Expression of Neighboring Genes in SAL1-PAP-XRN Retrograde Signaling
<p>In plants, the molecular function(s) of the nucleus-localized 5′-3′ EXORIBONUCLEASES (XRNs) are unclear; however, their activity is reported to have a significant effect on gene expression and SAL1-mediated retrograde signaling. Using parallel analysis of RNA ends, we documented a dramatic increase in uncapped RNA substrates of the XRNs in both <i>sal1</i> and <i>xrn2xrn3</i> mutants. We found that a major consequence of reducing SAL1 or XRN activity was RNA Polymerase II 3′ read-through. This occurred at 72% of expressed genes, demonstrating a major genome-wide role for the XRN-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">torpedo</span></strong> model of transcription termination in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Read-through is speculated to have a negative effect on transcript abundance; however, we did not observe this. Rather, we identified a strong association between read-through and increased transcript abundance of tandemly orientated downstream genes, strongly correlated with the proximity (less than 1,000 bp) and expression of the upstream gene. We observed read-through in the proximity of 903 genes up-regulated in the <i>sal1-8</i> retrograde signaling mutant; thus, this phenomenon may account directly for up to 23% of genes up-regulated in <i>sal1-8</i>. Using <i>APX2</i> and <i>AT5G43770</i> as exemplars, we genetically uncoupled read-through loci from downstream genes to validate the principle of read-through-mediated mRNA regulation, providing one mechanism by which an ostensibly posttranscriptional exoribonuclease that targets uncapped RNAs could modulate gene expression.</p>

Development Defects of Hydroxy-Fatty Acid-Accumulating Seeds Are Reduced by Castor Acyltransferases
<p>Researchers have long endeavored to produce modified fatty acids in easily managed crop plants where they are not natively found. An important step toward this goal has been the biosynthesis of these valuable products in model oilseeds. The successful production of such fatty acids has revealed barriers to the broad application of this technology, including low seed oil and low proportion of the introduced fatty acid and reduced seed vigor. Here, we analyze the impact of producing hydroxy-fatty acids on seedling development. We show that germinating seeds of a hydroxy-fatty acid-accumulating Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) line produce chlorotic cotyledons and suffer reduced photosynthetic capacity. These seedlings retain hydroxy-fatty acids in polar lipids, including chloroplast lipids, and exhibit decreased fatty acid synthesis. Triacylglycerol mobilization in seedling development also is reduced, especially for lipids that include hydroxy-fatty acid moieties. These developmental defects are ameliorated by increased flux of hydroxy-fatty acids into seed triacylglycerol created through the expression of either castor (<i>Ricinus communis</i>) acyltransferase enzyme ACYL-COA:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE2 or PHOSPHOLIPID:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1A. Such expression increases both the level of total stored triacylglycerol and the rate at which it is mobilized, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuel</span></strong>ing fatty acid synthesis and restoring photosynthetic capacity. Our results suggest that further improvements in seedling development may require the specific mobilization of triacylglycerol-containing hydroxy-fatty acids. Understanding the defects in early development caused by the accumulation of modified fatty acids and providing mechanisms to circumvent these defects are vital steps in the development of tailored oil crops.</p>

Darkened Leaves Use Different Metabolic Strategies for Senescence and Survival
<p>In plants, an individually darkened leaf initiates senescence much more rapidly than a leaf from a whole darkened plant. Combining transcriptomic and metabolomic approaches in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), we present an overview of the metabolic strategies that are employed in response to different darkening treatments. Under darkened plant conditions, the perception of carbon starvation drove a profound metabolic readjustment in which branched-chain amino acids and potentially monosaccharides released from cell wall loosening became important substrates for maintaining minimal ATP production. Concomitantly, the increased accumulation of amino acids with a high nitrogen-carbon ratio may provide a safety mechanism for the storage of metabolically derived cytotoxic ammonium and a pool of nitrogen for use upon returning to typical growth conditions. Conversely, in individually darkened leaf, the metabolic profiling that followed our <sup>13</sup>C-enrichment assays revealed a temporal and differential exchange of metabolites, including sugars and amino acids, between the darkened leaf and the rest of the plant. This active transport could be the basis for a progressive metabolic shift in the substrates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuel</span></strong>ing mitochondrial activities, which are central to the catabolic reactions facilitating the retrieval of nutrients from the senescing leaf. We propose a model illustrating the specific metabolic strategies employed by leaves in response to these two darkening treatments, which support either rapid senescence or a strong capacity for survival.</p>

Variation in Leaf Respiration Rates at Night Correlates with Carbohydrate and Amino Acid Supply
<p>Plant respiration can theoretically be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuel</span></strong>ed by and dependent upon an array of central metabolism components; however, which ones are responsible for the quantitative variation found in respiratory rates is unknown. Here, large-scale screens revealed 2-fold variation in nighttime leaf respiration rate (R<sub>N</sub>) among mature leaves from an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) natural accession collection grown under common favorable conditions. R<sub>N</sub> variation was mostly maintained in the absence of genetic variation, which emphasized the low heritability of R<sub>N</sub> and its plasticity toward relatively small environmental differences within the sampling regime. To pursue metabolic explanations for leaf R<sub>N</sub> variation, parallel metabolite level profiling and assays of total protein and starch were performed. Within an accession, R<sub>N</sub> correlated strongly with stored carbon substrates, including starch and dicarboxylic acids, as well as sucrose, major amino acids, shikimate, and salicylic acid. Among different accessions, metabolite-R<sub>N</sub> correlations were maintained with protein, sucrose, and major amino acids but not stored carbon substrates. A complementary screen of the effect of exogenous metabolites and effectors on leaf R<sub>N</sub> revealed that (1) R<sub>N</sub> is stimulated by the uncoupler FCCP and high levels of substrates, demonstrating that both adenylate turnover and substrate supply can limit leaf R<sub>N</sub>, and (2) inorganic nitrogen did not stimulate R<sub>N</sub>, consistent with limited nighttime nitrogen assimilation. Simultaneous measurements of R<sub>N</sub> and protein synthesis revealed that these processes were largely uncorrelated in mature leaves. These results indicate that differences in preceding daytime metabolic activities are the major source of variation in mature leaf R<sub>N</sub> under favorable controlled conditions.</p>

The Enzyme Activity and Substrate Specificity of Two Major Cinnamyl Alcohol Dehydrogenases in Sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>), SbCAD2 and SbCAD4
<p>Cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) catalyzes the final step in monolignol biosynthesis, reducing sinapaldehyde, coniferaldehyde, and <i>p</i>-coumaraldehyde to their corresponding alcohols in an NADPH-dependent manner. Because of its terminal location in monolignol biosynthesis, the variation in substrate specificity and activity of CAD can result in significant changes in overall composition and amount of lignin. Our in-depth characterization of two major CAD isoforms, SbCAD2 (Brown midrib 6 [bmr6]) and SbCAD4, in lignifying tissues of sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>), a strategic plant for generating renewable chemicals and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuel</span></strong>s, indicates their similarity in both structure and activity to Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) CAD5 and <i>Populus tremuloides</i> sinapyl alcohol dehydrogenase, respectively. This first crystal structure of a monocot CAD combined with enzyme kinetic data and a catalytic model supported by site-directed mutagenesis allows full comparison with dicot CADs and elucidates the potential signature sequence for their substrate specificity and activity. The L119W/G301F-SbCAD4 double mutant displayed its substrate preference in the order coniferaldehyde > <i>p</i>-coumaraldehyde > sinapaldehyde, with higher catalytic efficiency than that of both wild-type SbCAD4 and SbCAD2. As SbCAD4 is the only major CAD isoform in <i>bmr6</i> mutants, replacing SbCAD4 with L119W/G301F-SbCAD4 in <i>bmr6</i> plants could produce a phenotype that is more amenable to biomass processing.</p>

NADPH Thioredoxin Reductase C and Thioredoxins Act Concertedly in Seedling Development
<p>Thiol-dependent redox regulation of enzyme activity plays a central role in the rapid acclimation of chloroplast metabolism to ever-fluctuating light availability. This regulatory mechanism relies on ferredoxin reduced by the photosynthetic electron transport chain, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuel</span></strong>s reducing power to thioredoxins (Trxs) via a ferredoxin-dependent Trx reductase. In addition, chloroplasts harbor an NADPH-dependent Trx reductase, which has a joint Trx domain at the carboxyl terminus, termed NTRC. Thus, a relevant issue concerning chloroplast function is to establish the relationship between these two redox systems and its impact on plant development. To address this issue, we generated Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants combining the deficiency of NTRC with those of Trxs <i>f</i>, which participate in metabolic redox regulation, and that of Trx <i>x</i>, which has antioxidant function. The <i>ntrc-trxf1f2</i> and, to a lower extent, <i>ntrc-trxx</i> mutants showed severe growth-retarded phenotypes, decreased photosynthesis performance, and almost abolished light-dependent reduction of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. Moreover, the combined deficiency of both redox systems provokes aberrant chloroplast ultrastructure. Remarkably, both the <i>ntrc-trxf1f2</i> and <i>ntrc-trxx</i> mutants showed high mortality at the seedling stage, which was overcome by the addition of an exogenous carbon source. Based on these results, we propose that NTRC plays a pivotal role in chloroplast redox regulation, being necessary for the activity of diverse Trxs with unrelated functions. The interaction between the two thiol redox systems is indispensable to sustain photosynthesis performed by cotyledons chloroplasts, which is essential for early plant development.</p>

Phospholipase Dζ Enhances Diacylglycerol Flux into Triacylglycerol<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plant seeds are the primary source of triacylglycerols (TAG) for food, feed, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuel</span></strong>, and industrial applications. As TAG is produced from diacylglycerol (DAG), successful engineering strategies to enhance TAG levels have focused on the conversion of DAG to TAG. However, the production of TAG can be limited by flux through the enzymatic reactions that supply DAG. In this study, two <i>Arabidopsis phospholipase D</i><sub>ζ</sub> genes (<i>AtPLD<sub>ζ1</sub></i> and <i>AtPLD<sub>ζ2</sub></i>) were coexpressed in <i>Camelina sativa</i> to test whether the conversion of phosphatidylcholine to DAG impacts TAG levels in seeds. The resulting transgenic plants produced 2% to 3% more TAG as a component of total seed biomass and had increased 18:3 and 20:1 fatty acid levels relative to wild type. Increased DAG and decreased PC levels were examined through the kinetics of lipid assembly by [<sup>14</sup>C]acetate and [<sup>14</sup>C]glycerol incorporation into glycerolipids. [<sup>14</sup>C]acetate was rapidly incorporated into TAG in both wild-type and overexpression lines, indicating a significant flux of nascent and elongated acyl-CoAs into the <i>sn</i>-3 position of TAG. Stereochemical analysis revealed that newly synthesized fatty acids were preferentially incorporated into the <i>sn</i>-2 position of PC, but the <i>sn</i>-1 position of de novo DAG and indicated similar rates of nascent acyl groups into the Kennedy pathway and acyl editing. [<sup>14</sup>C]glycerol studies demonstrated PC-derived DAG is the major source of DAG for TAG synthesis in both tissues. The results emphasize that the interconversions of DAG and PC pools can impact oil production and composition.</p>

Plant Chemical Genetics: From Phenotype-Based Screens to Synthetic Biology
<p>The treatment of a biological system with small molecules to specifically perturb cellular functions is commonly referred to as chemical biology. Small molecules are used commercially as drugs, herbicides, and fungicides in different systems, but in recent years they are increasingly exploited as tools for basic research. For instance, chemical genetics involves the discovery of small-molecule effectors of various cellular functions through screens of compound libraries. Whereas the drug discovery field has largely been driven by target-based screening approaches followed by drug optimization, chemical genetics in plant systems tends to be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuel</span></strong>ed by more general phenotype-based screens, opening the possibility to identify a wide range of small molecules that are not necessarily directly linked to the process of interest. Here, we provide an overview of the current progress in chemical genetics in plants, with a focus on the discoveries regarding small molecules identified in screens designed with a basic biology perspective. We reflect on the possibilities that lie ahead and discuss some of the potential pitfalls that might be encountered upon adopting a given chemical genetics approach.</p>

Starch Turnover and Metabolism during Flower and Early Embryo Development
<p>The accumulation of starch within photosynthetic tissues and within dedicated storage organs has been characterized extensively in many species, and a function in buffering carbon availability or in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuel</span></strong>ing later growth phases, respectively, has been proposed. However, developmentally regulated starch turnover within heterotrophic tissues other than dedicated storage organs is poorly characterized, and its function is not well understood. Here, we report on the characterization of starch turnover during flower, early embryo, and silique development in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) using a combined clearing-staining technique on whole-mount tissue. Besides the two previously documented waves of transient starch accumulation in the stamen envelope, occurring during meiosis and pollen mitosis I, we identified a novel, third wave of starch amylogenesis/amylolysis during the last stages of stamen development. To gain insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms, we analyzed publicly available microarray data, which revealed a developmentally coordinated expression of carbohydrate transport and metabolism genes during these waves of transient starch accumulation. Based on this analysis, we characterized starch dynamics in mutants affecting hexose phosphate metabolism and translocation, and identified the Glc-6-phosphate/phosphate antiporter GPT1 as the putative translocator of Glc-6-phosphate for starch biosynthesis in reproductive tissues. Based on these results, we propose a model of starch synthesis within the pollen grain and discuss the nutrient transport route feeding the embryo within the developing seed.</p>

Y Chromosome Analysis of Dingoes and Southeast Asian Village Dogs Suggests a Neolithic Continental Expansion from Southeast Asia Followed by Multiple Austronesian Dispersals
<p>Dogs originated more than 14,000 BP, but the location(s) where they first arose is uncertain. The earliest archeological evidence of ancient dogs was discovered in Europe and the Middle East, some 5–7 millennia before that from Southeast Asia. However, mitochondrial DNA analyses suggest that most modern dogs derive from Southeast Asia, which has <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuel</span></strong>ed the controversial hypothesis that dog domestication originated in this region despite the lack of supporting archeological evidence. We propose and investigate with Y chromosomes an alternative hypothesis for the proximate origins of dogs from Southeast Asia—a massive Neolithic expansion of dogs from this region that largely replaced more primitive dogs to the west and north. Previous attempts to test matrilineal findings with independent patrilineal markers have lacked the necessary genealogical resolution and mutation rate estimates. Here, we used Y chromosome genotypes, composed of 29 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) and 5 single tandem repeats (STRs), from 338 Australian dingoes, New Guinea singing dogs, and village dogs from Island Southeast Asia, along with modern European breed dogs, to estimate the evolutionary mutation rates of Y chromosome STRs based on calibration to the independently known age of the dingo population. Dingoes exhibited a unique haplogroup characterized by a single distinguishing SNP mutation and 14 STR haplotypes. The age of the European haplogroup was estimated to be only 1.7 times older than that of the dingo population, suggesting an origin during the Neolithic rather than the Paleolithic (as predicted by the Southeast Asian origins hypothesis). We hypothesize that isolation of Neolithic dogs from wolves in Southeast Asia was a key step accelerating their phenotypic transformation, enhancing their value in trade and as cargo, and enabling them to rapidly expand and replace more primitive dogs to the West. Our findings also suggest that dingoes could have arrived in Australia directly from Taiwan, independently of later dispersals of dogs through Thailand to Island Southeast Asia.</p>

Molecular Adaptation during a Rapid Adaptive Radiation
<p>“Explosive” adaptive radiations on islands remain one of the most puzzling evolutionary phenomena and the evolutionary genetic processes behind such radiations remain unclear. Rapid morphological and ecological evolution during island radiations suggests that many genes may be under fairly strong selection, although this remains untested. Here, we report that during a rapid recent diversification in the Hawaiian endemic plant genus <i>Schiedea</i> (<i>Caryophyllaceae</i>), 5 in 36 studied genes evolved under positive selection. Positively selected genes are involved in defence mechanisms, photosynthesis, and reproduction. Comparison with eight mainland plant groups demonstrates both the relaxation of purifying selection and more widespread positive selection in Hawaiian <i>Schiedea</i>. This provides compelling evidence that adaptive evolution of protein-coding genes may play a significant role during island adaptive radiations.</p>

Molecular and functional characterization of hemocyanin of the giant African millipede, <i>Archispirostreptus gigas</i>
<p>In contrast to other terrestrial arthropods, where gaseous O<sub>2</sub> that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuel</span></strong>s aerobic metabolism diffuses to the tissues in tracheal tubes, and most other metazoans, where O<sub>2</sub> is transported to tissues by circulating respiratory proteins, the myriapods (millipedes and centipedes) strikingly have tracheal systems as well as circulating hemocyanin (Hc). In order to elucidate the evolutionary origin and biological significance of millipede Hc, we report the molecular structure (subunit composition and amino acid sequence) of multimeric (36-mer) Hc from the forest floor-dwelling giant African millipede <i>Archispirostreptus gigas</i> and its allosteric oxygen-binding properties under various physico-chemical conditions. <i>Archispirostreptus gigas</i> Hc consists of only a single subunit type with differential glycosylation. Phylogenic analysis revealed that millipede Hc is a sister group to centipede HcA, which supports an early divergence of distinct Hc subunits in myriapods and an ancient origin of multimeric Hcs. <i>Archispirostreptus gigas</i> Hc binds O<sub>2</sub> with a high affinity and shows a strong Bohr effect. O<sub>2</sub> binding is, moreover, modulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, which increase the O<sub>2</sub> affinity of the Hc in the tense (T; deoxygenated) as well as the relaxed (R; oxygenated) states, and by (<sc>l</sc>)-lactate, which modulates Hc–O<sub>2</sub> affinity by changing the allosteric equilibrium constant, <i>L</i>. Cooperativity in O<sub>2</sub> binding at half O<sub>2</sub> saturation (<i>n</i><sub>50</sub>) is pH dependent and maximal at ~pH 7.4, and the number of interacting O<sub>2</sub>-binding sites (<i>q</i>) is markedly increased by binding Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The data are discussed in the light of the mutually supplementary roles of Hc and the tracheal system for tissue O<sub>2</sub> supply.</p>

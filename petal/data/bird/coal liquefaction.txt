Heterogeneous to homogeneous melting transition visualized with ultrafast electron diffraction
<p>The ultrafast laser excitation of matters leads to nonequilibrium states with complex solid-liquid phase-transition dynamics. We used electron diffraction at mega–electron volt energies to visualize the ultrafast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>ing of gold on the atomic scale length. For energy densities approaching the irreversible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>ing regime, we first observed heterogeneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>ing on time scales of 100 to 1000 picoseconds, transitioning to homogeneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>ing that occurs catastrophically within 10 to 20 picoseconds at higher energy densities. We showed evidence for the heterogeneous coexistence of solid and liquid. We determined the ion and electron temperature evolution and found superheated conditions. Our results constrain the electron-ion coupling rate, determine the Debye temperature, and reveal the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>ing sensitivity to nucleation seeds.</p>

Methane production from coal by a single methanogen
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coal</span></strong>-bed methane is one of the largest unconventional natural gas resources. Although microbial activity may greatly contribute to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coal</span></strong>-bed methane formation, it is unclear whether the complex aromatic organic compounds present in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coal</span></strong> can be used for methanogenesis. We show that deep subsurface–derived <i>Methermicoccus</i> methanogens can produce methane from more than 30 types of methoxylated aromatic compounds (MACs) as well as from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coal</span></strong>s containing MACs. In contrast to known methanogenesis pathways involving one- and two-carbon compounds, this “methoxydotrophic” mode of methanogenesis couples <i>O</i>-demethylation, CO<sub>2</sub> reduction, and possibly acetyl–coenzyme A metabolism. Because MACs derived from lignin may occur widely in subsurface sediments, methoxydotrophic methanogenesis would play an important role in the formation of natural gas not limited to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coal</span></strong>-bed methane and in the global carbon cycle.</p>

Melting of Iron at Earth’s Inner Core Boundary Based on Fast X-ray Diffraction
<sec><title>Hot Enough to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong> Iron</title><p>Earth's core is divided into a fluid outer core and a solid inner core, both composed predominately of iron at extremely high pressures and temperatures. The boundary between these two regions is largely controlled by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>ing point of iron at ∼330 GPa, which in turn influences heat transfer and geodynamo generation. <bold>Anzellini <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 464, see the Perspective by Fei) compressed iron in a laser-heated diamond anvil cell, tracking its structure and texture by using time-resolved x-ray diffraction as the pressure increased to 200 GPa.

Melting of subducted basalt at the core-mantle boundary
<p>The geological materials in Earth's lowermost mantle control the characteristics and interpretation of seismic ultra–low velocity zones at the base of the core-mantle boundary. Partial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>ing of the bulk lower mantle is often advocated as the cause, but this does not explain the nonubiquitous character of these regional seismic features. We explored the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>ing properties of mid-oceanic ridge basalt (MORB), which can reach the lowermost mantle after subduction of oceanic crust. At a pressure representative of the core-mantle boundary (135 gigapascals), the onset of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>ing occurs at ~3800 kelvin, which is ~350 kelvin below the mantle solidus. The SiO<sub>2</sub>-rich liquid generated either remains trapped in the MORB material or solidifies after reacting with the surrounding MgO-rich mantle, remixing subducted MORB with the lowermost mantle.</p>

RNA polymerase motions during promoter melting
<p>All cellular RNA polymerases (RNAPs), from those of bacteria to those of man, possess a clamp that can open and close, and it has been assumed that the open RNAP separates promoter DNA strands and then closes to establish a tight grip on the DNA template. Here, we resolve successive motions of the initiating bacterial RNAP by studying real-time signatures of fluorescent reporters placed on RNAP and DNA in the presence of ligands locking the clamp in distinct conformations. We report evidence for an unexpected and obligatory step early in the initiation involving a transient clamp closure as a prerequisite for DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>ing. We also present a 2.6-angstrom crystal structure of a late-initiation intermediate harboring a rotationally unconstrained downstream DNA duplex within the open RNAP active site cleft. Our findings explain how RNAP thermal motions control the promoter search and drive DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>ing in the absence of external energy sources.</p>

Experimental constraints on the damp peridotite solidus and oceanic mantle potential temperature
<p>Decompression of hot mantle rock upwelling beneath oceanic spreading centers causes it to exceed the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>ing point (solidus), producing magmas that ascend to form basaltic crust ~6 to 7 kilometers thick. The oceanic upper mantle contains ~50 to 200 micrograms per gram of water (H<sub>2</sub>O) dissolved in nominally anhydrous minerals, which—relative to its low concentration—has a disproportionate effect on the solidus that has not been quantified experimentally. Here, we present results from an experimental determination of the peridotite solidus containing known amounts of dissolved hydrogen. Our data reveal that the H<sub>2</sub>O-undersaturated peridotite solidus is hotter than previously thought. Reconciling geophysical observations of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>ing regime beneath the East Pacific Rise with our experimental results requires that existing estimates for the oceanic upper mantle potential temperature be adjusted upward by about 60°C.</p>

Seasonal accumulation of acetylated triacylglycerols by a freeze-tolerant insect
<p>Most animals store energy as long-chain triacylglycerols (lcTAGs). Trace amounts of acetylated triacylglycerols (acTAGs) have been reported in animals, but are not accumulated, likely because they have lower energy density than lcTAGs. Here we report that acTAGs comprise 36% of the neutral lipid pool of overwintering prepupae of the goldenrod gall fly, <i>Eurosta solidaginis</i>, while only 17% of the neutral lipid pool is made up of typical lcTAGs. These high concentrations of acTAGs, present only during winter, appear to be synthesized by <i>E. solidaginis</i> and are not found in other freeze-tolerant insects, nor in the plant host. The mixture of acTAGs found in <i>E. solidaginis</i> has a significantly lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>ing point than equivalent lcTAGs, and thus remains liquid at temperatures at which <i>E. solidaginis</i> is frozen in the field, and depresses the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>ing point of aqueous solutions in a manner unusual for neutral lipids. We note that accumulation of acTAGs coincides with preparation for overwintering and the seasonal acquisition of freeze tolerance. This is the first observation of accumulation of acTAGs by an animal, and the first evidence of dynamic interconversion between acTAGs and lcTAGs during development and in response to stress.</p>

Keyhole threshold and morphology in laser melting revealed by ultrahigh-speed x-ray imaging
<p>We used ultrahigh-speed synchrotron x-ray imaging to quantify the phenomenon of vapor depressions (also known as keyholes) during laser <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>ing of metals as practiced in additive manufacturing. Although expected from welding and inferred from postmortem cross sections of fusion zones, the direct visualization of the keyhole morphology and dynamics with high-energy x-rays shows that (i) keyholes are present across the range of power and scanning velocity used in laser powder bed fusion; (ii) there is a well-defined threshold from conduction mode to keyhole based on laser power density; and (iii) the transition follows the sequence of vaporization, depression of the liquid surface, instability, and then deep keyhole formation. These and other aspects provide a physical basis for three-dimensional printing in laser powder bed machines.</p>

A self-assembled nanoscale robotic arm controlled by electric fields
<p>The use of dynamic, self-assembled DNA nanostructures in the context of nanorobotics requires fast and reliable actuation mechanisms. We therefore created a 55-nanometer–by–55-nanometer DNA-based molecular platform with an integrated robotic arm of length 25 nanometers, which can be extended to more than 400 nanometers and actuated with externally applied electrical fields. Precise, computer-controlled switching of the arm between arbitrary positions on the platform can be achieved within milliseconds, as demonstrated with single-pair Forster resonance energy transfer experiments and fluorescence microscopy. The arm can be used for electrically driven transport of molecules or nanoparticles over tens of nanometers, which is useful for the control of photonic and plasmonic processes. Application of piconewton forces by the robot arm is demonstrated in force-induced DNA duplex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>ing experiments.</p>

Catalytic molten metals for the direct conversion of methane to hydrogen and separable carbon
<p>Metals that are active catalysts for methane (Ni, Pt, Pd), when dissolved in inactive low–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>ing temperature metals (In, Ga, Sn, Pb), produce stable molten metal alloy catalysts for pyrolysis of methane into hydrogen and carbon. All solid catalysts previously used for this reaction have been deactivated by carbon deposition. In the molten alloy system, the insoluble carbon floats to the surface where it can be skimmed off. A 27% Ni–73% Bi alloy achieved 95% methane conversion at 1065°C in a 1.1-meter bubble column and produced pure hydrogen without CO<sub>2</sub> or other by-products. Calculations show that the active metals in the molten alloys are atomically dispersed and negatively charged. There is a correlation between the amount of charge on the atoms and their catalytic activity.</p>

A liquid metal reaction environment for the room-temperature synthesis of atomically thin metal oxides
<p>Two-dimensional (2D) oxides have a wide variety of applications in electronics and other technologies. However, many oxides are not easy to synthesize as 2D materials through conventional methods. We used nontoxic eutectic gallium-based alloys as a reaction solvent and co-alloyed desired metals into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>. On the basis of thermodynamic considerations, we predicted the composition of the self-limiting interfacial oxide. We isolated the surface oxide as a 2D layer, either on substrates or in suspension. This enabled us to produce extremely thin subnanometer layers of HfO<sub>2</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and Gd<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. The liquid metal–based reaction route can be used to create 2D materials that were previously inaccessible with preexisting methods. The work introduces room-temperature liquid metals as a reaction environment for the synthesis of oxide nanomaterials with low dimensionality.</p>

A unified continental thickness from seismology and diamonds suggests a melt-defined plate
<p>Thick, rigid continents move over the weaker underlying mantle, although geophysical and geochemical constraints on the exact thickness and defining mechanism of the continental plates are widely discrepant. Xenoliths suggest a chemical continental lithosphere ~175 kilometers thick, whereas seismic tomography supports a much thicker root (>250 kilometers) and a gradual lithosphere-asthenosphere transition, consistent with a thermal definition. We modeled <i>SS</i> precursor waveforms from continental interiors and found a 7 to 9% velocity drop at depths of 130 to 190 kilometers. The discontinuity depth is well correlated with the origin depths of diamond-bearing xenoliths and corresponds to the transition from coarse to deformed xenoliths. At this depth, the xenolith-derived geotherm also intersects the carbonate-silicate solidus, suggesting that partial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong> defines the plate boundaries beneath the continental interior.</p>

Seismic evidence for partial melting at the root of major hot spot plumes
<p>Ultralow-velocity zones are localized regions of extreme material properties detected seismologically at the base of Earth's mantle. Their nature and role in mantle dynamics are poorly understood. We used shear waves diffracted at the core-mantle boundary to illuminate the root of the Iceland plume from different directions. Through waveform modeling, we detected a large ultralow-velocity zone and constrained its shape to be axisymmetric to a very good first order. We thus attribute it to partial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>ing of a locally thickened, denser- and hotter-than-average layer, reflecting dynamics and elevated temperatures within the plume root. Such structures are few and far apart, and they may be characteristic of the roots of some of the broad mantle plumes tomographically imaged within the large low-shear-velocity provinces in the lower mantle.</p>

On the deep-mantle origin of the Deccan Traps
<p>The Deccan Traps in west-central India constitute one of Earth’s largest continental flood basalt provinces, whose eruption played a role in the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event. The unknown mantle structure under the Indian Ocean at the start of the Cenozoic presents a challenge for connecting the event to a deep mantle origin. We used a back-and-forth iterative method for time-reversed convection modeling, which incorporates tomography-based, present-day mantle heterogeneity to reconstruct mantle structure at the start of the Cenozoic. We show a very low-density, deep-seated upwelling that ascends beneath the Ršćééàéééšćéunion hot spot at the time of the Deccan eruptions. We found a second active upwelling below the Comores hot spot that likely contributed to the region of partial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong> feeding the massive eruption.</p>

Large gem diamonds from metallic liquid in Earth’s deep mantle
<p>The redox state of Earth’s convecting mantle, masked by the lithospheric plates and basaltic magmatism of plate tectonics, is a key unknown in the evolutionary history of our planet. Here we report that large, exceptional gem diamonds like the Cullinan, Constellation, and Koh-i-Noor carry direct evidence of crystallization from a redox-sensitive metallic liquid phase in the deep mantle. These sublithospheric diamonds contain inclusions of solidified iron-nickel-carbon-sulfur <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>, accompanied by a thin fluid layer of methane ± hydrogen, and sometimes majoritic garnet or former calcium silicate perovskite. The metal-dominated mineral assemblages and reduced volatiles in large gem diamonds indicate formation under metal-saturated conditions. We verify previous predictions that Earth has highly reducing deep mantle regions capable of precipitating a metallic iron phase that contains dissolved carbon and hydrogen.</p>

Inflation-predictable behavior and co-eruption deformation at Axial Seamount
<p>Deformation of the ground surface at active volcanoes provides information about magma movements at depth. Improved seafloor deformation measurements between 2011 and 2015 documented a fourfold increase in magma supply and confirmed that Axial Seamount’s eruptive behavior is inflation-predictable, probably triggered by a critical level of magmatic pressure. A 2015 eruption was successfully forecast on the basis of this deformation pattern and marked the first time that deflation and tilt were captured in real time by a new seafloor cabled observatory, revealing the timing, location, and volume of eruption-related magma movements. Improved modeling of the deformation suggests a steeply dipping prolate-spheroid pressure source beneath the eastern caldera that is consistent with the location of the zone of highest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong> within the subcaldera magma reservoir determined from multichannel seismic results.</p>

Ocean mixing and ice-sheet control of seawater <sup>234</sup>U/<sup>238</sup>U during the last deglaciation
<p>Seawater <sup>234</sup>U/<sup>238</sup>U provides global-scale information about continental weathering and is vital for marine uranium-series geochronology. Existing evidence supports an increase in <sup>234</sup>U/<sup>238</sup>U since the last glacial period, but the timing and amplitude of its variability has been poorly constrained. Here we report two seawater <sup>234</sup>U/<sup>238</sup>U records based on well-preserved deep-sea corals from the low-latitude Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The Atlantic <sup>234</sup>U/<sup>238</sup>U started to increase before major sea-level rise and overshot the modern value by 3 per mil during the early deglaciation. Deglacial <sup>234</sup>U/<sup>238</sup>U in the Pacific converged with that in the Atlantic after the abrupt resumption of Atlantic meridional overturning. We suggest that ocean mixing and early deglacial release of excess <sup>234</sup>U from enhanced subglacial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>ing of the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets have driven the observed <sup>234</sup>U/<sup>238</sup>U evolution.</p>

New genus of extinct Holocene gibbon associated with humans in Imperial China
<p>Although all extant apes are threatened with extinction, there is no evidence for human-caused extinctions of apes or other primates in postglacial continental ecosystems, despite intensive anthropogenic pressures associated with biodiversity loss for millennia in many regions. Here, we report a new, globally extinct genus and species of gibbon, <i>Junzi imperialis</i>, described from a partial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cranium</span></strong> and mandible from a ~2200- to 2300-year-old tomb from Shaanxi, China. <i>Junzi</i> can be differentiated from extant hylobatid genera and the extinct Quaternary gibbon <i>Bunopithecus</i> by using univariate and multivariate analyses of craniodental morphometric data. Primates are poorly represented in the Chinese Quaternary fossil record, but historical accounts suggest that China may have contained an endemic ape radiation that has only recently disappeared.</p>

Mandibular Remains Support Taxonomic Validity of <i>Australopithecus sediba</i>
<p>Since the announcement of the species <i>Australopithecus sediba</i>, questions have been raised over whether the Malapa fossils represent a valid taxon or whether inadequate allowance was made for intraspecific variation, in particular with reference to the temporally and geographically proximate species <i>Au</i>. <i>africanus</i>. The morphology of mandibular remains of <i>Au. sediba</i>, including newly recovered material discussed here, shows that it is not merely a late-surviving morph of <i>Au. africanus</i>. Rather—as is seen elsewhere in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cranium</span></strong>, dentition, and postcranial skeleton—these mandibular remains share similarities with other australopiths but can be differentiated from the hypodigm of <i>Au. africanus</i> in both size and shape as well as in their ontogenetic growth trajectory.</p>

<i>In vivo</i> cranial bone strain and bite force in the agamid lizard <i>Uromastyx geyri</i>
<p><i>In vivo</i> bone strain data are the most direct evidence of deformation and strain regimes in the vertebrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cranium</span></strong> during feeding and can provide important insights into skull morphology. Strain data have been collected during feeding across a wide range of mammals; in contrast, <i>in vivo</i> cranial bone strain data have been collected from few sauropsid taxa. Here we present bone strain data recorded from the jugal of the herbivorous agamid lizard <i>Uromastyx geyri</i> along with simultaneously recorded bite force. Principal and shear strain magnitudes in <i>Uromastyx geyri</i> were lower than cranial bone strains recorded in <i>Alligator mississippiensis</i>, but higher than those reported from herbivorous mammals. Our results suggest that variations in principal strain orientations in the facial skeleton are largely due to differences in feeding behavior and bite location, whereas food type has little impact on strain orientations. Furthermore, mean principal strain orientations differ between male and female <i>Uromastyx</i> during feeding, potentially because of sexual dimorphism in skull morphology.</p>

Electron-scale dynamics of the diffusion region during symmetric magnetic reconnection in space
<p>Magnetic reconnection is an energy conversion process that occurs in many astrophysical contexts including Earth’s magnetosphere, where the process can be investigated in situ by spacecraft. On 11 July 2017, the four Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft encountered a reconnection site in Earth’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnetotail</span></strong>, where reconnection involves symmetric inflow conditions. The electron-scale plasma measurements revealed (i) super-Alfvénic electron jets reaching 15,000 kilometers per second; (ii) electron meandering motion and acceleration by the electric field, producing multiple crescent-shaped structures in the velocity distributions; and (iii) the spatial dimensions of the electron diffusion region with an aspect ratio of 0.1 to 0.2, consistent with fast reconnection. The well-structured multiple layers of electron populations indicate that the dominant electron dynamics are mostly laminar, despite the presence of turbulence near the reconnection site.</p>

Atmospheric <sup>14</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C changes during the last glacial period from Hulu Cave
<p>Paired measurements of <sup>14</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C and <sup>230</sup>Th ages from two Hulu Cave stalagmites complete a precise record of atmospheric <sup>14</sup>C covering the full range of the <sup>14</sup>C dating method (~54,000 years). Over the last glacial period, atmospheric <sup>14</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C ranges from values similar to modern values to values 1.70 times higher (42,000 to 39,000 years ago). The latter correspond to <sup>14</sup>C ages 5200 years less than calibrated ages and correlate with the Laschamp <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geomagnet</span></strong>ic excursion followed by Heinrich Stadial 4. Millennial-scale variations are largely attributable to Earth’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnetic field</span></strong> changes and in part to climate-related changes in the oceanic carbon cycle. A progressive shift to lower <sup>14</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C values between 25,000 and 11,000 years ago is likely related, in part, to progressively increasing ocean ventilation rates.</p>

Pre-settlement coral-reef fish larvae respond to magnetic field changes during the day
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> The individual orientation behaviour of coral-reef fish larvae during the pre-settlement phase is influenced by magnetic-field shifts, which indicates sensitivity to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geomagnet</span></strong>ic field and the use of a magnetic compass during dispersal and settlement.</p>

Networks of enzymatically oxidized membrane lipids support calcium-dependent coagulation factor binding to maintain hemostasis
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coagul</span></strong>ation functions as part of the innate immune system by preventing bacterial invasion, and it is critical to stopping <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> loss (hemostasis). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coagul</span></strong>ation involves the external membrane surface of activated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platelet</span></strong>s and leukocytes. Using lipidomic, genetic, biochemical, and mathematical modeling approaches, we found that enzymatically oxidized phospholipids (eoxPLs) generated by the activity of leukocyte or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platelet</span></strong> lipoxygenases (LOXs) were required for normal hemostasis and promoted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coagul</span></strong>ation factor activities in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and phosphatidylserine (PS)–dependent manner. In wild-type mice, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid–phospholipids (HETE-PLs) enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coagul</span></strong>ation and restored normal hemostasis in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clot</span></strong>ting-deficient animals genetically lacking p12-LOX or 12/15-LOX activity. Murine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platelet</span></strong>s generated 22 eoxPL species, all of which were missing in the absence of p12-LOX. Humans with the thrombotic disorder antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) had statistically significantly increased HETE-PLs in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platelet</span></strong>s and leukocytes, as well as greater HETE-PL immunoreactivity, than healthy controls. HETE-PLs enhanced membrane binding of the serum protein β2GP1 (β2-glycoprotein 1), an event considered central to the autoimmune reactivity responsible for APS symptoms. Correlation network analysis of 47 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platelet</span></strong> eoxPL species in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platelet</span></strong>s from APS and control subjects identified their enzymatic origin and revealed a complex network of regulation, with the abundance of 31 p12-LOX–derived eoxPL molecules substantially increased in APS. In summary, circulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> cells generate networks of eoxPL molecules, including HETE-PLs, which change membrane properties to enhance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coagul</span></strong>ation and contribute to the excessive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clot</span></strong>ting and immunoreactivity of patients with APS.</p>

Point-of-Care Hemostatic Testing in Cardiac Surgery
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac surgery is frequently complicated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coagul</span></strong>opathic bleeding that is difficult to optimally manage using standard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemostat</span></strong>ic testing.

Platelets Express Activated P2Y<sub>12</sub> Receptor in Patients With Diabetes Mellitus
<sec><title>Background:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platelet</span></strong>s from patients with diabetes mellitus are hyperactive. Hyperactivated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platelet</span></strong>s may contribute to cardiovascular complications and inadequate responses to anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platelet</span></strong> agents in the setting of diabetes mellitus. However, the underlying mechanism of hyperactivated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platelet</span></strong>s is not completely understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We measured P2Y<sub>12</sub> expression on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platelet</span></strong>s from patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platelet</span></strong>s from rats with diabetes mellitus. We also assayed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platelet</span></strong> P2Y<sub>12</sub> activation by measuring cAMP and VASP phosphorylation. The anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platelet</span></strong> and antithrombotic effects of AR-C78511 and cangrelor were compared in rats. Finally, we explored the role of the nuclear factor-κB pathway in regulating P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor expression in megakaryocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platelet</span></strong> P2Y<sub>12</sub> levels are 4-fold higher in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus compared with healthy subjects. P2Y<sub>12</sub> expression correlates with ADP-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platelet</span></strong> aggregation (r=0.89, <i>P</i><0.01). P2Y<sub>12</sub> in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platelet</span></strong>s from patients with diabetes mellitus is constitutively activated. Although both AR-C78511, a potent P2Y<sub>12</sub> inverse agonist, and cangrelor have similar anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platelet</span></strong> efficacy on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platelet</span></strong>s from healthy subjects, AR-C78511 exhibits more powerful anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platelet</span></strong> effects on diabetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platelet</span></strong>s than cangrelor (aggregation ratio 36±3% versus 49±5%, respectively, <i>P</i><0.05). Using a FeCl<sub>3</sub>-injury mesenteric arteriole <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thrombosi</span></strong>s model in rats and an arteriovenous shunt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thrombosi</span></strong>s model in rats, we found that the inverse agonist AR-C78511 has greater antithrombotic effects on GK rats with diabetes mellitus than cangrelor (thrombus weight 4.9±0.3 mg versus 8.3±0.4 mg, respectively, <i>P</i><0.01).

Transcription Factor RUNX1 Regulates Platelet <i>PCTP</i> (Phosphatidylcholine Transfer Protein): Implications for Cardiovascular Events
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>PCTP (phosphatidylcholine transfer protein) regulates the intermembrane transfer of phosphatidylcholine. Higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platelet</span></strong> PCTP expression is associated with increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platelet</span></strong> responses on activation of protease-activated receptor 4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thrombin</span></strong> receptors noted in black subjects compared with white subjects. Little is known about the regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platelet</span></strong> <i>PCTP</i>. Haplodeficiency of RUNX1, a major hematopoietic transcription factor, is associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thrombocyt</span></strong>openia and impaired <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platelet</span></strong> responses on activation. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platelet</span></strong> expression profiling of a patient with a <i>RUNX1</i> loss-of-function mutation revealed a 10-fold downregulation of the <i>PCTP</i> gene compared with healthy controls.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We pursued the hypothesis that <i>PCTP</i> is regulated by RUNX1 and that <i>PCTP</i> expression is correlated with cardiovascular events. We studied RUNX1 binding to the <i>PCTP</i> promoter using DNA-protein binding studies and human erythroleukemia cells and promoter activity using luciferase reporter studies. We assessed the relationship between <i>RUNX1</i> and <i>PCTP</i> in peripheral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> RNA and <i>PCTP</i> and death or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myocardial infarct</span></strong>ion in 2 separate patient cohorts (587 total patients) with cardiovascular disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platelet</span></strong> PCTP protein in the patient was reduced by ≈50%. DNA-protein binding studies showed RUNX1 binding to consensus sites in ≈1 kB of <i>PCTP</i> promoter. <i>PCTP</i> expression was increased with <i>RUNX1</i> overexpression and reduced with <i>RUNX1</i> knockdown in human erythroleukemia cells, indicating that <i>PCTP</i> is regulated by RUNX1. Studies in 2 cohorts of patients showed that <i>RUNX1</i> expression in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> correlated with <i>PCTP</i> gene expression; <i>PCTP</i> expression was higher in black compared with white subjects and was associated with future death/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myocardial infarct</span></strong>ion after adjustment for age, sex, and race (odds ratio, 2.05; 95% confidence interval 1.6–2.7; <i>P</i><0.0001). <i>RUNX1</i> expression is known to initiate at 2 alternative promoters, a distal P1 and a proximal P2 promoter. In patient cohorts, there were differential effects of <i>RUNX1</i> isoforms on <i>PCTP</i> expression with a negative correlation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> between <i>RUNX1</i> expressed from the P1 promoter and <i>PCTP</i> expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p><i>PCTP</i> is a direct transcriptional target of RUNX1. <i>PCTP</i> expression is associated with death/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myocardial infarct</span></strong>ion in patients with cardiovascular disease.

A cluster of immunoresolvents links coagulation to innate host defense in human blood
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coagul</span></strong>ation is a protective response that prevents excessive bleeding upon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> vessel injury. We investigated the relationship between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coagul</span></strong>ation and the resolution of inflammation and infection by lipid mediators (LMs) through metabololipidomics-based profiling of human whole <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> (WB) during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coagul</span></strong>ation. We identified temporal clusters of endogenously produced prothrombotic and proinflammatory LMs (eicosanoids), as well as specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs). In addition to eicosanoids, a specific SPM cluster was identified that consisted of resolvin E1 (RvE1), RvD1, RvD5, lipoxin B<sub>4</sub>, and maresin 1, each of which was present at bioactive concentrations (0.1 to 1 nM). Removal of adenosine from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coagul</span></strong>ating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> markedly enhanced the amounts of SPMs produced and further increased the biosynthesis of RvD3, RvD4, and RvD6. The cyclooxygenase inhibitors celecoxib and indomethacin, which block the production of thromboxanes and prostanoids, did not block the production of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clot</span></strong>-driven SPMs. Unbiased mass cytometry analysis demonstrated that the SPM cluster produced in human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> targeted leukocytes at the single-cell level, directly activating ERK and CREB signaling in neutrophils and CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes. Treatment of human WB with the components of this SPM cluster enhanced both the phagocytosis and killing of <i>Escherichia coli</i> by leukocytes. Together, these data identify a proresolving LM circuit, including endogenous molecular brakes and accelerators, which promoted host defense. These temporal LM-SPM clusters can provide accessible metabolomic profiles for precision and personalized medicine.</p>

Association Between Urinary Sodium and Potassium Excretion and Blood Pressure Among Adults in the United States
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Higher levels of sodium and lower levels of potassium intake are associated with higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure. However, the shape and magnitude of these associations can vary by study participant characteristics or intake assessment method. Twenty-four–hour urinary excretion of sodium and potassium are unaffected by recall errors and represent all sources of intake, and were collected for the first time in a nationally representative US survey. Our objective was to assess the associations of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure and hypertension with 24-hour urinary excretion of sodium and potassium among US adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Cross-sectional data were obtained from 766 participants age 20 to 69 years with complete <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure and 24-hour urine collections in the 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a nationally representative survey of the US noninstitutionalized population.

Outcomes included systolic and diastolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure from the average of 3 measures and hypertension status, based on average <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure ≥140/90 and antihypertensive medication use.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>After multivariable adjustment, each 1000-mg difference in usual 24-hour sodium excretion was directly associated with systolic (4.58 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.64–6.51) and diastolic (2.25 mm Hg; 95% CI, 0.83–3.67) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressures. Each 1000-mg difference in potassium excretion was inversely associated with systolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure (–3.72 mm Hg; 95% CI, –6.01 to –1.42).

Potent Thrombolytic Effect of <i>N</i>-Acetylcysteine on Arterial Thrombi
<sec><title>Background:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platelet</span></strong> cross-linking during arterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thrombosi</span></strong>s involves von Willebrand Factor (VWF) multimers. Therefore, proteolysis of VWF appears promising to disaggregate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platelet</span></strong>-rich thrombi and restore vessel patency in acute thrombotic disorders such as ischemic stroke, acute coronary syndrome, or acute limb ischemia. <i>N</i>-Acetylcysteine (NAC, a clinically approved mucolytic drug) can reduce intrachain disulfide bonds in large polymeric proteins. In the present study, we postulated that NAC might cleave the VWF multimers inside occlusive thrombi, thereby leading to their dissolution and arterial recanalization.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Experimental models of thrombotic stroke induced by either intra-arterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thrombin</span></strong> injection or ferric chloride application followed by measurement of cerebral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> flow using a combination of laser Doppler flowmetry and MRI were performed to uncover the effects of NAC on arterial thrombi. To investigate the effect of NAC on larger vessels, we also performed ferric chloride–induced carotid artery <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thrombosi</span></strong>s. In vitro experiments were performed to study the molecular bases of NAC thrombolytic effect, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platelet</span></strong> aggregometry, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platelet</span></strong>-rich thrombi lysis assays, thromboelastography (ROTEM), and high-shear VWF string formation using microfluidic devices. We also investigated the putative prohemorrhagic effect of NAC in a mouse model of intracranial hemorrhage induced by in situ collagenase type VII injection.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We demonstrated that intravenous NAC administration promotes lysis of arterial thrombi that are resistant to conventional approaches such as recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator, direct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thrombin</span></strong> inhibitors, and anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platelet</span></strong> treatments. Through in vitro and in vivo experiments, we provide evidence that the molecular target underlying the thrombolytic effects of NAC is principally the VWF that cross-link <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platelet</span></strong>s in arterial thrombi. Coadministration of NAC and a nonpeptidic GpIIb/IIIa inhibitor further improved its thrombolytic efficacy, essentially by accelerating thrombus dissolution and preventing re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thrombosi</span></strong>s. Thus, in a new large-vessel thromboembolic stroke model in mice, this cotreatment significantly improved ischemic lesion size and neurological outcome. It is important to note that NAC did not worsen hemorrhagic stroke outcome, suggesting that it exerts thrombolytic effects without significantly impairing normal hemostasis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We provide evidence that NAC is an effective and safe alternative to currently available antithrombotic agents to restore vessel patency after arterial occlusion.</p></sec>

In these studies, thrombus quantification has been based on a 2-dimensional assessment of a 3-dimensional phenomenon.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Postprocedural, 4-dimensional, volume-rendered CT data of patients with CoreValve, Evolut R, and SAPIEN 3 transcatheter aortic valve replacement enrolled in the RESOLVE study (Assessment of Transcatheter and Surgical Aortic Bioprosthetic Valve Dysfunction With Multimodality Imaging and Its Treatment with Anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coagul</span></strong>ation) were included in this analysis. Patients on anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coagul</span></strong>ation were excluded.

Patients were classified as having THV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thrombosi</span></strong>s if there was any evidence of hypoattenuated leaflet thickening. Anatomic and THV deployment geometries were analyzed, and thrombus volumes were computed through manual 3-dimensional reconstruction. We aimed to identify and evaluate risk factors that contribute to THV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thrombosi</span></strong>s through the combination of retrospective clinical data analysis and in vitro imaging in the space between the native and THV leaflets (neosinus).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>SAPIEN 3 valves with leaflet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thrombosi</span></strong>s were on average 10% further expanded (by diameter) than those without (95.5±5.2% versus 85.4±3.9%; <i>P</i><0.001).

In CoreValve/Evolut Rs with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thrombosi</span></strong>s, the thrombus volume increased linearly with implant depth (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup>=0.7, <i>P</i><0.001). This finding was not seen in the SAPIEN 3. The in vitro analysis showed that a supraannular THV deployment resulted in a nearly 7-fold decrease in stagnation zone size (velocities <0.1 m/s) when compared with an intraannular deployment. In addition, the in vitro model indicated that the size of the stagnation zone increased as cardiac output decreased.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Although transcatheter aortic valve replacement <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thrombosi</span></strong>s is a multifactorial process involving foreign materials, patient-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> chemistry, and complex flow patterns, our study indicates that deployed THV geometry may have implications on the occurrence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thrombosi</span></strong>s. In addition, a supraannular neosinus may reduce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thrombosi</span></strong>s risk because of reduced flow stasis. Although additional prospective studies are needed to further develop strategies for minimizing thrombus burden, these results may help identify patients at higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thrombosi</span></strong>s risk and aid in the development of next-generation devices with reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thrombosi</span></strong>s risk.</p></sec>

Day-to-Day Blood Pressure Variability and Risk of Dementia in a General Japanese Elderly Population

Day-to-day systolic (SBP) and diastolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure variabilities, calculated as coefficients of variation (CoV) of home SBP and diastolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure, were categorized into quartiles. The hazard ratios and their 95% confidence intervals of the CoV levels of home <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure on the development of all-cause dementia, vascular dementia (VaD), and Alzheimer disease (AD) were computed with a Cox proportional hazards model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>During the follow-up, 194 subjects developed all-cause dementia; of these, 47 had VaD and 134 had AD. The age- and sex-adjusted incidences of all-cause dementia, VaD, and AD increased significantly with increasing CoV levels of home SBP (all <i>P</i> for trend <0.05). These associations remained unchanged after adjustment for potential confounding factors, including home SBP. Compared with subjects in the first quartile of CoV levels of home SBP, the risks of the development of all-cause dementia, VaD, and AD were significantly higher in those in the fourth quartile (hazard ratio=2.27, 95% confidence interval=1.45–3.55, <i>P</i><0.001 for all-cause dementia; hazard ratio=2.79, 95% confidence interval=1.04–7.51, <i>P</i>=0.03 for VaD; hazard ratio=2.22, 95% confidence interval=1.31–3.75, <i>P</i><0.001 for AD).

This response requires two cell surface ion channels—TRPC6, a channel that is activated by the stretch caused by increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure, and TRPM4, a channel that triggers the electrical impulses necessary for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> vessel constriction. Gonzales <i>et al.</i> found that activation of TRPC6 stimulated TRPM4 through calcium-dependent pathways. TRPC6, TRPM4, and the enzyme PLCγ1 were located in close proximity to each other in smooth muscle cells, indicating that a pressure-sensitive signaling network keeps <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> flowing in the brain.</p></sec>

Host DNases prevent vascular occlusion by neutrophil extracellular traps
<p>Platelet and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fibrin</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clot</span></strong>s occlude <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> vessels in hemostasis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thrombosi</span></strong>s. Here we report a noncanonical mechanism for vascular occlusion based on neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), DNA fibers released by neutrophils during inflammation. We investigated which host factors control NETs in vivo and found that two deoxyribonucleases (DNases), DNase1 and DNase1-like 3, degraded NETs in circulation during sterile neutrophilia and septicemia. In the absence of both DNases, intravascular NETs formed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clot</span></strong>s that obstructed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> vessels and caused organ damage. Vascular occlusions in patients with severe bacterial infections were associated with a defect to degrade NETs ex vivo and the formation of intravascular NET <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clot</span></strong>s. DNase1 and DNase1-like 3 are independently expressed and thus provide dual host protection against deleterious effects of intravascular NETs.</p>

Nitrite and <i>S</i>-Nitrosohemoglobin Exchange Across the Human Cerebral and Femoral Circulation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The mechanisms underlying red <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> cell (RBC)–mediated hypoxic vasodilation remain controversial, with separate roles for nitrite ([Formula]) and <i>S</i>-nitrosohemoglobin (SNO-Hb) widely contested given their ability to transduce nitric oxide bioactivity within the microcirculation. To establish their relative contribution in vivo, we quantified arterial-venous concentration gradients across the human cerebral and femoral circulation at rest and during exercise, an ideal model system characterized by physiological extremes of O<sub>2</sub> tension and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> flow.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Ten healthy participants (5 men, 5 women) aged 24±4 (mean±SD) years old were randomly assigned to a normoxic (21% O<sub>2</sub>) and hypoxic (10% O<sub>2</sub>) trial with measurements performed at rest and after 30 minutes of cycling at 70% of maximal power output in hypoxia and equivalent relative and absolute intensities in normoxia. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> was sampled simultaneously from the brachial artery and internal jugular and femoral veins with plasma and RBC nitric oxide metabolites measured by tri-iodide reductive chemiluminescence. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> flow was determined by transcranial Doppler ultrasound (cerebral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> flow) and constant infusion thermodilution (femoral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> flow) with net exchange calculated via the Fick principle.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Hypoxia was associated with a mild increase in both cerebral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> flow and femoral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> flow (<i>P</i><0.05 versus normoxia) with further, more pronounced increases observed in femoral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> flow during exercise (<i>P</i><0.05 versus rest) in proportion to the reduction in RBC oxygenation (<i>r</i>=0.680–0.769, <i>P</i><0.001).

Pharmacodynamic Effects of Switching From Ticagrelor to Clopidogrel in Patients With Coronary Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Switching between different classes of P2Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitors, including de-escalation from ticagrelor to clopidogrel, commonly occurs in clinical practice. However, the pharmacodynamic profiles of this strategy have been poorly explored.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This was a prospective, randomized, open-label study conducted in patients on maintenance dosing (MD) of aspirin (81 mg/d) and clopidogrel (75 mg/d). After a 7-day run-in with ticagrelor (180 mg loading dose [LD] followed by 90 mg twice daily MD), patients (n=80) were randomized into 1 of 4 groups: group A, clopidogrel 600 mg LD 24 hours after the last MD of ticagrelor (C-600 mg-24h); group B, clopidogrel 600 mg LD 12 hours after the last MD of ticagrelor (C-600 mg-12h); group C, clopidogrel 75 mg/d MD 24 hours after the last MD of ticagrelor (C-75 mg-24h); and group D, ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily MD (T-90 mg twice daily). MD of the randomized treatment was maintained for 10±3 days. Pharmacodynamic assessments were performed at baseline, after run-in, and at 2, 24, 48, and 72 hours and 10 days with P2Y<sub>12</sub> reaction units by VerifyNow; <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platelet</span></strong> reactivity index was assessed by vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein; and maximal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platelet</span></strong> aggregation was determined by light transmittance aggregometry.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>T-90 mg twice daily led to lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platelet</span></strong> reactivity than any clopidogrel regimen using all assays at all time points. P2Y<sub>12</sub> reaction unit levels were similar between the C-600 mg-24h (group A) and the C-75 mg-24h (group C) (<i>P</i>=0.29), including at 48 hours (primary end point; least mean difference, −6.9; 95% confidence interval, −38.1 to 24.3; <i>P</i>=0.66). P2Y<sub>12</sub> reaction unit levels were lower with C-600 mg-12h (group B) than with C-75 mg-24h (group C; <i>P</i>=0.024). Maximal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platelet</span></strong> aggregation over time was lower with both C-600 mg-24h (group A; <i>P</i>=0.041) and C-600 mg-12h (group B; <i>P</i>=0.028) compared with C-75 mg-24h (group C). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platelet</span></strong> reactivity index profiles paralleled those observed with P2Y<sub>12</sub> reaction units. There were no pharmacodynamic differences for all tests between C-600 mg-24h (group A) and C-600 mg-12h (group B). In group C (C-75 mg-24h), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platelet</span></strong> reactivity increased compared with baseline as early as 24 hours, reaching statistical significance at 48 and 72 hours and up to 10 days. These pharmacodynamic findings were delayed and blunted in magnitude with the administration of an LD, regardless of the timing of administration.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>De-escalation from ticagrelor to clopidogrel therapy is associated with an increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platelet</span></strong> reactivity. The use of an LD before the initiation of an MD regimen of clopidogrel mitigates these observations, although this is not affected by the timing of its administration after ticagrelor discontinuation.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

High On-Treatment Platelet Reactivity as a Risk Factor for Secondary Prevention After Coronary Stent Revascularization

Whether results are different during the phase of secondary prevention starting after hospital discharge, when periprocedural events have been excluded, is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>In ARCTIC, 2440 patients were randomized before coronary stenting to a strategy of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platelet</span></strong> function monitoring (VerifyNow P2Y<sub>12</sub>/aspirin point-of-care assay) with drug adjustment in suboptimal responders to anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platelet</span></strong> therapy or to a conventional strategy without monitoring and without drug or dose changes.

Bmal1 in Perivascular Adipose Tissue Regulates Resting-Phase Blood Pressure Through Transcriptional Regulation of Angiotensinogen
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) surrounding vessels constitutes a distinct functional integral layer of the vasculature required to preserve vascular tone under physiological conditions. However, there is little information on the relationship between PVAT and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure regulation, including its potential contributions to circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure variation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using unique brown adipocyte–specific aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like protein 1 (Bmal1) and angiotensinogen knockout mice, we determined the vasoactivity of homogenized PVAT in aortic rings and how brown adipocyte peripheral expression of Bmal1 and angiotensinogen in PVAT regulates the amplitude of diurnal change in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure in mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We uncovered a peripheral clock in PVAT and demonstrated that loss of Bmal1 in PVAT reduces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure in mice during the resting phase, leading to a superdipper phenotype. PVAT extracts from wild-type mice significantly induced contractility of isolated aortic rings in vitro in an endothelium-independent manner. This property was impaired in PVAT from brown adipocyte–selective Bmal1-deficient (BA-Bmal1-KO) mice. The PVAT contractile properties were mediated by local angiotensin II, operating through angiotensin II type 1 receptor–dependent signaling in the isolated vessels and linked to PVAT circadian regulation of angiotensinogen. Indeed, angiotensinogen mRNA and angiotensin II levels in PVAT of BA-Bmal1-KO mice were significantly reduced. Systemic infusion of angiotensin II, in turn, reduced Bmal1 expression in PVAT while eliminating the hypotensive phenotype during the resting phase in BA-Bmal1-KO mice. Angiotensinogen, highly expressed in PVAT, shows circadian expression in PVAT, and selective deletion of angiotensinogen in brown adipocytes recapitulates the phenotype of selective deletion of Bmal1 in brown adipocytes. Furthermore, angiotensinogen is a transcriptional target of Bmal1 in PVAT.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These data indicate that local Bmal1 in PVAT regulates angiotensinogen expression and the ensuing increase in angiotensin II, which acts on smooth muscle cells in the vessel walls to regulate vasoactivity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure in a circadian fashion during the resting phase. These findings will contribute to a better understanding of the cardiovascular complications of circadian disorders, alterations in the circadian dipping phenotype, and cross-talk between systemic and peripheral regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure.</p></sec>

We report the influence of adherence to antihypertensive treatment on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure control.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>One hundred six patients with hypertension resistant to 4 weeks of treatment with indapamide 1.5 mg/d, ramipril 10 mg/d (or irbesartan 300 mg/d), and amlodipine 10 mg/d were randomly assigned to renal denervation plus standardized stepped-care antihypertensive treatment, or the same antihypertensive treatment alone. For standardized stepped-care antihypertensive treatment, spironolactone 25 mg/d, bisoprolol 10 mg/d, prazosin 5 mg/d, and rilmenidine 1 mg/d were sequentially added at monthly visits if home <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure was ≥135/85 mm Hg after randomization.

Gene expression profiles of brain endothelial cells during embryonic development at bulk and single-cell levels
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong>-brain barrier is a dynamic interface that separates the brain from the circulatory system, and it is formed by highly specialized endothelial cells. To explore the molecular mechanisms defining the unique nature of vascular development and differentiation in the brain, we generated high-resolution gene expression profiles of mouse embryonic brain endothelial cells using translating ribosome affinity purification and single-cell RNA sequencing. We compared the brain vascular translatome with the vascular translatomes of other organs and analyzed the vascular translatomes of the brain at different time points during embryonic development. Because canonical Wnt signaling is implicated in the formation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong>-brain barrier, we also compared the brain endothelial translatome of wild-type mice with that of mice lacking the transcriptional cofactor β-catenin (<i>Ctnnb1</i>). Our analysis revealed extensive molecular changes during the embryonic development of the brain endothelium. We identified genes encoding brain endothelium–specific transcription factors (<i>Foxf2</i>, <i>Foxl2</i>, <i>Foxq1</i>, <i>Lef1</i>, <i>Ppard</i>, <i>Zfp551</i>, and <i>Zic3</i>) that are associated with maturation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong>-brain barrier and act downstream of the Wnt–β-catenin signaling pathway. Profiling of individual brain endothelial cells revealed substantial heterogeneity in the population. Nevertheless, the high abundance of <i>Foxf2</i>, <i>Foxq1</i>, <i>Ppard</i>, or <i>Zic3</i> transcripts correlated with the increased expression of genes encoding markers of brain endothelial cell differentiation. Expression of <i>Foxf2</i> and <i>Zic3</i> in human umbilical vein endothelial cells induced the production of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong>-brain barrier differentiation markers. This comprehensive data set may help to improve the engineering of in vitro <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong>-brain barrier models.</p>

Association of Traditional Cardiovascular Risk Factors With Venous Thromboembolism
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Much controversy surrounds the association of traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors with venous thromboembolism (VTE).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed an individual level random-effect meta-analysis including 9 prospective studies with measured baseline cardiovascular disease risk factors and validated VTE events. Definitions were harmonized across studies. Traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors were modeled categorically and continuously using restricted cubic splines. Estimates were obtained for overall VTE, provoked VTE (ie, VTE occurring in the presence of 1 or more established VTE risk factors), and unprovoked VTE, pulmonary embolism, and deep-vein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thrombosi</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The studies included 244 865 participants with 4910 VTE events occurring during a mean follow-up of 4.7 to 19.7 years per study. Age, sex, and body mass index-adjusted hazard ratios for overall VTE were 0.98 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.89−1.07) for hypertension, 0.97 (95% CI: 0.88−1.08) for hyperlipidemia, 1.01 (95% CI: 0.89−1.15) for diabetes mellitus, and 1.19 (95% CI: 1.08−1.32) for current smoking. After full adjustment, these estimates were numerically similar. When modeled continuously, an inverse association was observed for systolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure (hazard ratio=0.79 [95% CI: 0.68−0.92] at systolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure 160 vs 110 mm Hg) but not for diastolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure or lipid measures with VTE. An important finding from VTE subtype analyses was that cigarette smoking was associated with provoked but not unprovoked VTE. Fully adjusted hazard ratios for the associations of current smoking with provoked and unprovoked VTE were 1.36 (95% CI: 1.22−1.52) and 1.08 (95% CI: 0.90−1.29), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Except for the association between cigarette smoking and provoked VTE, which is potentially mediated through comorbid conditions such as cancer, the modifiable traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors are not associated with increased VTE risk. Higher systolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure showed an inverse association with VTE.</p></sec>

Has a second person with HIV been cured?
<p>Since the AIDS epidemic surfaced in 1980, some 75 million people have been infected with HIV and only one person has been cured, Timothy Ray Brown, aka the "Berlin patient." Now, a second infected person, who received a similar intervention to Brown, also appears to have cleared his infection. Both Brown and a man dubbed "the London patient" had <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> cancers that required stem cell transplants. At the advice of their doctors, they received transplants from immunologically matched donors who also happened to have mutations in CCR5, a receptor on white <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> cells that HIV uses to establish infections. The transplants may have also helped rid their bodies of HIV because they required "conditioning" regimens of toxic chemicals—and in the case of Brown, whole body irradiation, too—to kill off their tumor cells. What's more, they both had graft-versus-host disease in which the donor immune cells attack the recipient's tissues as foreign, which further could have killed residual HIV. As the London patient's doctor explained at an AIDS conference in Seattle, Washington, this week and in a description of the case in <i>Nature</i>, the man (who wants to remain anonymous) has been off anti-HIV drugs for 18 months and has no detectable virus in his <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> on the most sensitive assays. The researchers studying him are being cautious and saying he is in long-term remission, not cured—and indeed the virus has rebounded in others who looked cured but many months later had HIV resurface. The intensive intervention also will only make sense for HIV-infected people with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> cancers, a tiny fraction of the 37 million people living with the virus today. But there's hope that if both men indeed are cured it will spur simpler interventions that genetically modify CCR5, some of which are being studied today.</p>

Targeting an energy sensor to treat diabetes
<p>Obesity occurs when whole-body energy intake exceeds energy expenditure for prolonged periods. This is a major public health issue because obesity increases the risk of disorders such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The liver and muscle store excess energy in the form of fat, leading to resistance to the hormone insulin. Released when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> glucose rises after meals, insulin normally promotes glucose uptake by muscle and represses glucose production by the liver, thus rapidly returning <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> glucose to normal. However, this process is impaired in insulin-resistant individuals, who may eventually develop persistently elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> glucose (i.e., T2DM), which can cause debilitating or life-threatening complications. Because the energy sensor AMPK (adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase) promotes muscle glucose uptake by insulin-independent mechanisms, it was proposed in 1999 that AMPK-activating drugs might represent a novel approach to treating T2DM (<i>1</i>). Representing the culmination of more than 15 years of developing this concept, a study by Myers <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) on page 507 of this issue and a study by Cokorinos <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) show that compounds that bind to a unique site on AMPK can promote glucose uptake by muscle, and hence reverse elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> glucose in animal models of T2DM.</p>

A key malaria metabolite modulates vector blood seeking, feeding, and susceptibility to infection
<p>Malaria infection renders humans more attractive to <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> sensu lato mosquitoes than uninfected people. The mechanisms remain unknown. We found that an isoprenoid precursor produced by <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>, (<i>E</i>)-4-hydroxy-3-methyl-but-2-enyl pyrophosphate (HMBPP), affects <i>A. gambiae</i> s.l. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> meal seeking and feeding behaviors as well as susceptibility to infection. HMBPP acts indirectly by triggering human red <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> cells to increase the release of CO<sub>2</sub>, aldehydes, and monoterpenes, which together enhance vector attraction and stimulate vector feeding. When offered in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> meal, HMBPP modulates neural, antimalarial, and oogenic gene transcription without affecting mosquito survival or fecundity; in a <i>P. falciparum</i>–infected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> meal, sporogony is increased.</p>

Outcomes were compared by use of propensity score adjustment to account for baseline differences between groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>One hundred six patients with a PDA stent and 251 patients with a BT shunt were included. The groups differed in underlying anatomy (expected 2-ventricle circulation in 60% of PDA stents versus 45% of BT shunts; <i>P</i>=0.001) and presence of antegrade pulmonary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> flow (61% of PDA stents versus 38% of BT shunts; <i>P</i><0.001). After propensity score adjustment, there was no difference in the hazard of the primary composite outcome of death or unplanned reintervention to treat cyanosis (hazard ratio, 0.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52–1.23; <i>P</i>=0.31). Other reinterventions were more common in the PDA stent group (hazard ratio, 29.8; 95% CI, 9.8–91.1; <i>P</i><0.001).

Association Between Diastolic Blood Pressure During Pediatric In-Hospital Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Survival
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>On the basis of laboratory cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) investigations and limited adult data demonstrating that survival depends on attaining adequate arterial diastolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure (DBP) during CPR, the American Heart Association recommends using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure to guide pediatric CPR. However, evidence-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure targets during pediatric CPR remain an important knowledge gap for CPR guidelines.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>All children ≥37 weeks’ gestation and <19 years old in Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network intensive care units with chest compressions for ≥1 minute and invasive arterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure monitoring before and during CPR between July 1, 2013, and June 31, 2016, were included. Mean DBP during CPR and Utstein-style standardized cardiac arrest data were collected. The hypothesis was that DBP ≥25 mm Hg during CPR in infants and ≥30 mm Hg in children ≥1 year old would be associated with survival. Primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. Secondary outcome was survival to hospital discharge with favorable neurological outcome, defined as Pediatric Cerebral Performance Categories 1 to 3 or no worse than prearrest baseline. Multivariable Poisson regression models with robust error estimates were used to estimate the relative risk of outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Blinded investigators analyzed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure waveforms during CPR from 164 children, including 60% <1 year old, 60% with congenital heart disease, and 54% after cardiac surgery. The immediate cause of arrest was hypotension in 67%, respiratory decompensation in 44%, and arrhythmia in 19%. Median duration of CPR was 8 minutes (quartiles, 3 and 27 minutes). Ninety percent survived the event, 68% with return of spontaneous circulation and 22% by extracorporeal life support. Forty-seven percent survived to hospital discharge, and 43% survived to discharge with favorable neurological outcome. Maintaining mean DBP ≥25 mm Hg in infants and ≥30 mm Hg in children ≥1 year old occurred in 101 of 164 children (62%) and was associated with survival (adjusted relative risk, 1.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.2–2.6; <i>P</i>=0.007) and survival with favorable neurological outcome (adjusted relative risk, 1.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.1–2.5; <i>P</i>=0.02).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These data demonstrate that mean DBP ≥25 mm Hg during CPR in infants and ≥30 mm Hg in children ≥1 year old was associated with greater likelihood of survival to hospital discharge and survival with favorable neurological outcome.</p></sec>

Functional Characterization of the <i>GUCY1A3</i> Coronary Artery Disease Risk Locus
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>A chromosomal locus at 4q32.1 has been genome-wide significantly associated with coronary artery disease risk. The locus encompasses <i>GUCY1A3</i>, which encodes the α<sub>1</sub> subunit of the soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC), a key enzyme in the nitric oxide/cGMP signaling pathway. The mechanism linking common variants in this region with coronary risk is not known.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Gene expression and protein expression were analyzed with quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting, respectively. Putative allele-specific transcription factors were identified with in silico analyses and validated via allele-specific quantification of antibody-precipitated chromatin fractions. Regulatory properties of the lead risk variant region were analyzed with reporter gene assays. To assess the effect of zinc finger E box-binding homeobox 1 transcription factor (ZEB1), siRNA-mediated knockdown and overexpression experiments were performed. Association of <i>GUCY1A3</i> genotype and cellular phenotypes was analyzed with vascular smooth muscle cell migration assays and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platelet</span></strong> aggregation analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> <i>GUCY1A3</i> mRNA levels were significantly lower in individuals homozygous for the lead (rs7692387) risk variant. Likewise, reporter gene assays demonstrated significantly lower <i>GUCY1A3</i> promoter activity for constructs carrying this allele. In silico analyses located a DNase I hypersensitivity site to rs7692387 and predicted binding of the transcription factor ZEB1 rather to the nonrisk allele, which was confirmed experimentally. Knockdown of <i>ZEB1</i> resulted in more profound reduction of nonrisk allele promoter activity and a significant reduction of endogenous <i>GUCY1A3</i> expression. Ex vivo–studied <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platelet</span></strong>s from homozygous nonrisk allele carriers displayed enhanced inhibition of ADP-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platelet</span></strong> aggregation by the nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside and the phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor sildenafil compared with homozygous risk allele carriers. Moreover, pharmacological stimulation of sGC led to reduced migration only in vascular smooth muscle cells homozygous for the nonrisk allele. In the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel, higher levels of <i>GUCY1A3</i> expression correlated with less atherosclerosis in the aorta.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Rs7692387 is located in an intronic site that modulates <i>GUCY1A3</i> promoter activity. The transcription factor ZEB1 binds preferentially to the nonrisk allele, leading to an increase in <i>GUCY1A3</i> expression, higher sGC levels, and higher sGC activity after stimulation. Finally, human and mouse data link augmented sGC expression to lower risk of atherosclerosis.</p></sec>

J Curve in Patients Randomly Assigned to Different Systolic Blood Pressure Targets
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Low systolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure (SBP) values are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, giving rise to the so-called J-curve phenomenon. We assessed the association between on-treatment SBP levels, cardiovascular events, and all-cause mortality in patients randomized to different SBP targets.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data from 2 large randomized trials that randomly allocated hypertensive patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease to intensive (SBP<120 mm Hg) or conventional (SBP<140 mm Hg) treatment were pooled and harmonized for outcomes and follow-up duration. Using natural cubic splines, we plotted the hazard ratio for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events against the mean on-treatment SBP per treatment group.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The pooled data consisted of 194 875 on-treatment SBP measurements in 13 946 patients (98.9%). During a median follow-up of 3.3 years, cardiovascular events occurred in 1014 patients (7.3%), and 502 patients died (3.7%). For both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure targets, an identical shape of the J curve was present, with a nadir for cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality just below the SBP target. Patients in the lowest SBP stratum were older, had a higher body mass index, smoked more often, and had a higher frequency of diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular events.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Low on-treatment SBP levels are associated with increased cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. This association is independent of the attained <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure level because the J curve aligns with the SBP target.

Hemocompatibility-Related Outcomes in the MOMENTUM 3 Trial at 6 Months

Protective Effects of Ticagrelor on Myocardial Injury After Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor antagonist ticagrelor has been shown to be clinically superior to clopidogrel. Although the underlying mechanisms remain elusive, ticagrelor may exert off-target effects through adenosine-related mechanisms. We aimed to investigate whether ticagrelor reduces myocardial injury to a greater extent than clopidogrel after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myocardial infarct</span></strong>ion (MI) at a similar level of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platelet</span></strong> inhibition and to determine the underlying mechanisms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Pigs received the following before MI induction: (1) placebo-control; (2) a loading dose of clopidogrel (600 mg); (3) a loading dose of ticagrelor (180 mg); or (4) a loading dose of ticagrelor followed by an adenosine A1/A2-receptor antagonist [8-(<i>p</i>-sulfophenyl)theophylline, 4 mg/kg intravenous] to determine the potential contribution of adenosine in ticagrelor-related cardioprotection. Animals received the corresponding maintenance doses of the anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platelet</span></strong> agents during the following 24 hours and underwent 3T-cardiac MRI analysis. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platelet</span></strong> inhibition was monitored by ADP-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platelet</span></strong> aggregation. In the myocardium, we assessed the expression and activation of proteins known to modulate edema formation, including aquaporin-4 and AMP-activated protein kinase and its downstream effectors CD36 and endothelial nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Clopidogrel and ticagrelor exerted a high and consistent anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platelet</span></strong> effect (68.2% and 62.2% of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platelet</span></strong> inhibition, respectively, on challenge with 20 μmol/L ADP) that persisted up to 24 hours post-MI (<i>P</i><0.05). All groups showed comparable myocardial area-at-risk and cardiac worsening after MI induction. 3T-Cardiac MRI analysis revealed that clopidogrel- and ticagrelor-treated animals had a significantly smaller extent of MI than placebo-control animals (15.7 g left ventricle and 12.0 g left ventricle versus 22.8 g left ventricle, respectively). Yet, ticagrelor reduced infarct size to a significantly greater extent than clopidogrel (further 23.5% reduction; <i>P</i>=0.0026), an effect supported by troponin-I assessment and histopathologic analysis (<i>P</i>=0.0021). Furthermore, in comparison with clopidogrel, ticagrelor significantly diminished myocardial edema by 24.5% (<i>P</i>=0.004), which correlated with infarct mass (<i>r</i>=0.73; <i>P</i><0.001). 8-(<i>p</i>-Sulfophenyl)theophylline administration abolished the cardioprotective effects of ticagrelor over clopidogrel. At a molecular level, aquaporin-4 expression decreased and the expression and activation of AMP-activated protein kinase signaling and cyclooxygenase-2 increased in the ischemic myocardium of ticagrelor- versus clopidogrel-treated animals (<i>P</i><0.05). These protein changes were not observed in those animals administered the adenosine receptor blocker 8-(<i>p</i>-sulfophenyl)theophylline.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Ticagrelor, beyond its anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platelet</span></strong> efficacy, exerts cardioprotective effects by reducing necrotic injury and edema formation via adenosine-dependent mechanisms.</p></sec>

The Global Cardiovascular Risk Transition
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>It is commonly assumed that cardiovascular disease risk factors are associated with affluence and Westernization. We investigated the associations of body mass index (BMI), fasting plasma glucose, systolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure, and serum total cholesterol with national income, Western diet, and, for BMI, urbanization in 1980 and 2008.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Country-level risk factor estimates for 199 countries between 1980 and 2008 were from a previous systematic analysis of population-based data. We analyzed the associations between risk factors and per capita national income, a measure of Western diet, and, for BMI, the percentage of the population living in urban areas. In 1980, there was a positive association between national income and population mean BMI, systolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure, and total cholesterol. By 2008, the slope of the association between national income and systolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure became negative for women and zero for men. Total cholesterol was associated with national income and Western diet in both 1980 and 2008. In 1980, BMI rose with national income and then flattened at ≈Int$7000; by 2008, the relationship resembled an inverted U for women, peaking at middle-income levels. BMI had a positive relationship with the percentage of urban population in both 1980 and 2008. Fasting plasma glucose had weaker associations with these country macro characteristics, but it was positively associated with BMI.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>The changing associations of metabolic risk factors with macroeconomic variables indicate that there will be a global pandemic of hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus, together with high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure in low-income countries, unless effective lifestyle and pharmacological interventions are implemented.</p></sec>

Perivascular dendritic cells elicit anaphylaxis by relaying allergens to mast cells via microvesicles
<p>Anaphylactic reactions are triggered when allergens enter the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> circulation and activate immunoglobulin E (IgE)–sensitized mast cells (MCs), causing systemic discharge of prestored proinflammatory mediators. As MCs are extravascular, how they perceive circulating allergens remains a conundrum. Here, we describe the existence of a CD301b<sup>+</sup> perivascular dendritic cell (DC) subset that continuously samples <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> and relays antigens to neighboring MCs, which vigorously degranulate and trigger anaphylaxis. DC antigen transfer involves the active discharge of surface-associated antigens on 0.5- to 1.0-micrometer microvesicles (MVs) generated by vacuolar protein sorting 4 (VPS4). Antigen sharing by DCs is not limited to MCs, as neighboring DCs also acquire antigen-bearing MVs. This capacity of DCs to distribute antigen-bearing MVs to various immune cells in the perivascular space potentiates inflammatory and immune responses to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong>-borne antigens.</p>

PIEZOs mediate neuronal sensing of blood pressure and the baroreceptor reflex
<p>Activation of stretch-sensitive baroreceptor neurons exerts acute control over heart rate and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure. Although this homeostatic baroreflex has been described for more than 80 years, the molecular identity of baroreceptor mechanosensitivity remains unknown. We discovered that mechanically activated ion channels PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 are together required for baroreception. Genetic ablation of both <i>Piezo1</i> and <i>Piezo2</i> in the nodose and petrosal sensory ganglia of mice abolished drug-induced baroreflex and aortic depressor nerve activity. Awake, behaving animals that lack <i>Piezos</i> had labile hypertension and increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure variability, consistent with phenotypes in baroreceptor-denervated animals and humans with baroreflex failure. Optogenetic activation of <i>Piezo2</i>-positive sensory afferents was sufficient to initiate baroreflex in mice. These findings suggest that PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 are the long-sought baroreceptor mechanosensors critical for acute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure control.</p>

Lymph node blood vessels provide exit routes for metastatic tumor cell dissemination in mice
<p>During metastasis, malignant cells escape the primary tumor, intravasate lymphatic vessels, and reach draining sentinel lymph nodes before they colonize distant organs via the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> circulation. Although lymph node metastasis in cancer patients correlates with poor prognosis, evidence is lacking as to whether and how tumor cells enter the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong>stream via lymph nodes. To investigate this question, we delivered carcinoma cells into the lymph nodes of mice by microinfusing the cells into afferent lymphatic vessels. We found that tumor cells rapidly infiltrated the lymph node parenchyma, invaded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> vessels, and seeded lung metastases without involvement of the thoracic duct. These results suggest that the lymph node <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> vessels can serve as an exit route for systemic dissemination of cancer cells in experimental mouse models. Whether this form of tumor cell spreading occurs in cancer patients remains to be determined.</p>

Resistance to malaria through structural variation of red blood cell invasion receptors
<p>The malaria parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> invades human red <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> cells by a series of interactions between host and parasite surface proteins. By analyzing genome sequence data from human populations, including 1269 individuals from sub-Saharan Africa, we identify a diverse array of large copy-number variants affecting the host invasion receptor genes <i>GYPA</i> and <i>GYPB</i>. We find that a nearby association with severe malaria is explained by a complex structural rearrangement involving the loss of <i>GYPB</i> and gain of two <i>GYPB-A</i> hybrid genes, which encode a serologically distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> group antigen known as Dantu. This variant reduces the risk of severe malaria by 40% and has recently increased in frequency in parts of Kenya, yet it appears to be absent from west Africa. These findings link structural variation of red <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> cell invasion receptors with natural resistance to severe malaria.</p>

Deep-diving sea lions exhibit extreme bradycardia in long-duration dives
<p>Heart rate and peripheral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> flow distribution are the primary determinants of the rate and pattern of oxygen store utilisation and ultimately breath-hold duration in marine endotherms. Despite this, little is known about how otariids (sea lions and fur seals) regulate heart rate (<i>f</i><sub>H</sub>) while diving. We investigated dive <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> in five adult female California sea lions (<i>Zalophus californianus</i>) during foraging trips by instrumenting them with digital electrocardiogram (ECG) loggers and time depth recorders. In all dives, dive <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> (number of beats/duration; 50±9 beats min<sup>−1</sup>) decreased compared with surface rates (113±5 beats min<sup>−1</sup>), with all dives exhibiting an instantaneous <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> below resting (<54 beats min<sup>−1</sup>) at some point during the dive. Both dive <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> and minimum instantaneous <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> significantly decreased with increasing dive duration. Typical instantaneous <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> profiles of deep dives (>100 m) consisted of: (1) an initial rapid decline in <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> resulting in the lowest instantaneous <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> of the dive at the end of descent, often below 10 beats min<sup>−1</sup> in dives longer than 6 min in duration; (2) a slight increase in <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> to ~10–40 beats min<sup>−1</sup> during the bottom portion of the dive; and (3) a gradual increase in <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> during ascent with a rapid increase prior to surfacing. Thus, <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> regulation in deep-diving sea lions is not simply a progressive bradycardia. Extreme bradycardia and the presumed associated reductions in pulmonary and peripheral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> flow during late descent of deep dives should (a) contribute to preservation of the lung oxygen store, (b) increase dependence of muscle on the myoglobin-bound oxygen store, (c) conserve the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> oxygen store and (d) help limit the absorption of nitrogen at depth. This <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> profile during deep dives of sea lions may be characteristic of deep-diving marine endotherms that dive on inspiration as similar <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> profiles have been recently documented in the emperor penguin, another deep diver that dives on inspiration.</p>

Simultaneous high-resolution pH and spectrophotometric recordings of oxygen binding in blood microvolumes
<p>Oxygen equilibrium curves have been widely used to understand oxygen transport in numerous organisms. A major challenge has been to monitor oxygen binding characteristics and concomitant pH changes as they occur <i>in vivo</i>, in limited sample volumes. Here we report a technique allowing highly resolved and simultaneous monitoring of pH and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pigment saturation in minute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> volumes. We equipped a gas diffusion chamber with a broad-range fibre-optic spectrophotometer and a micro-pH optode and recorded changes of pigment oxygenation along oxygen partial pressure (<i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>) and pH gradients to test the setup. Oxygen binding parameters derived from measurements in only 15 μl of haemolymph from the cephalopod <i>Octopus vulgaris</i> showed low instrumental error (0.93%) and good agreement with published data. Broad-range spectra, each resolving 2048 data points, provided detailed insight into the complex absorbance characteristics of diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> types. After consideration of photobleaching and intrinsic fluorescence, pH optodes yielded accurate recordings and resolved a sigmoidal shift of 0.03 pH units in response to changing <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> from 0 to 21 kPa. Highly resolved continuous recordings along pH gradients conformed to stepwise measurements at low rates of pH changes. In this study we showed that a diffusion chamber upgraded with a broad-range spectrophotometer and an optical pH sensor accurately characterizes oxygen binding with minimal sample consumption and manipulation. We conclude that the modified diffusion chamber is highly suitable for experimental biologists who demand high flexibility, detailed insight into oxygen binding as well as experimental and biological accuracy combined in a single setup.</p>

Mid-term changes in blood metal ion levels after Articular Surface Replacement arthroplasty of the hip

Phenotypic Consequences of a Genetic Predisposition to Enhanced Nitric Oxide Signaling

Here, we seek to understand the impact of a genetic predisposition to enhanced nitric oxide signaling on risk for cardiovascular diseases, thus informing the potential utility of pharmacological stimulation of the nitric oxide pathway as a therapeutic strategy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We analyzed the association of common and rare genetic variants in 2 genes that mediate nitric oxide signaling (Nitric Oxide Synthase 3 [<i>NOS3</i>] and Guanylate Cyclase 1, Soluble, Alpha 3 [<i>GUCY1A3</i>]) with a range of human phenotypes. We selected 2 common variants (rs3918226 in <i>NOS3</i> and rs7692387 in <i>GUCY1A3</i>) known to associate with increased <i>NOS3</i> and <i>GUCY1A3</i> expression and reduced mean arterial pressure, combined them into a genetic score, and standardized this exposure to a 5 mm Hg reduction in mean arterial pressure. Using individual-level data from 335 464 participants in the UK Biobank and summary association results from 7 large-scale genome-wide association studies, we examined the effect of this nitric oxide signaling score on cardiometabolic and other diseases. We also examined whether rare loss-of-function mutations in <i>NOS3</i> and <i>GUCY1A3</i> were associated with coronary heart disease using gene sequencing data from the Myocardial Infarction Genetics Consortium (n=27 815).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A genetic predisposition to enhanced nitric oxide signaling was associated with reduced risks of coronary heart disease (odds ratio, 0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31-0.45; <i>P</i>=5.5*10<sup>–26</sup>], peripheral arterial disease (odds ratio 0.42; 95% CI, 0.26-0.68; <i>P</i>=0.0005), and stroke (odds ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.37-0.76; <i>P</i>=0.0006).

The primary end point was the composite of mortality, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myocardial infarct</span></strong>ion, disabling stroke, and rehospitalization for cardiovascular causes or bleeding within 1 year. The study was designed to demonstrate superiority of prasugrel 5 mg over clopidogrel 75 mg.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Enrollment was interrupted, according to prespecified criteria, after a planned interim analysis, when 1443 patients (40% women; mean age, 80 years) had been enrolled with a median follow-up of 12 months, because of futility for efficacy. The primary end point occurred in 121 patients (17%) with prasugrel and 121 (16.6%) with clopidogrel (hazard ratio, 1.007; 95% confidence interval, 0.78–1.30; <i>P</i>=0.955). Definite/probable stent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thrombosi</span></strong>s rates were 0.7% with prasugrel versus 1.9% with clopidogrel (odds ratio, 0.36; 95% confidence interval, 0.13–1.00; <i>P</i>=0.06). Bleeding Academic Research Consortium types 2 and greater rates were 4.1% with prasugrel versus 2.7% with clopidogrel (odds ratio, 1.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.85–3.16; <i>P</i>=0.18).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The present study in elderly patients with acute coronary syndromes showed no difference in the primary end point between reduced-dose prasugrel and standard-dose clopidogrel.

Effects of Bariatric Surgery in Obese Patients With Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Recent research efforts on bariatric surgery have focused on metabolic and diabetes mellitus resolution. Randomized trials designed to assess the impact of bariatric surgery in patients with obesity and hypertension are needed.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In this randomized, single-center, nonblinded trial, we included patients with hypertension (using ≥2 medications at maximum doses or >2 at moderate doses) and a body mass index between 30.0 and 39.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Patients were randomized to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass plus medical therapy or medical therapy alone. The primary end point was reduction of ≥30% of the total number of antihypertensive medications while maintaining systolic and diastolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure <140 mm Hg and 90 mm Hg, respectively, at 12 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We included 100 patients (70% female, mean age 43.8±9.2 years, mean body mass index 36.9±2.7 kg/m2), and 96% completed follow-up. Reduction of ≥30% of the total number of antihypertensive medications while maintaining controlled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure occurred in 41 of 49 patients from the gastric bypass group (83.7%) compared with 6 of 47 patients (12.8%) from the control group with a rate ratio of 6.6 (95% confidence interval, 3.1–14.0; <i>P</i><0.001). Remission of hypertension was present in 25 of 49 (51%) and 22 of 48 (45.8%) patients randomized to gastric bypass, considering office and 24-hour ambulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure monitoring, respectively, whereas no patient submitted to medical therapy was free of antihypertensive drugs at 12 months. A post hoc analysis for the primary end point considering the SPRINT (Systolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> Pressure Intervention Trial) target reached consistent results, with a rate ratio of 3.8 (95% confidence interval, 1.4–10.6; <i>P</i>=0.005). Eleven patients (22.4%) from the gastric bypass group and none in the control group were able to achieve SPRINT levels without antihypertensives. Waist circumference, body mass index, fasting plasma glucose, glycohemoglobin, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and 10-year Framingham risk score were lower in the gastric bypass than in the control group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Bariatric surgery represents an effective strategy for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure control in a broad population of patients with obesity and hypertension.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Left Ventricular Assist Device Malfunctions
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Reports of left ventricular assist device (LVAD) malfunction have focused on pump <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thrombosi</span></strong>s. However, the device consists of the pump, driveline, and peripherals, all of which are potentially subject to failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Prospectively collected data were reviewed for all LVAD device malfunctions (DMs) occurring in rotary LVADs implanted at a single center between April 2004 and May 2016. Durable LVADs included 108 Heartmate II (HM II) and 105 HeartWare VAD (HVAD). DM data were categorized according to device type and into categories related to the component that failed: (1) controller, (2) peripheral components, and (3) implantable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pump or its integral electric driveline. Pump-related events were analyzed as pump-specific (suspected or confirmed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thrombosi</span></strong>s) or nonpump-specific (driveline failure). DM rates were reported as events per 1000 patient-days, and Cox proportional hazard models were used for time-to-event analyses. Cumulative rates of malfunction were examined for the main components of each type of LVAD.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Types of DM included controller failure (30%), battery failure (19%), or patient cable failure (14%), whereas only 13% were because of pump failure. DMs were more common in the HM II device (3.73 per 1000 patient-days versus 3.06 per 1000 patient-days for the HVAD, <i>P</i><0.01). A higher rate of pump-specific malfunctions was discovered in those implanted with an HM II versus an HVAD (0.55 versus 0.39, respectively; <i>P</i><0.01) and peripheral malfunctions (2.32 versus 1.78 for the HM II and HVAD, respectively; <i>P</i><0.01); no difference occurred in the incidence of controller DM between the 2 LVADs. Patients with HVAD were 90% free of a pump-specific malfunction at 3 years compared with 56% for the HM II (log-rank <i>P</i><0.003). Only 74% of the patients with HM II were free of pump <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thrombosi</span></strong>s at 3 years compared with 90% of the patients with HVAD. Freedom from failure of the integrated driveline was 79% at 3 years for the HM II but 100% for the HVAD (log-rank <i>P</i><0.02).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Device malfunction is much broader than pump failure alone and occurs for different components at different rates based on the type of LVAD.</p></sec>

Neurological Injury and Cerebral Blood Flow in Single Ventricles Throughout Staged Surgical Reconstruction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Patients with a single ventricle experience a high rate of brain injury and adverse neurodevelopmental outcome; however, the incidence of brain abnormalities throughout surgical reconstruction and their relationship with cerebral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> flow, oxygen delivery, and carbon dioxide reactivity remain unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients with a single ventricle were studied with magnetic resonance imaging scans immediately prior to bidirectional Glenn (pre-BDG), before Fontan (BDG), and then 3 to 9 months after Fontan reconstruction.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>One hundred sixty-eight consecutive subjects recruited into the project underwent 235 scans: 63 pre-BDG (mean age, 4.8±1.7 months), 118 BDG (2.9±1.4 years), and 54 after Fontan (2.4±1.0 years). Nonacute ischemic white matter changes on T2-weighted imaging, focal tissue loss, and ventriculomegaly were all more commonly detected in BDG and Fontan compared with pre-BDG patients (<i>P</i><0.05). BDG patients had significantly higher cerebral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> flow than did Fontan patients. The odds of discovering brain injury with adjustment for surgical stage as well as ≥2 coexisting lesions within a patient decreased (63%–75% and 44%, respectively) with increasing amount of cerebral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> flow (<i>P</i><0.05). In general, there was no association of oxygen delivery (except for ventriculomegaly in the BDG group) or carbon dioxide reactivity with neurological injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Significant brain abnormalities are commonly present in patients with a single ventricle, and detection of these lesions increases as children progress through staged surgical reconstruction, with multiple coexisting lesions more common earlier than later. In addition, this study demonstrated that BDG patients had greater cerebral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> flow than did Fontan patients and that an inverse association exists of various indexes of cerebral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> flow with these brain lesions. However, CO<sub>2</sub> reactivity and oxygen delivery (with 1 exception) were not associated with brain lesion development.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Endothelial Microparticles From Acute Coronary Syndrome Patients Induce Premature Coronary Artery Endothelial Cell Aging and Thrombogenicity
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Microparticles (MPs) have emerged as a surrogate marker of endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular risk. This study examined the potential of MPs from senescent endothelial cells (ECs) or from patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) to promote premature EC aging and thrombogenicity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Primary porcine coronary ECs were isolated from the left circumflex coronary artery. MPs were prepared from ECs and venous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> from patients with ACS (n=30) and from healthy volunteers (n=4) by sequential centrifugation. The level of endothelial senescence was assessed as senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity using flow cytometry, oxidative stress using the redox-sensitive probe dihydroethidium, tissue factor activity using an enzymatic Tenase assay, the level of target protein expression by Western blot analysis, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platelet</span></strong> aggregation using an aggregometer, and shear stress using a cone-and-plate viscometer.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Senescence, as assessed by senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, was induced by the passaging of porcine coronary artery ECs from passage P1 to P4, and was associated with a progressive shedding of pro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coagul</span></strong>ant MPs. Exposure of P1 ECs to MPs shed from senescent P3 cells or circulating MPs from ACS patients induced increased senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, oxidative stress, early phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and Akt, and upregulation of p53, p21, and p16. Ex vivo, the prosenescent effect of circulating MPs from ACS patients was evidenced only under conditions of low shear stress. Depletion of endothelial-derived MPs from ACS patients reduced the induction of senescence. Prosenescent MPs promoted EC thrombogenicity through tissue factor upregulation, shedding of pro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coagul</span></strong>ant MPs, endothelial nitric oxide synthase downregulation, and reduced nitric oxide–mediated inhibition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">platelet</span></strong> aggregation. These MPs exhibited angiotensin-converting enzyme activity and upregulated AT1 receptors and angiotensin-converting enzyme in P1 ECs. Losartan, an AT1 receptor antagonist, and inhibitors of either mitogen-activated protein kinases or phosphoinositide 3-kinase prevented the MP-induced endothelial senescence.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These findings indicate that endothelial-derived MPs from ACS patients induce premature endothelial senescence under atheroprone low shear stress and thrombogenicity through angiotensin II–induced redox-sensitive activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt. They further suggest that targeting endothelial-derived MP shedding and their bioactivity may be a promising therapeutic strategy to limit the development of an endothelial dysfunction post-ACS.</p></sec>

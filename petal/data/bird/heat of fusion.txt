Heterogeneous to homogeneous melting transition visualized with ultrafast electron diffraction
<p>The ultrafast laser excitation of matters leads to nonequilibrium states with complex solid-liquid phase-transition dynamics. We used electron diffraction at mega–electron volt energies to visualize the ultrafast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>ing of gold on the atomic scale length. For energy densities approaching the irreversible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>ing regime, we first observed heterogeneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>ing on time scales of 100 to 1000 picoseconds, transitioning to homogeneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>ing that occurs catastrophically within 10 to 20 picoseconds at higher energy densities. We showed evidence for the heterogeneous coexistence of solid and liquid. We determined the ion and electron temperature evolution and found superheated conditions. Our results constrain the electron-ion coupling rate, determine the Debye temperature, and reveal the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>ing sensitivity to nucleation seeds.</p>

Melting of Iron at Earth’s Inner Core Boundary Based on Fast X-ray Diffraction
<sec><title>Hot Enough to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong> Iron</title><p>Earth's core is divided into a fluid outer core and a solid inner core, both composed predominately of iron at extremely high pressures and temperatures.

Melting of subducted basalt at the core-mantle boundary
<p>The geological materials in Earth's lowermost mantle control the characteristics and interpretation of seismic ultra–low velocity zones at the base of the core-mantle boundary. Partial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>ing of the bulk lower mantle is often advocated as the cause, but this does not explain the nonubiquitous character of these regional seismic features. We explored the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>ing properties of mid-oceanic ridge basalt (MORB), which can reach the lowermost mantle after subduction of oceanic crust. At a pressure representative of the core-mantle boundary (135 gigapascals), the onset of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>ing occurs at ~3800 kelvin, which is ~350 kelvin below the mantle solidus. The SiO<sub>2</sub>-rich liquid generated either remains trapped in the MORB material or solidifies after reacting with the surrounding MgO-rich mantle, remixing subducted MORB with the lowermost mantle.</p>

A liquid metal reaction environment for the room-temperature synthesis of atomically thin metal oxides
<p>Two-dimensional (2D) oxides have a wide variety of applications in electronics and other technologies. However, many oxides are not easy to synthesize as 2D materials through conventional methods. We used nontoxic eutectic gallium-based alloys as a reaction solvent and co-alloyed desired metals into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>. On the basis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thermodynam</span></strong>ic considerations, we predicted the composition of the self-limiting interfacial oxide. We isolated the surface oxide as a 2D layer, either on substrates or in suspension. This enabled us to produce extremely thin subnanometer layers of HfO<sub>2</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and Gd<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. The liquid metal–based reaction route can be used to create 2D materials that were previously inaccessible with preexisting methods. The work introduces room-temperature liquid metals as a reaction environment for the synthesis of oxide nanomaterials with low dimensionality.</p>

RNA polymerase motions during promoter melting
<p>All cellular RNA polymerases (RNAPs), from those of bacteria to those of man, possess a clamp that can open and close, and it has been assumed that the open RNAP separates promoter DNA strands and then closes to establish a tight grip on the DNA template. Here, we resolve successive motions of the initiating bacterial RNAP by studying real-time signatures of fluorescent reporters placed on RNAP and DNA in the presence of ligands locking the clamp in distinct conformations. We report evidence for an unexpected and obligatory step early in the initiation involving a transient clamp closure as a prerequisite for DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>ing. We also present a 2.6-angstrom crystal structure of a late-initiation intermediate harboring a rotationally unconstrained downstream DNA duplex within the open RNAP active site cleft. Our findings explain how RNAP thermal motions control the promoter search and drive DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>ing in the absence of external energy sources.</p>

Experimental constraints on the damp peridotite solidus and oceanic mantle potential temperature
<p>Decompression of hot mantle rock upwelling beneath oceanic spreading centers causes it to exceed the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>ing point (solidus), producing magmas that ascend to form basaltic crust ~6 to 7 kilometers thick. The oceanic upper mantle contains ~50 to 200 micrograms per gram of water (H<sub>2</sub>O) dissolved in nominally anhydrous minerals, which—relative to its low concentration—has a disproportionate effect on the solidus that has not been quantified experimentally. Here, we present results from an experimental determination of the peridotite solidus containing known amounts of dissolved hydrogen. Our data reveal that the H<sub>2</sub>O-undersaturated peridotite solidus is hotter than previously thought. Reconciling geophysical observations of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>ing regime beneath the East Pacific Rise with our experimental results requires that existing estimates for the oceanic upper mantle potential temperature be adjusted upward by about 60°C.</p>

Experimental measurement of binding energy, selectivity, and allostery using fluctuation theorems
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thermodynam</span></strong>ic bulk measurements of binding reactions rely on the validity of the law of mass action and the assumption of a dilute solution. Yet, important biological systems such as allosteric ligand-receptor binding, macromolecular crowding, or misfolded molecules may not follow these assumptions and may require a particular reaction model. Here we introduce a fluctuation theorem for ligand binding and an experimental approach using single-molecule force spectroscopy to determine binding energies, selectivity, and allostery of nucleic acids and peptides in a model-independent fashion. A similar approach could be used for proteins. This work extends the use of fluctuation theorems beyond unimolecular folding reactions, bridging the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thermodynam</span></strong>ics of small systems and the basic laws of chemical equilibrium.</p>

Seasonal accumulation of acetylated triacylglycerols by a freeze-tolerant insect
<p>Most animals store energy as long-chain triacylglycerols (lcTAGs). Trace amounts of acetylated triacylglycerols (acTAGs) have been reported in animals, but are not accumulated, likely because they have lower energy density than lcTAGs. Here we report that acTAGs comprise 36% of the neutral lipid pool of overwintering prepupae of the goldenrod gall fly, <i>Eurosta solidaginis</i>, while only 17% of the neutral lipid pool is made up of typical lcTAGs. These high concentrations of acTAGs, present only during winter, appear to be synthesized by <i>E. solidaginis</i> and are not found in other freeze-tolerant insects, nor in the plant host. The mixture of acTAGs found in <i>E. solidaginis</i> has a significantly lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>ing point than equivalent lcTAGs, and thus remains liquid at temperatures at which <i>E. solidaginis</i> is frozen in the field, and depresses the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>ing point of aqueous solutions in a manner unusual for neutral lipids. We note that accumulation of acTAGs coincides with preparation for overwintering and the seasonal acquisition of freeze tolerance. This is the first observation of accumulation of acTAGs by an animal, and the first evidence of dynamic interconversion between acTAGs and lcTAGs during development and in response to stress.</p>

Probing entanglement in a many-body–localized system
<p>An interacting quantum system that is subject to disorder may cease to thermalize owing to localization of its constituents, thereby marking the breakdown of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thermodynam</span></strong>ics. The key to understanding this phenomenon lies in the system’s entanglement, which is experimentally challenging to measure. We realize such a many-body–localized system in a disordered Bose-Hubbard chain and characterize its entanglement properties through particle fluctuations and correlations. We observe that the particles become localized, suppressing transport and preventing the thermalization of subsystems. Notably, we measure the development of nonlocal correlations, whose evolution is consistent with a logarithmic growth of entanglement entropy, the hallmark of many-body localization. Our work experimentally establishes many-body localization as a qualitatively distinct phenomenon from localization in noninteracting, disordered systems.</p>

Observation and stabilization of photonic Fock states in a hot radio-frequency resonator
<p>Detecting weak radio-frequency electromagnetic fields plays a crucial role in a wide range of fields, from radio astronomy to nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. In quantum optics, the ultimate limit of a weak field is a single photon. Detecting and manipulating single photons at megahertz frequencies presents a challenge because, even at cryogenic temperatures, thermal fluctuations are appreciable. Using a gigahertz superconducting qubit, we observed the quantization of a megahertz radio-frequency resonator, cooled it to the ground state, and stabilized Fock states. Releasing the resonator from our control, we observed its rethermalization with nanosecond resolution. Extending circuit quantum electrodynamics to the megahertz regime, we have enabled the exploration of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thermodynam</span></strong>ics at the quantum scale and allowed interfacing quantum circuits with megahertz systems such as spin systems or macroscopic mechanical oscillators.</p>

Interface and heterostructure design in polyelemental nanoparticles

Multielement nanoparticles can now be synthesized through a variety of routes, but how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thermodynam</span></strong>ic phases form in such structures and how specific interfaces between them can be designed and synthesized are still poorly understood. We explored how palladium-tin alloys form mixed-composition phases with metals with known but complex miscibilities. Nanoparticles with up to seven elements were synthesized, and many form triphase heterostructures consisting of either three-interface or two-interface architectures. Density functional theory calculations and experimental work were used to determine the balance between the surface and interfacial energies of the observed phases. From these observations, design rules have been established for making polyelemental systems with specific heterostructures, including tetraphase nanoparticles with as many as six junctions.</p>

Keyhole threshold and morphology in laser melting revealed by ultrahigh-speed x-ray imaging

Although expected from welding and inferred from postmortem cross sections of fusion zones, the direct visualization of the keyhole morphology and dynamics with high-energy x-rays shows that (i) keyholes are present across the range of power and scanning velocity used in laser powder bed fusion; (ii) there is a well-defined threshold from conduction mode to keyhole based on laser power density; and (iii) the transition follows the sequence of vaporization, depression of the liquid surface, instability, and then deep keyhole formation. These and other aspects provide a physical basis for three-dimensional printing in laser powder bed machines.</p>

Entropy-driven stability of chiral single-walled carbon nanotubes
<p>Single-walled carbon nanotubes are hollow cylinders that can grow centimeters long via carbon incorporation at the interface with a catalyst. They display semiconducting or metallic characteristics, depending on their helicity, which is determined during their growth. To support the quest for a selective synthesis, we develop a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thermodynam</span></strong>ic model that relates the tube-catalyst interfacial energies, temperature, and the resulting tube chirality. We show that nanotubes can grow chiral because of the configurational entropy of their nanometer-sized edge, thus explaining experimentally observed temperature evolutions of chiral distributions. Taking the chemical nature of the catalyst into account through interfacial energies, we derive structural maps and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase diagram</span></strong>s that will guide a rational choice of a catalyst and growth parameters toward a better selectivity.</p>

Flexo-photovoltaic effect
<p>It is highly desirable to discover photovoltaic mechanisms that enable enhanced efficiency of solar cells. Here we report that the bulk photovoltaic effect, which is free from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thermodynam</span></strong>ic Shockley-Queisser limit but usually manifested only in noncentrosymmetric (piezoelectric or ferroelectric) materials, can be realized in any semiconductor, including silicon, by mediation of flexoelectric effect. We used either an atomic force microscope or a micrometer-scale indentation system to introduce strain gradients, thus creating very large photovoltaic currents from centrosymmetric single crystals of strontium titanate, titanium dioxide, and silicon. This strain gradient–induced bulk photovoltaic effect, which we call the flexo-photovoltaic effect, functions in the absence of a p-n junction. This finding may extend present solar cell technologies by boosting the solar energy conversion efficiency from a wide pool of established semiconductors.</p>

A liquid-liquid transition in supercooled aqueous solution related to the HDA-LDA transition
<p>Simulations and theory suggest that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thermodynam</span></strong>ic anomalies of water may be related to a phase transition between two supercooled liquid states, but so far this phase transition has not been observed experimentally because of preemptive ice crystallization. We used calorimetry, infrared spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate a water-rich hydrazinium trifluoroacetate solution in which the local hydrogen bond structure surrounding a water molecule resembles that in neat water at elevated pressure, but which does not crystallize upon cooling. Instead, this solution underwent a sharp, reversible phase transition between two homogeneous liquid states. The hydrogen-bond structures of these two states are similar to those established for high- and low-density amorphous (HDA and LDA) water. Such structural similarity supports theories that predict a similar sharp transition in pure water under pressure if ice crystallization could be suppressed.</p>

A self-assembled nanoscale robotic arm controlled by electric fields
<p>The use of dynamic, self-assembled DNA nanostructures in the context of nanorobotics requires fast and reliable actuation mechanisms. We therefore created a 55-nanometer–by–55-nanometer DNA-based molecular platform with an integrated robotic arm of length 25 nanometers, which can be extended to more than 400 nanometers and actuated with externally applied electrical fields. Precise, computer-controlled switching of the arm between arbitrary positions on the platform can be achieved within milliseconds, as demonstrated with single-pair Forster resonance energy transfer experiments and fluorescence microscopy. The arm can be used for electrically driven transport of molecules or nanoparticles over tens of nanometers, which is useful for the control of photonic and plasmonic processes.

Maxima in the thermodynamic response and correlation functions of deeply supercooled water
<p>Femtosecond x-ray laser pulses were used to probe micrometer-sized water droplets that were cooled down to 227 kelvin in vacuum. Isothermal compressibility and correlation length were extracted from x-ray scattering at the low–momentum transfer region. The temperature dependence of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thermodynam</span></strong>ic response and correlation functions shows maxima at 229 kelvin for water and 233 kelvin for heavy water. In addition, we observed that the liquids undergo the fastest growth of tetrahedral structures at similar temperatures. These observations point to the existence of a Widom line, defined as the locus of maximum correlation length emanating from a critical point at positive pressures in the deeply supercooled regime. The difference in the maximum value of the isothermal compressibility between the two isotopes shows the importance of nuclear quantum effects.</p>

Catalytic molten metals for the direct conversion of methane to hydrogen and separable carbon
<p>Metals that are active catalysts for methane (Ni, Pt, Pd), when dissolved in inactive low–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>ing temperature metals (In, Ga, Sn, Pb), produce stable molten metal alloy catalysts for pyrolysis of methane into hydrogen and carbon.

A 27% Ni–73% Bi alloy achieved 95% methane conversion at 1065°C in a 1.1-meter bubble column and produced pure hydrogen without CO<sub>2</sub> or other by-products. Calculations show that the active metals in the molten alloys are atomically dispersed and negatively charged. There is a correlation between the amount of charge on the atoms and their catalytic activity.</p>

Highly efficient electrocaloric cooling with electrostatic actuation

A unified continental thickness from seismology and diamonds suggests a melt-defined plate
<p>Thick, rigid continents move over the weaker underlying mantle, although geophysical and geochemical constraints on the exact thickness and defining mechanism of the continental plates are widely discrepant. Xenoliths suggest a chemical continental lithosphere ~175 kilometers thick, whereas seismic tomography supports a much thicker root (>250 kilometers) and a gradual lithosphere-asthenosphere transition, consistent with a thermal definition. We modeled <i>SS</i> precursor waveforms from continental interiors and found a 7 to 9% velocity drop at depths of 130 to 190 kilometers. The discontinuity depth is well correlated with the origin depths of diamond-bearing xenoliths and corresponds to the transition from coarse to deformed xenoliths. At this depth, the xenolith-derived geotherm also intersects the carbonate-silicate solidus, suggesting that partial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong> defines the plate boundaries beneath the continental interior.</p>

Seismic evidence for partial melting at the root of major hot spot plumes
<p>Ultralow-velocity zones are localized regions of extreme material properties detected seismologically at the base of Earth's mantle. Their nature and role in mantle dynamics are poorly understood. We used shear waves diffracted at the core-mantle boundary to illuminate the root of the Iceland plume from different directions. Through waveform modeling, we detected a large ultralow-velocity zone and constrained its shape to be axisymmetric to a very good first order. We thus attribute it to partial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>ing of a locally thickened, denser- and hotter-than-average layer, reflecting dynamics and elevated temperatures within the plume root. Such structures are few and far apart, and they may be characteristic of the roots of some of the broad mantle plumes tomographically imaged within the large low-shear-velocity provinces in the lower mantle.</p>

Greater role for Atlantic inflows on sea-ice loss in the Eurasian Basin of the Arctic Ocean
<p>Arctic sea-ice loss is a leading indicator of climate change and can be attributed, in large part, to atmospheric forcing. Here, we show that recent ice reductions, weakening of the halocline, and shoaling of the intermediate-depth Atlantic Water layer in the eastern Eurasian Basin have increased winter ventilation in the ocean interior, making this region structurally similar to that of the western Eurasian Basin. The associated enhanced release of oceanic heat has reduced winter sea-ice formation at a rate now comparable to losses from atmospheric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thermodynam</span></strong>ic forcing, thus explaining the recent reduction in sea-ice cover in the eastern Eurasian Basin. This encroaching “atlantification” of the Eurasian Basin represents an essential step toward a new Arctic climate state, with a substantially greater role for Atlantic inflows.</p>

Cassini finds molecular hydrogen in the Enceladus plume: Evidence for hydrothermal processes

We used the Ion Neutral Mass Spectrometer onboard the Cassini spacecraft to detect molecular hydrogen in the plume. By using the instrument’s open-source mode, background processes of hydrogen production in the instrument were minimized and quantified, enabling the identification of a statistically significant signal of hydrogen native to Enceladus. We find that the most plausible source of this hydrogen is ongoing hydrothermal reactions of rock containing reduced minerals and organic materials.

Inflation-predictable behavior and co-eruption deformation at Axial Seamount
<p>Deformation of the ground surface at active volcanoes provides information about magma movements at depth. Improved seafloor deformation measurements between 2011 and 2015 documented a fourfold increase in magma supply and confirmed that Axial Seamount’s eruptive behavior is inflation-predictable, probably triggered by a critical level of magmatic pressure. A 2015 eruption was successfully forecast on the basis of this deformation pattern and marked the first time that deflation and tilt were captured in real time by a new seafloor cabled observatory, revealing the timing, location, and volume of eruption-related magma movements.

The transport characteristics in this regime are particularly intriguing, and a discrepancy between two- and three-dimensional transport coefficients has been observed. <bold>Bardon <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 722) studied the demagnetization dynamics of a three-dimensional Fermi gas. The gas was initially polarized along a single direction and was noninteracting. An applied magnetic field gradient then caused a spin spiral to form; as the gas relaxed from this state, the authors extracted the diffusion coefficient and observed the buildup of interactions between the atoms.</p></sec>

Biochemical and Structural Analysis of Substrate Specificity of a Phenylalanine Ammonia-Lyase
<p>Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) is the first enzyme of the general phenylpropanoid pathway catalyzing the nonoxidative elimination of ammonia from <sc>l</sc>-phenylalanine to give <i>trans</i>-cinnamate. In monocots, PAL also displays tyrosine ammonia lyase (TAL) activity, leading to the formation of <i>p</i>-coumaric acid. The catalytic mechanism and substrate specificity of a major PAL from sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>; SbPAL1), a strategic plant for bioenergy production, were deduced from crystal structures, molecular docking, site-directed mutagenesis, and kinetic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thermodynam</span></strong>ic analyses. This first crystal structure of a monocotyledonous PAL displayed a unique conformation in its flexible inner loop of the 4-methylidene-imidazole-5-one (MIO) domain compared with that of dicotyledonous plants. The side chain of histidine-123 in the MIO domain dictated the distance between the catalytic MIO prosthetic group created from <sup>189</sup>Ala-Ser-Gly<sup>191</sup> residues and the bound <sc>l</sc>-phenylalanine and <sc>l</sc>-tyrosine, conferring the deamination reaction through either the Friedel-Crafts or E<sub>2</sub> reaction mechanism. Several recombinant mutant SbPAL1 enzymes were generated via structure-guided mutagenesis, one of which, H123F-SbPAL1, has 6.2 times greater PAL activity without significant TAL activity. Additional PAL isozymes of sorghum were characterized and categorized into three groups. Taken together, this approach identified critical residues and explained substrate preferences among PAL isozymes in sorghum and other monocots, which can serve as the basis for the engineering of plants with enhanced biomass conversion properties, disease resistance, or nutritional quality.</p>

Structural and Biochemical Characterization of Cinnamoyl-CoA Reductases
<p>Cinnamoyl-coenzyme A reductase (CCR) catalyzes the reduction of hydroxycinnamoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) esters using NADPH to produce hydroxycinnamyl aldehyde precursors in lignin synthesis. The catalytic mechanism and substrate specificity of cinnamoyl-CoA reductases from sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>), a strategic plant for bioenergy production, were deduced from crystal structures, site-directed mutagenesis, and kinetic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thermodynam</span></strong>ic analyses. Although SbCCR1 displayed higher affinity for caffeoyl-CoA or <i>p</i>-coumaroyl-CoA than for feruloyl-CoA, the enzyme showed significantly higher activity for the latter substrate. Through molecular docking and comparisons between the crystal structures of the <i>Vitis vinifera</i> dihydroflavonol reductase and SbCCR1, residues threonine-154 and tyrosine-310 were pinpointed as being involved in binding CoA-conjugated phenylpropanoids. Threonine-154 of SbCCR1 and other CCRs likely confers strong substrate specificity for feruloyl-CoA over other cinnamoyl-CoA thioesters, and the T154Y mutation in SbCCR1 led to broader substrate specificity and faster turnover. Through data mining using our structural and biochemical information, four additional putative <i>CCR</i> genes were discovered from sorghum genomic data. One of these, SbCCR2, displayed greater activity toward <i>p</i>-coumaroyl-CoA than did SbCCR1, which could imply a role in the synthesis of defense-related lignin. Taken together, these findings provide knowledge about critical residues and substrate preference among CCRs and provide, to our knowledge, the first three-dimensional structure information for a CCR from a monocot species.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
A Comprehensive, High-Resolution Map of a Gene’s Fitness Landscape
<p>Mutations are central to evolution, providing the genetic variation upon which selection acts. A mutation’s effect on the suitability of a gene to perform a particular function (gene fitness) can be positive, negative, or neutral. Knowledge of the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of mutations is fundamental for understanding evolutionary dynamics, molecular-level genetic variation, complex genetic disease, the accumulation of deleterious mutations, and the molecular clock. We present comprehensive DFEs for point and codon mutants of the <i>Escherichia coli TEM-1</i> β-lactamase gene and missense mutations in the TEM-1 protein. These DFEs provide insight into the inherent benefits of the genetic code’s architecture, support for the hypothesis that mRNA stability dictates codon usage at the beginning of genes, an extensive framework for understanding protein mutational tolerance, and evidence that mutational effects on protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thermodynam</span></strong>ic stability shape the DFE. Contrary to prevailing expectations, we find that deleterious effects of mutation primarily arise from a decrease in specific protein activity and not cellular protein levels.</p>

The cost of muscle power production: muscle oxygen consumption per unit work increases at low temperatures in <i>Xenopus laevis</i>
<p>Metabolic energy (ATP) supply to muscle is essential to support activity and behaviour. It is expected, therefore, that there is strong selection to maximise muscle power output for a given rate of ATP use. However, the viscosity and stiffness of muscle increases with a decrease in temperature, which means that more ATP may be required to achieve a given work output. Here, we tested the hypothesis that ATP use increases at lower temperatures for a given power output in <i>Xenopus laevis.</i> To account for temperature variation at different time scales, we considered the interaction between acclimation for 4 weeks (to 15 or 25°C) and acute exposure to these temperatures. Cold-acclimated frogs had greater sprint speed at 15°C than warm-acclimated animals. However, acclimation temperature did not affect isolated gastrocnemius muscle biomechanics. Isolated muscle produced greater tetanus force, and faster isometric force generation and relaxation, and generated more work loop power at 25°C than at 15°C acute test temperature. Oxygen consumption of isolated muscle at rest did not change with test temperature, but oxygen consumption while muscle was performing work was significantly higher at 15°C than at 25°C, regardless of acclimation conditions. Muscle therefore consumed significantly more oxygen at 15°C for a given work output than at 25°C, and plastic responses did not modify this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thermodynam</span></strong>ic effect. The metabolic cost of muscle performance and activity therefore increased with a decrease in temperature. To maintain activity across a range of temperature, animals must increase ATP production or face an allocation trade-off at lower temperatures. Our data demonstrate the potential energetic benefits of warming up muscle before activity, which is seen in diverse groups of animals such as bees, which warm flight muscle before take-off, and humans performing warm ups before exercise.</p>

A dynamic cell adhesion surface regulates tissue architecture in growth plate cartilage
<p>The architecture and morphogenetic properties of tissues are founded in the tissue-specific regulation of cell behaviors. In endochondral bones, the growth plate cartilage promotes bone elongation via regulated chondrocyte maturation within an ordered, three-dimensional cell array. A key event in the process that generates this cell array is the transformation of disordered resting chondrocytes into clonal columns of discoid proliferative cells aligned with the primary growth vector. Previous analysis showed that column-forming chondrocytes display planar cell divisions, and the resulting daughter cells rearrange by ∼90° to align with the lengthening column. However, these previous studies provided limited information about the mechanisms underlying this dynamic process. Here we present new mechanistic insights generated by application of a novel time-lapse confocal microscopy method along with immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. We show that, during cell division, daughter chondrocytes establish a cell-cell adhesion surface enriched in cadherins and β-catenin. Rearrangement into columns occurs concomitant with expansion of this adhesion surface in a process more similar to cell spreading than to migration. Column formation requires cell-cell adhesion, as reducing cadherin binding via chelation of extracellular calcium inhibits chondrocyte rearrangement. Importantly, physical indicators of cell polarity, such as cell body alignment, are not prerequisites for oriented cell behavior. Our results support a model in which regulation of adhesive surface dynamics and cortical tension by extrinsic signaling modifies the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thermodynam</span></strong>ic landscape to promote organization of daughter cells in the context of the three-dimensional growth plate tissue.</p>

Spectrally resolved helium absorption from the extended atmosphere of a warm Neptune-mass exoplanet
<p>Stellar heating causes atmospheres of close-in exoplanets to expand and escape. These extended atmospheres are difficult to observe because their main spectral signature—neutral hydrogen at ultraviolet wavelengths—is strongly absorbed by interstellar medium. We report the detection of the near-infrared triplet of neutral helium in the transiting warm Neptune-mass exoplanet HAT-P-11b by using ground-based, high-resolution observations. The helium feature is repeatable over two independent transits, with an average absorption depth of 1.08 ± 0.05%. Interpreting absorption spectra with three-dimensional simulations of the planet’s upper atmosphere suggests that it extends beyond 5 planetary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radii</span></strong>, with a large-scale height and a helium mass loss rate of ≲3 × 10<sup>5</sup> grams per second. A net blue-shift of the absorption might be explained by high-altitude winds flowing at 3 kilometers per second from day to night-side.</p>

A 550,000-year record of East Asian monsoon rainfall from <sup>10</sup>Be in loess
<p>Cosmogenic <sup>10</sup>Be flux from the atmosphere is a proxy for rainfall. Using this proxy, we derived a 550,000-year-long record of East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) rainfall from Chinese loess. This record is forced at orbital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precess</span></strong>ion frequencies, with higher rainfall observed during Northern Hemisphere summer insolation maxima, although this response is damped during cold interstadials. The <sup>10</sup>Be monsoon rainfall proxy is also highly correlated with global ice-volume variations, which differs from Chinese cave δ<sup>18</sup>O, which is only weakly correlated. We argue that both EASM intensity and Chinese cave δ<sup>18</sup>O are not governed by high-northern-latitude insolation, as suggested by others, but rather by low-latitude interhemispheric insolation gradients, which may also strongly influence global ice volume via monsoon dynamics.</p>

Measurement of the fine-structure constant as a test of the Standard Model
<p>Measurements of the fine-structure constant α require methods from across subfields and are thus powerful tests of the consistency of theory and experiment in physics. Using the recoil frequency of cesium-133 atoms in a matter-wave interferometer, we recorded the most accurate measurement of the fine-structure constant to date: α = 1/137.035999046(27) at 2.0 × 10<sup>−10</sup> accuracy. Using multiphoton interactions (Bragg diffraction and Bloch oscillations), we demonstrate the largest phase (12 million radians) of any Ramsey-Bordé interferometer and control systematic effects at a level of 0.12 part per billion. Comparison with Penning trap measurements of the electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gyromagnet</span></strong>ic anomaly <i>g<sub>e</sub></i> − 2 via the Standard Model of particle physics is now limited by the uncertainty in <i>g<sub>e</sub></i> − 2; a 2.5σ tension rejects dark photons as the reason for the unexplained part of the muon’s magnetic moment at a 99% confidence level. Implications for dark-sector candidates and electron substructure may be a sign of physics beyond the Standard Model that warrants further investigation.</p>

The Rydberg constant and proton size from atomic hydrogen
<p>At the core of the “proton radius puzzle” is a four–standard deviation discrepancy between the proton root-mean-square charge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radii</span></strong> (<i>r</i><sub>p</sub>) determined from the regular hydrogen (H) and the muonic hydrogen (µp) atoms. Using a cryogenic beam of H atoms, we measured the 2S-4P transition frequency in H, yielding the values of the Rydberg constant <i>R</i><sub>∞</sub> = 10973731.568076(96) per meter<sup></sup>and <i>r</i><sub>p</sub> = 0.8335(95) femtometer. Our <i>r</i><sub>p</sub> value is 3.3 combined standard deviations smaller than the previous H world data, but in good agreement with the µp value. We motivate an asymmetric fit function, which eliminates line shifts from quantum interference of neighboring atomic resonances.</p>

Hydrogen positions in single nanocrystals revealed by electron diffraction
<p>The localization of hydrogen atoms is an essential part of crystal structure analysis, but it is difficult because of their small scattering power. We report the direct localization of hydrogen atoms in nanocrystalline materials, achieved using the recently developed approach of dynamical refinement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precess</span></strong>ion electron diffraction tomography data. We used this method to locate hydrogen atoms in both an organic (paracetamol) and an inorganic (framework cobalt aluminophosphate) material. The results demonstrate that the technique can reliably reveal fine structural details, including the positions of hydrogen atoms in single crystals with micro- to nanosized dimensions.</p>

Deterministic generation of a cluster state of entangled photons
<p>Photonic cluster states are a resource for quantum computation based solely on single-photon measurements. We use semiconductor quantum dots to deterministically generate long strings of polarization-entangled photons in a cluster state by periodic timed excitation of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precess</span></strong>ing matter qubit. In each period, an entangled photon is added to the cluster state formed by the matter qubit and the previously emitted photons. In our prototype device, the qubit is the confined dark exciton, and it produces strings of hundreds of photons in which the entanglement persists over five sequential photons. The measured process map characterizing the device has a fidelity of 0.81 with that of an ideal device. Further feasible improvements of this device may reduce the resources needed for optical quantum information processing.</p>

The effectiveness of anterior cervical decompression and fusion for the relief of dizziness in patients with cervical spondylosis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Cervical spondylosis is often accompanied by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dizzi</span></strong>ness. It has   recently been shown that the ingrowth of Ruffini corpuscles into   diseased cervical discs may be related to cervicogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dizzi</span></strong>ness.   In order to evaluate whether cervicogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dizzi</span></strong>ness stems from the   diseased cervical disc, we performed a prospective cohort study   to assess the effectiveness of anterior cervical discectomy and   fusion on the relief of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dizzi</span></strong>ness.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Of 145 patients with cervical spondylosis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dizzi</span></strong>ness, 116   underwent anterior cervical decompression and fusion and 29 underwent   conservative treatment. All were followed up for one year. The primary   outcomes were measures of the intensity and frequency of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dizzi</span></strong>ness.   Secondary outcomes were changes in the modified Japanese Orthopaedic   Association (mJOA) score and a visual analogue scale score for neck   pain.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were significantly lower scores for the intensity and frequency   of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dizzi</span></strong>ness in the surgical group compared with the conservative   group at different time points during the one-year follow-up period   (p = 0.001). There was a significant improvement in mJOA scores   in the surgical group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study indicates that anterior cervical surgery can relieve   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dizzi</span></strong>ness in patients with cervical spondylosis and that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dizzi</span></strong>ness   is an accompanying manifestation of cervical spondylosis.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:81–7.</p></sec>

A viral aphrodisiac in the cricket <i>Gryllus texensis</i>
<p>We identified the insect iridovirus IIV-6/CrIV as a pathogen of the cricket <i>Gryllus texensis</i> using electron microscopy (EM) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. EM showed that the virus attacks the fat body, an organ important for protein production, immune function and lipid storage. During infection the fat body hypertrophied, but egg production withered, leaving the lateral oviducts empty of eggs; the females were effectively sterile. EM of the testis of infected males suggests that the testis was not invaded by the virus, although sperm taken from the spermatophores of infected males showed little or no motility. Nevertheless, males and females continued to mate when infected. In fact, infected males were quicker to court females than uninfected controls. The virus benefits from the continued sexual behaviour of its host; transmission studies show that the virus can be spread through sexual contact. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sick</span></strong>ness behaviour, the adaptive reduction of feeding and sexual behaviour that is induced by an activated immune system, was absent in infected crickets. Total haemolymph protein was reduced, as was phenoloxidase activity, suggesting a reduction in immune protein production by the fat body. The evidence suggests that during IIV-6/CrIV infection, the immune signal(s) that induces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sick</span></strong>ness behaviour is absent. Curtailment of a host's <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sick</span></strong>ness behaviour may be necessary for any pathogen that is spread by host sexual behaviour.</p>

Linking immunity and sickness-induced sleep
<p>We are all familiar with the sleepiness experienced during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sick</span></strong>ness. What is less often appreciated is that this increased need for sleep is caused by the release of signaling molecules by our own immune and nervous systems, and not by the infectious agents themselves (<i>1</i>). Indeed, for the spread of a virus or a bacterium, it would be much better if we were out and about when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sick</span></strong>, instead of sleeping. On page 509 of this issue, Toda <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) reveal another facet of the interplay between sleep and immunity by identifying NEMURI (NUR), an antimicrobial peptide (AMP) produced by the fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> that also has sleep-promoting properties. Because humans synthesize more than 100 different AMPs (<i>3</i>), this work could have implications for interactions between sleep and immunity during human disease.</p>

A sleep-inducing gene, <i>nemuri</i>, links sleep and immune function in <i>Drosophila</i>
<p>Sleep remains a major mystery of biology. In particular, little is known about the mechanisms that account for the drive to sleep. In an unbiased screen of more than 12,000 <i>Drosophila</i> lines, we identified a single gene, <i>nemuri</i>, that induces sleep. The NEMURI protein is an antimicrobial peptide that can be secreted ectopically to drive prolonged sleep (with resistance to arousal) and to promote survival after infection. Loss of <i>nemuri</i> increased arousability during daily sleep and attenuated the acute increase in sleep induced by sleep deprivation or bacterial infection. Conditions that increase sleep drive induced expression of <i>nemuri</i> in a small number of fly brain neurons and targeted it to the sleep-promoting, dorsal fan-shaped body. We propose that NEMURI is a bona fide sleep homeostasis factor that is particularly important under conditions of high sleep need; because these conditions include <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sick</span></strong>ness, our findings provide a link between sleep and immune function.</p>

Evolutionary shift toward protein-based architecture in trypanosomal mitochondrial ribosomes
<p>Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) plays key functional and architectural roles in ribosomes. Using electron microscopy, we determined the atomic structure of a highly divergent ribosome found in mitochondria of <i>Trypanosoma brucei</i>, a unicellular parasite that causes sleeping <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sick</span></strong>ness in humans. The trypanosomal mitoribosome features the smallest rRNAs and contains more proteins than all known ribosomes. The structure shows how the proteins have taken over the role of architectural scaffold from the rRNA: They form an autonomous outer shell that surrounds the entire particle and stabilizes and positions the functionally important regions of the rRNA. Our results also reveal the “minimal” set of conserved rRNA and protein components shared by all ribosomes that help us define the most essential functional elements.</p>

Predictive modeling of U.S. health care spending in late life
<p>That one-quarter of Medicare spending in the United States occurs in the last year of life is commonly interpreted as waste. But this interpretation presumes knowledge of who will die and when. Here we analyze how spending is distributed by predicted mortality, based on a machine-learning model of annual mortality risk built using Medicare claims. Death is highly unpredictable. Less than 5% of spending is accounted for by individuals with predicted mortality above 50%. The simple fact that we spend more on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sick</span></strong>—both on those who recover and those who die—accounts for 30 to 50% of the concentration of spending on the dead. Our results suggest that spending on the ex post dead does not necessarily mean that we spend on the ex ante “hopeless.”</p>

Reports of inner-ear damage deepen diplomat controversy
<p>The mystery illness first reported in late 2016 among U.S. diplomats in Havana is now affecting personnel at a U.S. consulate in Guangzhou, China. Yet 18 months in, an explanation is nowhere in sight, although hypotheses have proliferated. Former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson blamed a deliberate "health attack" for the Cuba ailments, whereas some neuroscientists and psychologists—and a panel of Cuban scientists—have written them off as the result of stress. Some unaffected diplomats from the Havana embassy agree. But a few researchers are finding hints of a physical cause for the symptoms, which include headaches, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dizzi</span></strong>ness, and insomnia. In the latest proposal, Michael Hoffer, an otolaryngologist at the University of Miami in Florida, and his colleagues describe a unique vestibular and cognitive disorder in two dozen people evacuated from the Havana embassy.</p>

Cuban panel claims stress caused mystery illnesses
<p>After a 9-month probe hampered by lack of access to medical records, a panel of Cuban scientists this week declared that U.S. diplomats here likely suffered a "collective psychogenic disorder" earlier this year, not the deliberate "health attack" that the U.S. Department of State has claimed. Based on media reports about the mysterious symptoms, including hearing loss, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nausea</span></strong>, vertigo, and memory lapses, some U.S. scientists had already reached similar conclusions. That a panel appointed by the Cuban government dismisses the U.S. claims may not be surprising, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation is still leading what State Department officials have described as a "vigorous" multiagency investigation. But the Cuban report summary, obtained by <i>Science</i>, reveals intriguing details. For instance, a high-frequency noise that some had identified as a possible "sonic weapon" may have been crickets chirping.</p>

Supply of promising T cell therapy is strained
<p>Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy, which is based on modified immune cells, has lured doctors, companies, and patients alike, but many are hitting a frustrating roadblock: generating enough of these CAR-T cells, which remain experimental, to meet surging demand. For patients, getting the most anticipated new treatments is never easy. Clinical trials are tightly controlled and not everyone is eligible. But for this personalized approach, the difficulties are multiplied. Unlike a drug, each batch is designed for a specific patient. Because production involves genetic engineering and working with live cells, it is mostly done by hand, by highly trained technicians. The situation today is fluid, with shortages cropping up in some places and easing in others. Doctors, meanwhile, are grappling with how best to distribute the therapy among very <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sick</span></strong> patients in clinical trials.</p>

Fears of Ebola resurgence quickly dispelled in Liberia
<p>On 23 April, an 11-year-old girl arrived at the F. J. Grant Memorial Hospital in Greenville, Liberia. She was suffering from headache, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vomit</span></strong>ing, and diarrhea, and appeared mentally confused. An hour later she was dead. She was the first of dozens of patients who turned up at the hospital over the next days. All of them had attended a funeral and fears quickly spread that Ebola had returned to Liberia. But samples were rapidly tested and Ebola ruled out. In fact, the disease, which has <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sick</span></strong>ened 30 people and killed 13, appears to be meningitis caused by <i>Neisseria meninigitidis</i>. The samples of four patients tested at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were positive for the bacterium.</p>

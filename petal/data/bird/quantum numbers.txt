Effect of source/sink ratios on yield components, growth dynamics and structural characteristics of oil palm (<i>Elaeis guineensis</i>) bunches
<p>Source/sink ratios are known to be one of the main determinants of oil palm growth and development. A long-term experiment (9 years) was conducted in Indonesia on mature oil palms subjected to continuous bunch ablation and partial defoliation treatments to artificially modify source/sink ratios. During the experiment, all harvested bunches were dissected and phenological measurements were carried out to analyse the effect of source/sink ratios on yield components explaining variations in bunch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong>, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> of fruits per bunch and oil dry weight per fruit. An integrative variable (supply/demand ratio) describing the ratio between the assimilate supply from sources and the growing organ demand for carbohydrate was computed for each plant on a daily basis from observations of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> of developing organs and their sink strength, and of climate variables. Defoliation and bunch ablation affected the bunch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> and the fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> per bunch. Variations in bunch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> per month were mainly due to variations in the fraction of aborted inflorescence and in the ratio between female and male inflorescences. Under fluctuating trophic conditions, variations in fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> per bunch resulted both from changes in fruit-set and in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> of branches (rachillae) per inflorescence. For defoliated plants, the decrease in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> of developing reproductive sinks appeared to be sufficient to maintain fruit weight and oil concentration at the control level, without any major decrease in the concentration of non-structural carbohydrate reserves. Computation of the supply/demand ratio revealed that each yield component had a specific phase of sensitivity to supply/demand ratios during inflorescence development. Establishing quantitative relationships between supply/demand ratios, competition and yield components is the first step towards a functional model for oil palm.</p>

Femtosecond electron-phonon lock-in by photoemission and x-ray free-electron laser
<p>The interactions that lead to the emergence of superconductivity in iron-based materials remain a subject of debate. It has been suggested that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> correlations enhance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-phonon coupling in iron selenide (FeSe) and related pnictides, but direct experimental verification has been lacking. Here we show that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-phonon coupling strength in FeSe can be quantified by combining two time-domain experiments into a “coherent lock-in” measurement in the terahertz regime. X-ray diffraction tracks the light-induced femtosecond coherent lattice motion at a single phonon frequency, and photoemission monitors the subsequent coherent changes in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic band structure. Comparison with theory reveals a strong enhancement of the coupling strength in FeSe owing to correlation effects. Given that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-phonon coupling affects superconductivity exponentially, this enhancement highlights the importance of the cooperative interplay between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-phonon interactions.</p>

Full momentum- and energy-resolved spectral function of a 2D electronic system
<p>The single-particle spectral function measures the density of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic states in a material as a function of both momentum and energy, providing central insights into strongly correlated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> phenomena.

Using the technique on a prototypical 2D system, a GaAs quantum well, we uncover signatures of many-body effects involving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-phonon interactions, plasmons, polarons, and a phonon analog of the vacuum Rabi splitting in atomic systems.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Seasonal Regulation of Petal Number
<p>Four petals characterize the flowers of most species in the Brassicaceae family, and this phenotype is generally robust to genetic and environmental variation. A variable petal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> distinguishes the flowers of <i>Cardamine hirsuta</i> from those of its close relative Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), and allelic variation at many loci contribute to this trait. However, it is less clear whether <i>C. hirsuta</i> petal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> varies in response to seasonal changes in environment. To address this question, we assessed whether petal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> responds to a suite of environmental and endogenous cues that regulate flowering time in <i>C. hirsuta</i>. We found that petal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> showed seasonal variation in <i>C. hirsuta</i>, such that spring flowering plants developed more petals than those flowering in summer. Conditions associated with spring flowering, including cool ambient temperature, short photoperiod, and vernalization, all increased petal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> in <i>C. hirsuta</i>. Cool temperature caused the strongest increase in petal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> and lengthened the time interval over which floral meristems matured. We performed live imaging of early flower development and showed that floral buds developed more slowly at 15°C versus 20°C. This extended phase of floral meristem formation, coupled with slower growth of sepals at 15°C, produced larger intersepal regions with more space available for petal initiation. In summary, the growth and maturation of floral buds is associated with variable petal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> in <i>C. hirsuta</i> and responds to seasonal changes in ambient temperature.</p>

Electron-scale dynamics of the diffusion region during symmetric magnetic reconnection in space
<p>Magnetic reconnection is an energy conversion process that occurs in many astrophysical contexts including Earth’s magnetosphere, where the process can be investigated in situ by spacecraft. On 11 July 2017, the four Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft encountered a reconnection site in Earth’s magnetotail, where reconnection involves symmetric inflow conditions. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-scale plasma measurements revealed (i) super-Alfvénic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> jets reaching 15,000 kilometers per second; (ii) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> meandering motion and acceleration by the electric field, producing multiple crescent-shaped structures in the velocity distributions; and (iii) the spatial dimensions of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> diffusion region with an aspect ratio of 0.1 to 0.2, consistent with fast reconnection. The well-structured multiple layers of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> populations indicate that the dominant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> dynamics are mostly laminar, despite the presence of turbulence near the reconnection site.</p>

Imaging of nonlocal hot-electron energy dissipation via shot noise
<p>In modern micro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic devices, hot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>s accelerate, scatter, and dissipate energy in nanoscale dimensions. Despite recent progress in nanothermometry, direct real-space mapping of hot-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> energy dissipation is challenging because existing techniques are restricted to probing the lattice rather than the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>s. We realize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic nanothermometry by measuring local current fluctuations, or shot noise, associated with ultrafast hot-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> kinetic processes (~21 terahertz). Exploiting a scanning and contact-free tungsten tip as a local noise probe, we directly visualize hot-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> distributions before their thermal equilibration with the host gallium arsenide/aluminium gallium arsenide crystal lattice. With nanoconstriction devices, we reveal unexpected nonlocal energy dissipation at room temperature, which is reminiscent of ballistic transport of low-temperature quantum conductors.</p>

Tuning quantum nonlocal effects in graphene plasmonics
<p>The response of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> systems to electrodynamic fields that change rapidly in space is endowed by unique features, including an exquisite spatial nonlocality. This can reveal much about the materials’ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic structure that is invisible in standard probes that use gradually varying fields. Here, we use graphene plasmons, propagating at extremely slow velocities close to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> Fermi velocity, to probe the nonlocal response of the graphene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> liquid. The near-field imaging experiments reveal a parameter-free match with the full quantum description of the massless Dirac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> gas, which involves three types of nonlocal quantum effects: single-particle velocity matching, interaction-enhanced Fermi velocity, and interaction-reduced compressibility. Our experimental approach can determine the full spatiotemporal response of an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> system.</p>

Ballistic miniband conduction in a graphene superlattice
<p>Rational design of long-period artificial lattices yields effects unavailable in simple solids. The moiré pattern in highly aligned graphene/hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) heterostructures is a lateral superlattice with high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> mobility and an unusual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic dispersion whose miniband edges and saddle points can be reached by electrostatic gating. We investigated the dynamics of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>s in moiré minibands by measuring ballistic transport between adjacent local contacts in a magnetic field, known as the transverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> focusing effect. At low temperatures, we observed caustics of skipping orbits extending over hundreds of superlattice periods, reversals of the cyclotron revolution for successive minibands, and breakdown of cyclotron motion near van Hove singularities. At high temperatures, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> collisions suppress focusing. Probing such miniband conduction properties is a necessity for engineering novel transport behaviors in superlattice devices.</p>

The Impacts of Phosphorus Deficiency on the Photosynthetic Electron Transport Chain
<p>Phosphorus (P) is an essential macronutrient, and P deficiency limits plant productivity. Recent work showed that P deficiency affects <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport to photosystem I (PSI), but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here, we present a comprehensive biological model describing how P deficiency disrupts the photosynthetic machinery and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport chain through a series of sequential events in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>). P deficiency reduces the orthophosphate concentration in the chloroplast stroma to levels that inhibit ATP synthase activity. Consequently, protons accumulate in the thylakoids and cause lumen acidification, which inhibits linear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> flow. Limited plastoquinol oxidation retards <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport to the cytochrome <i>b<sub>6</sub>f</i> complex, yet the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transfer rate of PSI is increased under steady-state growth light and is limited under high-light conditions. Under P deficiency, the enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> flow through PSI increases the levels of NADPH, whereas ATP production remains restricted and, hence, reduces CO<sub>2</sub> fixation. In parallel, lumen acidification activates the energy-dependent quenching component of the nonphotochemical quenching mechanism and prevents the overexcitation of photosystem II and damage to the leaf tissue. Consequently, plants can be severely affected by P deficiency for weeks without displaying any visual leaf symptoms. All of the processes in the photosynthetic machinery influenced by P deficiency appear to be fully reversible and can be restored in less than 60 min after resupply of orthophosphate to the leaf tissue.</p>

Cholesterol Efflux Capacity, High-Density Lipoprotein Particle Number, and Incident Cardiovascular Events
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Recent failures of drugs that raised high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels to reduce cardiovascular events in clinical trials have led to increased interest in alternative indices of HDL quality, such as cholesterol efflux capacity, and HDL quantity, such as HDL particle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong>. However, no studies have directly compared these metrics in a contemporary population that includes potent statin therapy and low low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>HDL cholesterol levels, apolipoprotein A-I, cholesterol efflux capacity, and HDL particle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> were assessed at baseline and 12 months in a nested case-control study of the JUPITER trial (Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin), a randomized primary prevention trial that compared rosuvastatin treatment to placebo in individuals with normal low-density lipoprotein cholesterol but increased C-reactive protein levels. In total, 314 cases of incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) (myocardial infarction, unstable angina, arterial revascularization, stroke, or cardiovascular death) were compared to age- and gender-matched controls.

Signatures of exciton condensation in a transition metal dichalcogenide
<p>Bose condensation has shaped our understanding of macroscopic quantum phenomena, having been realized in superconductors, atomic gases, and liquid helium. Excitons are bosons that have been predicted to condense into either a superfluid or an insulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic crystal. Using the recently developed technique of momentum‐resolved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> energy‐loss spectroscopy (M-EELS), we studied <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic collective modes in the transition metal dichalcogenide semimetal 1<i>T</i>‐TiSe<sub>2</sub>. Near the phase-transition temperature (190 kelvin), the energy of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic mode fell to zero at nonzero momentum, indicating dynamical slowing of plasma fluctuations and crystallization of the valence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>s into an exciton condensate. Our study provides compelling evidence for exciton condensation in a three-dimensional solid and establishes M-EELS as a versatile technique sensitive to valence band excitations in quantum materials.</p>

Attosecond-resolved photoionization of chiral molecules
<p>Chiral light-matter interactions have been investigated for two centuries, leading to the discovery of many chiroptical processes used for discrimination of enantiomers. Whereas most chiroptical effects result from a response of bound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>s, photoionization can produce much stronger chiral signals that manifest as asymmetries in the angular distribution of the photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>s along the light-propagation axis.

The asymmetric temporal shape of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> wave packets emitted through an autoionizing state further reveals the chiral character of strongly correlated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic dynamics.</p>

Crystallization and vitrification of electrons in a glass-forming charge liquid
<p>Charge ordering (CO) is a phenomenon in which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>s in solids crystallize into a periodic pattern of charge-rich and charge-poor sites owing to strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> correlations. This usually results in long-range order. In geometrically frustrated systems, however, a glassy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic state without long-range CO has been observed. We found that a charge-ordered organic material with an isosceles triangular lattice shows charge dynamics associated with crystallization and vitrification of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>s, which can be understood in the context of an energy landscape arising from the degeneracy of various CO patterns. The dynamics suggest that the same nucleation and growth processes that characterize conventional glass-forming liquids guide the crystallization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>s. These similarities may provide insight into our understanding of the liquid-glass transition.</p>

Attosecond dynamics through a Fano resonance: Monitoring the birth of a photoelectron
<p>The dynamics of quantum systems are encoded in the amplitude and phase of wave packets. However, the rapidity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> dynamics on the attosecond scale has precluded the complete characterization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> wave packets in the time domain. Using spectrally resolved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> interferometry, we were able to measure the amplitude and phase of a photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> wave packet created through a Fano autoionizing resonance in helium. In our setup, replicas obtained by two-photon transitions interfere with reference wave packets that are formed through smooth continua, allowing the full temporal reconstruction, purely from experimental data, of the resonant wave packet released in the continuum. In turn, this resolves the buildup of the autoionizing resonance on an attosecond time scale. Our results, in excellent agreement with ab initio time-dependent calculations, raise prospects for detailed investigations of ultrafast photoemission dynamics governed by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> correlation, as well as coherent control over structured <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> wave packets.</p>

PGR5-Dependent Cyclic Electron Flow Protects Photosystem I under Fluctuating Light at Donor and Acceptor Sides
<p>In response to a sudden increase in light intensity, plants must cope with absorbed excess photon energy to protect photosystems from photodamage. Under fluctuating light, PSI is severely photodamaged in the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>proton gradient regulation5</i> (<i>pgr5</i>) mutant defective in the main pathway of PSI cyclic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport (CET). Here, we aimed to determine how PSI is protected by two proposed regulatory roles of CET via transthylakoid ΔpH formation: (1) reservation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> sink capacity by adjusting the ATP/NADPH production ratio (acceptor-side regulation) and (2) down-regulation of the cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub><i>f</i> complex activity called photosynthetic control for slowing down the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> flow toward PSI (donor-side regulation). We artificially enhanced donor- and acceptor-side regulation in the wild-type and <i>pgr5</i> backgrounds by introducing the <i>pgr1</i> mutation conferring the hypersensitivity of the cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub><i>f</i> complex to luminal acidification and moss <i>Physcomitrella patens</i> flavodiiron protein genes, respectively. Enhanced photosynthetic control partially alleviated PSI photodamage in the <i>pgr5</i> mutant background but restricted linear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport under constant high light, suggesting that the strength of photosynthetic control should be optimized. Flavodiiron protein-dependent oxygen photoreduction formed a large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> sink and alleviated PSI photoinhibition, accompanied by the induction of photosynthetic control. Thus, donor-side regulation is essential for PSI photoprotection but acceptor-side regulation also is important to rapidly induce donor-side regulation. In angiosperms, PGR5-dependent CET is required for both functions.</p>

In Silico Analysis of the Regulation of the Photosynthetic Electron Transport Chain in C3 Plants<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>We present a new simulation model of the reactions in the photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport chain of C3 species. We show that including recent insights about the regulation of the thylakoid proton motive force, ATP/NADPH balancing mechanisms (cyclic and noncyclic alternative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport), and regulation of Rubisco activity leads to emergent behaviors that may affect the operation and regulation of photosynthesis under different dynamic environmental conditions. The model was parameterized with experimental results in the literature, with a focus on Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). A dataset was constructed from multiple sources, including measurements of steady-state and dynamic gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, and absorbance spectroscopy under different light intensities and CO<sub>2</sub>, to test predictions of the model under different experimental conditions. Simulations suggested that there are strong interactions between cyclic and noncyclic alternative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport and that an excess capacity for alternative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport is required to ensure adequate redox state and lumen pH. Furthermore, the model predicted that, under specific conditions, reduction of ferredoxin by plastoquinol is possible after a rapid increase in light intensity. Further analysis also revealed that the relationship between ATP synthesis and proton motive force was highly regulated by the concentrations of ATP, ADP, and inorganic phosphate, and this facilitated an increase in nonphotochemical quenching and proton motive force under conditions where metabolism was limiting, such as low CO<sub>2</sub>, high light intensity, or combined high CO<sub>2</sub> and high light intensity. The model may be used as an in silico platform for future research on the regulation of photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport.</p>

Observation of parity-time symmetry breaking in a single-spin system
<p>Steering the evolution of single spin systems is crucial for quantum computing and quantum sensing. The dynamics of quantum systems has been theoretically investigated with parity-time–symmetric Hamiltonians exhibiting exotic properties. Although parity-time symmetry has been explored in classical systems, its observation in a single quantum system remains elusive. We developed a method to dilate a general parity-time–symmetric Hamiltonian into a Hermitian one. The quantum state evolutions ranging from regions of unbroken to broken [Formula] symmetry have been observed with a single nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. Owing to the universality of the dilation method, our result provides a route for further exploiting and understanding the exotic properties of parity-time symmetric Hamiltonian in quantum systems.</p>

Anti–parity-time symmetry in diffusive systems
<p>Various concepts related to parity-time symmetry, including anti–parity-time symmetry, have found broad applications in wave physics. Wave systems are fundamentally described by Hermitian operators, whereas their unusual properties are introduced by incorporation of gain and loss. We propose that the related physics need not be restricted to wave dynamics, and we consider systems described by diffusive dynamics. We study the heat transfer in two countermoving media and show that this system exhibits anti–parity-time symmetry. The spontaneous symmetry breaking results in a phase transition from motionless temperature profiles, despite the mechanical motion of the background, to moving temperature profiles. Our results extend the concepts of parity-time symmetry beyond wave physics and may offer opportunities to manipulate heat and mass transport.</p>

Identification of site-specific isotopic labels by vibrational spectroscopy in the electron microscope

Rapid change of superconductivity and electron-phonon coupling through critical doping in Bi-2212
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-boson coupling plays a key role in superconductivity for many systems. However, in copper-based high–critical temperature (<i>T</i><sub>c</sub>) superconductors, its relation to superconductivity remains controversial despite strong spectroscopic fingerprints. In this study, we used angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to find a pronounced correlation between the superconducting gap and the bosonic coupling strength near the Brillouin zone boundary in Bi<sub>2</sub>Sr<sub>2</sub>CaCu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8+δ</sub>. The bosonic coupling strength rapidly increases from the overdoped Fermi liquid regime to the optimally doped strange metal, concomitant with the quadrupled superconducting gap and the doubled gap-to-<i>T</i><sub>c</sub> ratio across the pseudogap boundary. This synchronized lattice and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic response suggests that the effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic interaction and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-phonon coupling (EPC) reinforce each other in a positive-feedback loop upon entering the strange-metal regime, which in turn drives a stronger superconductivity.</p>

Twistable electronics with dynamically rotatable heterostructures
<p>In heterostructures of two-dimensional materials, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic properties can vary dramatically with relative interlayer angle. This effect makes it theoretically possible to realize a new class of twistable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ics in which properties can be manipulated on demand by means of rotation. We demonstrate a device architecture in which a layered heterostructure can be dynamically twisted in situ. We study graphene encapsulated by boron nitride, where, at small rotation angles, the device characteristics are dominated by coupling to a long-wavelength moirééé superlattice. The ability to investigate arbitrary rotation angle in a single device reveals features of the optical, mechanical, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic response in this system not captured in static rotation studies.

Second Chern number of a quantum-simulated non-Abelian Yang monopole
<p>Topological order is often quantified in terms of Chern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong>s, each of which classifies a topological singularity. Here, inspired by concepts from high-energy physics, we use quantum simulation based on the spin degrees of freedom of atomic Bose-Einstein condensates to characterize a singularity present in five-dimensional non-Abelian gauge theories—a Yang monopole. We quantify the monopole in terms of Chern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong>s measured on enclosing manifolds: Whereas the well-known first Chern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> vanishes, the second Chern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> does not.

Bottom-up synthesis of multifunctional nanoporous graphene
<p>Nanosize pores can turn semimetallic graphene into a semiconductor and, from being impermeable, into the most efficient molecular-sieve membrane. However, scaling the pores down to the nanometer, while fulfilling the tight structural constraints imposed by applications, represents an enormous challenge for present top-down strategies. Here we report a bottom-up method to synthesize nanoporous graphene comprising an ordered array of pores separated by ribbons, which can be tuned down to the 1-nanometer range. The size, density, morphology, and chemical composition of the pores are defined with atomic precision by the design of the molecular precursors. Our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic characterization further reveals a highly anisotropic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic structure, where orthogonal one-dimensional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic bands with an energy gap of ∼1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> volt coexist with confined pore states, making the nanoporous graphene a highly versatile semiconductor for simultaneous sieving and electrical sensing of molecular species.</p>

Strong spin-photon coupling in silicon
<p>Long coherence times of single spins in silicon quantum dots make these systems highly attractive for quantum computation, but how to scale up spin qubit systems remains an open question. As a first step to address this issue, we demonstrate the strong coupling of a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> spin and a single microwave photon. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> spin is trapped in a silicon double quantum dot, and the microwave photon is stored in an on-chip high-impedance superconducting resonator. The electric field component of the cavity photon couples directly to the charge dipole of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> in the double dot, and indirectly to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> spin, through a strong local magnetic field gradient from a nearby micromagnet.

Atomic-resolution transmission electron microscopy of electron beam–sensitive crystalline materials

Enantioselective photochemistry through Lewis acid–catalyzed triplet energy transfer

We applied this strategy to asymmetric [2 + 2] photocycloadditions of 2′-hydroxychalcones, using tris(bipyridyl) ruthenium(II) as a sensitizer. A variety of electrochemical, computational, and spectroscopic data rule out substrate activation by means of photoinduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transfer and instead support a mechanism in which Lewis acid coordination dramatically lowers the triplet energy of the chalcone substrate.

Independent Regulation of Symbiotic Nodulation by the SUNN Negative and CRA2 Positive Systemic Pathways
<p>Plant systemic signaling pathways allow the integration and coordination of shoot and root organ metabolism and development at the whole-plant level depending on nutrient availability. In legumes, two systemic pathways have been reported in the <i>Medicago truncatula</i> model to regulate root nitrogen-fixing symbiotic nodulation. Both pathways involve leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases acting in shoots and proposed to perceive signaling peptides produced in roots depending on soil nutrient availability. In this study, we characterized in the <i>M. truncatula</i> Jemalong A17 genotype a mutant allelic series affecting the Compact Root Architecture2 (CRA2) receptor. These analyses revealed that this pathway acts systemically from shoots to positively regulate nodulation and is required for the activity of carboxyl-terminally encoded peptides (CEPs). In addition, we generated a double mutant to test genetic interactions of the CRA2 systemic pathway with the CLAVATA3/EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGION peptide (CLE)/Super Numeric Nodule (SUNN) receptor systemic pathway negatively regulating nodule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> from shoots, which revealed an intermediate nodule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> phenotype close to the wild type. Finally, we showed that the nitrate inhibition of nodule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong>s was observed in <i>cra2</i> mutants but not in <i>sunn</i> and <i>cra2 sunn</i> mutants. Overall, these results suggest that CEP/CRA2 and CLE/SUNN systemic pathways act independently from shoots to regulate nodule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong>s.</p>

Glycolate Induces Redox Tuning Of Photosystem II in Vivo: Study of a Photorespiration Mutant
<p>Bicarbonate removal from the nonheme iron at the acceptor side of photosystem II (PSII) was shown recently to shift the midpoint potential of the primary quinone acceptor Q<sub>A</sub> to a more positive potential and lowers the yield of singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) production. The presence of Q<sub>A</sub><sup>−</sup> results in weaker binding of bicarbonate, suggesting a redox-based regulatory and protective mechanism where loss of bicarbonate or exchange of bicarbonate by other small carboxylic acids may protect PSII against <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> in vivo under photorespiratory conditions. Here, we compared the properties of Q<sub>A</sub> in the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) photorespiration mutant deficient in peroxisomal HYDROXYPYRUVATE REDUCTASE1 (<i>hpr1-1</i>), which accumulates glycolate in leaves, with the wild type. Photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport was affected in the mutant, and chlorophyll fluorescence showed slower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport between Q<sub>A</sub> and Q<sub>B</sub> in the mutant. Glycolate induced an increase in the temperature maximum of thermoluminescence emission, indicating a shift of the midpoint potential of Q<sub>A</sub> to a more positive value. The yield of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> production was lowered in thylakoid membranes isolated from <i>hpr1-1</i> compared with the wild type, consistent with a higher potential of Q<sub>A</sub>/Q<sub>A</sub><sup>−</sup>. In addition, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> donation to photosystem I was affected in <i>hpr1-1</i> at higher light intensities, consistent with diminished <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transfer out of PSII. This study indicates that replacement of bicarbonate at the nonheme iron by a small carboxylate anion occurs in plants in vivo. These findings suggested that replacement of the bicarbonate on the nonheme iron by glycolate may represent a regulatory mechanism that protects PSII against photooxidative stress under low-CO<sub>2</sub> conditions.</p>

Ferredoxin:NADP(H) Oxidoreductase Abundance and Location Influences Redox Poise and Stress Tolerance
<p>In linear photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport, ferredoxin:NADP(H) oxidoreductase (FNR) transfers <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>s from ferredoxin (Fd) to NADP<sup>+</sup>. Both NADPH and reduced Fd (Fd<sup>red</sup>) are required for reductive assimilation and light/dark activation/deactivation of enzymes. FNR is therefore a hub, connecting photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport to chloroplast redox metabolism. A correlation between FNR content and tolerance to oxidative stress is well established, although the precise mechanism remains unclear. We investigated the impact of altered FNR content and localization on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport and superoxide radical evolution in isolated thylakoids, and probed resulting changes in redox homeostasis, expression of oxidative stress markers, and tolerance to high light in planta. Our data indicate that the ratio of Fd<sup>red</sup> to FNR is critical, with either too much or too little FNR potentially leading to increased superoxide production, and perception of oxidative stress at the level of gene transcription. In FNR overexpressing plants, which show more NADP(H) and glutathione pools, improved tolerance to high-light stress indicates that disturbance of chloroplast redox poise and increased free radical generation may help “prime” the plant and induce protective mechanisms. In <i>fnr1</i> knock-outs, the NADP(H) and glutathione pools are more oxidized relative to the wild type, and the photoprotective effect is absent despite perception of oxidative stress at the level of gene transcription.</p>

The NDH-1L-PSI Supercomplex Is Important for Efficient Cyclic Electron Transport in Cyanobacteria
<p>Two mutants isolated from a tagging library of <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. strain PCC 6803 were sensitive to high light and had a tag in <i>sll1471</i> encoding CpcG2, a linker protein for photosystem I (PSI)-specific antenna. Both mutants demonstrated strongly impaired NDH-1-dependent cyclic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport. Blue native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting and mass spectrometry analyses of the wild type and a mutant containing CpcG2 fused with yellow fluorescent protein-histidine6 indicated the presence of a novel NDH-1L-CpcG2-PSI supercomplex, which was absent in the <i>cpcG2</i> deletion mutant, the PSI-less mutant, and several other strains deficient in NDH-1L and/or NDH-1M. Coimmunoprecipitation and pull-down analyses on CpcG2-yellow fluorescent protein-histidine6, using antibody against green fluorescent protein and nickel column chromatography, confirmed the association of CpcG2 with the supercomplex. Conversely, the use of antibodies against NdhH or NdhK after blue native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and in coimmunoprecipitation experiments verified the necessity of CpcG2 in stabilizing the supercomplex. Furthermore, deletion of CpcG2 destabilized NDH-1L as well as its degradation product NDH-1M and significantly decreased the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> of functional PSI centers, consistent with the involvement of CpcG2 in NDH-1-dependent cyclic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport. The CpcG2 deletion, however, had no effect on respiration. Thus, we propose that the formation of an NDH-1L-CpcG2-PSI supercomplex in cyanobacteria facilitates PSI cyclic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport via NDH-1L.</p>

Evaluating the Impact and Cost-Effectiveness of Statin Use Guidelines for Primary Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease and Stroke

Sensitivity analyses varied costs, risks, and benefits. Main outcomes were incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong>s needed to treat for 10 years per quality-adjusted life-year gained.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Each approach produces substantial benefits and net cost savings relative to the status quo.

<sec><title>Background—</title><p>This study reports the impact of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) on hospitalizations in patients randomized to implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) or ICD-CRT in the Resynchronization-Defibrillation for Ambulatory Heart Failure Trial (RAFT).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Hospitalization rates and lengths of hospital stay were compared between the 2 groups. At the 18-month follow-up, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong>s of patients hospitalized for any cause were similar in the ICD (n=351, 38.8%) and ICD-CRT (n=331, 30.0%) groups. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> of patients hospitalized for heart failure was significantly lower in the ICD-CRT (n=101, 11.3%) compared with the ICD (n=141, 15.6%; <i>P</i>=0.003) group. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> of patients hospitalized for a device-related indication was similar in the ICD-CRT group (n=147, 16.4%) and ICD group (n=126, 13.9%; <i>P</i>=0.148). The total <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> of hospitalizations for any cause (n=1448 versus n=1553; <i>P</i>=0.042), any cardiovascular cause (n=667 versus n=790; <i>P</i>=0.017), and any heart failure cause (n=385 versus n=505; <i>P</i><0.0001) was significantly lower in ICD-CRT group compared with the ICD group, whereas the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> of hospitalizations for device-related causes was significantly higher in the ICD-CRT group compared with the ICD group (246 versus 159; <i>P</i><0.001). Although the reduction in hospitalizations for heart failure in the CRT-ICD group was offset by an increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> of hospitalizations for device-related indications, the length of hospital stay for any cause was significantly shorter in the ICD-CRT group (8.83±13.30 days) compared with the ICD group (9.59±14.40 days; <i>P</i>=0.005).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion—</title><p>ICD-CRT therapy significantly reduces hospitalizations and total days in hospital in patients with New York Heart Association class II/III heart failure compared with ICD therapy despite increased admissions for device-related indications.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration—</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

A parity-breaking electronic nematic phase transition in the spin-orbit coupled metal Cd<sub>2</sub>Re<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>
<p>Strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> interactions can drive metallic systems toward a variety of well-known symmetry-broken phases, but the instabilities of correlated metals with strong spin-orbit coupling have only recently begun to be explored. We uncovered a multipolar nematic phase of matter in the metallic pyrochlore Cd<sub>2</sub>Re<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> using spatially resolved second-harmonic optical anisotropy measurements. Like previously discovered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic nematic phases, this multipolar phase spontaneously breaks rotational symmetry while preserving translational invariance. However, it has the distinguishing property of being odd under spatial inversion, which is allowed only in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. By examining the critical behavior of the multipolar nematic order parameter, we show that it drives the thermal phase transition near 200 kelvin in Cd<sub>2</sub>Re<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> and induces a parity-breaking lattice distortion as a secondary order.</p>

Colloidally prepared La-doped BaSnO<sub>3</sub> electrodes for efficient, photostable perovskite solar cells
<p>Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) exceeding a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20% have mainly been demonstrated by using mesoporous titanium dioxide (mp-TiO<sub>2</sub>) as an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-transporting layer. However, TiO<sub>2</sub> can reduce the stability of PSCs under illumination (including ultraviolet light). Lanthanum (La)–doped BaSnO<sub>3</sub> (LBSO) perovskite would be an ideal replacement given its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> mobility and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic structure, but LBSO cannot be synthesized as well-dispersible fine particles or crystallized below 500°C. We report a superoxide colloidal solution route for preparing a LBSO electrode under very mild conditions (below 300°C). The PSCs fabricated with LBSO and methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI<sub>3</sub>) show a steady-state power conversion efficiency of 21.2%, versus 19.7% for a mp-TiO<sub>2</sub> device. The LBSO-based PSCs could retain 93% of their initial performance after 1000 hours of full-Sun illumination.</p>

Femtosecond x-ray spectroscopy of an electrocyclic ring-opening reaction
<p>The ultrafast light-activated electrocyclic ring-opening reaction of 1,3-cyclohexadiene is a fundamental prototype of photochemical pericyclic reactions. Generally, these reactions are thought to proceed through an intermediate excited-state minimum (the so-called pericyclic minimum), which leads to isomerization via nonadiabatic relaxation to the ground state of the photoproduct. Here, we used femtosecond (fs) soft x-ray spectroscopy near the carbon K-edge (~284 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> volts) on a table-top apparatus to directly reveal the valence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic structure of this transient intermediate state. The core-to-valence spectroscopic signature of the pericyclic minimum observed in the experiment was characterized, in combination with time-dependent density functional theory calculations, to reveal overlap and mixing of the frontier valence orbital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">energy level</span></strong>s. We show that this transient valence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic structure arises within 60 ± 20 fs after ultraviolet photoexcitation and decays with a time constant of 110 ± 60 fs.</p>

Extremely efficient internal exciton dissociation through edge states in layered 2D perovskites
<p>Understanding and controlling charge and energy flow in state-of-the-art semiconductor quantum wells has enabled high-efficiency opto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic devices. Two-dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites are solution-processed quantum wells wherein the band gap can be tuned by varying the perovskite-layer thickness, which modulates the effective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-hole confinement. We report that, counterintuitive to classical quantum-confined systems where photogenerated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>s and holes are strongly bound by Coulomb interactions or excitons, the photophysics of thin films made of Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites with a thickness exceeding two perovskite-crystal units (>1.3 nanometers) is dominated by lower-energy states associated with the local intrinsic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic structure of the edges of the perovskite layers. These states provide a direct pathway for dissociating excitons into longer-lived free carriers that substantially improve the performance of opto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic devices.</p>

Observation of the Wigner-Huntington transition to metallic hydrogen
<p>Producing metallic hydrogen has been a great challenge in condensed matter physics. Metallic hydrogen may be a room-temperature superconductor and metastable when the pressure is released and could have an important impact on energy and rocketry. We have studied solid molecular hydrogen under pressure at low temperatures. At a pressure of 495 gigapascals, hydrogen becomes metallic, with reflectivity as high as 0.91. We fit the reflectance using a Drude free-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> model to determine the plasma frequency of 32.5 ± 2.1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> volts at a temperature of 5.5 kelvin, with a corresponding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> carrier density of 7.7 ± 1.1 × 10<sup>23</sup> particles per cubic centimeter, which is consistent with theoretical estimates of the atomic density. The properties are those of an atomic metal. We have produced the Wigner-Huntington dissociative transition to atomic metallic hydrogen in the laboratory.</p>

Anomalously low electronic thermal conductivity in metallic vanadium dioxide
<p>In electrically conductive solids, the Wiedemann-Franz law requires the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic contribution to thermal conductivity to be proportional to electrical conductivity. Violations of the Wiedemann-Franz law are typically an indication of unconventional quasiparticle dynamics, such as inelastic scattering, or hydrodynamic collective motion of charge carriers, typically pronounced only at cryogenic temperatures. We report an order-of-magnitude breakdown of the Wiedemann-Franz law at high temperatures ranging from 240 to 340 kelvin in metallic vanadium dioxide in the vicinity of its metal-insulator transition. Different from previously established mechanisms, the unusually low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic thermal conductivity is a signature of the absence of quasiparticles in a strongly correlated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> fluid where heat and charge diffuse independently.</p>

Time-resolved x-ray absorption spectroscopy with a water window high-harmonic source
<p>Time-resolved x-ray absorption spectroscopy (TR-XAS) has so far practically been limited to large-scale facilities, to subpicosecond temporal resolution, and to the condensed phase. We report the realization of TR-XAS with a temporal resolution in the low femtosecond range by developing a tabletop high-harmonic source reaching up to 350 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> volts, thus partially covering the spectral region of 280 to 530 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> volts, where water is transmissive. We used this source to follow previously unexamined light-induced chemical reactions in the lowest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic states of isolated CF<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and SF<sub>6</sub><sup>+</sup> molecules in the gas phase. By probing element-specific core-to-valence transitions at the carbon K-edge or the sulfur L-edges, we characterized their reaction paths and observed the effect of symmetry breaking through the splitting of absorption bands and Rydberg-valence mixing induced by the geometry changes.</p>

Strong peak in <i>T</i><sub>c</sub> of Sr<sub>2</sub>RuO<sub>4</sub> under uniaxial pressure
<p>Sr<sub>2</sub>RuO<sub>4</sub> is an unconventional superconductor that has attracted widespread study because of its high purity and the possibility that its superconducting order parameter has odd parity. We study the dependence of its superconductivity on anisotropic strain. Applying uniaxial pressures of up to ~1 gigapascals along a 〈100〉 direction (<i>a</i> axis) of the crystal lattice results in the transition temperature (<i>T</i><sub>c</sub>) increasing from 1.5 kelvin in the unstrained material to 3.4 kelvin at compression by ≈0.6%, and then falling steeply. Calculations give evidence that the observed maximum <i>T</i><sub>c</sub> occurs at or near a Lifshitz transition when the Fermi level passes through a Van Hove singularity, and open the possibility that the highly strained, <i>T</i><sub>c</sub> = 3.4 K Sr<sub>2</sub>RuO<sub>4</sub> has an even-parity, rather than an odd-parity, order parameter.</p>

Strong coupling of a single electron in silicon to a microwave photon
<p>Silicon is vital to the computing industry because of the high quality of its native oxide and well-established doping technologies. Isotopic purification has enabled quantum coherence times on the order of seconds, thereby placing silicon at the forefront of efforts to create a solid-state quantum processor. We demonstrate strong coupling of a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> in a silicon double quantum dot to the photonic field of a microwave cavity, as shown by the observation of vacuum Rabi splitting. Strong coupling of a quantum dot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> to a cavity photon would allow for long-range qubit coupling and the long-range entanglement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>s in semiconductor quantum dots.</p>

Density functional theory is straying from the path toward the exact functional
<p>The theorems at the core of density functional theory (DFT) state that the energy of a many-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> system in its ground state is fully defined by its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> density distribution. This connection is made via the exact functional for the energy, which minimizes at the exact density. For years, DFT development focused on energies, implicitly assuming that functionals producing better energies become better approximations of the exact functional. We examined the other side of the coin: the energy-minimizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> densities for atomic species, as produced by 128 historical and modern DFT functionals. We found that these densities became closer to the exact ones, reflecting theoretical advances, until the early 2000s, when this trend was reversed by unconstrained functionals sacrificing physical rigor for the flexibility of empirical fitting.</p>

Observing the ultrafast buildup of a Fano resonance in the time domain
<p>Although the time-dependent buildup of asymmetric Fano line shapes in absorption spectra has been of great theoretical interest in the past decade, experimental verification of the predictions has been elusive. Here, we report the experimental observation of the emergence of a Fano resonance in the prototype system of helium by interrupting the autoionization process of a correlated two-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> excited state with a strong laser field. The tunable temporal gate between excitation and termination of the resonance allows us to follow the formation of a Fano line shape in time. The agreement with ab initio calculations validates our experimental time-gating technique for addressing an even broader range of topics, such as the emergence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> correlation, the onset of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-internuclear coupling, and quasi-particle formation.</p>

Buffer-gas cooling of antiprotonic helium to 1.5 to 1.7 K, and antiproton-to–electron mass ratio
<p>Charge, parity, and time reversal (CPT) symmetry implies that a particle and its antiparticle have the same mass. The antiproton-to-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> mass ratio [Formula] can be precisely determined from the single-photon transition frequencies of antiprotonic helium. We measured 13 such frequencies with laser spectroscopy to a fractional precision of 2.5 × 10<sup>−9</sup> to 16 × 10<sup>−9</sup>. About 2 × 10<sup>9</sup> antiprotonic helium atoms were cooled to temperatures between 1.5 and 1.7 kelvin by using buffer-gas cooling in cryogenic low-pressure helium gas; the narrow thermal distribution led to the observation of sharp spectral lines of small thermal Doppler width. The deviation between the experimental frequencies and the results of three-body quantum electrodynamics calculations was reduced by a factor of 1.4 to 10 compared with previous single-photon experiments. From this, [Formula] was determined as 1836.1526734(15), which agrees with a recent proton-to-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> experimental value within 8 × 10<sup>−10</sup>.</p>

Bifurcating electron-transfer pathways in DNA photolyases determine the repair quantum yield
<p>Photolyase is a blue-light–activated enzyme that repairs ultraviolet-induced DNA damage that occurs in the form of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and pyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4) photoproducts. Previous studies on microbial photolyases have revealed an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-tunneling pathway that is critical for the repair mechanism. In this study, we used femtosecond spectroscopy to deconvolute seven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-transfer reactions in 10 elementary steps in all classes of CPD photolyases. We report a unified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-transfer pathway through a conserved structural configuration that bifurcates to favor direct tunneling in prokaryotes and a two-step hopping mechanism in eukaryotes. Both bifurcation routes are operative, but their relative contributions, dictated by the reduction potentials of the flavin cofactor and the substrate, determine the overall quantum yield of repair.</p>

Simulated browsing affects leaf shedding phenology and litter quality of oak and birch saplings
<p>Herbivore effects on leaf litter can have a strong impact on ecosystem nutrient cycling. Although such effects are well described for insect herbivory, research on the impacts of browsing by mammalian herbivores on leaf litter dynamics and nutrient cycling has been more limited, particularly at the level of the individual plant. Clipping treatments (66% shoot removal twice, plus unclipped) were applied to analyse the effect of browsing on the phenology (start date and pattern of leaf shedding) and leaf litter quality (nitrogen (N), soluble sugars, starch and total non-structural carbohydrate concentrations, plus C : N ratios) of <i>Betula pubescens</i> Ehrh. and <i>Quercus petraea</i> [Matt.] Liebl. saplings. Clipping decreased leaf litter biomass and delayed leaf senescence and shedding, but did not change the phenological timing of litterfall between senescence and shedding. The quality of leaf litter of both species was increased by simulated browsing, through an increase in N and carbohydrate concentrations (mainly soluble sugars) and a decreased C : N ratio. This is the first evidence we are aware of that browsing may cause changes in leaf shedding phenology, delaying the process without altering its pattern. Our results also indicate that simulated browsing increases the quality of leaf litter. However, the potential positive effect of browsing on N cycling through litter quality may be offset by its negative impact on the amount of N shed per tree.</p>

ABC Transporter-Mediated Transport of Glutathione Conjugates Enhances Seed Yield and Quality in Chickpea
<p>The identification of functionally relevant molecular tags is vital for genomics-assisted crop improvement and enhancement of seed yield, quality, and productivity in chickpea (<i>Cicer arietinum</i>). The simultaneous improvement of yield/productivity as well as quality traits often requires pyramiding of multiple genes, which remains a major hurdle given various associated epistatic and pleotropic effects. Unfortunately, no single gene that can improve yield/productivity along with quality and other desirable agromorphological traits is known, hampering the genetic enhancement of chickpea. Using a combinatorial genomics-assisted breeding and functional genomics strategy, this study identified natural alleles and haplotypes of an <i>ABCC3</i>-type transporter gene that regulates seed weight, an important domestication trait, by transcriptional regulation and modulation of the transport of glutathione conjugates in seeds of <i>desi</i> and <i>kabuli</i> chickpea. The superior allele/haplotype of this gene introgressed in <i>desi</i> and <i>kabuli</i> near-isogenic lines enhances the seed weight, yield, productivity, and multiple desirable plant architecture and seed-quality traits without compromising agronomic performance. These salient findings can expedite crop improvement endeavors and the development of nutritionally enriched high-yielding cultivars in chickpea.</p>

Is gastrointestinal plasticity in king quail (<i>Coturnix chinensis</i>) elicited by diet-fibre or diet-energy dilution?
<p>Phenotypic plasticity of organ size allows some animals to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>e fluctuations of resource quality or availability. Here, we examined the phenotypic plasticity of the gastrointestinal tract of king quail (<i>Coturnix chinensis</i>) in a diet-fibre manipulation study. Quail were offered either a control low-fibre (high-quality) food (8.5% neutral-detergent fibre; NDF), or one of two experimental diets of higher fibre contents of 16% NDF (i.e. low-quality food). To examine whether phenotypic plasticity of organ size was associated with the fibre content per se, or as a consequence of diluting the diet energy contents by adding fibre, one of the high-fibre feeds was ‘balanced’ with additional energy to match that of the low-fibre control diet. Total empty dry mass of the gastrointestinal tract was significantly heavier among birds offered the unbalanced high-fibre diet as compared with those offered the control diet, with birds offered the fibrous but energy-balanced diet having guts of intermediate size. The heavier entire-gut mass (dry) of quail offered the unbalanced high-fibre diet was associated mainly with these birds having significantly heavier gizzards. Notably, the larger gizzard in the birds offered the unbalanced high-fibre diet was associated with marked increases in their metabolisability (digestion) of diet fibre. Our findings suggest that the available energy in the diet may be more important for eliciting phenotypic changes in the gut of these herbivorous birds rather than simple physical effects of diet fibre on feed intakes or on muscular compensation to fibrous ingesta.</p>

Major adverse cardiac events included death, myocardial infarction, and urgent revascularization. Costs were calculated on the basis of resource use and Medicare reimbursement rates. Changes in quality-adjusted life-years were assessed with utilities determined by the European Quality of Life–5 Dimensions health survey at baseline and over follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Major adverse cardiac events at 3 years were significantly lower in the PCI group compared with the MT group (10.1% versus 22.0%; <i>P</i><0.001), primarily as a result of a lower rate of urgent revascularization (4.3% versus 17.2%; <i>P</i><0.001). Death and myocardial infarction were numerically lower in the PCI group (8.3% versus 10.4%; <i>P</i>=0.28). Angina was significantly less severe in the PCI group at all follow-up points to 3 years. Mean initial costs were higher in the PCI group ($9944 versus $4440; <i>P</i><0.001) but by 3 years were similar between the 2 groups ($16 792 versus $16 737; <i>P</i>=0.94). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for PCI compared with MT was $17 300 per quality-adjusted life-year at 2 years and $1600 per quality-adjusted life-year at 3 years.

Study Comparing Vein Integrity and Clinical Outcomes in Open Vein Harvesting and 2 Types of Endoscopic Vein Harvesting for Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Current consensus statements maintain that endoscopic vein harvesting (EVH) should be standard care in coronary artery bypass graft surgery, but vein quality and clinical outcomes have been questioned. The VICO trial (Vein Integrity and Clinical Outcomes) was designed to assess the impact of different vein harvesting methods on vessel damage and whether this contributes to clinical outcomes after coronary artery bypass grafting.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In this single-center, randomized clinical trial, patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with an internal mammary artery and with 1 to 4 vein grafts were recruited. All veins were harvested by a single experienced practitioner. We randomly allocated 300 patients into closed tunnel CO<sub>2</sub> EVH (n=100), open tunnel CO<sub>2</sub> EVH (n=100), and traditional open vein harvesting (n=100) groups. The primary end point was endothelial integrity and muscular damage of the harvested vein. Secondary end points included clinical outcomes (major adverse cardiac events), use of healthcare resources, and impact on health status (quality-adjusted life-years).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The open vein harvesting group demonstrated marginally better endothelial integrity in random samples (85% versus 88% versus 93% for closed tunnel EVH, open tunnel EVH, and open vein harvesting; <i>P</i><0.001). Closed tunnel EVH displayed the lowest longitudinal hypertrophy (1% versus 13.5% versus 3%; <i>P</i>=0.001). However, no differences in endothelial stretching were observed between groups (37% versus 37% versus 31%; <i>P</i>=0.62). Secondary clinical outcomes demonstrated no significant differences in composite major adverse cardiac event scores at each time point up to 48 months. The quality-adjusted life-year gain per patient was 0.11 (<i>P</i><0.001) for closed tunnel EVH and 0.07 (<i>P</i>=0.003) for open tunnel EVH compared with open vein harvesting. The likelihood of being cost-effective, at a predefined threshold of £20 000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, was 75% for closed tunnel EVH, 19% for open tunnel EVH, and 6% for open vein harvesting.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our study demonstrates that harvesting techniques affect the integrity of different vein layers, albeit only slightly. Secondary outcomes suggest that histological findings do not directly contribute to major adverse cardiac event outcomes. Gains in health status were observed, and cost-effectiveness was better with closed tunnel EVH. High-level experience with endoscopic harvesting performed by a dedicated specialist practitioner gives optimal results comparable to those of open vein harvesting.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.isrctn.com</ext-link>.

Potential Cardiovascular and Total Mortality Benefits of Air Pollution Control in Urban China

Evaluating the Impact and Cost-Effectiveness of Statin Use Guidelines for Primary Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease and Stroke
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Statins are effective in the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guideline expands recommended statin use, but its cost-effectiveness has not been compared with other guidelines.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used the Cardiovascular Disease Policy Model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the ACC/AHA guideline relative to current use, Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines, and universal statin use in all men 45 to 74 years of age and women 55 to 74 years of age over a 10-year horizon from 2016 to 2025. Sensitivity analyses varied costs, risks, and benefits. Main outcomes were incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and numbers needed to treat for 10 years per quality-adjusted life-year gained.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Each approach produces substantial benefits and net cost savings relative to the status quo. Full adherence to the Adult Treatment Panel III guideline would result in 8.8 million more statin users than the status quo, at a number needed to treat for 10 years per quality-adjusted life-year gained of 35. The ACC/AHA guideline would potentially result in up to 12.3 million more statin users than the Adult Treatment Panel III guideline, with a marginal number needed to treat for 10 years per quality-adjusted life-year gained of 68. Moderate-intensity statin use in all men 45 to 74 years of age and women 55 to 74 years of age would result in 28.9 million more statin users than the ACC/AHA guideline, with a marginal number needed to treat for 10 years per quality-adjusted life-year gained of 108. In all cases, benefits would be greater in men than women. Results vary moderately with different risk thresholds for instituting statins and statin toxicity estimates but depend greatly on the disutility caused by daily medication use (pill burden).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>At a population level, the ACC/AHA guideline for expanded statin use for primary prevention is projected to treat more people, to save more lives, and to cost less compared with Adult Treatment Panel III in both men and women. Whether individuals benefit from long-term statin use for primary prevention depends more on the disutility associated with pill burden than their degree of cardiovascular risk.</p></sec>

Dimerization quality control via ubiquitylation
<p>Expanding the functional and structural repertoire of the proteome through protein dimerization is a fundamental concept in biology. Dimerization can occur in a homo- or heterotypic fashion with recurrent modular domains, such as BTB (BR-C, ttk, and bab) domains, leucine zippers, or coiled coils. Dimerization is a key factor in the regulation of enzymes, ion channels, receptors, and transcription factors. Indeed, proteomic studies indicate that a large fraction of mammalian proteins function only as dimers or multimers in cells (<i>1</i>). Thus, correct dimer formation is of fundamental importance for a healthy proteome and consequently for a healthy organism. However, whereas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">quality control</span></strong> systems for RNA, DNA, and the folding of nascent proteins are well-studied, whether and how correct composition of protein complexes is surveyed by cells has been unknown. On page 198 of this issue, Mena <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) describe a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">quality control</span></strong> pathway that detects and eliminates nonfunctional dimer complexes. A failing dimerization <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">quality control</span></strong> (DQC) pathway leads to the accumulation of aberrant dimers, which could contribute to the pathology of various diseases.</p>

Improving mechanical sensor performance through larger damping
<p>Mechanical resonances are used in a wide variety of devices, from smartphone accelerometers to computer clocks and from wireless filters to atomic force microscopes. Frequency stability, a critical performance metric, is generally assumed to be tantamount to resonance quality factor (the inverse of the linewidth and of the damping). We show that the frequency stability of resonant nanomechanical sensors can be improved by lowering the quality factor. At high bandwidths, quality-factor reduction is completely mitigated by increases in signal-to-noise ratio. At low bandwidths, notably, increased damping leads to better stability and sensor resolution, with improvement proportional to damping. We confirm the findings by demonstrating temperature resolution of 60 microkelvin at 300-hertz bandwidth. These results open the door to high-performance ultrasensitive resonators in gaseous or liquid environments, single-cell nanocalorimetry, nanoscale gas chromatography, atmospheric-pressure nanoscale mass spectrometry, and new approaches in crystal oscillator stability.</p>

New developments for protein quality control
<p>The cellular proteome is maintained by a dynamic balance between protein synthesis and degradation, known as proteostasis. An imperative of successful proteostasis is the detection and removal of misfolded proteins by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">quality control</span></strong> pathways. Proteins that result from translation errors, misfolding, or age-induced or chemical damage, as well as orphan proteins (which result from inappropriate stoichiometry of multiprotein complexes), are all subject to a variety of degradative pathways to limit their cellular accumulation, which can be toxic (<i>1</i>). One of the striking features of degradative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">quality control</span></strong> is the juxtaposition of high specificity for misfolded versions of normal proteins with the very broad range of substrates that can be accommodated by each pathway. On pages 472 and 471 of this issue, Yanagitani <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) and Nguyen <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>), respectively, show that a newly discovered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">quality control</span></strong> pathway is used to bring about the sweeping changes in proteome content that are observed in the differentiation of relatively “cellular” reticulocytes to the highly specialized hemoglobin-rich red blood cells (erythrocytes) (<i>4</i>, <i>5</i>).</p>

Eutrophication will increase during the 21st century as a result of precipitation changes
<p>Eutrophication, or excessive nutrient enrichment, threatens water resources across the globe. We show that climate change–induced precipitation changes alone will substantially increase (19 ± 14%) riverine total nitrogen loading within the continental United States by the end of the century for the “business-as-usual” scenario. The impacts, driven by projected increases in both total and extreme precipitation, will be especially strong for the Northeast and the corn belt of the United States. Offsetting this increase would require a 33 ± 24% reduction in nitrogen inputs, representing a massive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement challenge. Globally, changes in precipitation are especially likely to also exacerbate eutrophication in India, China, and Southeast Asia. It is therefore imperative that water quality <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement strategies account for the impact of projected future changes in precipitation on nitrogen loading.</p>

Editing of an Alpha-Kafirin Gene Family Increases, Digestibility and Protein Quality in Sorghum
<p>Kafirins are the major storage proteins in sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>) grains and form protein bodies with poor digestibility. Since kafirins are devoid of the essential amino acid lysine, they also impart poor protein quality to the kernel. The α-kafirins, which make up most of the total kafirins, are largely encoded by the <i>k1C</i> family of highly similar genes. We used a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) gene editing approach to target the <i>k1C</i> genes to create variants with reduced kafirin levels and improved protein quality and digestibility. A single guide RNA was designed to introduce mutations in a conserved region encoding the endoplasmic reticulum signal peptide of α-kafirins. Sequencing of kafirin PCR products revealed extensive edits in 25 of 26 events in one or multiple <i>k1C</i> family members. T1 and T2 seeds showed reduced α-kafirin levels, and selected T2 events showed significantly increased grain protein digestibility and lysine content. Thus, a single consensus single guide RNA carrying target sequence mismatches is sufficient for extensive editing of all <i>k1C</i> genes. The resulting quality improvements can be deployed rapidly for breeding and the generation of transgene-free, improved cultivars of sorghum, a major crop worldwide.</p>

An acquired distaste: sugar discrimination by the larval parasitoid <i>Microplitis croceipes</i> (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) is affected by prior sugar exposure
<p>We examined gustatory responses of the larval parasitoid <i>Microplitis croceipes</i> to determine whether the adults discriminate among common sugars, including fructose, glucose, maltose and sucrose, found in plants. When given single sugar solutions of sucrose, glucose, fructose and maltose at concentrations of 0.008–2.0 mol l<sup>−1</sup>, the estimated concentrations at which 50% of wasps initiated feeding ranged between 0.054 and 0.085 mol l<sup>−1</sup> for sucrose, glucose and fructose, which was significantly lower than for maltose. Wasps showed a strong decrease in feeding time for maltose or fructose following a brief exposure to other sugars, suggesting that wasps can distinguish maltose and fructose from the other sugars tested. The higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accept</span></strong>ance threshold and short feeding time in the case of maltose appears adaptive in light of the relatively poor nutritional quality of the sugar in the longevity trial. The pronounced feeding inhibition seen for fructose following exposure to other sugars is not linked with lower nutritional performance. This feeding inhibition was even seen in wasps that had fed on glucose at the lowest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accept</span></strong>ance threshold (0.031 mol l<sup>−1</sup>) and persisted for 24 h. This study is the first to show feeding inhibition of otherwise phagostimulant sugars such as maltose and fructose after gustatory stimulation on other sugars.</p>

Olfactory memories are intensity specific in larval <i>Drosophila</i>
<p>Learning can rely on stimulus quality, stimulus intensity, or a combination of these. Regarding olfaction, the coding of odour quality is often proposed to be combinatorial along the olfactory pathway, and working hypotheses are available concerning short-term associative memory trace formation of odour quality. However, it is less clear how odour intensity is coded, and whether olfactory memory traces include information about the intensity of the learnt odour. Using odour–sugar associative conditioning in larval <i>Drosophila</i>, we first describe the dose–effect curves of learnability across odour intensities for four different odours (<i>n</i>-amyl acetate, 3-octanol, 1-octen-3-ol and benzaldehyde). We then chose odour intensities such that larvae were trained at an intermediate odour intensity, but were tested for retention with either that trained intermediate odour intensity, or with respectively higher or lower intensities. We observed a specificity of retention for the trained intensity for all four odours used. This adds to the appreciation of the richness in ‘content’ of olfactory short-term memory traces, even in a system as simple as larval <i>Drosophila</i>, and to define the demands on computational models of associative olfactory memory trace formation. We suggest two kinds of circuit architecture that have the potential to accommodate intensity learning, and discuss how they may be implemented in the insect brain.</p>

The management of open tibial fractures in children
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Following the introduction of national standards in 2009, most   major paediatric trauma is now triaged to specialist units offering   combined orthopaedic and plastic surgical expertise. We investigated   the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement of open tibia fractures at a paediatric trauma centre,   primarily reporting the risk of infection and rate of union.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A retrospective review was performed on 61 children who between   2007 and 2015 presented with an open tibia fracture. Their mean   age was nine years (2 to 16) and the median follow-up was ten months   (interquartile range 5 to 18). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement involved IV antibiotics,   early debridement and combined treatment of the skeletal and soft-tissue injuries   in line with standards proposed by the British Orthopaedic Association.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were 36 diaphyseal fractures and 25 distal tibial fractures.   Of the distal fractures, eight involved the physis. Motor vehicle   collisions accounted for two thirds of the injuries and 38 patients   (62%) arrived outside of normal working hours. The initial method   of stabilisation comprised: casting in nine cases (15%); elastic   nailing in 19 (31%); Kirschner (K)-wiring in 13 (21%); intramedullary   nailing in one (2%); open reduction and plate fixation in four (7%); and   external fixation in 15 (25%). Wound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement comprised: primary   wound closure in 24 (39%), delayed primary closure in 11 (18%),   split skin graft (SSG) in eight (13%), local flap with SSG in 17   (28%) and a free flap in one. A total of 43 fractures (70%) were   Gustilo-Anderson grade III. There were four superficial (6.6%) and   three (4.9%) deep infections. Two deep infections occurred following   open reduction and plate fixation and the third after    K-wire fixation of a distal fracture. No patient who underwent primary   wound closure developed an infection. All the fractures united,   although nine patients required revision of a mono-lateral to circular   frame for delayed union (two) or for altered alignment or length   (seven). The mean time to union was two weeks longer in diaphyseal fractures   than in distal fractures (13 weeks <i>versus</i> 10.8   weeks, p<i> = </i>0.016). Children aged > 12 years had   a significantly longer time to union than those aged < 12 years   (16.3 weeks <i>versus</i> 11.4 weeks, p<i> = </i>0.045).   The length of stay in hospital for patients with a Gustilo-Anderson   grade IIIB fracture was twice as long as for less severe injuries. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Fractures in children heal better than those in adults. Based   on our experience of deep infection we discourage the use of internal   fixation with a plate for open tibial fractures in children. We   advocate aggressive initial wound debridement in theatre with early   definitive combined orthopaedic and plastic surgery in order to   obtain skeletal stabilisation and soft-tissue cover.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:544–53.</p></sec>

Can we predict which dysplastic hips will require acetabular augmentation during total hip arthroplasty based on pre-operative radiographs?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether an innovative   templating technique could predict the need for acetabular augmentation   during primary total hip arthroplasty for patients with dysplastic   hips.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We developed a simple templating technique to estimate acetabular   component coverage at total hip arthroplasty, the True Cup: False   Cup (TC:FC) ratio. We reviewed all patients with dysplastic hips   who underwent primary total hip arthroplasty between 2005 and 2012.   Traditional radiological methods of assessing the degree of acetabular dysplasia   (Sharp’s angle, Tönnis angle, centre-edge angle) as well as the   TC:FC ratio were measured from the pre-operative radiographs. A   comparison of augmented and non-augmented hips was undertaken to   determine any difference in pre-operative radiological indices between   the two cohorts. The intra- and inter-observer reliability for all   radiological indices used in the study were also calculated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of the 128 cases reviewed, 33 (26%) needed acetabular augmentation.   We found no difference in the median Sharp’s angle (p = 0.10), Tönnis   angle (p = 0.28), or centre-edge angle (p = 0.07) between the two   groups. A lower TC:FC ratio was observed in the augmented group   compared with the non-augmented group (median = 0.66 <i>versus</i> 0.88, p < 0.001).   Intra-observer reliability was found to be high for all radiological   indices analysed (interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) > 0.7).   However, inter-observer reliability was more variable and was only   high for the TC: FC ratio (ICC > 0.7).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The TC: FC ratio gives an accurate estimate of acetabular component   coverage. It can help predict which dysplastic hips are likely to   need acetabular augmentation at primary total hip arthroplasty.

Does osteofibrous dysplasia progress to adamantinoma and how should they be treated?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to identify any progression between   benign osteofibrous dysplasia (OFD), OFD-like adamantinoma and malignant   adamantinoma, and to investigate the rates of local recurrence,   metastases and survival, in order to develop treatment algorithms   for each.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A single institution retrospective review of all patients presenting   with OFD, OFD-like adamantinoma and adamantinoma between 1973 and   2012 was undertaken. Complete data were available for 73 patients   (42 with OFD; ten with an OFD-like adamantinoma and 21 with an adamantinoma).   The mean follow-up was 10.3 years (3 to 25) for OFD, 9.2 years (3.0   to 26.3) for OFD-like and 11.6 years (0.25 to 33) for adamantinoma.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean age at diagnosis for OFD was 13.5 years (1 to 49), 10.5   years (6 to 28) for OFD-like and 34 years (14 to 86) for adamantinoma.   A total of 24 of the 42 patients with OFD (57%) have not required   any treatment and have been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ed with observation. A total of   18 of the 42 patients with OFD underwent surgery, 13 with curettage   and five with resection. In all, three patients developed recurrence   following curettage (23%) but none following resection. All these   patients were cured with further limited surgery. A total of six   patients initially diagnosed with OFD were subsequently found to   have OFD-like adamantinoma. Of the ten patients initially diagnosed   with OFD-like adamantinoma, three (30%) were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ed with observation   alone and seven underwent surgery, two with curettage and five with   resection. Local recurrence arose in two patients, one each after   curettage and resection. No patients with either OFD or an OFD-like   adamantinoma developed metastases or had progression to adamantinoma.   All patients with an adamantinoma were treated by surgery, three   with curettage, six with amputation and 12 with excision. In all,   two of the three treated with curettage developed local recurrence, requiring   further surgery. Late development of both local recurrence and metastases   led to a ten year disease specific survival of 93% which had dropped   to 39% by 20 years.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We found no evidence of progression from OFD to adamantinoma.   Conservative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement with observation or curettage is often successful   for patients with OFD and OFD-like adamantinoma.

Proximal femoral resection without post-operative traction for the painful dislocated hip in young patients with cerebral palsy
<p>Proximal femoral resection (PFR) is a proven   pain-relieving procedure for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement of patients with severe cerebral   palsy and a painful displaced hip. Previous authors have recommended   post-operative traction or immobilisation to prevent a recurrence   of pain due to proximal migration of the femoral stump. We present   a series of 79 PFRs in 63 patients, age 14.7 years (10 to 26; 35   male, 28 female), none of whom had post-operative traction or immobilisation.</p><p>A total of 71 hips (89.6%) were reported to be pain free or to   have mild pain following surgery. Four children underwent further   resection for persistent pain; of these, three had successful resolution   of pain and one had no benefit. A total of 16 hips (20.2%) showed   radiographic evidence of heterotopic ossification, all of which   had formed within one year of surgery. Four patients had a wound   infection, one of which needed debridement; all recovered fully.   A total of 59 patients (94%) reported improvements in seating and   hygiene.</p><p>The results are as good as or better than the historical results   of using traction or immobilisation. We recommend that following   PFR, children can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ed without traction or immobilisation,   and can be discharged earlier and with fewer complications. However,   care should be taken with severely dystonic patients, in whom more   extensive femoral resection should be considered in combination   with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement of the increased tone.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014; 96-B:701–6.</p>

A new and reliable classification system for fractures of the navicular and associated injuries to the midfoot
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Fractures of the navicular can occur in isolation but, owing   to the intimate anatomical and biomechanical relationships, are   often associated with other injuries to the neighbouring bones and   joints in the foot. As a result, they can lead to long-term morbidity   and poor function. Our aim in this study was to identify patterns   of injury in a new classification system of traumatic fractures   of the navicular, with consideration being given to the commonly associated   injuries to the midfoot.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We undertook a retrospective review of 285 consecutive patients   presenting over an eight- year period with a fracture of the navicular.   Five common patterns of injury were identified and classified according   to the radiological features. Type 1 fractures are dorsal avulsion   injuries related to the capsule of the talonavicular joint. Type   2 fractures are isolated avulsion injuries to the tuberosity of   the navicular. Type 3 fractures are a variant of tarsometatarsal   fracture/dislocations creating instability of the medial ray. Type   4 fractures involve the body of the navicular with no associated   injury to the lateral column and type 5 fractures occur in conjunction   with disruption of the midtarsal joint with crushing of the medial   or lateral, or both, columns of the foot.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In order to test the reliability and reproducibility of this   new classification, a cohort of 30 patients with a fracture of the   navicular were classified by six independent assessors at two separate   times, six months apart. Interobserver reliability and intraobserver   reproducibility both had substantial agreement, with kappa values   of 0.80 and 0.72, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We propose a logical, all-inclusive, and mutually exclusive classification   system for fractures of the navicular that gives associated injuries   involving the lateral column due consideration. We have shown that   this system is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reliabl</span></strong>e and reproducible and have described the   rationale for the subsequent treatment of each type.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:176–82.</p></sec>

Fractures of the femoral shaft in children
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology of closed   isolated fractures of the femoral shaft in children, and to compare   the treatment and length of stay (LOS) between major trauma centres   (MTCs) and trauma units (TUs) in England.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>National data were obtained from the Trauma and Audit Research   Network for all isolated, closed fractures of the femoral shaft   in children from birth to 15 years of age, between 2012 and 2015.

Mortality and Cerebrovascular Events After Heart Rhythm Disorder Management Procedures
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Recognition of rates and causes of hard, patient-centered outcomes of death and cerebrovascular events (CVEs) after heart rhythm disorder <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement (HRDM) procedures is an essential step for the development of quality improvement programs in electrophysiology laboratories. Our primary aim was to assess and characterize death and CVEs (stroke or transient ischemic attack) after HRDM procedures over a 17-year period.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed a retrospective cohort study of all patients undergoing HRDM procedures between January 2000 and November 2016 at the Mayo Clinic. Patients from all 3 tertiary academic centers (Rochester, Phoenix, and Jacksonville) were included in the study. All in-hospital deaths and CVEs after HRDM procedures were identified and were further characterized as directly or indirectly related to the HRDM procedure. Subgroup analysis of death and CVE rates was performed for ablation, device implantation, electrophysiology study, lead extraction, and defibrillation threshold testing procedures.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 48 913 patients (age, 65.7±6.6 years; 64% male) who underwent a total of 62 065 HRDM procedures were included in the study. The overall mortality and CVE rates in the cohort were 0.36% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31–0.42) and 0.12% (95% CI, 0.09–0.16), respectively. Patients undergoing lead extraction had the highest overall mortality rate at 1.9% (95% CI, 1.34–2.61) and CVE rate at 0.62% (95% CI, 0.32–1.07). Among patients undergoing HRDM procedures, 48% of deaths directly related to the HDRM procedure were among patients undergoing device implantation procedures. Overall, cardiac tamponade was the most frequent direct cause of death (40%), and infection was the most common indirect cause of death (29%). The overall 30-day mortality rate was 0.76%, with the highest being in lead extraction procedures (3.08%), followed by device implantation procedures (0.94%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Half of the deaths directly related to an HRDM procedure were among the patients undergoing device implantation procedures, with cardiac tamponade being the most common cause of death. This highlights the importance of the development of protocols for the quick identification and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement of cardiac tamponade even in procedures typically believed to be lower risk such as device implantation.</p></sec>

Association Between Hospital Volume, Processes of Care, and Outcomes in Patients Admitted With Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Hospital volume is frequently used as a structural metric for assessing quality of care, but its utility in patients admitted with acute heart failure (HF) is not well characterized. Accordingly, we sought to determine the relationship between admission volume, process-of-care metrics, and short- and long-term outcomes in patients admitted with acute HF.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients enrolled in the Get With The Guidelines-HF registry with linked Medicare inpatient data at 342 hospitals were assessed. Volume was assessed both as a continuous variable, and quartiles based on the admitting hospital annual HF case volume, as well: 5 to 38 (quartile 1), 39 to 77 (quartile 2), 78 to 122 (quartile 3), 123 to 457 (quartile 4). The main outcome measures were (1) process measures at discharge (achievement of HF achievement, quality, reporting, and composite metrics); (2) 30-day mortality and hospital readmission; and (3) 6-month mortality and hospital readmission. Adjusted logistic and Cox proportional hazards models were used to study these associations with hospital volume.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 125 595 patients with HF were included. Patients admitted to high-volume hospitals had a higher burden of comorbidities. On multivariable modeling, lower-volume hospitals were significantly less likely to be adherent to HF process measures than higher-volume hospitals. Higher hospital volume was not associated with a difference in in-hospital (odds ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.94–1.05; <i>P</i>=0.78) or 30-day mortality (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.97–1.01; <i>P</i>=0.26), or 30-day readmissions (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.97–1.00; <i>P</i>=0.10). There was a weak association of higher volumes with lower 6-month mortality (hazard ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97–0.99; <i>P</i>=0.001) and lower 6-month all-cause readmissions (hazard ratio, 0.98; 95%, CI 0.97–1.00; <i>P</i>=0.025).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our analysis of a large contemporary prospective national quality improvement registry of older patients with HF indicates that hospital volume as a structural metric correlates with process measures, but not with 30-day outcomes, and only marginally with outcomes up to 6 months of follow-up. Hospital profiling should focus on participation in systems of care, adherence to process metrics, and risk-standardized outcomes rather than on hospital volume itself.</p></sec>

Prognostic Value of N-Terminal Pro-B-Type Natriuretic Peptide, Troponin-T, and Growth-Differentiation Factor 15 in Adult Congenital Heart Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The number of patients with adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) is rapidly increasing. To optimize patient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement, there is a great need to accurately identify high-risk patients. Still, no biomarker has been firmly established as a clinically useful prognostic tool in this group. We studied the association of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), high-sensitive troponin-T, and growth-differentiation factor 15 with cardiovascular events in ACHD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Clinically stable patients with ACHD who routinely visited the outpatient clinic between April 2011 and April 2013 underwent clinical assessment, electrocardiography, echocardiography, and biomarker measurement (NT-proBNP, high-sensitive troponin-T, and growth-differentiation factor 15) at the time of study inclusion. Patients were prospectively followed for the occurrence of cardiovascular events (death, heart failure, hospitalization, arrhythmia, thromboembolic events, and reintervention). Survival curves were derived by the Kaplan-Meier method, and Cox regression was performed to investigate the relation between biomarkers and events with adjustment for multiple clinical and echocardiographic variables.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In total, 595 patients were included (median age, 33 years; interquartile range, 25–41 years; 58% male; 90% New York Heart Association class I). Patients were followed during a median of 42 (interquartile range, 37–46) months. Of the 3 evaluated biomarkers, NT-proBNP in the upper quartile (>33.3 pmol/L) was most strongly associated with cardiovascular events (n=165, adjusted hazard ratio, 9.05 [3.24–25.3], <i>P</i><0.001) and with death or heart failure (n=50, adjusted hazard ratio, 16.0 [2.04–126], <i>P</i><0.001). When NT-proBNP was analyzed as a continuous variable, similar findings were retrieved. The cumulative proportion of patients with death and heart failure was only 1% in the lowest 2 NT-proBNP quartiles. Elevated NT-proBNP (>14 pmol/L), elevated high-sensitive troponin-T (>14 ng/L), and elevated growth-differentiation factor 15 (>1109 ng/L) identified those patients at highest risk of cardiovascular events (log-rank <i>P</i><0.0001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>NT-proBNP provides prognostic information beyond a conventional risk marker model in patients with ACHD and can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reliabl</span></strong>y exclude the risk of death and heart failure. Elevated levels of NT-proBNP, high-sensitive troponin-T, and growth-differentiation factor 15 identify patients at highest risk of cardiovascular events. These biomarkers therefore may play an important role in the monitoring and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement of patients with ACHD.</p></sec>

Variations in Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Care: A Report From the International Consortium of Vascular Registries
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>This project by the ICVR (International Consortium of Vascular Registries), a collaboration of 11 vascular surgical quality registries, was designed to evaluate international variation in the contemporary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with relation to recommended treatment guidelines from the Society for Vascular Surgery and the European Society for Vascular Surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Registry data for open and endovascular AAA repair (EVAR) during 2010 to 2013 were collected from 11 countries. Variations in patient selection and treatment were compared across countries and across centers within countries.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 51 153 patients, 86% were treated for intact AAA (iAAA) and 14% for ruptured AAA. Women constituted 18% of the entire cohort (range, 12% in Switzerland–21% in the United States; <i>P</i><0.01). Intact AAAs were repaired at diameters smaller than recommended by guidelines in 31% of men (<5.5 cm; range, 6% in Iceland–41% in Germany; <i>P</i><0.01) and 12% of women with iAAA (<5 cm; range, 0% in Iceland–16% in the United States; <i>P</i><0.01). Overall, use of EVAR for iAAA varied from 28% in Hungary to 79% in the United States (<i>P</i><0.01) and for ruptured AAA from 5% in Denmark to 52% in the United States (<i>P</i><0.01). In addition to the between-country variations, significant variations were present between centers in each country in terms of EVAR use and rate of small AAA repair. Countries that more frequently treated small AAAs tended to use EVAR more frequently (trend: correlation coefficient, 0.51; <i>P</i>=0.14). Octogenarians made up 23% of all patients, ranging from 12% in Hungary to 29% in Australia (<i>P</i><0.01). In countries with a fee-for-service reimbursement system (Australia, Germany, Switzerland, and the United States), the proportions of small AAA (33%) and octogenarians undergoing iAAA repair (25%) were higher compared with countries with a population-based reimbursement model (small AAA repair, 16%; octogenarians, 18%; <i>P</i><0.01). In general, center-level variation within countries in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement of AAA was as important as variation between countries.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Despite homogeneous guidelines from professional societies, significant variation exists in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement of AAA, most notably for iAAA diameter at repair, use of EVAR, and the treatment of elderly patients. ICVR provides an opportunity to study treatment variation across countries and to encourage optimal practice by sharing these results.</p></sec>

The Cost-Effectiveness of Antibiotic Prophylaxis for Patients at Risk of Infective Endocarditis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In March 2008, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommended stopping antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) for those at risk of infective endocarditis (IE) undergoing dental procedures in the United Kingdom, citing a lack of evidence of efficacy and cost-effectiveness. We have performed a new economic evaluation of AP on the basis of contemporary estimates of efficacy, adverse events, and resource implications.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A decision analytic cost-effectiveness model was used. Health service costs and benefits (measured as quality-adjusted life-years) were estimated. Rates of IE before and after the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance were available to estimate prophylactic efficacy. AP adverse event rates were derived from recent UK data, and resource implications were based on English Hospital Episode Statistics.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>AP was less costly and more effective than no AP for all patients at risk of IE. The results are sensitive to AP efficacy, but efficacy would have to be substantially lower for AP not to be cost-effective. AP was even more cost-effective in patients at high risk of IE. Only a marginal reduction in annual IE rates (1.44 cases in high-risk and 33 cases in all at-risk patients) would be required for AP to be considered cost-effective at £20 000 ($26 600) per quality-adjusted life-year. Annual cost savings of £5.5 to £8.2 million ($7.3–$10.9 million) and health gains >2600 quality-adjusted life-years could be achieved from reinstating AP in England.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>AP is cost-effective for preventing IE, particularly in those at high risk. These findings support the cost-effectiveness of guidelines recommending AP use in high-risk individuals.</p></sec>

Diagnosis and Treatment of Fetal Cardiac Disease
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>The goal of this statement is to review available literature and to put forth a scientific statement on the current practice of fetal cardiac medicine, including the diagnosis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement of fetal cardiovascular disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>A writing group appointed by the American Heart Association reviewed the available literature pertaining to topics relevant to fetal cardiac medicine, including the diagnosis of congenital heart disease and arrhythmias, assessment of cardiac function and the cardiovascular system, and available treatment options. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association classification of recommendations and level of evidence for practice guidelines were applied to the current practice of fetal cardiac medicine. Recommendations relating to the specifics of fetal diagnosis, including the timing of referral for study, indications for referral, and experience suggested for performance and interpretation of studies, are presented. The components of a fetal echocardiogram are described in detail, including descriptions of the assessment of cardiac anatomy, cardiac function, and rhythm. Complementary modalities for fetal cardiac assessment are reviewed, including the use of advanced ultrasound techniques, fetal magnetic resonance imaging, and fetal magnetocardiography and electrocardiography for rhythm assessment. Models for parental counseling and a discussion of parental stress and depression assessments are reviewed. Available fetal therapies, including medical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement for arrhythmias or heart failure and closed or open intervention for diseases affecting the cardiovascular system such as twin–twin transfusion syndrome, lung masses, and vascular tumors, are highlighted. Catheter-based intervention strategies to prevent the progression of disease in utero are also discussed. Recommendations for delivery planning strategies for fetuses with congenital heart disease including models based on classification of disease severity and delivery room treatment will be highlighted. Outcome assessment is reviewed to show the benefit of prenatal diagnosis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement as they affect outcome for babies with congenital heart disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Fetal cardiac medicine has evolved considerably over the past 2 decades, predominantly in response to advances in imaging technology and innovations in therapies. The diagnosis of cardiac disease in the fetus is mostly made with ultrasound; however, new technologies, including 3- and 4-dimensional echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging, and fetal electrocardiography and magnetocardiography, are available. Medical and interventional treatments for select diseases and strategies for delivery room care enable stabilization of high-risk fetuses and contribute to improved outcomes. This statement highlights what is currently known and recommended on the basis of evidence and experience in the rapidly advancing and highly specialized field of fetal cardiac care.</p></sec>

The evolution of fracture clinic design
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Fracture clinics are often characterised by the referral of large   numbers of unselected patients with minor injuries not requiring   investigation or intervention, long waiting times and recurrent   unnecessary reviews. Our experience had been of an unsustainable   system and we implemented a ‘Trauma Triage Clinic’ (TTC) in order   to rationalise and regulate access to our fracture service. The   British Orthopaedic Association’s guidelines have required a prospective evaluation   of this change of practice, and we report our experience and results.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We review the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement of all 12 069 patients referred to our   service in the calendar year 2014, with a minimum of one year follow-up   during the calendar year 2015. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Following the successful introduction of the TTC, only 2836 patients   (23.5%) who would previously have been reviewed in the general fracture   clinic were brought back to such a clinic to be seen by a surgeon.   An additional 2366 patients (19.6%) were brought back to a sub-specialist   injury-specific clinic. Another 2776 patients (23%) with relatively   predictable injuries were reviewed by a nurse practitioner according   to an established protocol or specific consultant instructions.   A further 3222 patients (26.7%) were discharged from the service   without attending the clinic. No significant errors or omissions   occurred with the introduction of the TTC.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have found that our TTC allows large numbers of referrals   to be reviewed and triaged safely and effectively, to the benefit   and satisfaction of patients, consultants, trainees, staff and the   organisation.

Minimising aseptic loosening in extreme bone resections
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Following the resection of an extensive amount of bone in the   treatment of a tumour, the residual segment may be insufficient   to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accept</span></strong> a standard length intramedullary cemented stem. Short-stemmed   endoprostheses conceivably have an increased risk of aseptic loosening.   Extra-cortical plates have been added to minimise this risk by supplementing   fixation. The aim of this study was to investigate the survivorship   of short-stemmed endoprostheses and extra-cortical plates.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The study involved 37 patients who underwent limb salvage surgery   for a primary neoplasm of bone between 1998 and 2013. Endoprosthetic   replacement involved the proximal humerus in nine, the proximal   femur in nine, the distal femur in 13 and the proximal tibia in   six patients. There were 12 primary (32%) and 25 revision procedures (68%).   Implant survivorship was compared with matched controls. The amount   of bone that was resected was > 70% of its length and statistically   greater than the standard control group at each anatomical site.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean follow-up was seven years (one to 17). The mean length   of the stem was 33 mm (20 to 60) in the humerus and 79 mm (34 to   100) in the lower limb. Kaplan-Meier analysis of survival of the   implant according to anatomical site confirmed that there was no   statistically significant difference between the short-stemmed endoprostheses and   the standard stemmed controls at the proximal humeral (p = 0.84),   proximal femoral (p = 0.57), distal femoral (p = 0.21) and proximal   tibial (p = 0.61) sites.</p><p>In the short-stemmed group, no implants with extra-cortical plate   osseointegration suffered loosening at a mean of 8.5 years (range   2 to 16 years). Three of ten (30%) without osseointegration suffered   aseptic loosening at a mean of 7.7 years (range 2 to 11.5 years).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>When extensive resections of bone are required in the surgical   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement of tumours, and in revision cases, the addition of extra-cortical   plates to short medullary stems has shown non-inferiority to standard   length medullary stems and minimises aseptic failure.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1689–95.</p></sec>

High levels of disability and impairment   were reported in the immediate post-operative period with subsequently   a rapid initial improvement followed by more gradual improvement   for up to one year. The results highlight that the period associated   with the greatest physical recovery is in the first three months   and suggest that the endpoint of treatment outcomes is best measured   at one year post-surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Clinically meaningful improvements in outcomes can be expected   for 12 months, after which progress plateaus and reaches normal   values. This paper adopted a novel approach to meta-analyses in   that the research question was of a longitudinal nature, which required   a unique method of statistical analysis.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1665–76.</p></sec>

An evolution in the management of fractures of the ankle
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>There has been an evolution recently in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement of unstable   fractures of the ankle with a trend towards direct fixation of a   posterior malleolar fragment. Within these fractures, Haraguchi   type 2 fractures extend medially and often cannot be fixed using   a standard posterolateral approach. Our aim was to describe the   posteromedial approach to address these fractures and to assess   its efficacy and safety.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We performed a review of 15 patients with a Haraguchi type 2   posterior malleolar fracture which was fixed using a posteromedial   approach. Five patients underwent initial temporary spanning external   fixation. The outcome was assessed at a median follow-up of 29 months (interquartile   range (IQR) 17 to 36) using the Olerud and Molander score and radiographs were   assessed for the quality of the reduction.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The median Olerud and Molander score was 72 (IQR 70 to 75), representing   a good functional outcome. The reduction was anatomical in ten,   with a median step of 1.2 mm (IQR 0.9 to 1.85) in the remaining   five patients. One patient had parasthaesiae affecting the medial   forefoot, which resolved within three months.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We found that the posteromedial approach to the ankle for the   surgical treatment of Haraguchi type 2 posterior malleolar fractures   is a safe technique that enables good visualisation and reduction   of the individual fracture fragments with promising early outcomes.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1496–1501.</p></sec>

Cemented total hip arthroplasty following acetabular fracture
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To evaluate the outcomes of cemented total hip arthroplasty (THA)   following a fracture of the acetabulum, with evaluation of risk   factors and comparison with a patient group with no history of fracture. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between 1992 and 2016, 49 patients (33 male) with mean age of   57 years (25 to 87) underwent cemented THA at a mean of 6.5 years   (0.1 to 25) following acetabular fracture. A total of 38 had undergone   surgical fixation and 11 had been treated non-operatively; 13 patients   died at a mean of 10.2 years after THA (0.6 to 19). Patients were   assessed pre-operatively, at one year and at final follow-up (mean   9.1 years, 0.5 to 23) using the Oxford Hip Score (OHS). Implant   survivorship was assessed. An age and gender-matched cohort of THAs   performed for non-traumatic osteoarthritis (OA) or avascular necrosis   (AVN) (n = 98) were used to compare complications and patient-reported outcome   measures (PROMs).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean time from fracture to THA was significantly shorter   for patients with AVN    (2.2 years) or protrusio (2.2 years) than those with post-traumatic   OA (9.4 years) or infection (8.0 years) (p = 0.03). Nine contained   and four uncontained defects were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ed with autograft (n = 11),   bulk allograft (n = 1), or trabecular metal augment (n = 1). Initial   fracture <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement (open reduction and internal fixation or non-operative),   timing of THA    (>/< one year), and age (>/< 55 years) had no significant   effect on OHS or ten-year survival. Six THAs were revised at mean   of 12 years (5 to 23) with ten-year all-cause survival of 92% (95%   confidence interval 80.8 to 100). THA complication rates (all complications,   heterotopic ossification, leg length discrepancy > 10 mm) were significantly higher   following acetabular fracture compared with atraumatic OA/AVN and   OHSs were inferior: one-year OHS    (35.7 v<i>ersus</i> 40.2, p = 0.026); and final follow-up   OHS (33.6 v<i>ersus</i> 40.9, p = 0.008). </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion </title><p>Cemented THA is a reasonable option for the sequelae of acetabular   fracture. Higher complication rates and poorer PROMs, compared with   patients undergoing THA for atraumatic causes, reflects the complex   nature of these cases.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1399–1408.</p></sec>

Myxofibrosarcoma of the extremity and trunk
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Myxofibrosarcomas (MFSs) are malignant soft-tissue sarcomas characteristically   presenting as painless slowly growing masses in the extremities.   Locally infiltrative growth means that the risk of local recurrence   is high. We reviewed our experience to make recommendations about   resection strategies and the role of the multidisciplinary team   in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement of these tumours.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Patients with a primary or recurrent MFS who were treated surgically   in our unit between 1997 and 2012 were included in the study. Clinical   records and imaging were reviewed. A total of 50 patients with a   median age of 68.4 years (interquartile range 61.6 to 81.8) were   included. There were 35 men; 49 underwent surgery in our unit.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The lower limb was the most common site (32/50, 64%). The mean   size of the tumours was 8.95 cm (1.5 to 27.0); 26 (52%) were French   Fédération Nationale des Centres de Lutte Contre le Cancer grade   III. A total of 21 (43%) had positive margins after the initial   excision; 11 underwent further excision. Histology showed microscopic   spread of up to 29 mm beyond macroscopic tumour.

The use of ultra-low-dose CT scans for the evaluation of limb fractures
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To evaluate whether an ultra-low-dose CT protocol can diagnose   selected limb fractures as well as conventional CT (C-CT).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We prospectively studied 40 consecutive patients with a limb   fracture in whom a CT scan was indicated. These were scanned using   an ultra-low-dose CT Reduced Effective Dose Using Computed Tomography   In Orthopaedic Injury (REDUCTION) protocol. Studies from 16 selected   cases were compared with 16 C-CT scans matched for age, gender and   type of fracture. Studies were assessed for diagnosis and image   quality. Descriptive and reliability statistics were calculated.   The total effective radiation dose for each scanned site was compared.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean estimated effective dose (ED) for the REDUCTION protocol   was 0.03 milliSieverts (mSv) and 0.43 mSv (p < 0.005) for C-CT.   The sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value   (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the REDUCTION protocol   to detect fractures were 0.98, 0.89, 0.98 and 0.89 respectively   when two occult fractures were excluded. Inter- and intra-observer   reliability for diagnosis using the REDUCTION protocol (κ = 0.75, κ =   0.71) were similar to those of C-CT (κ = 0.85, κ = 0.82). Using   the REDUCTION protocol, 3D CT reconstructions were equivalent in   quality and diagnostic information to those generated by C-CT (κ =   0.87, κ = 0.94).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>With a near 14-fold reduction in estimated ED compared with C-CT,   the REDUCTION protocol reduces the amount of CT radiation substantially   without significant diagnostic decay. It produces images that appear   to be comparable with those of C-CT for evaluating fractures of   the limbs.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2016;98-B:1668-73.</p></sec>

A new morphological classification for greater tuberosity fractures of the proximal humerus
<p>In this study, we describe a morphological classification   for greater tuberosity fractures of the proximal humerus. We divided   these fractures into three types: avulsion, split and depression.   We retrospectively reviewed all shoulder radiographs showing isolated   greater tuberosity fractures in a Level I trauma centre between   July 2007 and July 2012. We identified 199 cases where records and   radiographs were reviewed and included 79 men and 120 women with   a mean age of 58 years (23 to 96). The morphological classification   was applied to the first 139 cases by three reviewers on two occasions   using the Kappa statistic and compared with the AO and Neer classifications.   The inter- and intra-observer reliability of the morphological classification   was 0.73 to 0.77 and 0.69 to 0.86, respectively. This was superior   to the Neer (0.31 to 0.35/0.54 to 0.63) and AO (0.30 to 0.32/0.59   to 0.65) classifications. The distribution of avulsion, split and   depression type fractures was 39%, 41%, and 20%, respectively. This   classification of greater tuberosity fractures is more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reliabl</span></strong>e   than the Neer or AO classifications. These distinct fracture morphologies   are likely to have implications in terms of pathophysiology and   surgical technique.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014;96-B:646–51.</p>

An analysis of the best method for evaluating anteversion of the acetabular component after total hip replacement on plain radiographs
<p>Several radiological methods of measuring anteversion   of the acetabular component after total hip replacement (THR) have   been described. These studies used different definitions and reference   planes to compare methods, allowing for misinterpretation of the   results. We compared the reliability and accuracy of five current   methods using plain radiographs (those of Lewinnek, Widmer, Liaw,   Pradhan, and Woo and Morrey) with CT measurements, using the same   definition and reference plane. We retrospectively studied the plain   radiographs and CT scans in 84 hips of 84 patients who underwent   primary THR. Intra- and inter-observer reliability were high for   the measurement of inclination and anteversion with all methods   on plain radiographs and CT scans. The measurements of inclination on   plain radiographs were similar to the measurements using CT (p =   0.043). The mean difference between CT measurements was 0.6° (-5.9°   to 6.8°).</p><p>Measurements using Widmer’s method were the most similar to those   using CT (p = 0.088), with a mean difference between CT measurements   of -0.9° (-10.4° to 9.1°), whereas the other four methods differed   significantly from those using CT (p < 0.001).</p><p>This study has shown that Widmer’s method is the best for evaluating   the anteversion of the acetabular component on plain radiographs.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014; 96-B:597–603.</p>

An interobserver reliability comparison between the Orthopaedic Trauma Association’s open fracture classification and the Gustilo and Anderson classification
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To evaluate interobserver reliability of the Orthopaedic Trauma   Association’s open fracture classification system (OTA-OFC).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Patients of any age with a first presentation of an open long   bone fracture were included. Standard radiographs, wound photographs,   and a short clinical description were given to eight orthopaedic   surgeons, who independently evaluated the injury using both the   Gustilo and Anderson (GA) and OTA-OFC classifications. The responses   were compared for variability using Cohen’s kappa.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The overall interobserver agreement was ĸ = 0.44 for the GA classification   and ĸ = 0.49 for OTA-OFC, which reflects moderate agreement (0.41   to 0.60) for both classifications.

The presence of Waddell signs depends on age and gender, not diagnosis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to determine if positive Waddell signs   were related to patients’ demographics or to perception of their   quality of life.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This prospective cross-sectional study included 479 adult patients   with back pain from a university spine centre. Each completed SF-12   and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) questionnaires and underwent   standard spinal examinations to elicit Waddell signs. The relationship   between Waddell signs and age, gender, ODI, Mental Component Score   (MCS), and Physical Component Score (PCS) scores was determined.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of the 479 patients, 128 (27%) had at least one positive Waddell   sign. There were significantly more women with two or more Waddell   signs than men. The proportion of patients with at least one positive   Waddell sign increased with age until 55 years, and then declined   rapidly; none had a positive sign over the age of 75 years. Functional outcome   scores were significantly worse in those with a single Waddell sign   (p < 0.01). With one or more Waddell signs, patients’ PCS and   ODI scores indicated a perception of severe disability; with three   or more Waddell signs, patients’ MCS scores indicated severe disability.   With five Waddell signs, ODI scores indicated that patients perceived   themselves as crippled.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Positive Waddell signs, a potential indicator of central sensitization,   indicated a likelihood of having functional limitations and an impaired   quality of life, particularly in young women.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:219–25.</p></sec>

Impact of Novel Low-Density Lipoprotein-Cholesterol Assessment on the Utility of Secondary Non-High-Density Lipoprotein-C and Apolipoprotein B Targets in Selected Worldwide Dyslipidemia Guidelines
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Selected dyslipidemia guidelines recommend non-high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C) and apolipoprotein B (apoB) as secondary targets to the primary target of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C). After considering 2 LDL-C estimates that differ in accuracy, we examined: (1) how frequently non-HDL-C guideline targets could change <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement; and (2) the utility of apoB targets after meeting LDL-C and non-HDL-C targets.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We analyzed 2518 adults representative of the US population from the 2011 to 2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and 126 092 patients from the Very Large Database of Lipids study with apoB. We identified all individuals as well as those with high-risk clinical features, including coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and metabolic syndrome who met very high- and high-risk guideline targets of LDL-C <70 and <100 mg/dL using Friedewald estimation (LDL-C<sub>F</sub>) and a novel, more accurate method (LDL-C<sub>N</sub>). Next, we examined those not meeting non-HDL-C (<100, <130 mg/dL) and apoB (<80, <100 mg/dL) guideline targets. In those meeting dual LDL-C and non-HDL-C targets (<70 and <100 mg/dL, respectively, or <100 and <130 mg/dL, respectively), we determined the proportion of individuals who did not meet guideline apoB targets (<80 or <100 mg/dL).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 7% to 9% and 31% to 36% of individuals had LDL-C <70 and <100 mg/dL, respectively. Among those with LDL-C<sub>F</sub><70 mg/dL, 14% to 15% had non-HDL-C ≥100 mg/dL, and 7% to 8% had apoB ≥80 mg/dL. Among those with LDL-C<sub>F</sub><100 mg/dL, 8% to 10% had non-HDL-C ≥130 mg/dL and 2% to 3% had apoB ≥100 mg/dL. In comparison, among those with LDL-C<sub>N</sub><70 or 100 mg/dL, only ≈2% and ≈1% of individuals, respectively, had non-HDL-C and apoB values above guideline targets. Similar trends were upheld among those with high-risk clinical features: ≈0% to 3% of individuals with LDL-C<sub>N</sub><70 mg/dL had non-HDL-C ≥100 mg/dL or apoB ≥80 mg/dL compared with 13% to 38% and 9% to 25%, respectively, in those with LDL-C<sub>F</sub><70 mg/dL. With LDL-C<sub>F</sub> or LDL-C<sub>N</sub><70 mg/dL and non-HDL-C <100 mg/dL, 0% to 1% had apoB ≥80 mg/dL. Among all dual LDL-C<sub>F</sub> or LDL-C<sub>N</sub><100 mg/dL and non-HDL-C <130 mg/dL individuals, 0% to 0.4% had apoB ≥100 mg/dL. These findings were robust to sex, fasting status, and lipid-lowering therapy status.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>After more accurately estimating LDL-C, guideline-suggested non-HDL-C targets could alter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement in only a small fraction of individuals, including those with coronary artery disease and other high-risk clinical features. Furthermore, current guideline-suggested apoB targets provide modest utility after meeting cholesterol targets.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

The Little Ice Age and 20th-century deep Pacific cooling
<p>Proxy records show that before the onset of modern anthropogenic warming, globally coherent cooling occurred from the Medieval Warm Period to the Little Ice Age. The long memory of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong> suggests that these historical surface anomalies are associated with ongoing deep-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong> temperature adjustments. Combining an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong> model with modern and pale<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong>ographi</span></strong>c data leads to a prediction that the deep Pacific is still adjusting to the cooling going into the Little Ice Age, whereas temperature trends in the surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong> and deep Atlantic reflect modern warming. This prediction is corroborated by temperature changes identified between the HMS Challenger expedition of the 1870s and modern hydrography. The implied heat loss in the deep <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong> since 1750 CE offsets one-fourth of the global heat gain in the upper <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong>.</p>

The oceanic sink for anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> from 1994 to 2007
<p>We quantify the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong>ic sink for anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) over the period 1994 to 2007 by using observations from the global repeat hydrography program and contrasting them to observations from the 1990s. Using a linear regression–based method, we find a global increase in the anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> inventory of 34 ± 4 petagrams of carbon (Pg C) between 1994 and 2007. This is equivalent to an average uptake rate of 2.6 ± 0.3 Pg C year<sup>−1</sup> and represents 31 ± 4% of the global anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions over this period. Although this global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong> sink estimate is consistent with the expectation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong> uptake having increased in proportion to the rise in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, substantial regional differences in storage rate are found, likely owing to climate variability–driven changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong> circulation.</p>

Coral reefs will transition to net dissolving before end of century
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong> acidification refers to the lowering of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong>’s pH due to the uptake of anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere. Coral reef calcification is expected to decrease as the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong>s become more acidic. Dissolving calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) sands could greatly exacerbate reef loss associated with reduced calcification but is presently poorly constrained. Here we show that CaCO<sub>3</sub> dissolution in reef sediments across five globally distributed sites is negatively correlated with the aragonite saturation state (Ω<sub>ar</sub>) of overlying seawater and that CaCO<sub>3</sub> sediment dissolution is 10-fold more sensitive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong> acidification than coral calcification. Consequently, reef sediments globally will transition from net precipitation to net dissolution when seawater Ω<sub>ar</sub> reaches 2.92 ± 0.16 (expected circa 2050 CE). Notably, some reefs are already experiencing net sediment dissolution.</p>

Major role of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria in dark ocean carbon fixation
<p>Carbon fixation by chemoautotrophic microorganisms in the dark <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong> has a major impact on global carbon cycling and ecological relationships in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong>’s interior, but the relevant taxa and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">energy sourc</span></strong>es remain enigmatic. We show evidence that nitrite-oxidizing bacteria affiliated with the Nitrospinae phylum are important in dark <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong> chemoautotrophy. Single-cell genomics and community metagenomics revealed that Nitrospinae are the most abundant and globally distributed nitrite-oxidizing bacteria in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong>. Metaproteomics and metatranscriptomics analyses suggest that nitrite oxidation is the main pathway of energy production in Nitrospinae. Microautoradiography, linked with catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization, indicated that Nitrospinae fix 15 to 45% of inorganic carbon in the mesopelagic western North Atlantic. Nitrite oxidation may have a greater impact on the carbon cycle than previously assumed.</p>

The geologic history of seawater pH
<p>Although pH is a fundamental property of Earth’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong>s, critical to our understanding of seawater biogeochemistry, its long-timescale geologic history is poorly constrained. We constrain seawater pH through time by accounting for the cycles of the major components of seawater. We infer an increase from early Archean pH values between ~6.5 and 7.0 and Phanerozoic values between ~7.5 and 9.0, which was caused by a gradual decrease in atmospheric <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> in response to solar brightening, alongside a decrease in hydrothermal exchange between seawater and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong> crust. A lower pH in Earth’s early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong>s likely affected the kinetics of chemical reactions associated with the origin of life, the energetics of early metabolisms, and climate through the partitioning of CO<sub>2</sub> between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong>s and atmosphere.</p>

Olfactory foraging in temperate waters: sensitivity to dimethylsulphide of shearwaters in the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea
<p>Many procellariiforms use olfactory cues to locate food patches over the seemingly featureless <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong> surfac</span></strong>e. In particular, some of them are able to detect and are attracted by dimethylsulphide (DMS), a volatile compound naturally occurring over worldwide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong>s in correspondence with productive feeding areas. However, current knowledge is restricted to sub-Antarctic species and to only one study realized under natural conditions at sea. Here, for the first time, we investigated the response to DMS in parallel in two different environments in temperate waters, the Atlantic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong> and the Mediterranean Sea, employing Cory's (<i>Calonectris borealis</i>) and Scopoli's (<i>Calonectris diomedea</i>) shearwaters as models. To test whether these birds can detect and respond to DMS, we presented them with this substance in a Y-maze. Then, to determine whether they use this molecule in natural conditions, we tested the response to DMS at sea. The number of birds that chose DMS in the Y-maze and that were recruited at DMS-scented slicks at sea suggests that these shearwaters are attracted to DMS in both non-foraging and natural contexts. Our findings show that the use of DMS as a foraging cue may be a strategy adopted by procellariiforms across <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong>s but that regional differences may exist, giving a worldwide perspective to previous hypotheses concerning the use of DMS as a chemical cue.</p>

Dominant effect of relative tropical Atlantic warming on major hurricane occurrence
<p>Here we explore factors potentially linked to the enhanced major hurricane activity in the Atlantic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong> during 2017. Using a suite of high-resolution model experiments, we show that the increase in 2017 major hurricanes was not primarily caused by La Niña conditions in the Pacific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong> but rather triggered mainly by pronounced warm sea surface conditions in the tropical North Atlantic. Further, we superimpose a similar pattern of North Atlantic surface warming on data for long-term increasing sea surface temperature (a product of increases in greenhouse gas concentrations and decreases in aerosols) to show that this warming trend will likely lead to even higher numbers of major hurricanes in the future. The key factor controlling Atlantic major hurricane activity appears to be the degree to which the tropical Atlantic warms relative to the rest of the global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong>.</p>

Large-scale ocean deoxygenation during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum
<p>The consequences of global warming for fisheries are not well understood, but the geological record demonstrates that carbon cycle perturbations are frequently associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong> deoxygenation. Of particular interest is the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), where the carbon dioxide input into the atmosphere was similar to the IPCC RCP8.5 emission scenario. Here we present sulfur-isotope data that record a positive 1 per mil excursion during the PETM. Modeling suggests that large parts of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong> must have become sulfidic. The toxicity of hydrogen sulfide will render two of the largest and least explored ecosystems on Earth, the mesopelagic and bathypelagic zones, uninhabitable by multicellular organisms.

Late inception of a resiliently oxygenated upper ocean
<p>Rising <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong>ic and atmospheric oxygen levels through time have been crucial to enhanced habitability of surface Earth environments. Few redox proxies can track secular variations in dissolved oxygen concentrations around threshold levels for metazoan survival in the upper <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong>. We present an extensive compilation of iodine-to-calcium ratios (I/Ca) in marine carbonates. Our record supports a major rise in the partial pressure of oxygen in the atmosphere at ~400 million years (Ma) ago and reveals a step change in the oxygenation of the upper <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong> to relatively sustainable near-modern conditions at ~200 Ma ago. An Earth system model demonstrates that a shift in organic matter remineralization to greater depths, which may have been due to increasing size and biomineralization of eukaryotic plankton, likely drove the I/Ca signals at ~200 Ma ago.</p>

Determination of intrinsic attenuation in the oceanic lithosphere-asthenosphere system

The strong intrinsic attenuation in the asthenosphere obtained at higher frequency (~3 hertz) is comparable to that constrained at lower frequency (~100 seconds) by surface waves and suggests frequency-independent anelasticity, whereas the intrinsic attenuation in the lithosphere is frequency dependent. This difference in frequency dependence indicates that the strong and broad peak dissipation recently observed in the laboratory exists only in the asthenosphere and provides new insight into what distinguishes the asthenosphere from the lithosphere.</p>

Ocean biogeochemistry modeled with emergent trait-based genomics
<p>Marine ecosystem models have advanced to incorporate metabolic pathways discovered with genomic sequencing, but direct comparisons between models and “omics” data are lacking. We developed a model that directly simulates metagenomes and metatranscriptomes for comparison with observations. Model microbes were randomly assigned genes for specialized functions, and communities of 68 species were simulated in the Atlantic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong>. Unfit organisms were replaced, and the model self-organized to develop community genomes and transcriptomes. Emergent communities from simulations that were initialized with different cohorts of randomly generated microbes all produced realistic vertical and horizontal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong> nutrient, genome, and transcriptome gradients. Thus, the library of gene functions available to the community, rather than the distribution of functions among specific organisms, drove community assembly and biogeochemical gradients in the model <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong>.</p>

The Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 early science investigations of regional carbon dioxide fluxes

Tsunami-driven rafting: Transoceanic species dispersal and implications for marine biogeography
<p>The 2011 East Japan earthquake generated a massive tsunami that launched an extraordinary trans<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong>ic biological rafting event with no known historical precedent. We document 289 living Japanese coastal marine species from 16 phyla transported over 6 years on objects that traveled thousands of kilometers across the Pacific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong> to the shores of North America and Hawai‘i. Most of this dispersal occurred on nonbiodegradable objects, resulting in the longest documented trans<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong>ic survival and dispersal of coastal species by rafting. Expanding shoreline infrastructure has increased global sources of plastic materials available for biotic colonization and also interacts with climate change–induced storms of increasing severity to eject debris into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong>s.

21st-century rise in anthropogenic nitrogen deposition on a remote coral reef
<p>With the rapid rise in pollution-associated nitrogen inputs to the western Pacific, it has been suggested that even the open <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong> has been affected. In a coral core from Dongsha Atoll, a remote coral reef ecosystem, we observe a decline in the <sup>15</sup>N/<sup>14</sup>N of coral skeleton–bound organic matter, which signals increased deposition of anthropogenic atmospheric N on the open <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong> and its incorporation into plankton and, in turn, the atoll corals. The first clear change occurred just before 2000 CE, decades later than predicted by other work. The amplitude of change suggests that, by 2010, anthropogenic atmospheric N deposition represented 20 ± 5% of the annual N input to the surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong> in this region, which appears to be at the lower end of other estimates.</p>

Cassini finds molecular hydrogen in the Enceladus plume: Evidence for hydrothermal processes
<p>Saturn’s moon Enceladus has an ice-covered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong>; a plume of material erupts from cracks in the ice. The plume contains chemical signatures of water-rock interaction between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong> and a rocky core. We used the Ion Neutral Mass Spectrometer onboard the Cassini spacecraft to detect molecular hydrogen in the plume. By using the instrument’s open-source mode, background processes of hydrogen production in the instrument were minimized and quantified, enabling the identification of a statistically significant signal of hydrogen native to Enceladus. We find that the most plausible source of this hydrogen is ongoing hydrothermal reactions of rock containing reduced minerals and organic materials. The relatively high hydrogen abundance in the plume signals thermodynamic disequilibrium that favors the formation of methane from CO<sub>2</sub> in Enceladus’ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong>.</p>

Inflammation boosts bacteriophage transfer between <i>Salmonella</i> spp.
<p>Bacteriophage transfer (lysogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion) promotes bacterial virulence evolution. There is limited understanding of the factors that determine lysogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion dynamics within infected hosts. A murine <i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium (<i>S</i>.Tm) diarrhea model was used to study the transfer of SopEΦ, a prophage from <i>S</i>.Tm SL1344, to <i>S</i>.Tm ATCC14028S. Gut inflammation and enteric disease triggered >55% lysogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion of ATCC14028S within 3 days. Without inflammation, SopEΦ transfer was reduced by up to 10<sup>5</sup>-fold. This was because inflammation (e.g., reactive oxygen species, reactive nitrogen species, hypochlorite) triggers the bacterial SOS response, boosts expression of the phage antirepressor Tum, and thereby promotes free phage production and subsequent transfer. Mucosal vaccination prevented a dense intestinal <i>S</i>.Tm population from inducing inflammation and consequently abolished SopEΦ transfer. Vaccination may be a general strategy for blocking pathogen evolution that requires disease-driven transfer of temperate bacteriophages.</p>

Experimental constraints on the damp peridotite solidus and oceanic mantle potential temperature
<p>Decompression of hot mantle rock upwelling beneath <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong>ic spreading centers causes it to exceed the melting point (solidus), producing magmas that ascend to form basaltic crust ~6 to 7 kilometers thick.

Here, we present results from an experimental determination of the peridotite solidus containing known amounts of dissolved hydrogen. Our data reveal that the H<sub>2</sub>O-undersaturated peridotite solidus is hotter than previously thought. Reconciling geophysical observations of the melting regime beneath the East Pacific Rise with our experimental results requires that existing estimates for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong>ic upper mantle potential temperature be adjusted upward by about 60°C.</p>

Although molar DOS versus dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) ratios of 0.11 ± 0.024 in Atlantic surface water resembled phytoplankton stoichiometry (sulfur/nitrogen ~ 0.08), increasing dissolved organic carbon (DOC) versus DOS ratios and decreasing methionine-S yield demonstrated selective DOS removal and active involvement in marine biogeochemical cycles. Based on stoichiometric estimates, the minimum global inventory of marine DOS is 6.7 petagrams of sulfur, exceeding all other marine organic sulfur reservoirs by an order of magnitude.</p>

Atmospheric <sup>14</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C changes during the last glacial period from Hulu Cave

Over the last glacial period, atmospheric <sup>14</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C ranges from values similar to modern values to values 1.70 times higher (42,000 to 39,000 years ago). The latter correspond to <sup>14</sup>C ages 5200 years less than calibrated ages and correlate with the Laschamp geomagnetic excursion followed by Heinrich Stadial 4. Millennial-scale variations are largely attributable to Earth’s magnetic field changes and in part to climate-related changes in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong>ic carbon cycle. A progressive shift to lower <sup>14</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C values between 25,000 and 11,000 years ago is likely related, in part, to progressively increasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong> ventilation rates.</p>

The effect of these changes on animal survival is evaluated using the Metabolic Index (Φ), a measure of scope for aerobic activity governed by organismal traits sampled in diverse modern species. Modeled loss of aerobic habitat predicts lower extinction intensity in the tropics, a pattern confirmed with a spatially explicit analysis of the marine fossil record.

We biochemically investigated the recombinant DA biosynthetic enzymes and linked their mechanisms to the construction of DA’s diagnostic pyrrolidine skeleton, establishing a model for DA biosynthesis.

Using satellite imagery, we developed a forest loss classification model to determine a spatial attribution of forest disturbance to the dominant drivers of land cover and land use change over the period 2001 to 2015. Our results indicate that 27% of global forest loss can be attributed to deforestation through permanent land use change for commodity production. The remaining areas maintained the same land use over 15 years; in those areas, loss was attributed to forestry (26%), shifting agriculture (24%), and wildfire (23%). Despite corporate commitments, the rate of commodity-driven deforestation has not declined. To end deforestation, companies must eliminate 5 million hectares of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion from supply chains each year.</p>

Diatom ooze—A large marine mercury sink
<p>The role of algae for sequestration of atmospheric mercury in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong> is largely unknown owing to a lack of marine sediment data. We used high-resolution cores from marine Antarctica to estimate Holocene global mercury accumulation in biogenic siliceous sediments (diatom ooze). Diatom ooze exhibits the highest mercury accumulation rates ever reported for the marine environment and provides a large sink of anthropogenic mercury, surpassing existing model estimates by as much as a factor of 7. Anthropogenic pollution of the Southern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong> began ~150 years ago, and up to 20% of anthropogenic mercury emitted to the atmosphere may have been stored in diatom ooze. These findings reveal the crucial role of diatoms as a fast vector for mercury sequestration and diatom ooze as a large marine mercury sink.</p>

Ultrastable laser interferometry for earthquake detection with terrestrial and submarine cables
<p>Detecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong>-floor seismic activity is crucial for our understanding of the interior structure and dynamic behavior of Earth. However, 70% of the planet’s surface is covered by water, and seismometer coverage is limited to a handful of permanent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong> bottom stations. We show that existing telecommunication optical fiber cables can detect seismic events when combined with state-of-the-art frequency metrology techniques by using the fiber itself as the sensing element. We detected earthquakes over terrestrial and submarine links with lengths ranging from 75 to 535 kilometers and a geographical distance from the earthquake’s epicenter ranging from 25 to 18,500 kilometers. Implementing a global seismic network for real-time detection of underwater earthquakes requires applying the proposed technique to the existing extensive submarine optical fiber network.</p>

The South Asian monsoon—pollution pump and purifier
<p>Air pollution is growing fastest in monsoon-affected South Asia. During the dry winter monsoon, the fumes disperse toward the Indian Ocean, creating a vast pollution haze, but their fate during the wet summer monsoon has been unclear. We performed atmospheric chemistry measurements by aircraft in the Oxidation Mechanism Observations campaign, sampling the summer monsoon outflow in the upper troposphere between the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean. The measurements, supported by model calculations, show that the monsoon sustains a remarkably efficient cleansing mechanism by which contaminants are rapidly oxidized and deposited to Earth’s surface. However, some pollutants are lofted above the monsoon clouds and chemically processed in a reactive reservoir before being redistributed globally, including to the stratosphere.</p>

Biological uptake and reversible scavenging of zinc in the global ocean
<p>Zinc (Zn) is a key micronutrient for marine phytoplankton, with a global distribution that is similar to silicic acid. The processes that govern this relationship, despite the very different biological cycling of Zn and silica, remain poorly understood. Here, we use diagnostic and mechanistic models to show that only a combination of Southern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong> biological uptake and reversible scavenging of Zn onto sinking particles can explain the observations. The distinction between organic and adsorbed Zn can also reconcile the vertical distribution and mass balance of Zn isotopes, which previously appeared at odds. This holistic understanding explains the Zn deficiencies observed throughout the low-latitude <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong> and implies a greater sensitivity of the marine Zn cycle to climate-driven changes in organic matter cycling than previously recognized.</p>

3D charge and 2D phonon transports leading to high out-of-plane <i>ZT</i> in n-type SnSe crystals
<p>Thermoelectric technology enables the harvest of waste heat and its direct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion into electricity. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion efficiency is determined by the materials figure of merit <i>ZT</i>. Here we show a maximum <i>ZT</i> of ~2.8 ± 0.5 at 773 kelvin in n-type tin selenide (SnSe) crystals out of plane. The thermal conductivity in layered SnSe crystals is the lowest in the out-of-plane direction [two-dimensional (2D) phonon transport]. We doped SnSe with bromine to make n-type SnSe crystals with the overlapping interlayer charge density (3D charge transport). A continuous phase transition increases the symmetry and diverges two converged conduction bands. These two factors improve carrier mobility, while preserving a large Seebeck coefficient. Our findings can be applied in 2D layered materials and provide a new strategy to enhance out-of-plane electrical transport properties without degrading thermal properties.</p>

Two-billion-year-old evaporites capture Earth’s great oxidation
<p>Major changes in atmospheric and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong> chemistry occurred in the Paleoproterozoic era (2.5 to 1.6 billion years ago). Increasing oxidation dramatically changed Earth’s surface, but few quantitative constraints exist on this important transition. This study describes the sedimentology, mineralogy, and geochemistry of a 2-billion-year-old, ~800-meter-thick evaporite succession from the Onega Basin in Russian Karelia. The deposit consists of a basal unit dominated by halite (~100 meters) followed by units dominated by anhydrite-magnesite (~500 meters) and dolomite-magnesite (~200 meters). The evaporite minerals robustly constrain marine sulfate concentrations to at least 10 millimoles per kilogram of water, representing an oxidant reservoir equivalent to more than 20% of the modern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong>-atmosphere oxidizing capacity. These results show that substantial amounts of surface oxidant accumulated during this critical transition in Earth’s oxygenation.</p>

GDV1 induces sexual commitment of malaria parasites by antagonizing HP1-dependent gene silencing
<p>Malaria is caused by <i>Plasmodium</i> parasites that proliferate in the bloodstream. During each replication cycle, some parasites differentiate into gametocytes, the only forms able to infect the mosquito vector and transmit malaria. Sexual commitment is triggered by activation of AP2-G, the master transcriptional regulator of gametocytogenesis. Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1)–dependent silencing of <i>ap2-g</i> prevents sexual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion in proliferating parasites. In this study, we identified <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> gametocyte development 1 (GDV1) as an upstream activator of sexual commitment. We found that GDV1 targeted heterochromatin and triggered HP1 eviction, thus derepressing <i>ap2-g</i>. Expression of GDV1 was responsive to environmental triggers of sexual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion and controlled via a <i>gdv1</i> antisense RNA. Hence, GDV1 appears to act as an effector protein that induces sexual differentiation by antagonizing HP1-dependent gene silencing.</p>

Sustained climate warming drives declining marine biological productivity
<p>Climate change projections to the year 2100 may miss physical-biogeochemical feedbacks that emerge later from the cumulative effects of climate warming. In a coupled climate simulation to the year 2300, the westerly winds strengthen and shift poleward, surface waters warm, and sea ice disappears, leading to intense nutrient trapping in the Southern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong>. The trapping drives a global-scale nutrient redistribution, with net transfer to the deep <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong>. Ensuing surface nutrient reductions north of 30°S drive steady declines in primary production and carbon export (decreases of 24 and 41%, respectively, by 2300). Potential fishery yields, constrained by lower–trophic-level productivity, decrease by more than 20% globally and by nearly 60% in the North Atlantic. Continued high levels of greenhouse gas emissions could suppress marine biological productivity for a millennium.</p>

We assessed the influence of plastic waste on disease risk in 124,000 reef-building corals from 159 reefs in the Asia-Pacific region. The likelihood of disease increases from 4% to 89% when corals are in contact with plastic. Structurally complex corals are eight times more likely to be affected by plastic, suggesting that microhabitats for reef-associated organisms and valuable fisheries will be disproportionately affected. Plastic levels on coral reefs correspond to estimates of terrestrial mismanaged plastic waste entering the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong>. We estimate that 11.1 billion plastic items are entangled on coral reefs across the Asia-Pacific and project this number to increase 40% by 2025.

Structural basis for methylphosphonate biosynthesis
<p>Methylphosphonate synthase (MPnS) produces methylphosphonate, a metabolic precursor to methane in the upper <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong>.

We further solve the structure of a related enzyme, hydroxyethylphosphonate dioxygenase from <i>Streptomyces albus</i> (<i>Sa</i>HEPD), and find that it displays the same motif. <i>Sa</i>HEPD can be converted into an MPnS by mutation of glutamine-adjacent residues, identifying the molecular requirements for methylphosphonate synthesis. Using these sequence markers, we find numerous putative MPnSs in marine microbiomes and confirm that MPnS is present in the abundant <i>Pelagibacter ubique.</i> The ubiquity of MPnS-containing microbes supports the proposal that methylphosphonate is a source of methane in the upper, aerobic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong>, where phosphorus-starved microbes catabolize methylphosphonate for its phosphorus.</p>

Titanium isotopic evidence for felsic crust and plate tectonics 3.5 billion years ago

This can only be explained if the emerged crust was predominantly felsic (silica-rich) since 3.5 billion years ago, requiring an early initiation of plate tectonics. We also observed a change in the abundance of biologically important nutrients phosphorus and nickel across the Archean-Proterozoic boundary, which might have helped trigger the rise in atmospheric oxygen.</p>

Greater role for Atlantic inflows on sea-ice loss in the Eurasian Basin of the Arctic Ocean
<p>Arctic sea-ice loss is a leading indicator of climate change and can be attributed, in large part, to atmospheric forcing.

The associated enhanced release of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong>ic heat has reduced winter sea-ice formation at a rate now comparable to losses from atmospheric thermodynamic forcing, thus explaining the recent reduction in sea-ice cover in the eastern Eurasian Basin. This encroaching “atlantification” of the Eurasian Basin represents an essential step toward a new Arctic climate state, with a substantially greater role for Atlantic inflows.</p>

Reovirus infection triggers inflammatory responses to dietary antigens and development of celiac disease
<p>Viral infections have been proposed to elicit pathological processes leading to the initiation of T helper 1 (T<sub>H</sub>1) immunity against dietary gluten and celiac disease (CeD). To test this hypothesis and gain insights into mechanisms underlying virus-induced loss of tolerance to dietary antigens, we developed a viral infection model that makes use of two reovirus strains that infect the intestine but differ in their immunopathological outcomes. Reovirus is an avirulent pathogen that elicits protective immunity, but we discovered that it can nonetheless disrupt intestinal immune homeostasis at inductive and effector sites of oral tolerance by suppressing peripheral regulatory T cell (pT<sub>reg</sub>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion and promoting T<sub>H</sub>1 immunity to dietary antigen.

Last, our study in humans supports a role for infection with reovirus, a seemingly innocuous virus, in triggering the development of CeD.</p>

<p><i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973 (<i>Synechococcus</i> 2973) has the shortest reported doubling time (2.1 h) among cyanobacteria, making it a promising platform for the solar-based production of biochemicals. In this meta-analysis, its intracellular flux distribution was recomputed using genome-scale isotopic nonstationary <sup>13</sup>C-metabolic flux analysis given the labeling dynamics of 13 metabolites reported in an earlier study. To achieve this, a genome-scale mapping model, namely <i>i</i>mSyu593, was constructed using the <i>i</i>mSyn617 mapping model for <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 (<i>Synechocystis</i> 6803) as the starting point encompassing 593 reactions. The flux elucidation revealed nearly complete <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion (greater than 96%) of the assimilated carbon into biomass in <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973. In contrast, <i>Synechocystis</i> 6803 achieves complete <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion of only 86% of the assimilated carbon. This high biomass yield was enabled by the reincorporation of the fixed carbons lost in anabolic and photorespiratory pathways in conjunction with flux rerouting through a nondecarboxylating reaction such as phosphoketolase. This reincorporation of lost CO<sub>2</sub> sustains a higher flux through the photorespiratory C2 cycle that fully meets the glycine and serine demands for growth. In accordance with the high carbon efficiency drive, acetyl-coenzyme A was entirely produced using the carbon-efficient phosphoketolase pathway. Comparison of the <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973 flux map with that of <i>Synechocystis</i> 6803 revealed differences in the use of Calvin cycle and photorespiratory pathway reactions. The two species used different reactions for the synthesis of metabolites such as fructose-6-phosphate, glycine, sedoheptulose-7-phosphate, and Ser. These findings allude to a highly carbon-efficient metabolism alongside the fast carbon uptake rate in <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973, which explains its faster growth rate.</p>

Reconfigured Cyanogenic Glucoside Biosynthesis in <i>Eucalyptus cladocalyx</i> Involves a Cytochrome P450 CYP706C55
<p>Cyanogenic glucosides are a class of specialized metabolites widespread in the plant kingdom. Cyanogenic glucosides are α-hydroxynitriles, and their hydrolysis releases toxic hydrogen cyanide, providing an effective chemical defense against herbivores. <i>Eucalyptus cladocalyx</i> is a cyanogenic tree, allocating up to 20% of leaf nitrogen to the biosynthesis of the cyanogenic monoglucoside, prunasin. Here, mass spectrometry analyses of <i>E. cladocalyx</i> tissues revealed spatial and ontogenetic variations in prunasin content, as well as the presence of the cyanogenic diglucoside amygdalin in flower buds and flowers. The identification and biochemical characterization of the prunasin biosynthetic enzymes revealed a unique enzyme configuration for prunasin production in <i>E. cladocalyx</i>. This result indicates that a multifunctional cytochrome P450 (CYP), CYP79A125, catalyzes the initial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion of <sc>l</sc>-phenylalanine into its corresponding aldoxime, phenylacetaldoxime; a function consistent with other members of the CYP79 family. In contrast to the single multifunctional CYP known from other plant species, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion of phenylacetaldoxime to the α-hydroxynitrile, mandelonitrile, is catalyzed by two distinct CYPs. CYP706C55 catalyzes the dehydration of phenylacetaldoxime, an unusual CYP reaction. The resulting phenylacetonitrile is subsequently hydroxylatedby CYP71B103 to form mandelonitrile. The final glucosylation step to yield prunasin is catalyzed by a UDP-glucosyltransferase, UGT85A59. Members of the CYP706 family have not been reported previously to participate in the biosynthesis of cyanogenic glucosides, and the pathway structure in <i>E. cladocalyx</i> represents an example of convergent evolution in the biosynthesis of cyanogenic glucosides in plants.</p>

DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE and DIACYLGLYCEROL KINASE Modulate Triacylglycerol and Phosphatidic Acid Production in the Plant Response to Freezing Stress
<p>Plants accumulate the lipids phosphatidic acid (PA), diacylglycerol (DAG), and triacylglycerol (TAG) during cold stress, but how plants balance the levels of these lipids to mediate cold responses remains unknown. The enzymes ACYL-COENZYME A:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE (DGAT) and DIACYLGLYCEROL KINASE (DGK) catalyze the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion of DAG to TAG and PA, respectively. Here, we show that DGAT1, DGK2, DGK3, and DGK5 contribute to the response to cold in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). With or without cold acclimation, the <i>dgat1</i> mutants exhibited higher sensitivity upon freezing exposure compared with the wild type. Under cold conditions, the <i>dgat1</i> mutants showed reduced expression of <i>C-REPEAT/DRE BINDING FACTOR2</i> and its regulons, which are essential for the acquisition of cold tolerance. Lipid profiling revealed that freezing significantly increased the levels of PA and DAG while decreasing TAG in the rosettes of <i>dgat1</i> mutant plants. During freezing stress, the accumulation of PA in <i>dgat1</i> plants stimulated NADPH oxidase activity and enhanced RbohD-dependent hydrogen peroxide production compared with the wild type. Moreover, the cold-inducible transcripts of <i>DGK2</i>, <i>DGK3</i>, and <i>DGK5</i> were significantly more up-regulated in the <i>dgat1</i> mutants than in the wild type during cold stress. Consistent with this observation, <i>dgk2</i>, <i>dgk3</i>, and <i>dgk5</i> knockout mutants showed improved tolerance and attenuated PA production in response to freezing temperatures. Our findings demonstrate that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion of DAG to TAG by <i>DGAT1</i> is critical for plant freezing tolerance, acting by balancing TAG and PA production in Arabidopsis.</p>

Phospholipase Dζ Enhances Diacylglycerol Flux into Triacylglycerol<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plant seeds are the primary source of triacylglycerols (TAG) for food, feed, fuel, and industrial applications. As TAG is produced from diacylglycerol (DAG), successful engineering strategies to enhance TAG levels have focused on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion of DAG to TAG. However, the production of TAG can be limited by flux through the enzymatic reactions that supply DAG. In this study, two <i>Arabidopsis phospholipase D</i><sub>ζ</sub> genes (<i>AtPLD<sub>ζ1</sub></i> and <i>AtPLD<sub>ζ2</sub></i>) were coexpressed in <i>Camelina sativa</i> to test whether the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion of phosphatidylcholine to DAG impacts TAG levels in seeds. The resulting transgenic plants produced 2% to 3% more TAG as a component of total seed biomass and had increased 18:3 and 20:1 fatty acid levels relative to wild type. Increased DAG and decreased PC levels were examined through the kinetics of lipid assembly by [<sup>14</sup>C]acetate and [<sup>14</sup>C]glycerol incorporation into glycerolipids. [<sup>14</sup>C]acetate was rapidly incorporated into TAG in both wild-type and overexpression lines, indicating a significant flux of nascent and elongated acyl-CoAs into the <i>sn</i>-3 position of TAG. Stereochemical analysis revealed that newly synthesized fatty acids were preferentially incorporated into the <i>sn</i>-2 position of PC, but the <i>sn</i>-1 position of de novo DAG and indicated similar rates of nascent acyl groups into the Kennedy pathway and acyl editing. [<sup>14</sup>C]glycerol studies demonstrated PC-derived DAG is the major source of DAG for TAG synthesis in both tissues. The results emphasize that the inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ions of DAG and PC pools can impact oil production and composition.</p>

The Evolution of Silicon Transport in Eukaryotes
<p>Biosilicification (the formation of biological structures from silica) occurs in diverse eukaryotic lineages, plays a major role in global biogeochemical cycles, and has significant biotechnological applications. Silicon (Si) uptake is crucial for biosilicification, yet the evolutionary history of the transporters involved remains poorly known. Recent evidence suggests that the SIT family of Si transporters, initially identified in diatoms, may be widely distributed, with an extended family of related transporters (SIT-Ls) present in some nonsilicified organisms. Here, we identify SITs and SIT-Ls in a range of eukaryotes, including major silicified lineages (radiolarians and chrysophytes) and also bacterial SIT-Ls. Our evidence suggests that the symmetrical 10-transmembrane-domain SIT structure has independently evolved multiple times via duplication and fusion of 5-transmembrane-domain SIT-Ls. We also identify a second gene family, similar to the active Si transporter Lsi2, that is broadly distributed amongst siliceous and nonsiliceous eukaryotes. Our analyses resolve a distinct group of Lsi2-like genes, including plant and diatom Si-responsive genes, and sequences unique to siliceous sponges and choanoflagellates. The SIT/SIT-L and Lsi2 transporter families likely contribute to biosilicification in diverse lineages, indicating an ancient role for Si transport in eukaryotes. We propose that these Si transporters may have arisen initially to prevent Si toxicity in the high Si Precambrian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong>s, with subsequent biologically induced reductions in Si concentrations of Phanerozoic seas leading to widespread losses of SIT, SIT-L, and Lsi2-like genes in diverse lineages. Thus, the origin and diversification of two independent Si transporter families both drove and were driven by ancient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ocean</span></strong> Si levels.</p>

Changes in protein expression in the salt marsh mussel <i>Geukensia demissa</i>: evidence for a shift from anaerobic to aerobic metabolism during prolonged aerial exposure
<p>During aerial exposure (emersion), most sessile intertidal invertebrates experience cellular stress caused by hypoxia, and the amount and types of hypoxia-induced stress will differ as exposure time increases, likely leading to altered metabolic responses. We examined proteomic responses to increasing emersion times and decreasing recovery (immersion) times in the mussel <i>Geukensia demissa</i>, which occurs in salt marshes along the east coast of North America. Individuals are found above mean <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tide</span></strong> level, and can be emersed for over 18 h during spring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tide</span></strong>s. We acclimated mussels to full immersion at 15°C for 4 weeks, and compared changes in gill protein expression between groups of mussels that were continually immersed (control), were emersed for 6 h and immersed during recovery for 18 h (6E/18R), were emersed for 12 h and recovered for 12 h (12E/12R), or were emersed for 18 h with a 6 h recovery (18E/6R). We found clear differences in protein expression patterns among the treatments. Proteins associated with anaerobic fermentation increased in abundance in 6E/18R but not in 12E/12R or 18E/6R. Increases in oxidative stress proteins were most apparent in 12E/12R, and in 18E/6R changes in cytoskeletal protein expression predominated. We conclude that <i>G. demissa</i> alters its strategy for coping with emersion stress over time, relying on anaerobic metabolism for short- to medium-duration exposure, but switching to an air-gaping strategy for long-term exposure, which reduces hypoxia stress but may cause structural damage to gill tissue.</p>

Ventricular Fibrillation Conversion Testing After Implantation of a Subcutaneous Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Compared with transvenous implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), subcutaneous (S)-ICDs require a higher energy for effective defibrillation. Although ventricular fibrillation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion testing (CT) is recommended after S-ICD implantation to ensure an adequate margin between the defibrillation threshold and maximum device output (80J), prior work found that adherence to this recommendation is declining.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied first-time recipients of S-ICDs (between September 28, 2012, and April 1, 2016) in the National Cardiovascular Database Registry ICD Registry to determine predictors of use of CT, predictors of an insufficient safety margin (ISM, defined as ventricular fibrillation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion energy >65J) during testing, and inhospital outcomes associated with use of CT. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to predict use of CT and ISM. Inverse probability weighted logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between use of CT and inhospital adverse events including death.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>CT testing was performed in 70.7% (n=5624) of 7960 patients with S-ICDs. Although deferral of CT was associated with several patient characteristics (including increased body mass index, increased body surface area, severely reduced ejection fraction, dialysis dependence, warfarin use, anemia, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), the facility effect was comparatively more important (area under the curve for patient level versus generalized linear mixed model: 0.619 versus 0.877). An ISM occurred in 6.9% (n=336) of 4864 patients without a prior ICD and was more common among white patients and those with ventricular pacing on the preimplant ECG, higher preimplant blood pressure, larger body surface area, higher body mass index, and lower ejection fraction. A risk score was able to identify patients at low (<5%), medium (5% to 10%), and high risk (>10%) for ISM. CT testing was not associated with a composite of inhospital complications including death.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Use of CT testing after S-ICD implantation was driven by facility preference to a greater extent than patient factors and was not associated with a composite of inhospital complications or death. ISM was relatively uncommon and is associated with several widely available patient characteristics. These data may inform ICD system selection and a targeted approach to CT.</p></sec>

Structure Annotation and Quantification of Wheat Seed Oxidized Lipids by High-Resolution LC-MS/MS
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> oxidation is a process ubiquitous in life, but the direct and comprehensive analysis of oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s has been limited by available analytical methods. We applied high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to quantify oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glycerid</span></strong>es, fatty acids, phospho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, lysophospho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, and galacto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s) and implemented a platform-independent high-throughput-amenable analysis pipeline for the high-confidence annotation and acyl composition analysis of oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> contents of 90 different naturally aged wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) seed stocks were quantified in an untargeted high-resolution LC-MS experiment, resulting in 18,556 quantitative mass-to-charge ratio features. In a posthoc liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry experiment, high-resolution MS/MS spectra (5 mD accuracy) were recorded for 8,957 out of 12,080 putatively monoisotopic features of the LC-MS data set. A total of 353 nonoxidized and 559 oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s with up to four additional oxygen atoms were annotated based on the accurate mass recordings (1.5 ppm tolerance) of the LC-MS data set and filtering procedures. MS/MS spectra available for 828 of these annotations were analyzed by translating experimentally known fragmentation rules of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s into the fragmentation of oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s. This led to the identification of 259 nonoxidized and 365 oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s by both accurate mass and MS/MS spectra and to the determination of acyl compositions for 221 nonoxidized and 295 oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s. Analysis of 15-year aged wheat seeds revealed increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> oxidation and hydrolysis in seeds stored in ambient versus cold conditions.</p>

Proteomic analysis of S-nitrosylated nuclear proteins in rat cortical neurons
<p>Neurons modulate gene expression in response to extrinsic signals to enable brain development, cognition, and learning and to process stimuli that regulate systemic physiological functions. This signal-to-gene communication is facilitated by posttranslational modifications such as S-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrosyl</span></strong>ation, the covalent attachment of a nitric oxide (NO) moiety to cysteine thiols. In the cerebral cortex, S-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrosyl</span></strong>ation of histone de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acet</span></strong>ylase 2 (HDAC2) is required for gene transcription during neuronal development, but few other nuclear targets of S-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrosyl</span></strong>ation have been identified to date. We used S-nitrosothiol resin-assisted capture on NO donor-treated nuclear extracts from rat cortical neurons and identified 614 S-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrosyl</span></strong>ated nuclear proteins. Of these, 131 proteins have not previously been shown to be S-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrosyl</span></strong>ated in any system, and 555 are previously unidentified targets of S-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrosyl</span></strong>ation in neurons. The sites of S-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrosyl</span></strong>ation were identified for 59% of the targets, and motifs containing single lysines were found at 33% of these sites. In addition, lysine motifs were necessary for promoting the S-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrosyl</span></strong>ation of HDAC2 and methyl-CpG binding protein 3 (MBD3). Moreover, S-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrosyl</span></strong>ation of the histone-binding protein RBBP7 was necessary for dendritogenesis of cortical neurons in culture. Together, our findings characterize S-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrosyl</span></strong>ated nuclear proteins in neurons and identify S-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrosyl</span></strong>ation motifs that may be shared with other targets of NO signaling.</p>

NMDA-Type Glutamate Receptor Activation Promotes Vascular Remodeling and Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Excessive proliferation and apoptosis resistance in pulmonary vascular cells underlie vascular remodeling in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Specific treatments for PAH exist, mostly targeting endothelial dysfunction, but high pulmonary arterial pressure still causes heart failure and death. Pulmonary vascular remodeling may be driven by metabolic reprogramming of vascular cells to increase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>inolysis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate production. The <i>N</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aspart</span></strong>ate receptor (NMDAR), a major neuronal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate receptor, is also expressed on vascular cells, but its role in PAH is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We assessed the status of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate-NMDAR axis in the pulmonary arteries of patients with PAH and controls through mass spectrometry imaging, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. We measured the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate release from cultured pulmonary vascular cells using enzymatic assays and analyzed NMDAR regulation/phosphorylation through Western blot experiments. The effect of NMDAR blockade on human pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell proliferation was determined using a BrdU incorporation assay. We assessed the role of NMDARs in vascular remodeling associated to pulmonary hypertension, in both smooth muscle-specific NMDAR knockout mice exposed to chronic hypoxia and the monocrotaline rat model of pulmonary hypertension using NMDAR blockers.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We report <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate accumulation, upregulation of the NMDAR, and NMDAR engagement reflected by increases in GluN1-subunit phosphorylation in the pulmonary arteries of human patients with PAH. K<sub>v</sub> channel inhibition and type A-selective endothelin receptor activation amplified calcium-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate release from human pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell, and type A-selective endothelin receptor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor activation led to NMDAR engagement, highlighting crosstalk between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate-NMDAR axis and major PAH-associated pathways. The platelet-derived growth factor-BB-induced proliferation of human pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells involved NMDAR activation and phosphorylated GluN1 subunit localization to cell-cell contacts, consistent with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>atergic communication between proliferating human pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells via NMDARs. Smooth-muscle NMDAR deficiency in mice attenuated the vascular remodeling triggered by chronic hypoxia, highlighting the role of vascular NMDARs in pulmonary hypertension. Pharmacological NMDAR blockade in the monocrotaline rat model of pulmonary hypertension had beneficial effects on cardiac and vascular remodeling, decreasing endothelial dysfunction, cell proliferation, and apoptosis resistance while disrupting the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate-NMDAR pathway in pulmonary arteries.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These results reveal a dysregulation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate-NMDAR axis in the pulmonary arteries of patients with PAH and identify vascular NMDARs as targets for antiremodeling treatments in PAH.</p></sec>

Lipidomics Profiling and Risk of Cardiovascular Disease in the Prospective Population-Based Bruneck Study
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>The bulk of cardiovascular disease risk is not explained by traditional risk factors. Recent advances in mass spectrometry allow the identification and quantification of hundreds of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> species. Molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> profiling by mass spectrometry may improve cardiovascular risk prediction.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s were extracted from 685 plasma samples of the prospective population-based Bruneck Study (baseline evaluation in 2000). One hundred thirty-five <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> species from 8 different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> classes were profiled by shotgun <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>omics with the use of a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer. Levels of individual species of cholesterol esters (CEs), lysophosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs), sphingomyelins, and triacylglycerols (TAGs) were associated with cardiovascular disease over a 10-year observation period (2000–2010, 90 incident events). Among the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> species with the strongest predictive value were TAGs and CEs with a low carbon number and double-bond content, including TAG(54:2) and CE(16:1), as well as PE(36:5) (<i>P</i>=5.1×10<sup>−7</sup>, 2.2×10<sup>−4</sup>, and 2.5×10<sup>−3</sup>, respectively).

Gene expression kinetics governs stimulus-specific decoration of the <i>Salmonella</i> outer membrane
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A is the innermost component of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecules that occupy the outer leaflet of the outer membrane in Gram-negative bacteria. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A is recognized by the host immune system and targeted by cationic antimicrobial compounds. In <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhimurium, the phosphates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A are chemically modified by enzymes encoded by targets of the transcriptional regulator PmrA. These modifications increase resistance to the cationic peptide antibiotic polymyxin B by reducing the negative charge of the LPS. We report the mechanism by which <i>Salmonella</i> produces different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A profiles when PmrA is activated by low Mg<sup>2+</sup> versus a mildly acidic pH. Low Mg<sup>2+</sup> favored modification of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A phosphates with 4-amino-4-deoxy-<sc>l</sc>-aminoarabinose (<sc>l</sc>-Ara4N) by activating the regulatory protein PhoP, which initially increased the LPS negative charge by promoting transcription of <i>lpxT</i>, encoding an enzyme that adds an additional phosphate group to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A. Later, PhoP activated PmrA posttranslationally, resulting in expression of PmrA-activated genes, including those encoding the LpxT inhibitor PmrR and enzymes responsible for the incorporation of <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N. By contrast, a mildly acidic pH favored modification of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A phosphates with a mixture of <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N and phosphoethanolamine (pEtN) by simultaneously inducing the PhoP-activated <i>lpxT</i> and PmrA-activated <i>pmrR</i> genes. Although <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N reduces the LPS negative charge more than does pEtN, modification of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A phosphates solely with <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N required a prior transient increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A negative charge. Our findings demonstrate how bacteria tailor their cell surface to different stresses, such as those faced inside phagocytes.</p>

Bioenergetics through thick and thin
<p>The cells in all biological systems are composed of a limited number of molecular constituents, mainly proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s. Of these, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s tend to receive the shortest shrift, as they are typically considered to be merely the building blocks of membranes that provide a scaffold in which the “important” molecules, such as enzymes or signaling proteins, reside. In recent years, and with the advent of advanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>omics techniques, we have learned that “a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>” is simply not true, and that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> composition of membranes can have profound effects on the behavior and activity of its resident macromolecules. For example, some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, such as members of the phosphatidylinositol family, are important signaling molecules. However, what is less appreciated is that the physical composition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> membranes can have profound effects on cellular behavior as well. On page 1186 of this issue, Budin <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) use the Gram-negative bacterium <i>Escherichia coli</i> and the budding yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> as model systems to show that the fluidity of a membrane, as determined by its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> composition, can have huge effects on the efficiency of aerobic energy production (respiration) by the highly hydrophobic, membrane-embedded, oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) system.</p>

Revisiting the Algal “Chloroplast Lipid Droplet”: The Absence of an Entity That Is Unlikely to Exist
<p>The precise localization of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplets and the metabolic pathways associated with oil production are crucial to the engineering of microalgae for biofuel production. Several studies have reported detecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplets within the chloroplast of the microalga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, which accumulates considerable amounts of triacylglycerol and starch within the cell under nitrogen deprivation or high-light stress conditions. Starch undoubtedly accumulates within the chloroplast, but there have been debates on the localization of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplets, which are cytosolic organelles in other organisms. Although it is impossible to prove an absence, we tried to repeat experiments that previously indicated the presence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplets in chloroplasts. Here, we present microscopic results showing no evidence for the presence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplets within the chloroplast stroma, even though some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplets existed in close association with the chloroplast or were largely engulfed by the chloroplasts. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplets are cytosolic structures, distinct from the plastoglobules present in the chloroplast stroma. These results not only contrast with the old ideas but also point out that what were previously thought to be chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplets are likely to be embedded within chloroplast invaginations in association with the outer envelope of the chloroplast without intervention of the endoplasmic reticulum. These findings point to the intriguing possibility of a tight metabolic flow from the chloroplast to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplet through a close association rather than direct contact of both organelles.</p>

Spatial and Temporal Mapping of Key Lipid Species in <i>Brassica napus</i> Seeds
<p>The regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> synthesis in oil seeds is still not fully understood. Oilseed rape (<i>Brassica napus</i>) is the third most productive vegetable oil crop on the global market; therefore, increasing our understanding of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> accumulation in oilseed rape seeds is of great economic, as well as intellectual, importance. Matrix-assisted laser/desorption ionization-mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) is a technique that allows the mapping of metabolites directly onto intact biological tissues, giving a spatial context to metabolism. We have used MALDI-MSI to study the spatial distribution of two major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> species, triacylglycerols and phosphatidylcholines. A dramatic, heterogenous landscape of molecular species was revealed, demonstrating significantly different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> compositions between the various tissue types within the seed. The embryonic axis was found to be particularly enriched in palmitic acid, while the seed coat/aleurone layer accumulated vaccenic, linoleic, and α-linoleic acids. Furthermore, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> composition of the inner and outer cotyledons differed from each other, a remarkable discovery given the supposed identical functionality of these two tissues. Triacylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine molecular species distribution was analyzed through a developmental time series covering early seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> accumulation to seed maturity. The spatial patterning of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> molecular species did not vary significantly during seed development. Data gathered using MALDI-MSI was verified through gas chromatography analysis of dissected seeds. The distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> distribution profiles observed imply differential regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> metabolism between the different tissue types of the seed. Further understanding of this differential regulation will enhance efforts to improve oilseed rape productivity and quality.</p>

Glycerolipid Characterization and Nutrient Deprivation-Associated Changes in the Green Picoalga <i>Ostreococcus tauri</i>
<p>The picoalga <i>Ostreococcus tauri</i> is a minimal photosynthetic eukaryote that has been used as a model system. <i>O. tauri</i> is known to efficiently produce docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). We provide a comprehensive study of the glycero<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>ome of <i>O. tauri</i> and validate this species as model for related picoeukaryotes. <i>O. tauri</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s displayed unique features that combined traits from the green and the chromalveolate lineages. The betaine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> diacylglyceryl-hydroxymethyl-trimethyl-β-alanine and phosphatidyldimethylpropanethiol, both hallmarks of chromalveolates, were identified as presumed extraplastidial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s. DHA was confined to these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, while plastidial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s of prokaryotic type were characterized by the overwhelming presence of ω-3 C18 polyunsaturated fatty acids (FAs), 18:5 being restricted to galacto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s. C16:4, an FA typical of green microalgae galacto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, also was a major component of <i>O. tauri</i> extraplastidial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, while the 16:4-coenzyme A (CoA) species was not detected. Triacylglycerols (TAGs) displayed the complete panel of FAs, and many species exhibited combinations of FAs diagnostic for plastidial and extraplastidial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s. Importantly, under nutrient deprivation, 16:4 and ω-3 C18 polyunsaturated FAs accumulated into de novo synthesized TAGs while DHA-TAG species remained rather stable, indicating an increased contribution of FAs of plastidial origin to TAG synthesis. Nutrient deprivation further severely down-regulated the conversion of 18:3 to 18:4, resulting in obvious inversion of the 18:3/18:4 ratio in plastidial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, TAGs, as well as acyl-CoAs. The fine-tuned and dynamic regulation of the 18:3/18:4 ratio suggested an important physiological role of these FAs in photosynthetic membranes. Acyl position in structural and storage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s together with acyl-CoA analysis further help to determine mechanisms possibly involved in glycero<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> synthesis.</p>

Genomics and evolution of protein phosphatases
<p>Protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphatas</span></strong>es are the essential opposite to protein kinases; together, these enzymes regulate all protein phosphorylation and most cellular processes. To better understand the global roles of protein phosphorylation, we cataloged the human protein phosphatome, composed of 189 known and predicted human protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphatas</span></strong>e genes. We also identified 79 protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphatas</span></strong>e pseudogenes or retrogenes, some of which may have residual function. We traced the origin and diversity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphatas</span></strong>es by building protein phosphatomes for eight other eukaryotes, from the protist <i>Dictyostelium</i> to the sea urchin. We classified protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphatas</span></strong>es from all nine species into a hierarchy of 10 protein folds, 21 families, and 178 subfamilies. We found that >80% of the 101 human subfamilies were conserved across the animal kingdom, but show substantial differences in evolution, including losses and expansions of individual subfamilies and changes in accessory domains. Protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphatas</span></strong>es show similar evolutionary dynamics to those of kinases, with substantial losses in major model organisms. Sequence analysis predicts that 26 human protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphatas</span></strong>e domains are catalytically disabled and that this disability is mostly conserved across orthologs. This genomic and evolutionary perspective on protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphatas</span></strong>es provides a framework for global analysis of protein phosphorylation throughout the animal kingdom.</p>

Plastic waste associated with disease on coral reefs

We assessed the influence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong> waste on disease risk in 124,000 reef-building corals from 159 reefs in the Asia-Pacific region. The likelihood of disease increases from 4% to 89% when corals are in contact with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>. Structurally complex corals are eight times more likely to be affected by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>, suggesting that microhabitats for reef-associated organisms and valuable fisheries will be disproportionately affected. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong> levels on coral reefs correspond to estimates of terrestrial mismanaged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong> waste entering the ocean.

Network Analysis Reveals a Role for Salicylic Acid Pathway Components in Shade Avoidance
<p>Plants have sophisticated mechanisms for sensing neighbor shade. To maximize their ability to compete for light, plants respond to shade through enhanced elongation and physiological changes. The shade avoidance response affects many different organs and growth stages, yet the signaling pathways underlying this response have mostly been studied in seedlings. We assayed transcriptome changes in response to shade across a 2-d time course in the wild type and 12 Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants. The resulting temporal map of transcriptional responses to shade defines early and late responses in adult plants, enabling us to determine connections between key signaling genes and downstream responses. We found a pervasive and unexpectedly strong connection between shade avoidance and genes related to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salicyl</span></strong>ic acid, suggesting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salicyl</span></strong>ic acid signaling to be an important shade avoidance growth regulator. We tested this connection and found that several mutants disrupting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salicyl</span></strong>ic acid levels or signaling were defective in shade avoidance. The effect of these mutations on shade avoidance was specific to petiole elongation; neither hypocotyl nor flowering time responses were altered, thereby defining important stage-specific differences in the downstream shade avoidance signaling pathway. Shade treatment did not change <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salicyl</span></strong>ic acid levels, indicating that the mediation of shade avoidance by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salicyl</span></strong>ic acid is not dependent on the modulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salicyl</span></strong>ic acid levels. These results demonstrate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salicyl</span></strong>ic acid pathway genes also are key components of petiole shade avoidance.</p>

Starch Deficiency Enhances Lipid Biosynthesis and Turnover in Leaves
<p>Starch and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s represent two major forms of carbon and energy storage in plants and play central roles in diverse cellular processes. However, whether and how starch and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> metabolic pathways interact to regulate metabolism and growth are poorly understood. Here, we show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s can partially compensate for the lack of function of transient starch during normal growth and development in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Disruption of starch synthesis resulted in a significant increase in fatty acid synthesis via posttranslational regulation of the plastidic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acet</span></strong>yl-coenzyme A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carboxyl</span></strong>ase and a concurrent increase in the synthesis and turnover of membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s and triacylglycerol. Genetic analysis showed that blocking fatty acid peroxisomal β-oxidation, the sole pathway for metabolic breakdown of fatty acids in plants, significantly compromised or stunted the growth and development of mutants defective in starch synthesis under long days or short days, respectively. We also found that the combined disruption of starch synthesis and fatty acid turnover resulted in increased accumulation of membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, triacylglycerol, and soluble sugars and altered fatty acid flux between the two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> biosynthetic pathways compartmentalized in either the chloroplast or the endoplasmic reticulum. Collectively, our findings provide insight into the role of fatty acid β-oxidation and the regulatory network controlling fatty acid synthesis, and they reveal the mechanistic basis by which starch and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> metabolic pathways interact and undergo cross talk to modulate carbon allocation, energy homeostasis, and plant growth.</p>

Inflammation, necrosis, and the kinase RIP3 are key mediators of AAG-dependent alkylation-induced retinal degeneration
<p>DNA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alkyl</span></strong>ating agents are commonly used to kill cancer cells, but the base excision repair (BER) pathway they trigger can also produce toxic intermediates that cause tissue damage, such as retinal degeneration (RD). Apoptosis, a process of programmed cell death, is assumed to be the main mechanism of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alkyl</span></strong>ation-induced photoreceptor (PR) cell death in RD. Here, we studied the involvement of necroptosis (another programmed cell death process) and inflammation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alkyl</span></strong>ation-induced RD. Male mice exposed to a methylating agent exhibited a reduced number of PR cell rows, active gliosis, and cytokine induction and macrophage infiltration in the retina. Dying PRs exhibited a necrotic morphology, increased 8-hydroxyguanosine abundance (an oxidative damage marker), and overexpression of the necroptosis-associated genes <i>Rip1</i> and <i>Rip3</i>. The activity of PARP1, which mediates BER, cell death, and inflammation, was increased in PR cells and associated with the release of proinflammatory chemokine HMGB1 from PR nuclei. Mice lacking the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 exhibited more severe RD, whereas deficiency of RIP3 (also known as RIPK3) conferred partial protection. Female mice were partially protected from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alkyl</span></strong>ation-induced RD, showing reduced necroptosis and inflammation compared to males. PRs in mice lacking the BER-initiating DNA glycosylase AAG did not exhibit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alkyl</span></strong>ation-induced necroptosis or inflammation. Our findings show that AAG-initiated BER at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alkyl</span></strong>ated DNA bases induces sex-dependent RD primarily by triggering necroptosis and activating an inflammatory response that amplifies the original damage and, furthermore, reveal new potential targets to prevent this side effect of chemotherapy.</p>

IRE1α prevents hepatic steatosis by processing and promoting the degradation of select microRNAs
<p>Obesity or a high-fat diet represses the endoribonuclease activity of inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α), a transducer of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in cells under endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. An impaired UPR is associated with hepatic steatosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is caused by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> accumulation in the liver. We found that IRE1α was critical to maintaining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> homeostasis in the liver by repressing the biogenesis of microRNAs (miRNAs) that regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> mobilization. In mice fed normal chow, the endoribonuclease function of IRE1α processed a subset of precursor miRNAs in the liver, including those of the miR-200 and miR-34 families, such that IRE1α promoted their degradation through the process of regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD). A high-fat diet in mice or hepatic steatosis in patients was associated with the S-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrosyl</span></strong>ation of IRE1α and inactivation of its endoribonuclease activity. This resulted in an increased abundance of these miRNA families in the liver and, consequently, a decreased abundance of their targets, which included peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor α (PPARα) and the de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acet</span></strong>ylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), regulators of fatty acid oxidation and tri<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glycerid</span></strong>e lipolysis. IRE1α deficiency exacerbated hepatic steatosis in mice. The abundance of the miR-200 and miR-34 families was also increased in cultured, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>-overloaded hepatocytes and in the livers of patients with hepatic steatosis. Our findings reveal a mechanism by which IRE1α maintains <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> homeostasis through its regulation of miRNAs, a regulatory pathway distinct from the canonical IRE1α-UPR pathway under acute ER stress.</p>

Nitrosylation of GAPDH augments pathological tau acetylation upon exposure to amyloid-β
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acet</span></strong>ylation of the microtubule-associated protein tau promotes its polymerization into neurofibrillary tangles that are implicated in the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD).

We found that NO production and tau <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acet</span></strong>ylation at Lys<sup>280</sup> occurred in the brain tissue in mice and in cultured mouse cortical neurons in response to exposure to amyloid-β<sub>1–42</sub> (Aβ<sub>1–42</sub>), a peptide that is also implicated in AD.

Restoring tumor suppression
<p>Many oncogenes and tumor suppressors that are mutated during cancer development act as enzymatic switches that phosphorylate (kinases) or dephosphorylate (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphatas</span></strong>es) substrates. Much attention has focused on therapeutically inhibiting oncogenic kinases that are activated by mutation. However, there has been less focus on targeting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphatas</span></strong>es, despite their importance in cancer development. The tumor suppressor PTEN (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphatas</span></strong>e and tensin homolog on chromosome 10) is the most frequently inactivated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphatas</span></strong>e in human cancer (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). The loss of PTEN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphatas</span></strong>e activity increases downstream activity of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)–AKT signaling pathway (<i>3</i>, <i>4</i>). Preclinical studies have shown that targeting the PI3K-AKT pathway reduces tumor growth when PTEN is inactivated (<i>5</i>). However, many PTEN mutant tumors are resistant to such therapies. On page 651 of this issue, Lee <i>et al.</i> (<i>6</i>) activate PTEN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphatas</span></strong>e by inhibiting a newly described inhibitory system and thereby reduce PI3K-AKT signaling and tumor growth in mice.</p>

The Ancient Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase Signaling System Is a Master Regulator of Energy and Carbon Metabolism in Algae
<p>Algae undergo a complete metabolic transformation under stress by arresting cell growth, inducing autophagy and hyper-accumulating biofuel precursors such as triacylglycerols and starch. However, the regulatory mechanisms behind this stress-induced transformation are still unclear. Here, we use biochemical, mutational, and “omics” approaches to demonstrate that PI3K signaling mediates the homeostasis of energy molecules and influences carbon metabolism in algae. In <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, the inhibition and knockdown (KD) of algal class III PI3K led to significantly decreased cell growth, altered cell morphology, and higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> and starch contents. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> profiling of wild-type and PI3K KD lines showed significantly reduced membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> breakdown under nitrogen starvation (−N) in the KD. RNA-seq and network analyses showed that under −N conditions, the KD line carried out lipogenesis rather than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> hydrolysis by initiating de novo fatty acid biosynthesis, which was supported by tri<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carboxyl</span></strong>ic acid cycle down-regulation and via <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acet</span></strong>yl-CoA synthesis from glycolysis. Remarkably, autophagic responses did not have primacy over inositide signaling in algae, unlike in mammals and vascular plants. The mutant displayed a fundamental shift in intracellular energy flux, analogous to that in tumor cells. The high free fatty acid levels and reduced mitochondrial ATP generation led to decreased cell viability. These results indicate that the PI3K signal transduction pathway is the metabolic gatekeeper restraining biofuel yields, thus maintaining fitness and viability under stress in algae. This study demonstrates the existence of homeostasis between starch and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> synthesis controlled by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> signaling in algae and expands our understanding of such processes, with biotechnological and evolutionary implications.</p>

Mechanisms of Phosphorus Acquisition and Lipid Class Remodeling under P Limitation in a Marine Microalga
<p>Molecular mechanisms of phosphorus (P) limitation are of great interest for understanding algal production in aquatic ecosystems. Previous studies point to P limitation-induced changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> composition. As, in microalgae, the molecular mechanisms of this specific P stress adaptation remain unresolved, we reveal a detailed phospho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>-recycling scheme in <i>Nannochloropsis oceanica</i> and describe important P acquisition genes based on highly corresponding transcriptome and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>ome data. Initial responses to P limitation showed increased expression of genes involved in P uptake and an expansion of the P substrate spectrum based on purple acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphatas</span></strong>es. Increase in P trafficking displayed a rearrangement between compartments by supplying P to the chloroplast and carbon to the cytosol for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> synthesis. We propose a novel phospho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>-recycling scheme for algae that leads to the rapid reduction of phospho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s and synthesis of the P-free <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> classes. P mobilization through membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> degradation is mediated mainly by two glycerophosphoryldiester phosphodiesterases and three patatin-like phospholipases A on the transcriptome level. To compensate for low phospho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s in exponential growth, <i>N. oceanica</i> synthesized sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol and diacylglyceroltrimethylhomoserine. In this study, it was shown that an <i>N. oceanica</i> strain has a unique repertoire of genes that facilitate P acquisition and the degradation of phospho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s compared with other stramenopiles. The novel phospho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>-recycling scheme opens new avenues for metabolic engineering of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> composition in algae.</p>

Carnosic Acid and Carnosol, Two Major Antioxidants of Rosemary, Act through Different Mechanisms
<p>Carnosic acid, a phenolic diterpene specific to the Lamiaceae family, is highly abundant in rosemary (<i>Rosmarinus officinalis</i>). Despite numerous industrial and medicinal/pharmaceutical applications of its antioxidative features, this compound in planta and its antioxidant mechanism have received little attention, except a few studies of rosemary plants under natural conditions. In vitro analyses, using high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet and luminescence imaging, revealed that carnosic acid and its major oxidized derivative, carnosol, protect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s from oxidation. Both compounds preserved linolenic acid and monogalactosyldiacylglycerol from singlet oxygen and from hydroxyl radical. When applied exogenously, they were both able to protect thylakoid membranes prepared from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves against <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> peroxidation. Different levels of carnosic acid and carnosol in two contrasting rosemary varieties correlated with tolerance to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> peroxidation. Upon reactive oxygen species (ROS) oxidation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, carnosic acid was consumed and oxidized into various derivatives, including into carnosol, while carnosol resisted, suggesting that carnosic acid is a chemical quencher of ROS. The antioxidative function of carnosol relies on another mechanism, occurring directly in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> oxidation process. Under oxidative conditions that did not involve ROS generation, carnosol inhibited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> peroxidation, contrary to carnosic acid. Using spin probes and electron paramagnetic resonance detection, we confirmed that carnosic acid, rather than carnosol, is a ROS quencher. Various oxidized derivatives of carnosic acid were detected in rosemary leaves in low light, indicating chronic oxidation of this compound, and accumulated in plants exposed to stress conditions, in parallel with a loss of carnosic acid, confirming that chemical quenching of ROS by carnosic acid takes place in planta.</p>

A Central Role for Triacylglycerol in Membrane Lipid Breakdown, Fatty Acid <i>β</i>-Oxidation, and Plant Survival under Extended Darkness
<p>Neutral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> metabolism is a key aspect of intracellular homeostasis and energy balance and plays a vital role in cell survival under adverse conditions, including nutrient deprivation in yeast and mammals, but the role of triacylglycerol (TAG) metabolism in plant stress response remains largely unknown. By thoroughly characterizing mutants defective in SUGAR-DEPENDENT1 (SDP1) triacylglycerol lipase or PEROXISOMAL ABC TRANSPORTER 1 (PXA1), here we show that TAG is a key intermediate in the mobilization of fatty acids from membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s for peroxisomal β-oxidation under prolonged dark treatment. Disruption of SDP1 increased TAG accumulation in cytosolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplets and markedly enhanced plant tolerance to extended darkness. We demonstrate that blocking TAG hydrolysis enhances plant tolerance to dark treatment via two distinct mechanisms. In <i>pxa1</i> mutants, in which free fatty acids accumulated rapidly under extended darkness, SDP1 disruption resulted in a marked decrease in levels of cytotoxic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> intermediates such as free fatty acids and phosphatidic acid, suggesting a buffer function of TAG accumulation against lipotoxicity under fatty acid overload. In the wild type, in which free fatty acids remained low and unchanged under dark treatment, disruption of SDP1 caused a decrease in reactive oxygen species production and hence the level of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> peroxidation, indicating a role of TAG in protection against oxidative damage. Overall, our findings reveal a crucial role for TAG metabolism in membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> breakdown, fatty acid turnover, and plant survival under extended darkness.</p>

Essential roles of AMPA receptor GluA1 phosphorylation and presynaptic HCN channels in fast-acting antidepressant responses of ketamine
<p>Although the molecular mechanism is not clear, the clinically tested drug ketamine has rapid antidepressant action that does not require the multiple weeks of treatment needed for other antidepressant drugs to have an effect. We showed that ketamine potentiated Schaffer collateral–CA1 cell excitatory synaptic transmission in hippocampal slice preparations from rodents and enhanced the phosphorylation of the GluA1 subunit on Ser<sup>845</sup> of the AMPA-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate receptor in the hippocampal area CA1. These effects persisted when γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors were pharmacologically blocked. Ketamine reduced behavioral despair in wild-type mice but had no effect in GluA1 S845A knock-in mutant mice. Presynaptic (CA3 pyramidal cell), but not postsynaptic (CA1 pyramidal cell), deletion of <i>N</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aspart</span></strong>ate (NMDA)–type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate receptors eliminated the ketamine-induced enhancement of excitatory synaptic transmission in hippocampal slices and the antidepressant actions of ketamine in mice. The synaptic and behavioral actions of ketamine were completely occluded by inhibition or deletion of the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide–gated channel 1 (HCN1). Our results implicate presynaptic NMDA receptor inhibition followed by reduced activity of presynaptic HCN1 channels, which would result in an increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate release and postsynaptic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate receptor activity, as a mechanism of ketamine action.

A lipase-independent pathway of lipid release and immune modulation by adipocytes

We found that adipocytes release exosome-sized, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>-filled vesicles (AdExos) that become a source of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> for local macrophages. Adipose tissue from lean mice released ~1% of its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> content per day via exosomes ex vivo, a rate that more than doubles in obese animals. AdExos and associated factors were sufficient to induce in vitro differentiation of bone marrow precursors into adipose tissue macrophage–like cells. Thus, AdExos are both an alternative pathway of local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> release and a mechanism by which parenchymal cells can modulate tissue macrophage differentiation and function.</p>

Lipid-filled vesicles modulate macrophages
<p>Adipose (fat) tissue is a major site of energy storage that responds to fluctuations in nutrient availability to maintain systemic metabolic homeostasis (<i>1</i>). Adipocytes take up circulating free fatty acids (FFAs) from the blood and store them in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplets in response to increased insulin concentrations (which occur after feeding); they then hydrolyze <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s to release FFAs under conditions of nutrient deprivation. A variety of other cell types are present within adipose tissue, including fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs). In addition to their roles in immune surveillance and clearance of cellular debris, ATMs are important for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> buffering and regulate adipose tissue function in both healthy and diseased states (<i>2</i>). Owing to the rising global incidence of chronic obesity and associated health issues, there is renewed interest in understanding how adipose tissue functions in physiological and pathological settings. On page 989 of this issue, Flaherty <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) report that adipocytes communicate with ATMs by releasing a distinct class of extracellular vesicles (EVs) called adipocyte-derived exosomes (AdExos), which are loaded with fat and appear to be derived directly from adipocyte <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplets. The uptake of AdExos by resident ATMs allows for the direct transfer of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, revealing a form of intercellular communication and nutrient exchange with important implications for obesity-associated pathologies.</p>

Viscous control of cellular respiration by membrane lipid composition
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> composition determines the physical properties of biological membranes and can vary substantially between and within organisms. We describe a specific role for the viscosity of energy-transducing membranes in cellular respiration. Engineering of fatty acid biosynthesis in <i>Escherichia coli</i> allowed us to titrate inner membrane viscosity across a 10-fold range by controlling the abundance of unsaturated or branched <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s. These fluidizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s tightly controlled respiratory metabolism, an effect that can be explained with a quantitative model of the electron transport chain (ETC) that features diffusion-coupled reactions between enzymes and electron carriers (quinones). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> unsaturation also modulated mitochondrial respiration in engineered budding yeast strains. Thus, diffusion in the ETC may serve as an evolutionary constraint for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> composition in respiratory membranes.</p>

CRMP2-binding compound, edonerpic maleate, accelerates motor function recovery from brain damage

Fatty acids in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are synthesized by the host plant
<p>Plants form beneficial associations with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, which facilitate nutrient acquisition from the soil. In return, the fungi receive organic carbon from the plants.

An Iron-Activated Citrate Transporter, MtMATE67, Is Required for Symbiotic Nitrogen Fixation<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Iron (Fe) is an essential micronutrient for symbiotic nitrogen fixation in legume nodules, where it is required for the activity of bacterial nitrogenase, plant leghemoglobin, respiratory oxidases, and other Fe proteins in both organisms. Fe solubility and transport within and between plant tissues is facilitated by organic chelators, such as nicotianamine and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">citrat</span></strong>e. We have characterized a nodule-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">citrat</span></strong>e transporter of the multidrug and toxic compound extrusion family, MtMATE67 of <i>Medicago truncatula</i>. The MtMATE67 gene was induced early during nodule development and expressed primarily in the invasion zone of mature nodules. The MtMATE67 protein was localized to the plasma membrane of nodule cells and also the symbiosome membrane surrounding bacteroids in infected cells. In oocytes, MtMATE67 transported <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">citrat</span></strong>e out of cells in an Fe-activated manner. Loss of <i>MtMATE67</i> gene function resulted in accumulation of Fe in the apoplasm of nodule cells and a substantial decrease in symbiotic nitrogen fixation and plant growth. Taken together, the results point to a primary role of MtMATE67 in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">citrat</span></strong>e efflux from nodule cells in response to an Fe signal. This efflux is necessary to ensure Fe(III) solubility and mobility in the apoplasm and uptake into nodule cells. Likewise, MtMATE67-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">citrat</span></strong>e transport into the symbiosome space would increase the solubility and availability of Fe(III) for rhizobial bacteroids.</p>

Protoplast Swelling and Hypocotyl Growth Depend on Different Auxin Signaling Pathways
<p>Members of the TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE1/AUXIN SIGNALING F-BOX PROTEIN (TIR1/AFB) family are known auxin receptors. To analyze the possible receptor function of AUXIN BINDING PROTEIN1 (ABP1), an auxin receptor currently under debate, we performed different approaches. We performed a pharmacological approach using α-(2,4-dimethylphenylethyl-2-oxo)-indole-3-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acet</span></strong>ic acid (auxinole), α-(phenylethyl-2-oxo)-indole-3-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acet</span></strong>ic acid (PEO-IAA), and 5-fluoroindole-3-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acet</span></strong>ic acid (5-F-IAA) to discriminate between ABP1- and TIR1/AFB-mediated processes in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We used a peptide of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carboxyl</span></strong>-terminal region of AtABP1 as a tool. We performed mutant analysis with the null alleles of <i>ABP1</i>, <i>abp1-c1</i> and <i>abp1-TD1</i>, and the TILLING mutant <i>abp1-5</i>. We employed Coimbra, an accession that exhibits an amino acid exchange in the auxin-binding domain of ABP1. We measured either volume changes of single hypocotyl protoplasts or hypocotyl growth, both at high temporal resolution. 5-F-IAA selectively activated the TIR1/AFB pathway but did not induce protoplast swelling; instead, it showed auxin activity in the hypocotyl growth test. In contrast, PEO-IAA induced an auxin-like swelling response but no hypocotyl growth. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carboxyl</span></strong>-terminal peptide of AtABP1 induced an auxin-like swelling response. In the <i>ABP1</i>-related mutants and Coimbra, no auxin-induced protoplast swelling occurred. ABP1 seems to be involved in mediating rapid auxin-induced protoplast swelling, but it is not involved in the control of rapid auxin-induced growth.</p>

Two Membrane-Anchored Aspartic Proteases Contribute to Pollen and Ovule Development
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aspart</span></strong>ic proteases are a class of proteolytic enzymes with conserved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aspart</span></strong>ate residues, which are implicated in protein processing, maturation, and degradation. Compared with yeast and animals, plants possess a larger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aspart</span></strong>ic protease family. However, little is known about most of these enzymes. Here, we characterized two Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) putative glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aspart</span></strong>ic protease genes, <i>A36</i> and <i>A39</i>, which are highly expressed in pollen and pollen tubes. <i>a36</i> and <i>a36 a39</i> mutants display significantly reduced pollen activity. Transmission electron microscopy and terminal-deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling assays further revealed that the unviable pollen in <i>a36 a39</i> may undergo unanticipated apoptosis-like programmed cell death. The degeneration of female gametes also occurred in <i>a36 a39</i>. Aniline Blue staining, scanning electron microscopy, and semi in vitro guidance assays indicated that the micropylar guidance of pollen tubes is significantly compromised in <i>a36 a39</i>. A36 and A39 that were fused with green fluorescent protein are localized to the plasma membrane and display punctate cytosolic localization and colocalize with the GPI-anchored protein COBRA-LIKE10. Furthermore, in <i>a36 a39</i>, the abundance of highly methylesterified homogalacturonans and xyloglucans was increased significantly in the apical pollen tube wall. These results indicate that A36 and A39, two putative GPI-anchored <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aspart</span></strong>ic proteases, play important roles in plant reproduction in Arabidopsis.</p>

The Nonspecific Lipid Transfer Protein AtLtpI-4 Is Involved in Suberin Formation of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> Crown Galls
<p>Nonspecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> transfer proteins reversibly bind different types of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> molecules in a hydrophobic cavity. They facilitate phospho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> transfer between membranes in vitro, play a role in cuticle and possibly in suberin formation, and might be involved in plant pathogen defense signaling. This study focuses on the role of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> transfer protein <i>AtLTPI-4</i> in crown gall development. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) crown gall tumors, which develop upon infection with the virulent <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i> strain C58, highly expressed <i>AtLTPI-4</i>. Crown galls of the <i>atltpI-4</i> loss-of-function mutant were much smaller compared with those of wild-type plants. The gene expression pattern and localization of the protein to the plasma membrane pointed to a function of AtLTPI-4 in cell wall suberization. Since Arabidopsis crown galls are covered by a suberin-containing periderm instead of a cuticle, we analyzed the suberin composition of crown galls and found a reduction in the amounts of long-chain fatty acids (C<sub>18:0</sub>) in the <i>atltpI-4</i> mutant. To demonstrate the impact of AtLtpI-4 on extracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> composition, we expressed the protein in Arabidopsis epidermis cells. This led to a significant increase in the very-long-chain fatty acids C<sub>24</sub> and C<sub>26</sub> in the cuticular wax fraction. Homology modeling and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>-protein-overlay assays showed that AtLtpI-4 protein can bind these very-long-chain fatty acids. Thus, AtLtpI-4 protein may facilitate the transfer of long-chain as well as very-long-chain fatty acids into the apoplast, depending on the cell type in which it is expressed. In crown galls, which endogenously express AtLtpI-4, it is involved in suberin formation.</p>

Physiological basis of starvation resistance in <i>Drosophila leontia</i>: analysis of sexual dimorphism
<p>Geographically varying starvation stress has often been considered as a natural selector that constrains between-population differences for starvation resistance (SR) in <i>Drosophila</i> species. On the Indian subcontinent, a dozen <i>Drosophila</i> species have shown clinal variations in SR across latitude, but the evolved physiological basis of such contrasting adaptations is largely unknown. In the present study, I untangled the physiological basis of sex-specific as well as between-population divergence for SR in <i>D. leontia</i>, collected across a latitudinal transect of the Indian subcontinent (11°45′–31°19′N). Secondly, I tested the assumptions that hardening to starvation stress facilitates an increased survival under subsequent lethal levels of starvation, and such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong> effects differ between the sexes. I observed several interesting results. In contrast to a steeper cline of starvation-related traits with latitude in females, a shallower gradient was observed for males. Females stored higher (~1.3-fold) dry-mass-specific levels of body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s and glycogen contents, and utilized these both of these energy resources under starvation stress, whereas the starved males metabolized only body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s as a source of energy. Conversely, the rate of body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> utilization and threshold need were considerably higher in females as compared with males. Between-population differences were significant for storage levels of energy reserves only, but not for other avenues (rate of metabolite utilization and threshold need) of SR for both sexes. These findings indicate that multiple pathways shape the physiological basis of sexual dimorphism for SR in <i>D. leontia</i>. Further, single or multiple bouts of starvation hardening conferred an increased longevity (~4–9 h; <i>P</i><0.001) under subsequent lethal levels of starvation stress for females only, and such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong> responses were consistent with a decrease in rate of metabolite utilization. Nevertheless, between-population effects were non-significant for absolute hardening capacity (AHC=<i>K</i><sub>SR</sub>–C). Altogether, these findings suggest that similar evolutionary constraints have resulted in divergent genetic as well as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong> responses to evolve adaptations under starvation stress, and account for the observed sexual dimorphism for basal SR in <i>D. leontia</i>.</p>

Hippocampal mGluR1-dependent long-term potentiation requires NAADP-mediated acidic store Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling
<p>Acidic organelles, such as endosomes and lysosomes, store Ca<sup>2+</sup> that is released in response to intracellular increases in the second messenger nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP). In neurons, NAADP and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling contribute to synaptic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity, a process of activity-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) [or, alternatively, long-term depression (LTD)] of synaptic strength and neuronal transmission that is critical for neuronal function and memory formation. We explored the function of and mechanisms regulating acidic Ca<sup>2+</sup> store signaling in murine hippocampal neurons. We found that metabotropic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate receptor 1 (mGluR1) was coupled to NAADP signaling that elicited Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from acidic stores. In turn, this released Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated mGluR1-dependent LTP by transiently inhibiting SK-type K<sup>+</sup> channels, possibly through the activation of protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphatas</span></strong>e 2A. Genetically removing two-pore channels (TPCs), which are endolysosomal-specific ion channels, switched the polarity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity from LTP to LTD, indicating the importance of specific receptor store coupling and providing mechanistic insight into how mGluR1 can produce both synaptic potentiation and synaptic depression.</p>

Restoring auditory cortex plasticity in adult mice by restricting thalamic adenosine signaling

The Phosphate Fast-Responsive Genes <i>PECP1</i> and <i>PPsPase1</i> Affect Phosphocholine and Phosphoethanolamine Content<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Phosphate starvation-mediated induction of the HAD-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphatas</span></strong>es PPsPase1 (AT1G73010) and PECP1 (AT1G17710) has been reported in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). However, little is known about their in vivo function or impact on plant responses to nutrient deficiency. The preferences of PPsPase1 and PECP1 for different substrates have been studied in vitro but require confirmation in planta. Here, we examined the in vivo function of both enzymes using a reverse genetics approach. We demonstrated that PPsPase1 and PECP1 affect plant phosphocholine and phosphoethanolamine content, but not the pyrophosphate-related phenotypes. These observations suggest that the enzymes play a similar role in planta related to the recycling of polar heads from membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s that is triggered during phosphate starvation. Altering the expression of the genes encoding these enzymes had no effect on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> composition, possibly due to compensation by other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> recycling pathways triggered during phosphate starvation. Furthermore, our results indicated that PPsPase1 and PECP1 do not influence phosphate homeostasis, since the inactivation of these genes had no effect on phosphate content or on the induction of molecular markers related to phosphate starvation. A combination of transcriptomics and imaging analyses revealed that PPsPase1 and PECP1 display a highly dynamic expression pattern that closely mirrors the phosphate status. This temporal dynamism, combined with the wide range of induction levels, broad expression, and lack of a direct effect on Pi content and regulation, makes PPsPase1 and PECP1 useful molecular markers of the phosphate starvation response.</p>

Genetic Control of Plasticity in Root Morphology and Anatomy of Rice in Response to Water Deficit
<p>Elucidating the genetic control of rooting behavior under water-deficit stress is essential to breed climate-robust rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) cultivars.

We then carried out a genome-wide association analysis on these traits and their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity, using 45,608 high-quality single-nucleotide polymorphisms. One hundred four significant loci were detected for these traits under control conditions, 106 were detected under water-deficit stress, and 76 were detected for trait <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity. We predicted 296 (control), 284 (water-deficit stress), and 233 (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity) a priori candidate genes within linkage disequilibrium blocks for these loci. We identified key a priori candidate genes regulating root growth and development and relevant alleles that, upon validation, can help improve rice adaptation to water-deficit stress.</p>

Constitutive Expression of Arabidopsis <i>SMALL AUXIN UP RNA19</i> (<i>SAUR19</i>) in Tomato Confers Auxin-Independent Hypocotyl Elongation<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The plant hormone indole-3-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acet</span></strong>ic acid (IAA or auxin) mediates the elongation growth of shoot tissues by promoting cell expansion. According to the acid growth theory proposed in the 1970s, auxin activates plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases (PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases) to facilitate cell expansion by both loosening the cell wall through acidification and promoting solute uptake. Mechanistically, however, this process is poorly understood. Recent findings in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) have demonstrated that auxin-induced <i>SMALL AUXIN UP RNA</i> (<i>SAUR</i>) genes promote elongation growth and play a key role in PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activation by inhibiting PP2C.D family protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphatas</span></strong>es. Here, we extend these findings by demonstrating that SAUR proteins also inhibit tomato PP2C.D family <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphatas</span></strong>es and that AtSAUR19 overexpression in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) confers the same suite of phenotypes as previously reported for Arabidopsis. Furthermore, we employ a custom image-based method for measuring hypocotyl segment elongation with high resolution and a method for measuring cell wall mechanical properties, to add mechanistic details to the emerging description of auxin-mediated cell expansion. We find that constitutive expression of GFP-AtSAUR19 bypasses the normal requirement of auxin for elongation growth by increasing the mechanical extensibility of excised hypocotyl segments. In contrast, hypocotyl segments overexpressing a PP2C.D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphatas</span></strong>e are specifically impaired in auxin-mediated elongation. The time courses of auxin-induced <i>SAUR</i> expression and auxin-dependent elongation growth were closely correlated. These findings indicate that induction of <i>SAUR</i> expression is sufficient to elicit auxin-mediated expansion growth by activating PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases to facilitate apoplast acidification and mechanical wall loosening.</p>

NRT1.1-Related NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> Toxicity Is Associated with a Disturbed Balance between NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> Uptake and Assimilation
<p>A high concentration of ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) as the sole source of nitrogen in the growth medium often is toxic to plants. The nitrate transporter NRT1.1 is involved in mediating the effects of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> toxicity; however, the mechanism remains undefined. In this study, wild-type Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> Columbia-0 [Col-0]) and <i>NRT1.1</i> mutants (<i>chl1-1</i> and <i>chl1-5</i>) were grown hydroponically in NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> and (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> media to assess the function of NRT1.1 in NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> stress responses. All the plants grew normally in medium containing mixed nitrogen sources, but Col-0 displayed more chlorosis and lower biomass and photosynthesis than the <i>NRT1.1</i> mutants in (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> medium. Grafting experiments between Col-0 and <i>chl1-5</i> further confirmed that NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> toxicity is influenced by NRT1.1. In (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> medium, NRT1.1 induced the expression of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> transporters, increasing NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> uptake. Additionally, the activities of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ine synthetase and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate synthetase in roots of Col-0 plants decreased and soluble sugar accumulated significantly, whereas pyruvate kinase-mediated glycolysis was not affected, all of which contributed to NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> accumulation. By contrast, the <i>NRT1.1</i> mutants showed reduced NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> accumulation and enhanced NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> assimilation through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ine synthetase, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate synthetase, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate dehydrogenase. Moreover, the up-regulation of genes involved in ethylene synthesis and senescence in Col-0 plants treated with (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> suggests that ethylene is involved in NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> toxicity responses. This study showed that NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> toxicity is related to a nitrate-independent signaling function of <i>NRT1.1</i> in Arabidopsis, characterized by enhanced NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> accumulation and altered NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> metabolism, which stimulates ethylene synthesis, leading to plant senescence.</p>

Chloroplast Damage Induced by the Inhibition of Fatty Acid Synthesis Triggers Autophagy in Chlamydomonas
<p>Fatty acids are synthesized in the stroma of plant and algal chloroplasts by the fatty acid synthase complex. Newly synthesized fatty acids are then used to generate plastidial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s that are essential for chloroplast structure and function. Here, we show that inhibition of fatty acid synthesis in the model alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> activates autophagy, a highly conserved catabolic process by which cells degrade intracellular material under adverse conditions to maintain cell homeostasis. Treatment of <i>Chlamydomonas</i> cells with cerulenin, a specific fatty acid synthase inhibitor, stimulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>ation of the autophagosome protein ATG8 and enhanced autophagic flux. We found that inhibition of fatty acid synthesis decreased monogalactosyldiacylglycerol abundance, increased lutein content, down-regulated photosynthesis, and increased the production of reactive oxygen species. Electron microscopy revealed a high degree of thylakoid membrane stacking in cerulenin-treated cells. Moreover, global transcriptomic analysis of these cells showed an up-regulation of genes encoding chloroplast proteins involved in protein folding and oxidative stress and the induction of major catabolic processes, including autophagy and proteasome pathways. Thus, our results uncovered a link between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> metabolism, chloroplast integrity, and autophagy through a mechanism that involves the activation of a chloroplast quality control system.</p>

Protein Carbonylation and Glycation in Legume Nodules
<p>Nitrogen fixation is an agronomically and environmentally important process catalyzed by bacterial nitrogenase within legume root nodules. These unique symbiotic organs have high metabolic rates and produce large amounts of reactive oxygen species that may modify proteins irreversibly. Here, we examined two types of oxidative posttranslational modifications of nodule proteins: carbonylation, which occurs by direct oxidation of certain amino acids or by interaction with reactive aldehydes arising from cell membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> peroxides; and glycation, which results from the reaction of lysine and arginine residues with reducing sugars or their autooxidation products. We used a strategy based on the enrichment of carbonylated peptides by affinity chromatography followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify 369 oxidized proteins in bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>) nodules. Of these, 238 corresponded to plant proteins and 131 to bacterial proteins. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> peroxidation products induced most carbonylation sites. This study also revealed that carbonylation has major effects on two key nodule proteins. Metal-catalyzed oxidation caused the inactivation of malate dehydrogenase and the aggregation of leghemoglobin. In addition, numerous glycated proteins were identified in vivo, including three key nodule proteins: sucrose synthase, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ine synthetase, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate synthase. Label-free quantification identified 10 plant proteins and 18 bacterial proteins as age-specifically glycated. Overall, our results suggest that the selective carbonylation or glycation of crucial proteins involved in nitrogen metabolism, transcriptional regulation, and signaling may constitute a mechanism to control cell metabolism and nodule senescence.</p>

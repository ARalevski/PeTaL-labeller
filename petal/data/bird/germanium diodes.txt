Carbon nanotube transistors scaled to a 40-nanometer footprint
<p>The International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors challenges the device research community to reduce the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transistor</span></strong> footprint containing all components to 40 nanometers within the next decade. We report on a p-channel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transistor</span></strong> scaled to such an extremely small dimension. Built on one semiconducting carbon nanotube, it occupies less than half the space of leading silicon technologies, while delivering a significantly higher pitch-normalized current density—above 0.9 milliampere per micrometer at a low supply voltage of 0.5 volts with a subthreshold swing of 85 millivolts per decade. Furthermore, we show <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transistor</span></strong>s with the same small footprint built on actual high-density arrays of such nanotubes that deliver higher current than that of the best-competing silicon devices under the same overdrive, without any normalization. We achieve this using low-resistance end-bonded contacts, a high-purity semiconducting carbon nanotube source, and self-assembly to pack nanotubes into full surface-coverage aligned arrays.</p>

Printed subthreshold organic transistors operating at high gain and ultralow power
<p>Overcoming the trade-offs among power consumption, fabrication cost, and signal amplification has been a long-standing issue for wearable electronics. We report a high-gain, fully inkjet-printed Schottky barrier organic thin-film <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transistor</span></strong> amplifier circuit. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transistor</span></strong> signal amplification efficiency is 38.2 siemens per ampere, which is near the theoretical thermionic limit, with an ultralow power consumption of <1 nanowatt. The use of a Schottky barrier for the source gave the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transistor</span></strong> geometry-independent electrical characteristics and accommodated the large dimensional variation in inkjet-printed features. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transistor</span></strong>s exhibited good reliability with negligible threshold-voltage shift. We demonstrated this capability with an ultralow-power high-gain amplifier for the detection of electrophysiological signals and showed a signal-to-noise ratio of >60 decibels and noise voltage of <0.3 microvolt per hertz<sup>1/2</sup> at 100 hertz.</p>

Aptamer–field-effect transistors overcome Debye length limitations for small-molecule sensing
<p>Detection of analytes by means of field-effect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transistor</span></strong>s bearing ligand-specific receptors is fundamentally limited by the shielding created by the electrical double layer (the “Debye length” limitation). We detected small molecules under physiological high–ionic strength conditions by modifying printed ultrathin metal-oxide field-effect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transistor</span></strong> arrays with deoxyribonucleotide aptamers selected to bind their targets adaptively. Target-induced conformational changes of negatively charged aptamer phosphodiester backbones in close proximity to semiconductor channels gated conductance in physiological buffers, resulting in highly sensitive detection. Sensing of charged and electroneutral targets (serotonin, dopamine, glucose, and sphingosine-1-phosphate) was enabled by specifically isolated aptameric stem-loop receptors.</p>

A single-photon switch and transistor enabled by a solid-state quantum memory
<p>Single-photon switches and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transistor</span></strong>s generate strong photon-photon interactions that are essential for quantum circuits and networks. However, the deterministic control of an optical signal with a single photon requires strong interactions with a quantum memory, which has been challenging to achieve in a solid-state platform. We demonstrate a single-photon switch and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transistor</span></strong> enabled by a solid-state quantum memory. Our device consists of a semiconductor spin qubit strongly coupled to a nanophotonic cavity. The spin qubit enables a single 63-picosecond gate photon to switch a signal field containing up to an average of 27.7 photons before the internal state of the device resets. Our results show that semiconductor nanophotonic devices can produce strong and controlled photon-photon interactions that could enable high-bandwidth photonic quantum information processing.</p>

All-printed thin-film transistors from networks of liquid-exfoliated nanosheets
<p>All-printed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transistor</span></strong>s consisting of interconnected networks of various types of two-dimensional nanosheets are an important goal in nanoscience. Using electrolytic gating, we demonstrate all-printed, vertically stacked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transistor</span></strong>s with graphene source, drain, and gate electrodes, a transition metal dichalcogenide channel, and a boron nitride (BN) separator, all formed from nanosheet networks. The BN network contains an ionic liquid within its porous interior that allows electrolytic gating in a solid-like structure. Nanosheet network channels display on:off ratios of up to 600, transconductances exceeding 5 millisiemens, and mobilities of >0.1 square centimeters per volt per second. Unusually, the on-currents scaled with network thickness and volumetric capacitance. In contrast to other devices with comparable mobility, large capacitances, while hindering switching speeds, allow these devices to carry higher currents at relatively low drive voltages.</p>

Subthreshold Schottky-barrier thin-film transistors with ultralow power and high intrinsic gain
<p>The quest for low power becomes highly compelling in newly emerging application areas related to wearable devices in the Internet of Things. Here, we report on a Schottky-barrier indium-gallium-zinc-oxide thin-film <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transistor</span></strong> operating in the deep subthreshold regime (i.e., near the OFF state) at low supply voltages (<1 volt) and ultralow power (<1 nanowatt). By using a Schottky-barrier at the source and drain contacts, the current-voltage characteristics of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transistor</span></strong> were virtually channel-length independent with an infinite output resistance. It exhibited high intrinsic gain (>400) that was both bias and geometry independent. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transistor</span></strong> reported here is useful for sensor interface circuits in wearable devices where high current sensitivity and ultralow power are vital for battery-less operation.</p>

MoS<sub>2</sub> transistors with 1-nanometer gate lengths
<p>Scaling of silicon (Si) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transistor</span></strong>s is predicted to fail below 5-nanometer (nm) gate lengths because of severe short channel effects. As an alternative to Si, certain layered semiconductors are attractive for their atomically uniform thickness down to a monolayer, lower dielectric constants, larger band gaps, and heavier carrier effective mass. Here, we demonstrate molybdenum disulfide (MoS<sub>2</sub>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transistor</span></strong>s with a 1-nm physical gate length using a single-walled carbon nanotube as the gate electrode. These ultrashort devices exhibit excellent switching characteristics with near ideal subthreshold swing of ~65 millivolts per decade and an On/Off current ratio of ~10<sup>6</sup>. Simulations show an effective channel length of ~3.9 nm in the Off state and ~1 nm in the On state.</p>

SOCE mediated by STIM and Orai is essential for pacemaker activity in the interstitial cells of Cajal in the gastrointestinal tract
<p>Electrical pacemaker activity generates phasic contractions and motility patterns such as segmentation and peristalsis in the gastrointestinal tract. Pacemaker currents are generated in interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC), which release Ca<sup>2+</sup> from intracellular stores that stimulates Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>−</sup> channels (CaCCs) in the plasma membrane. Thus, Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores must be maintained to sustain pacemaker activity. Store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (SOCE) facilitates the refilling of Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores by a mechanism dependent upon interactions between STIM and Orai proteins. We investigated the role of SOCE in ICC pacemaker activity. Reintroduction of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in store-depleted ICC resulted in CaCC activation. Blocking CaCCs revealed an inwardly rectifying current with properties of a Ca<sup>2+</sup> release–activated current (<i>I</i><sub>CRAC</sub>). An inhibitory peptide that interfered with the STIM-Orai interaction blocked <i>I</i><sub>CRAC</sub> in HEK 293 cells expressing STIM1 and Orai1 and blocked spontaneous transient inward currents (STICs) and slow wave currents in ICC. STICs, which are fundamental pacemaker events in ICC, were blocked by an Orai antagonist. Imaging of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients linked to pacemaker activity in ICC in intact muscles showed that the Orai antagonist blocked Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in ICC. These data suggest that Ca<sup>2+</sup> recovery through STIM-Orai interactions is necessary to maintain ICC pacemaker activity.</p>

Semiconducting polymer blends that exhibit stable charge transport at high temperatures
<p>Although high-temperature operation (i.e., beyond 150°C) is of great interest for many electronics applications, achieving stable carrier mobilities for organic semiconductors at elevated temperatures is fundamentally challenging. We report a general strategy to make thermally stable high-temperature semiconducting polymer blends, composed of interpenetrating semicrystalline conjugated polymers and high glass-transition temperature insulating matrices. When properly engineered, such polymer blends display a temperature-insensitive charge transport behavior with hole mobility exceeding 2.0 cm<sup>2</sup>/V·s across a wide temperature range from room temperature up to 220°C in thin-film <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transistor</span></strong>s.</p>

Electrically tunable low-density superconductivity in a monolayer topological insulator
<p>Turning on superconductivity in a topologically nontrivial insulator may provide a route to search for non-Abelian topological states. However, existing demonstrations of superconductor-insulator switches have involved only topologically trivial systems. Here we report reversible, in situ electrostatic on-off switching of superconductivity in the recently established quantum spin Hall insulator monolayer tungsten ditelluride (WTe<sub>2</sub>). Fabricated into a van der Waals field-effect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transistor</span></strong>, the monolayer’s ground state can be continuously gate-tuned from the topological insulating to the superconducting state, with critical temperatures <i>T</i><sub>c</sub> up to ~1 kelvin.

Controlled crack propagation for atomic precision handling of wafer-scale two-dimensional materials
<p>Although flakes of two-dimensional (2D) heterostructures at the micrometer scale can be formed with adhesive-tape exfoliation methods, isolation of 2D flakes into monolayers is extremely time consuming because it is a trial-and-error process. Controlling the number of 2D layers through direct growth also presents difficulty because of the high nucleation barrier on 2D materials. We demonstrate a layer-resolved 2D material splitting technique that permits high-throughput production of multiple monolayers of wafer-scale (5-centimeter diameter) 2D materials by splitting single stacks of thick 2D materials grown on a single wafer. Wafer-scale uniformity of hexagonal boron nitride, tungsten disulfide, tungsten diselenide, molybdenum disulfide, and molybdenum diselenide monolayers was verified by photoluminescence response and by substantial retention of electronic conductivity. We fabricated wafer-scale van der Waals heterostructures, including field-effect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transistor</span></strong>s, with single-atom thickness resolution.</p>

Dirac-source field-effect transistors as energy-efficient, high-performance electronic switches
<p>An efficient way to reduce the power consumption of electronic devices is to lower the supply voltage, but this voltage is restricted by the thermionic limit of subthreshold swing (SS), 60 millivolts per decade, in field-effect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transistor</span></strong>s (FETs). We show that a graphene Dirac source (DS) with a much narrower electron density distribution around the Fermi level than that of conventional FETs can lower SS. A DS-FET with a carbon nanotube channel provided an average SS of 40 millivolts per decade over four decades of current at room temperature and high device current <i>I</i><sub>60</sub> of up to 40 microamperes per micrometer at 60 millivolts per decade. When compared with state-of-the-art silicon 14-nanometer node FETs, a similar on-state current <i>I</i><sub>on</sub> is realized but at a much lower supply voltage of 0.5 volts (versus 0.7 volts for silicon) and a much steeper SS below 35 millivolts per decade in the off-state.</p>

A bioinspired flexible organic artificial afferent nerve
<p>The distributed network of receptors, neurons, and synapses in the somatosensory system efficiently processes complex tactile information. We used flexible organic electronics to mimic the functions of a sensory nerve. Our artificial afferent nerve collects pressure information (1 to 80 kilopascals) from clusters of pressure sensors, converts the pressure information into action potentials (0 to 100 hertz) by using ring oscillators, and integrates the action potentials from multiple ring oscillators with a synaptic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transistor</span></strong>. Biomimetic hierarchical structures can detect movement of an object, combine simultaneous pressure inputs, and distinguish braille characters. Furthermore, we connected our artificial afferent nerve to motor nerves to construct a hybrid bioelectronic reflex arc to actuate muscles. Our system has potential applications in neurorobotics and neuroprosthetics.</p>

Elastic strain engineering for ultralow mechanical dissipation
<p>Extreme stresses can be produced in nanoscale structures; this feature has been used to realize enhanced materials properties, such as the high mobility of silicon in modern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transistor</span></strong>s. We show how nanoscale stress can be used to realize exceptionally low mechanical dissipation when combined with “soft-clamping”—a form of phononic engineering. Specifically, using a nonuniform phononic crystal pattern, we colocalize the strain and flexural motion of a free-standing silicon nitride nanobeam. Ringdown measurements at room temperature reveal string-like vibrational modes with quality (<i>Q</i>) factors as high as 800 million and <i>Q</i> × frequency exceeding 10<sup>15</sup> hertz. These results illustrate a promising route for engineering ultracoherent nanomechanical devices.</p>

Bottom-up construction of a superstructure in a porous uranium-organic crystal
<p>Bottom-up construction of highly intricate structures from simple building blocks remains one of the most difficult challenges in chemistry. We report a structurally complex, mesoporous uranium-based metal-organic framework (MOF) made from simple starting components. The structure comprises 10 uranium nodes and seven tricarboxylate ligands (both crystallographically nonequivalent), resulting in a 173.3-angstrom cubic unit cell enclosing 816 uranium nodes and 816 organic linkers—the largest unit cell found to date for any nonbiological material. The cuboctahedra organize into pentagonal and hexagonal prismatic secondary structures, which then form tetrahedral and diamond quaternary topologies with unprecedented complexity. This packing results in the formation of colossal icosidodecahedral and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rectifi</span></strong>ed hexakaidecahedral cavities with internal diameters of 5.0 nanometers and 6.2 nanometers, respectively—ultimately giving rise to the lowest-density MOF reported to date.</p>

Scaling carbon nanotube complementary transistors to 5-nm gate lengths

A scaling trend study revealed that the scaled CNT-based devices, which use graphene contacts, can operate much faster and at much lower supply voltage (0.4 versus 0.7 volts) and with much smaller subthreshold slope (typically 73 millivolts per decade). The 5-nanometer CNT FETs approached the quantum limit of FETs by using only one electron per switching operation. In addition, the contact length of the CNT CMOS devices was also scaled down to 25 nanometers, and a CMOS inverter with a total pitch size of 240 nanometers was also demonstrated.</p>

Highly stretchable polymer semiconductor films through the nanoconfinement effect
<p>Soft and conformable wearable electronics require stretchable semiconductors, but existing ones typically sacrifice charge transport mobility to achieve stretchability. We explore a concept based on the nanoconfinement of polymers to substantially improve the stretchability of polymer semiconductors, without affecting charge transport mobility. The increased polymer chain dynamics under nanoconfinement significantly reduces the modulus of the conjugated polymer and largely delays the onset of crack formation under strain. As a result, our fabricated semiconducting film can be stretched up to 100% strain without affecting mobility, retaining values comparable to that of amorphous silicon. The fully stretchable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transistor</span></strong>s exhibit high biaxial stretchability with minimal change in on current even when poked with a sharp object. We demonstrate a skinlike finger-wearable driver for a light-emitting diode.</p>

High-quality graphene via microwave reduction of solution-exfoliated graphene oxide
<p>Efficient exfoliation of graphite in solutions to obtain high-quality graphene flakes is desirable for printable electronics, catalysis, energy storage, and composites. Graphite oxide with large lateral dimensions has an exfoliation yield of ~100%, but it has not been possible to completely remove the oxygen functional groups so that the reduced form of graphene oxide (GO; reduced form: rGO) remains a highly disordered material. Here we report a simple, rapid method to reduce GO into pristine graphene using 1- to 2-second pulses of microwaves. The desirable structural properties are translated into mobility values of >1000 square centimeters per volt per second in field-effect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transistor</span></strong>s with microwave-reduced GO (MW-rGO) as the channel material and into particularly high activity for MW-rGO catalyst support toward oxygen evolution reactions.</p>

Measuring gill paracellular permeability with polyethylene glycol-4000 in freely swimming trout: proof of principle
<p>The influence of swimming activity on gill paracellular permeability has not been measured previously in fishes. We critically assessed the use of tritium-labeled polyethylene glycol ([<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000) for this purpose, a substance that is also a classic marker for extracellular fluid volume, glomerular filtration rate and drinking rate. Tests (8 h) on resting freshwater trout showed that when measuring [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance from the plasma in the efflux direction, correction for a large excretion via glomerular filtration was essential, necessitating urinary catheterization. When measuring [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance from the water in the influx direction, correction for a significant uptake by drinking was essential, necessitating terminal gut removal, whereas glomerular filtration losses were minimal. After correction for these alternate routes of loss and uptake, [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance rates by efflux from the plasma and by influx from the water were identical, showing that gill paracellular permeability is not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rectifi</span></strong>ed, and can be measured in either direction. The influx technique with terminal gut removal was used to assess gill paracellular permeability in trout without urinary catheters freely swimming at 1.2 body lengths s<sup>−1</sup> for 8 h. Branchial [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance rate (by influx from the water) increased significantly by ~80% in accord with a similar measured increase in O<sub>2</sub> consumption rate. Thus in trout, gill paracellular permeability does increase during exercise, in accord with the traditional concept of the osmorespiratory compromise.</p>

Generation and validation of a zebrafish model of EAST (epilepsy, ataxia, sensorineural deafness and tubulopathy) syndrome
<p>Recessive mutations in <i>KCNJ10</i>, which encodes an inwardly rectifying potassium channel, were recently identified as the cause of EAST syndrome, a severe and disabling multi-organ disorder consisting of epilepsy, ataxia, sensorineural deafness and tubulopathy that becomes clinically apparent with seizures in infancy. A <i>Kcnj10</i> knockout mouse shows postnatal mortality and is therefore not suitable for drug discovery. Because zebrafish are ideal for <i>in vivo</i> screening for potential therapeutics, we tested whether <i>kcnj10</i> knockdown in zebrafish would fill this need. We cloned zebrafish <i>kcnj10</i> and demonstrated that its function is equivalent to that of human <i>KCNJ10</i>. We next injected splice- and translation-blocking <i>kcnj10</i> antisense morpholino oligonucleotides and reproduced the cardinal symptoms of EAST syndrome – ataxia, epilepsy and renal tubular defects. Several of these phenotypes could be assayed in an automated manner. We could rescue the morphant phenotype with complementary RNA (cRNA) encoding human wild-type KCNJ10, but not with cRNA encoding a KCNJ10 mutation identified in individuals with EAST syndrome. Our results suggest that zebrafish will be a valuable tool to screen for compounds that are potentially therapeutic for EAST syndrome or its individual symptoms. Knockdown of <i>kcnj10</i> represents the first zebrafish model of a salt-losing tubulopathy, which has relevance for blood pressure control.</p>

Delayed Repolarization Underlies Ventricular Arrhythmias in Rats With Heart Failure and Preserved Ejection Fraction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) represents approximately half of heart failure, and its incidence continues to increase. The leading cause of mortality in HFpEF is sudden death, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Dahl salt-sensitive rats were fed a high-salt diet (8% NaCl) from 7 weeks of age to induce HFpEF (n=38). Rats fed a normal-salt diet (0.3% NaCl) served as controls (n=13). Echocardiograms were performed to assess systolic and diastolic function from 14 weeks of age. HFpEF-verified and control rats underwent programmed electrical stimulation. Corrected QT interval was measured by surface ECG. The mechanisms of ventricular arrhythmias (VA) were probed by optical mapping, whole-cell patch clamp to measure action potential duration and ionic currents, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting to investigate changes in ion channel expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>After 7 weeks of a high-salt diet, 31 of 38 rats showed diastolic dysfunction and preserved ejection fraction along with signs of heart failure and hence were diagnosed with HFpEF. Programmed electric stimulation demonstrated increased susceptibility to VA in HFpEF rats (<i>P</i><0.001 versus controls). The arrhythmogenicity index was increased (<i>P</i><0.001) and the corrected QT interval on ECG was prolonged (<i>P</i><0.001) in HFpEF rats. Optical mapping of HFpEF hearts demonstrated prolonged action potentials (<i>P</i><0.05) and multiple reentry circuits during induced VA. Single-cell recordings of cardiomyocytes isolated from HFpEF rats confirmed a delay of repolarization (<i>P</i>=0.001) and revealed downregulation of transient outward potassium current (<i>I</i><sub>to</sub>; <i>P</i><0.05). The rapid components of the delayed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rectifi</span></strong>er potassium current (<i>I</i><sub>Kr</sub>) and the inward <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rectifi</span></strong>er potassium current (<i>I</i><sub>K1</sub>) were also downregulated (<i>P</i><0.05), but the current densities were much lower than for <i>I</i><sub>to</sub>. In accordance with the reduction of <i>I</i><sub>to</sub>, both <i>Kcnd3</i> transcript and Kv4.3 protein levels were decreased in HFpEF rat hearts.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Susceptibility to VA was markedly increased in rats with HFpEF. Underlying abnormalities include QT prolongation, delayed repolarization from downregulation of potassium currents, and multiple reentry circuits during VA. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that potassium current downregulation leads to abnormal repolarization in HFpEF, which in turn predisposes to VA and sudden cardiac death.</p></sec>

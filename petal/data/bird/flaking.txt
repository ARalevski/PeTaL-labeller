The management of open tibial fractures in children
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Following the introduction of national standards in 2009, most   major paediatric trauma is now triaged to specialist units offering   combined orthopaedic and plastic surgical expertise. We investigated   the management of open tibia <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es at a paediatric trauma centre,   primarily reporting the risk of infection and rate of union.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A retrospective review was performed on 61 children who between   2007 and 2015 presented with an open tibia <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e. Their mean   age was nine years (2 to 16) and the median follow-up was ten months   (interquartile range 5 to 18). Management involved IV antibiotics,   early debridement and combined treatment of the skeletal and soft-tissue injuries   in line with standards proposed by the British Orthopaedic Association.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were 36 diaphyseal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es and 25 distal tibial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es.   Of the distal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es, eight involved the physis. Motor vehicle   collisions accounted for two thirds of the injuries and 38 patients   (62%) arrived outside of normal working hours. The initial method   of stabilisation comprised: casting in nine cases (15%); elastic   nailing in 19 (31%); Kirschner (K)-wiring in 13 (21%); intramedullary   nailing in one (2%); open reduction and plate fixation in four (7%); and   external fixation in 15 (25%). Wound management comprised: primary   wound closure in 24 (39%), delayed primary closure in 11 (18%),   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">split</span></strong> skin graft (SSG) in eight (13%), local flap with SSG in 17   (28%) and a free flap in one. A total of 43 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es (70%) were   Gustilo-Anderson grade III. There were four superficial (6.6%) and   three (4.9%) deep infections. Two deep infections occurred following   open reduction and plate fixation and the third after    K-wire fixation of a distal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e. No patient who underwent primary   wound closure developed an infection. All the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es united,   although nine patients required revision of a mono-lateral to circular   frame for delayed union (two) or for altered alignment or length   (seven). The mean time to union was two weeks longer in diaphyseal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es   than in distal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es (13 weeks <i>versus</i> 10.8   weeks, p<i> = </i>0.016). Children aged > 12 years had   a significantly longer time to union than those aged < 12 years   (16.3 weeks <i>versus</i> 11.4 weeks, p<i> = </i>0.045).   The length of stay in hospital for patients with a Gustilo-Anderson   grade IIIB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e was twice as long as for less severe injuries. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es in children heal better than those in adults. Based   on our experience of deep infection we discourage the use of internal   fixation with a plate for open tibial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es in children. We   advocate aggressive initial wound debridement in theatre with early   definitive combined orthopaedic and plastic surgery in order to   obtain skeletal stabilisation and soft-tissue cover.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:544–53.</p></sec>

A systematic review of Vancouver B2 and B3 periprosthetic femoral fractures
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the outcomes of Vancouver   type B2 and B3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es by performing a systematic review of the   methods of surgical treatment which have been reported.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A systematic search was performed in Ovid MEDLINE, Embase and   the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. For inclusion,   studies required a minimum of ten patients with a Vancouver type   B2 and/or ten patients with a Vancouver type B3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e, a minimum   mean follow-up of two years and outcomes which were matched to the type   of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e. Studies were also required to report the rate of re-operation   as an outcome measure. The protocol was registered in the PROSPERO   database. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 22 studies were included based on the eligibility   criteria, including 343 B2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es and 167 B3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es. The mean   follow-up ranged from 32 months to 74 months. </p><p>Of 343 Vancouver B2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es, the treatment in 298 (86.8%) involved   revision arthroplasty and 45 (12.6%) were treated with internal   fixation alone. A total of 37 patients (12.4%) treated with revision   arthroplasty and six (13.3%) treated by internal fixation only underwent   further re-operation. </p><p>Of 167 Vancouver B3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es, the treatment in 160 (95.8%) involved   revision arthroplasty and eight (4.8%) were treated with internal   fixation without revision. A total of 23 patients (14.4%) treated   with revision arthroplasty and two (28.6%) treated only with internal   fixation required re-operation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>A significant proportion, particularly of B2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es, were   treated without revision of the stem. These were associated with   a higher rate of re-operation. The treatment of B3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es without   revision of the stem resulted in a high rate of re-operation. This   demonstrates the importance of careful evaluation and accurate characterisation   of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e at the time of presentation to ensure the correct   management. There is a need for improvement in the reporting of   data in case series recording the outcome of the surgical treatment   of periprosthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es. We have suggested a minimum dataset   to improve the quality of data in studies dealing with these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B(4   Supple B):17–25.</p></sec>

Coherent single-atom superradiance
<p>Superradiance is a quantum phenomenon emerging in macroscopic systems whereby correlated single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s cooperatively emit photons. Demonstration of controlled collective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>-field interactions has resulted from the ability to directly imprint correlations with an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic ensemble. Here we report cavity-mediated coherent single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> superradiance: Single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s with predefined correlation traverse a high–quality factor cavity one by one, emitting photons cooperatively with the <i>N</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s that have already gone through the cavity (<i>N</i> represents the number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s). Enhanced collective photoemission of <i>N</i>-squared dependence was observed even when the intracavity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> number was less than unity. The correlation among single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s was achieved by nanometer-precision position control and phase-aligned state manipulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s by using a nanohole-array aperture. Our results demonstrate a platform for phase-controlled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>-field interactions.</p>

A new and reliable classification system for fractures of the navicular and associated injuries to the midfoot
<sec><title>Aims</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es of the navicular can occur in isolation but, owing   to the intimate an<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ical and biomechanical relationships, are   often associated with other injuries to the neighbouring bones and   joints in the foot. As a result, they can lead to long-term morbidity   and poor function. Our aim in this study was to identify patterns   of injury in a new classification system of traumatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es   of the navicular, with consideration being given to the commonly associated   injuries to the midfoot.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We undertook a retrospective review of 285 conse<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong>ive patients   presenting over an eight- year period with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e of the navicular.   Five common patterns of injury were identified and classified according   to the radiological features. Type 1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es are dorsal avulsion   injuries related to the capsule of the talonavicular joint. Type   2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es are isolated avulsion injuries to the tuberosity of   the navicular. Type 3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es are a variant of tarsometatarsal   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e/dislocations creating instability of the medial ray. Type   4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es involve the body of the navicular with no associated   injury to the lateral column and type 5 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es occur in conjunction   with disruption of the midtarsal joint with crushing of the medial   or lateral, or both, columns of the foot.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In order to test the reliability and reproducibility of this   new classification, a cohort of 30 patients with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e of the   navicular were classified by six independent assessors at two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate   times, six months apart. Interobserver reliability and intraobserver   reproducibility both had substantial agreement, with kappa values   of 0.80 and 0.72, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We propose a logical, all-inclusive, and mutually exclusive classification   system for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es of the navicular that gives associated injuries   involving the lateral column due consideration. We have shown that   this system is reliable and reproducible and have described the   rationale for the subsequent treatment of each type.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:176–82.</p></sec>

Ceramic-on-ceramic bearing fractures in total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Ceramic-on-ceramic (CoC) bearings in total hip arthroplasty (THA)   are commonly used, but concerns exist regarding ceramic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e.   This study aims to report the risk of revision for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e of modern   CoC bearings and identify factors that might influence this risk,   using data from the National Joint Registry (NJR) for England, Wales, Northern   Ireland and the Isle of Man.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We analysed data on 223 362 bearings from 111 681 primary CoC   THAs and 182 linked revisions for bearing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e recorded in the   NJR. We used implant codes to identify ceramic bearing composition   and generated Kaplan-Meier estimates for implant survivorship. Logistic   regression analyses were performed for implant size and patient specific   variables to determine any associated risks for revision.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 222 852 bearings (99.8%) were CeramTec Biolox products.   Revisions for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e were linked to seven of 79 442 (0.009%) Biolox   Delta heads, 38 of 31 982 (0.119%) Biolox Forte heads, 101 of 80   170 (0.126%) Biolox Delta liners and 35 of 31 258 (0.112%) Biolox   Forte liners. Regression analysis of implant size revealed smaller   heads had significantly higher odds of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e (chi-squared 68.0,   p < 0.001). The highest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e risk was observed in the 28 mm   Biolox Forte subgroup (0.382%). There were no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es in the 40   mm head group for either ceramic type. Liner thickness was not predictive   of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e (p = 0.67). Body mass index (BMI) was independently   associated with revision for both head <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es (odds ratio (OR)   1.09 per unit increase, p = 0.031) and liner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es (OR 1.06   per unit increase, p = 0.006). </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We report the largest independent study of CoC bearing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es   to date. The risk of revision for CoC bearing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e is very low   but previous studies have underestimated this risk. There is good   evidence that the latest generation of ceramic has greatly reduced   the odds of head <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e but not of liner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e.

Hemiarthroplasty proximal femoral endoprostheses following tumour reconstruction
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Dislocation rates are reportedly lower in patients requiring   proximal femoral hemiarthroplasty than for patients undergoing hip   arthroplasty for neoplasia. Without acetabular replacement, pain   due to acetabular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wear</span></strong> necessitating revision surgery has been described.   We aimed to determine whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wear</span></strong> of the native acetabulum following   hemiarthroplasty necessitates revision surgery with secondary replacement   of the acetabulum after proximal femoral replacement (PFR) for tumour   reconstruction.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We reviewed 100 conse<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong>ive PFRs performed between January 2003   and January 2013 without acetabular resurfacing. The procedure was   undertaken in 74 patients with metastases, for a primary bone tumour   in 20 and for myeloma in six. There were 48 male and 52 female patients,   with a mean age of 61.4 years (19 to 85) and median follow-up of   two years (interquartile range (IQR) 0.5 to 3.7 years). In total,   52 patients presented with a pathological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e and six presented   with failed fixation of a previously instrumented pathological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>All patients underwent reconstruction with either a unipolar   (n = 64) or bipolar (n = 36) articulation.

Hyperfine interaction of individual atoms on a surface
<p>Taking advantage of nuclear spins for electronic structure analysis, magnetic resonance imaging, and quantum devices hinges on knowledge and control of the surrounding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic-scale environment. We measured and manipulated the hyperfine interaction of individual iron and titanium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s placed on a magnesium oxide surface by using spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy in combination with single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> electron spin resonance. Using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> manipulation to move single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s, we found that the hyperfine interaction strongly depended on the binding configuration of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>. We could extract <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>- and position-dependent information about the electronic ground state, the state mixing with neighboring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s, and properties of the nuclear spin. Thus, the hyperfine spectrum becomes a powerful probe of the chemical environment of individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s and nanostructures.</p>

The prevention of a lateral hinge fracture as a complication of a medial opening wedge high tibial osteotomy
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We aimed to investigate factors related to the technique of medial   opening wedge high tibial osteotomy which might predispose to the   development of a lateral hinge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 71 patients with 82 osteotomies were included in the   study. Their mean age was 62.9 years (37 to 80). The classification   of the type of osteotomy was based on whether it extended beyond   the fibular head.

Ten-year follow-up study of three alternative bearing surfaces used in total hip arthroplasty in young patients
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We present the ten-year data of a cohort of patients, aged between   18 and 65 years (mean age 52.7 years; 19 to 64), who underwent total   hip arthroplasty. Patients were randomised to be treated with a   cobalt-chrome (CoCr) femoral head with an ultra-high molecular weight   polyethylene (UHMWPE), highly cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) or   ceramic-on-ceramic (CoC) bearing surface.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 102 hips (91 patients) were randomised into the three   groups. At ten years, 97 hips were available for radiological and   functional follow-up. Two hips (two patients) had been revised (one   with deep infection and one for periprosthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e) and three   were lost to follow-up. Radiological analysis was performed using   a validated digital assessment programme to give linear, directional   and volumetric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wear</span></strong> of the two polyethylene groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was a significantly reduced rate of steady-state linear   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wear</span></strong> with XLPE (0.07 mm/yr) compared with UHMWPE (0.37 mm/yr) (p   = 0.001). Volumetric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wear</span></strong> was also significantly reduced in the   XLPE group (29.29 mm<sup>3</sup>/yr) compared with the UHMWPE group   (100.75mm<sup>3</sup>/yr) (p = 0.0001). There were six patients   with UHMWPE who had non-progressive osteolysis and none in the XLPE   group. All three bearing groups had significant improvements in   12-item short form health survey scores, Western Ontario and McMaster   Universities Osteoarthritis Index score and Harris Hip Score. However,   the improvement in HSS was significantly less in the UHMWPE group   (p = 0.0188) than in the other two groups.</p><p>At ten years, the rates of volumetric and linear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wear</span></strong> in the   XLPE group remain low and predominantly below the estimated threshold   for osteolysis (1 mm/yr).

A new morphological classification for greater tuberosity fractures of the proximal humerus
<p>In this study, we describe a morphological classification   for greater tuberosity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es of the proximal humerus. We divided   these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es into three types: avulsion, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">split</span></strong> and depression.   We retrospectively reviewed all shoulder radiographs showing isolated   greater tuberosity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es in a Level I trauma centre between   July 2007 and July 2012. We identified 199 cases where records and   radiographs were reviewed and included 79 men and 120 women with   a mean age of 58 years (23 to 96). The morphological classification   was applied to the first 139 cases by three reviewers on two occasions   using the Kappa statistic and compared with the AO and Neer classifications.   The inter- and intra-observer reliability of the morphological classification   was 0.73 to 0.77 and 0.69 to 0.86, respectively. This was superior   to the Neer (0.31 to 0.35/0.54 to 0.63) and AO (0.30 to 0.32/0.59   to 0.65) classifications. The distribution of avulsion, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">split</span></strong> and   depression type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es was 39%, 41%, and 20%, respectively. This   classification of greater tuberosity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es is more reliable   than the Neer or AO classifications. These distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e morphologies   are likely to have implications in terms of pathophysiology and   surgical technique.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014;96-B:646–51.</p>

Creation of a Bose-condensed gas of <sup>87</sup>Rb by laser cooling
<p>Protocols for attaining quantum degeneracy in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic gases almost exclusively rely on evaporative cooling, a time-consuming final step associated with substantial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> loss. We demonstrate direct laser cooling of a gas of rubidium-87 (<sup>87</sup>Rb) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s to quantum degeneracy. The method is fast and induces little <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> loss. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s are trapped in a two-dimensional optical lattice that enables cycles of compression to increase the density, followed by Raman sideband cooling to decrease the temperature. From a starting number of 2000 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s, 1400 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s reach quantum degeneracy in 300 milliseconds, as confirmed by a bimodal velocity distribution. The method should be broadly applicable to many bosonic and fermionic species and to systems where evaporative cooling is not possible.</p>

Atom-by-atom assembly of defect-free one-dimensional cold atom arrays
<p>The realization of large-scale fully controllable quantum systems is an exciting frontier in modern physical science. We use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>-by-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> assembly to implement a platform for the deterministic preparation of regular one-dimensional arrays of individually controlled cold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s. In our approach, a measurement and feedback procedure eliminates the entropy associated with probabilistic trap occupation and results in defect-free arrays of more than 50 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s in less than 400 milliseconds. The technique is based on fast, real-time control of 100 optical tweezers, which we use to arrange <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s in desired geometric patterns and to maintain these configurations by replacing lost <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s with surplus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s from a reservoir. This bottom-up approach may enable controlled engineering of scalable many-body systems for quantum information processing, quantum simulations, and precision measurements.</p>

Plate fixation <i>versus</i> intramedullary nailing of completely displaced midshaft fractures of the clavicle
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>This is a prospective randomised controlled trial comparing the   functional outcomes of plate fixation and elastic stable intramedullary   nailing (ESIN) of completely displaced mid-shaft <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es of the   clavicle in the active adult population.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We prospectively recruited 123 patients and randomised them to   either plate fixation or ESIN. Patients completed the Quick Disabilities   of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score at one to six weeks post-operatively.   They were followed up at six weeks, three and six months and one   year with radiographs, and their clinical outcome was assessed using   both the DASH and the Constant Score.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Plate fixation provided a faster functional recovery during the   first six months compared with ESIN, but there was no difference   after one year. The duration of surgery was shorter for ESIN (mean   53.4 minutes, 22 to 120) than for plate fixation (mean 69.7 minutes,   35 to 106, p < 0.001). The recovery after ESIN was slower with   increasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comminut</span></strong>ion and with open reduction (p <   0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Both methods return the patients to their pre-injury functional   levels, but plate fixation has a faster recovery period in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comminut</span></strong>ed   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es than ESIN. ESIN has a shorter operative time and lower   infection and implant rates of failure when using 2.5 mm nails or   wider, suggesting that this is the preferred method in mid-shaft   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es with no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comminut</span></strong>ion, whereas plate fixation is the superior   method in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comminut</span></strong>ed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1095–1101</p></sec>

Mid-term results of the BIOLOX delta ceramic-on-ceramic total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We conducted a prospective study of a delta ceramic total hip   arthroplasty (THA) to determine the rate of ceramic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e, to   characterise post-operative noise, and to evaluate the mid-term   results and survivorship.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between March 2009 and March 2011, 274 patients (310 hips) underwent   cementless THA using a delta ceramic femoral head and liner. At   each follow-up, clinical and radiological outcomes were recorded.   A Kaplan-Meier analysis was undertaken to estimate survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Four patients (four hips) died and 18 patients (20 hips) were   lost to follow-up within five years. The remaining 252 patients   (286 hips) were followed for a mean of 66.5 months (60 to 84). There   were 144 men (166 hips) and 108 women (120 hips) with a mean age   of 49.7 years (16 to 83) at surgery. The mean pre-operative Harris   Hip Score of 47.1 points improved to 93.8 points at final follow-up.   Six patients reported squeaking in seven hips; however, none were   audible. Radiolucent lines involving Gruen zones one and/or seven   were seen in 52 hips (18.2%). No hip had detectable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wear</span></strong>, focal   osteolysis or signs of loosening. One hip was revised because of   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e of the ceramic liner, which occurred due to an undetected   malseating of the ceramic liner at the time of surgery. One hip   was revised for a periprosthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e of the femur, and one   hip was treated for periprosthetic joint infection.

An evolution in the management of fractures of the ankle
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>There has been an evolution recently in the management of unstable   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es of the ankle with a trend towards direct fixation of a   posterior malleolar fragment. Within these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es, Haraguchi   type 2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es extend medially and often cannot be fixed using   a standard posterolateral approach. Our aim was to describe the   posteromedial approach to address these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es and to assess   its efficacy and safety.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We performed a review of 15 patients with a Haraguchi type 2   posterior malleolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e which was fixed using a posteromedial   approach. Five patients underwent initial temporary spanning external   fixation.

A total of 38 had undergone   surgical fixation and 11 had been treated non-operatively; 13 patients   died at a mean of 10.2 years after THA (0.6 to 19). Patients were   assessed pre-operatively, at one year and at final follow-up (mean   9.1 years, 0.5 to 23) using the Oxford Hip Score (OHS). Implant   survivorship was assessed. An age and gender-matched cohort of THAs   performed for non-traumatic osteoarthritis (OA) or avascular necrosis   (AVN) (n = 98) were used to compare complications and patient-reported outcome   measures (PROMs).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean time from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e to THA was significantly shorter   for patients with AVN    (2.2 years) or protrusio (2.2 years) than those with post-traumatic   OA (9.4 years) or infection (8.0 years) (p = 0.03). Nine contained   and four uncontained defects were managed with autograft (n = 11),   bulk allograft (n = 1), or trabecular metal augment (n = 1). Initial   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e management (open reduction and internal fixation or non-operative),   timing of THA    (>/< one year), and age (>/< 55 years) had no significant   effect on OHS or ten-year survival.

The impact of external fixation on mortality in patients with an unstable pelvic ring fracture
<sec><title>Aim</title><p>There is not adequate evidence to establish whether external   fixation (EF) of pelvic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es leads to a reduced mortality.   We used the Japan Trauma Data Bank database to identify isolated   unstable pelvic ring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es to exclude the possibility of blood   loss from other injuries, and analyzed the effectiveness of EF on   mortality in this group of patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This was a registry-based comparison of 1163 patients who had   been treated for an isolated unstable pelvic ring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e with   (386 patients) or without (777 patients) EF. An isolated pelvic   ring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e was defined by an Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS) for   other injuries of < 3. An unstable pelvic ring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e was defined   as having an AIS ≥ 4. The primary outcome of this study was mortality.   A subgroup analysis was carried out for patients who required blood   transfusion within 24 hours of arrival in the Emergency Department   and those who had massive blood loss (AIS code: 852610.5).

Large-area graphene-nanomesh/carbon-nanotube hybrid membranes for ionic and molecular nanofiltration
<p>Nanoporous two-dimensional materials are attractive for ionic and molecular nanofiltration but limited by insufficient mechanical strength over large areas. We report a large-area graphene-nanomesh/single-walled carbon nanotube (GNM/SWNT) hybrid membrane with excellent mechanical strength while fully capturing the merit of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ically thin membranes. The monolayer GNM features high-density, subnanometer pores for efficient transport of water molecules while blocking solute ions or molecules to enable size-selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation. The SWNT network physically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ates the GNM into microsized islands and acts as the microscopic framework to support the GNM, thus ensuring the structural integrity of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ically thin GNM. The resulting GNM/SWNT membranes show high water permeance and a high rejection ratio for salt ions or organic molecules, and they retain stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation performance in tubular modules.</p>

Controlled crack propagation for atomic precision handling of wafer-scale two-dimensional materials
<p>Although <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flake</span></strong>s of two-dimensional (2D) heterostructures at the micrometer scale can be formed with adhesive-tape exfoliation methods, isolation of 2D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flake</span></strong>s into monolayers is extremely time consuming because it is a trial-and-error process. Controlling the number of 2D layers through direct growth also presents difficulty because of the high nucleation barrier on 2D materials. We demonstrate a layer-resolved 2D material <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">split</span></strong>ting technique that permits high-throughput production of multiple monolayers of wafer-scale (5-centimeter diameter) 2D materials by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">split</span></strong>ting single stacks of thick 2D materials grown on a single wafer. Wafer-scale uniformity of hexagonal boron nitride, tungsten disulfide, tungsten diselenide, molybdenum disulfide, and molybdenum diselenide monolayers was verified by photoluminescence response and by substantial retention of electronic conductivity. We fabricated wafer-scale van der Waals heterostructures, including field-effect transistors, with single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> thickness resolution.</p>

Single-cell profiling of the developing mouse brain and spinal cord with split-pool barcoding
<p>To facilitate scalable profiling of single cells, we developed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">split</span></strong>-pool ligation-based transcriptome sequencing (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">split</span></strong>-seq), a single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) method that labels the cellular origin of RNA through combinatorial barcoding. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">split</span></strong>-seq is compatible with fixed cells or nuclei, allows efficient sample multiplexing, and requires no customized equipment. We used <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">split</span></strong>-seq to analyze 156,049 single-nucleus transcriptomes from postnatal day 2 and 11 mouse brains and spinal cords. More than 100 cell types were identified, with gene expression patterns corresponding to cellular function, regional specificity, and stage of differentiation. Pseudotime analysis revealed transcriptional programs driving four developmental lineages, providing a snapshot of early postnatal development in the murine central nervous system. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">split</span></strong>-seq provides a path toward comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic analysis of other similarly complex multicellular systems.</p>

Synthesis of FeH<sub>5</sub>: A layered structure with atomic hydrogen slabs
<p>High pressure promotes the formation of polyhydrides with unusually high hydrogen-to-metal ratios. These polyhydrides have complex hydrogenic sublattices. We synthesized iron pentahydride (FeH<sub>5</sub>) by a direct reaction between iron and H<sub>2</sub> above 130 gigapascals in a laser-heated diamond anvil cell. FeH<sub>5</sub> exhibits a structure built of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic hydrogen only. It consists of intercalated layers of quasicubic FeH<sub>3</sub> units and four-plane slabs of thin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic hydrogen. The distribution of the valence electron density indicates a bonding between hydrogen and iron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s but none between hydrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s, presenting a two-dimensional metallic character. The discovery of FeH<sub>5</sub> suggests a low-pressure path to make materials that approach bulk dense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic hydrogen.</p>

Quantized thermal transport in single-atom junctions
<p>Thermal transport in individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic junctions and chains is of great fundamental interest because of the distinctive quantum effects expected to arise in them. By using novel, custom-fabricated, picowatt-resolution calorimetric scanning probes, we measured the thermal conductance of gold and platinum metallic wires down to single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> junctions. Our work reveals that the thermal conductance of gold single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> junctions is quantized at room temperature and shows that the Wiedemann-Franz law relating thermal and electrical conductance is satisfied even in single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> contacts. Furthermore, we quantitatively explain our experimental results within the Landauer framework for quantum thermal transport. The experimental techniques reported here will enable thermal transport studies in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic and molecular chains, which will be key to investigating numerous fundamental issues that thus far have remained experimentally inaccessible.</p>

An atom-by-atom assembler of defect-free arbitrary two-dimensional atomic arrays
<p>Large arrays of individually controlled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s trapped in optical tweezers are a very promising platform for quantum engineering applications. However, deterministic loading of the traps is experimentally challenging. We demonstrate the preparation of fully loaded two-dimensional arrays of up to ~50 microtraps, each containing a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> and arranged in arbitrary geometries. Starting from initially larger, half-filled matrices of randomly loaded traps, we obtain user-defined target arrays at unit filling. This is achieved with a real-time control system and a moving optical tweezers, which together enable a sequence of rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> moves depending on the initial distribution of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s in the arrays. These results open exciting prospects for quantum engineering with neutral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s in tunable two-dimensional geometries.</p>

Edge Nonlinear Optics on a MoS<sub>2</sub> Atomic Monolayer
<sec><title>Optics On the Edge</title><p>The ability to isolate stable materials just one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> thick has provided the impetus for a new generation of thin films technologies. Often, the materials are conceptually imaged in the form of an artist's impression as single continuous layers—a single crystal sheet of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s. Scanning probe and transmission electron microscopies reveal the reality, however, where the material resembles a patchwork quilt with polycrystals of different orientation and size <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated by grain boundaries forming a mosaic. These structures play an influential role in determining the transport and optical properties of the membrane. <bold>Yin <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 488; see the Perspective by <bold>Neshev and Kivshar</bold>) demonstrate a simple microscopy technique based on the nonlinear optical response of the materials to probe and characterize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ically thin layers of MoS<sub>2</sub>. The technique should prove useful during the characterization and optimization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ically thin membranes.</p></sec>

<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To evaluate the effect of a single early high-dose vitamin D   supplement on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e union in patients with hypovitaminosis D   and a long bone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between July 2011 and August 2013, 113 adults with a long bone   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e were enrolled in a prospective randomised double-blind   placebo-controlled trial. Their serum vitamin D levels were measured   and a total of 100 patients were found to be vitamin D deficient   (< 20 ng/ml) or insufficient (< 30 ng/mL). These were then   randomised to receive a single dose of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> orally   (100 000 IU) within two weeks of injury (treatment group, n = 50)   or a placebo (control group, n = 50). We recorded patient demographics,   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e location and treatment, vitamin D level, time to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e   union and complications, including vitamin D toxicity.</p><p>Outcomes included union, nonunion or complication requiring an   early, unplanned secondary procedure. Patients without an outcome   at 15 months and no scheduled follow-up were considered lost to   follow-up. The <i>t</i>-test and cross tabulations verified   the adequacy of randomisation. An intention-to-treat analysis was   carried out.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In all, 100 (89%) patients had hypovitaminosis D. Both treatment   and control groups had similar demographics and injury characteristics.   The initial median vitamin D levels were 16 ng/mL (interquartile   range 5 to 28) in both groups (p = 0.885). A total of 14 patients   were lost to follow-up (seven from each group), two had fixation   failure (one in each group) and one control group patient developed   an infection. Overall, the nonunion rate was 4% (two per group).   No patient showed signs of clinical toxicity from their supplement.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Despite finding a high level of hypovitaminosis D, the rate of   union was high and independent of supplementation with vitamin D<sub>3</sub>.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1520–5.</p></sec>

The challenge of Monteggia-like lesions of the elbow
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this retrospective multicentre study was to evaluate   mid-term results of the operative treatment of Monteggia-like lesions   and to determine the prognostic factors that influence the clinical   and radiological outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 46 patients (27 women and 19 men), with a mean age   of 57.7 years (18 to 84) who had sustained a Monteggia-like lesion   were followed up clinically and radiologically after surgical treatment.   The Mayo Modified Wrist Score (MMWS), Mayo Elbow Performance Score   (MEPS), Broberg and Morrey Score, and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder   and Hand (DASH) score were used for evaluation at a mean of 65 months   (27 to 111) postoperatively. All ulnar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es were stabilized   using a proximally contoured or precontoured locking compression   plate. Mason type I <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es of the radial head were treated conservatively, type   II <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es were treated with reconstruction, and type III <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es   with arthroplasty. All Morrey type II and III <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es of the coronoid   process was stabilized using lag screws.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Good results were found for the MMWS, with a mean of 88.4 (40 to   100).

Fractures of the femoral shaft in children
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology of closed   isolated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es of the femoral shaft in children, and to compare   the treatment and length of stay (LOS) between major trauma centres   (MTCs) and trauma units (TUs) in England.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>National data were obtained from the Trauma and Audit Research   Network for all isolated, closed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es of the femoral shaft   in children from birth to 15 years of age, between 2012 and 2015.   Age, gender, the season in which the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e occurred, non-accidental   injury, the mechanism of injury, hospital trauma status, LOS and   type of treatment were recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 1852 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es were identified.

Building one molecule from a reservoir of two atoms
<p>Chemical reactions typically proceed via stochastic encounters between reactants. Going beyond this paradigm, we combined exactly two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s in a single, controlled reaction. The experimental apparatus traps two individual laser-cooled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s [one sodium (Na) and one cesium (Cs)] in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate optical tweezers and then merges them into one optical dipole trap. Subsequently, photoassociation forms an excited-state NaCs molecule. The discovery of previously unseen resonances near the molecular dissociation threshold and measurement of collision rates are enabled by the tightly trapped ultracold sample of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s. As laser-cooling and trapping capabilities are extended to more elements, the technique will enable the study of more diverse, and eventually more complex, molecules in an isolated environment, as well as synthesis of designer molecules for qubits.</p>

Spatially distributed multipartite entanglement enables EPR steering of atomic clouds
<p>A key resource for distributed quantum-enhanced protocols is entanglement between spatially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated modes. However, the robust generation and detection of entanglement between spatially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated regions of an ultracold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic system remain a challenge. We used spin mixing in a tightly confined Bose-Einstein condensate to generate an entangled state of indistinguishable particles in a single spatial mode. We show experimentally that this entanglement can be spatially distributed by self-similar expansion of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic cloud. We used spatially resolved spin read-out to reveal a particularly strong form of quantum correlations known as Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering between distinct parts of the expanded cloud. Based on the strength of EPR steering, we constructed a witness, which confirmed genuine 5-partite entanglement.</p>

Control of zeolite framework flexibility and pore topology for separation of ethane and ethylene
<p>The discovery of new materials for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ating ethylene from ethane by adsorption, instead of using cryogenic distillation, is a key milestone for molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ations because of the multiple and widely extended uses of these molecules in industry. This technique has the potential to provide tremendous energy savings when compared with the currently used cryogenic distillation process for ethylene produced through steam cracking. Here we describe the synthesis and structural determination of a flexible pure silica zeolite (ITQ-55). This material can kinetically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate ethylene from ethane with an unprecedented selectivity of ~100, owing to its distinctive pore topology with large heart-shaped cages and framework flexibility. Control of such properties extends the boundaries for applicability of zeolites to challenging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ations.</p>

Angular momentum–induced delays in solid-state photoemission enhanced by intra-atomic interactions
<p>Attosecond time-resolved photoemission spectroscopy reveals that photoemission from solids is not yet fully understood. The relative emission delays between four photoemission channels measured for the van der Waals crystal tungsten diselenide (WSe<sub>2</sub>) can only be explained by accounting for both propagation and intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic delays. The intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic delay depends on the angular momentum of the initial localized state and is determined by intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic interactions. For the studied case of WSe<sub>2</sub>, the photoemission events are time ordered with rising initial-state angular momentum. Including intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic electron-electron interaction and angular momentum of the initial localized state yields excellent agreement between theory and experiment. This has required a revision of existing models for solid-state photoemission, and thus, attosecond time-resolved photoemission from solids provides important benchmarks for improved future photoemission models.</p>

Hydrogen positions in single nanocrystals revealed by electron diffraction
<p>The localization of hydrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s is an essential part of crystal structure analysis, but it is difficult because of their small scattering power. We report the direct localization of hydrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s in nanocrystalline materials, achieved using the recently developed approach of dynamical refinement of precession electron diffraction tomography data. We used this method to locate hydrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s in both an organic (paracetamol) and an inorganic (framework cobalt aluminophosphate) material. The results demonstrate that the technique can reliably reveal fine structural details, including the positions of hydrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s in single crystals with micro- to nanosized dimensions.</p>

Single-molecule optomechanics in “picocavities”
<p>Trapping light with noble metal nanostructures overcomes the diffraction limit and can confine light to volumes typically on the order of 30 cubic nanometers. We found that individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic features inside the gap of a plasmonic nanoassembly can localize light to volumes well below 1 cubic nanometer (“picocavities”), enabling optical experiments on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic scale. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic features are dynamically formed and disassembled by laser irradiation. Although unstable at room temperature, picocavities can be stabilized at cryogenic temperatures, allowing single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic cavities to be probed for many minutes. Unlike traditional optomechanical resonators, such extreme optical confinement yields a factor of 10<sup>6</sup> enhancement of optomechanical coupling between the picocavity field and vibrations of individual molecular bonds. This work sets the basis for developing nanoscale nonlinear quantum optics on the single-molecule level.</p>

Outcomes after early return to theatre following hip hemiarthroplasty for intracapsular fracture of the femoral neck
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Hip hemiarthroplasty is a standard treatment for intracapsular   proximal femoral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es in the frail elderly.

Demographic   details, medical backround, details of the primary procedure, complications,   subsequent procedures requiring return to theatre, re-admissions,   discharge destination and death were collected.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 705 procedures were included; 428 Austin Moore and   277 Exeter Trauma Stems were used. A total of 34 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es (in 33   patients) required early return to theatre within 30 days. Age,   gender, laterality, time from admission to primary procedure, American   Society of Anesthesiologists grade, and implant type were similar   for those requiring early return to theatre and those who did not.   Early return to theatre was associated with a significantly higher   length of stay (mean 33.6 days (7 to 107) <i>versus</i> 18.6   days (0 to 152), p < 0.001), re-admission rate (38.2% <i>versus</i> 8.6%,   p < 0.001), and subsequent revision rate (17.6% <i>versus</i> 1.3%,   p < 0.001).

The use of ultra-low-dose CT scans for the evaluation of limb fractures
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To evaluate whether an ultra-low-dose CT protocol can diagnose   selected limb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es as well as conventional CT (C-CT).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We prospectively studied 40 conse<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong>ive patients with a limb   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e in whom a CT scan was indicated. These were scanned using   an ultra-low-dose CT Reduced Effective Dose Using Computed Tomography   In Orthopaedic Injury (REDUCTION) protocol. Studies from 16 selected   cases were compared with 16 C-CT scans matched for age, gender and   type of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>e. Studies were assessed for diagnosis and image   quality. Descriptive and reliability statistics were calculated.   The total effective radiation dose for each scanned site was compared.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean estimated effective dose (ED) for the REDUCTION protocol   was 0.03 milliSieverts (mSv) and 0.43 mSv (p < 0.005) for C-CT.   The sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value   (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the REDUCTION protocol   to detect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es were 0.98, 0.89, 0.98 and 0.89 respectively   when two occult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fractur</span></strong>es were excluded. Inter- and intra-observer   reliability for diagnosis using the REDUCTION protocol (κ = 0.75, κ =   0.71) were similar to those of C-CT (κ = 0.85, κ = 0.82).

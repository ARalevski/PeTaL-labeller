Does osteofibrous dysplasia progress to adamantinoma and how should they be treated?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to identify any progression between   benign osteofibrous dysplasia (OFD), OFD-like adamantinoma and malignant   adamantinoma, and to investigate the rates of local recurrence,   metastases and survival, in order to develop treatment algorithms   for each.</p></sec><sec><title><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s and Methods</title><p>A single institution retrospective review of all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s presenting   with OFD, OFD-like adamantinoma and adamantinoma between 1973 and   2012 was undertaken. Complete data were available for 73 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s   (42 with OFD; ten with an OFD-like adamantinoma and 21 with an adamantinoma).   The mean follow-up was 10.3 years (3 to 25) for OFD, 9.2 years (3.0   to 26.3) for OFD-like and 11.6 years (0.25 to 33) for adamantinoma.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean age at diagnosis for OFD was 13.5 years (1 to 49), 10.5   years (6 to 28) for OFD-like and 34 years (14 to 86) for adamantinoma.   A total of 24 of the 42 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with OFD (57%) have not required   any treatment and have been managed with observation. A total of   18 of the 42 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with OFD underwent surgery, 13 with curettage   and five with resection. In all, three <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s developed recurrence   following curettage (23%) but none following resection. All these   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s were cured with further limited surgery. A total of six   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s initially diagnosed with OFD were subsequently found to   have OFD-like adamantinoma. Of the ten <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s initially diagnosed   with OFD-like adamantinoma, three (30%) were managed with observation   alone and seven underwent surgery, two with curettage and five with   resection. Local recurrence arose in two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s, one each after   curettage and resection. No <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with either OFD or an OFD-like   adamantinoma developed metastases or had progression to adamantinoma.   All <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with an adamantinoma were treated by surgery, three   with curettage, six with amputation and 12 with excision. In all,   two of the three treated with curettage developed local recurrence, requiring   further surgery. Late development of both local recurrence and metastases   led to a ten year disease specific survival of 93% which had dropped   to 39% by 20 years.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We found no evidence of progression from OFD to adamantinoma.   Conservative management with observation or curettage is often successful   for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with OFD and OFD-like adamantinoma. Resection with   clear margins is required for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with adamantinoma. Late tumour   recurrence is not uncommon in adamantinoma and prolonged follow-up   should be considered.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:409–16.</p></sec>

Depression Treatment and 1-Year Mortality After Acute Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Depression among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is prevalent and associated with an adverse quality of life and prognosis. Despite recommendations from some national organizations to screen for depression, it is unclear whether treatment of depression in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with AMI is associated with better outcomes. We aimed to determine whether the prognosis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with treated versus untreated depression differs.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The TRIUMPH study (Translational Research Investigating Underlying Disparities in Acute Myocardial Infarction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s’ Health Status) is an observational multicenter cohort study that enrolled 4062 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s aged ≥18 years with AMI between April 11, 2005, and December 31, 2008, from 24 US hospitals. Research coordinators administered the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong> Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) during the index AMI admission. Depression was defined by a PHQ-9 score of ≥10. Depression was categorized as treated if there was documentation of a discharge diagnosis, medication prescribed for depression, or referral for counseling, and as untreated if none of these 3 criteria was documented in the medical records despite a PHQ score ≥10. One-year mortality was compared between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with AMI having: (1) no depression (PHQ-9<10; reference); (2) treated depression; and (3) untreated depression adjusting for demographics, AMI severity, and clinical factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, 759 (18.7%) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s met PHQ-9 criteria for depression and 231 (30.4%) were treated. In comparison with 3303 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s without depression, the 231 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with treated depression had 1-year mortality rates that were not different (6.1% versus 6.7%; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.12; 95% confidence interval, 0.63–1.99). In contrast, the 528 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with untreated depression had higher 1-year mortality in comparison with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s without depression (10.8% versus 6.1%; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.91; 95% confidence interval, 1.39–2.62).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Although depression in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with AMI is associated with increased long-term mortality, this association may be confined to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with untreated depression.</p></sec>

Pelvic reconstruction following resection of malignant bone tumours using a stemmed acetabular pedestal cup
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Pelvic reconstruction after the resection of a tumour around   the acetabulum is a challenging procedure due to the complex anatomy   and biomechanics. Several pelvic endoprostheses have been introduced,   but the rates of complication remain high. Our aim was to review   the use of a stemmed acetabular pedestal cup in the management of   these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s and Methods</title><p>The study involved 48 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s who underwent periacetabular reconstruction   using a stemmed pedestal cup (Schoellner cup; Zimmer Biomet Inc.,   Warsaw, Indiana) between 2000 and 2013. The indications for treatment included   a primary bone tumour in 27 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s and metastatic disease in 21   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s. The mean age of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s at the time of surgery was   52 years (16 to 83).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At a median follow-up of 6.6 years (95% confidence interval 4.6   to 8.2), local control was achieved in all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s; 19 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s   had died (16 of disease). Complications occurred in 19 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s   (40%), of which deep infection was the most common, affecting eight   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s (17%). Seven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s (15%) had a dislocation of the hip.   Aseptic loosening was found in three <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s (6%). Two (4%) underwent   hindquarter amputation for non-oncological reasons. The risk of   revision, with death being treated as a competing event, was 28%   at one year, 39% at five years and 48% at ten years post-operatively.   The mean Musculoskeletal Tumour Society Score at final follow-up   was 71% (27% to 93%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This type of reconstruction is a satisfactory option for the   treatment of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with a periacetabular tumour.

Acute Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non–ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) management has evolved considerably over the past 2 decades. Little information on mortality trends in the most recent years is available. We assessed trends in characteristics, treatments, and outcomes for acute myocardial infarction in France between 1995 and 2015.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used data from 5 one-month registries, conducted 5 years apart, from 1995 to 2015, including 14 423 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with acute myocardial infarction (59% STEMI) admitted to cardiac intensive care units in metropolitan France.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>From 1995 to 2015, mean age decreased from 66±14 to 63±14 years in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with STEMI; it remained stable (68±14 years) in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with NSTEMI, whereas diabetes mellitus, obesity, and hypertension increased. At the acute stage, intended primary percutaneous coronary intervention increased from 12% (1995) to 76% (2015) in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with STEMI. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with NSTEMI, percutaneous coronary intervention ≤72 hours from admission increased from 9% (1995) to 60% (2015). Six-month mortality consistently decreased in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with STEMI from 17.2% in 1995 to 6.9% in 2010 and 5.3% in 2015; it decreased from 17.2% to 6.9% in 2010 and 6.3% in 2015 in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with NSTEMI. Mortality still decreased after 2010 in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with STEMI without reperfusion therapy, whereas no further mortality gain was found in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with STEMI with reperfusion therapy or in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with NSTEMI, whether or not they were treated with percutaneous coronary intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Over the past 20 years, 6-month mortality after acute myocardial infarction has decreased considerably for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with STEMI and NSTEMI.

Race and Sex Differences in Post–Myocardial Infarction Angina Frequency and Risk of 1-Year Unplanned Rehospitalization
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Race and sex disparities in in-hospital treatment and outcomes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with acute myocardial infarction (MI) have been described, but little is known about race and sex differences in post-MI angina and long-term risk of unplanned rehospitalization. We examined race and sex differences in post-MI angina frequency and 1-year unplanned rehospitalization to identify factors associated with unplanned rehospitalization, testing for whether race and sex modify these relationships.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using TRANSLATE-ACS (Treatment With Adenosine Diphosphate Receptor Inhibitors: Longitudinal Assessment of Treatment Patterns and Events after Acute Coronary Syndrome) data, we examined 6-week and 1-year angina frequency and 1-year unplanned rehospitalization stratified by race and sex among MI <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s treated with percutaneous coronary intervention. We used multivariable logistic regression to assess factors associated with unplanned rehospitalization and tested for interactions among angina frequency, race, and sex.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 11 595 MI <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s survived to 1 year postdischarge; there were 66.6% white male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s, 24.3% white female <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s, 5.3% black male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s, and 3.8% black female <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s.

Clinical Outcomes in 3343 Children and Adults With Rheumatic Heart Disease From 14 Low- and Middle-Income Countries
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>There are few contemporary data on the mortality and morbidity associated with rheumatic heart disease or information on their predictors. We report the 2-year follow-up of individuals with rheumatic heart disease from 14 low- and middle-income countries in Africa and Asia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Between January 2010 and November 2012, we enrolled 3343 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s from 25 centers in 14 countries and followed them for 2 years to assess mortality, congestive heart failure, stroke or transient ischemic attack, recurrent acute rheumatic fever, and infective endocarditis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Vital status at 24 months was known for 2960 (88.5%) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s. Two-thirds were female. Although <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s were young (median age, 28 years; interquartile range, 18–40), the 2-year case fatality rate was high (500 deaths, 16.9%). Mortality rate was 116.3/1000 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>-years in the first year and 65.4/1000 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>-years in the second year. Median age at death was 28.7 years. Independent predictors of death were severe valve disease (hazard ratio [HR], 2.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.80–3.11), congestive heart failure (HR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.70–2.72), New York Heart Association functional class III/IV (HR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.32–2.10), atrial fibrillation (HR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.10–1.78), and older age (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01–1.02 per year increase) at enrollment. Postprimary education (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.54–0.85) and female sex (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.52–0.80) were associated with lower risk of death. Two hundred and four (6.9%) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s had new congestive heart failure (incidence, 38.42/1000 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>-years), 46 (1.6%) had a stroke or transient ischemic attack (8.45/1000 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>-years), 19 (0.6%) had recurrent acute rheumatic fever (3.49/1000 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>-years), and 20 (0.7%) had infective endocarditis (3.65/1000 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>-years). Previous stroke and older age were independent predictors of stroke/transient ischemic attack or systemic embolism. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s from low- and lower-middle–income countries had significantly higher age- and sex-adjusted mortality than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s from upper-middle–income countries.

Tuberculosis of the spine with severe angular kyphosis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To address the natural history of severe post-tuberculous (TB)   kyphosis, with focus upon the long-term neurological outcome, occurrence   of restrictive lung disease, and the effect on life expectancy. </p></sec><sec><title><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s and Methods</title><p>This is a retrospective clinical review of prospectively collected   imaging data based at a single institute. A total of 24 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s   of Southern Chinese origin who presented with spinal TB with a mean   of 113° of kyphosis (65° to 159°) who fulfilled inclusion criteria   were reviewed. Plain radiographs were used to assess the degree   of spinal deformity. Myelography, CT and MRI were used when available   to assess the integrity of the spinal cord and canal. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong> demographics,   age of onset of spinal TB and interventions, types of surgical procedure,   intra- and post-operative complications, and neurological status   were assessed. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>All except one of the 24 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s were treated with anti-TB chemotherapy   when they were first diagnosed with spinal TB. They subsequently   received surgery either for neurological deterioration, or deformity   correction in later life. The mean follow-up was 34 years (11 to   59) since these surgical interventions. Some 16 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s (66.7%) suffered   from late neurological deterioration at a mean of 26 years (8 to   49) after the initial drug treatment. The causes of neurological   deterioration were healed disease in nine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s (56.2%),    re-activation in six <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s (37.5%) and adjacent level spinal   stenosis in one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong> (6.3%). The result of surgery was worse   in healed disease. Eight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s without neurological deterioration   received surgery to correct the kyphosis. The mean correction ranged   from 97° to 72°. Three <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s who were clinically quiescent with   no neurological deterioration were found to have active TB of the   spine. Solid fusion was achieved in all cases and no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong> suffered   from neurological deterioration after 42 years of follow-up. On   final follow-up, six <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s were noted to have deceased (age range:   47 years to 75 years).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study presents one of the longest assessments of spinal TB   with severe kyphosis. Severe post-TB kyphosis may lead to significant   health problems many years following the initial drug treatment.   Early surgical correction of the kyphosis, solid fusion and regular   surveillance may avoid late complications. Paraplegia, restrictive   lung disease and early onset kyphosis might relate to early death.   Clinically quiescent disease does not mean cure. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1381–8.</p></sec>

Atrial Fibrillation Burden in Young Patients With Congenital Heart Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with congenital heart disease (CHD) are assumed to be vulnerable to atrial fibrillation (AF) as a result of residual shunts, anomalous vessel anatomy, progressive valvulopathy, hypertension, and atrial scars from previous heart surgery. However, the risk of developing AF and the complications associated with AF in children and young adults with CHD have not been compared with those in control subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data from the Swedish <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong> and Cause of Death registers were used to identify all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with a diagnosis of CHD who were born from 1970 to 1993. Each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong> with CHD was matched by birth year, sex, and county with 10 control subjects from the Total Population Register in Sweden. Follow-up data were collected until 2011.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 21 982 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s (51.6% men) with CHD and 219 816 matched control subjects, 654 and 328 developed AF, respectively. The mean follow-up was 27 years. The risk of developing AF was 21.99 times higher (95% confidence interval, 19.26–25.12) in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with CHD than control subjects. According to a hierarchical CHD classification, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with conotruncal defects had the highest risk (hazard ratio, 84.27; 95% confidence interval, 56.86–124.89). At the age of 42 years, 8.3% of all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with CHD had a recorded diagnosis of AF. Heart failure was the quantitatively most important complication in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with CHD and AF, with a 10.7% (70 of 654) recorded diagnosis of heart failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The risk of AF in children and young adults with CHD was 22 times higher than that in matched control subjects. Up to the age of 42 years, 1 of 12 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with CHD had developed AF, and 1 of 10 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with CHD with AF had developed heart failure.

Interhospital Transfer Before Thrombectomy Is Associated With Delayed Treatment and Worse Outcome in the STRATIS Registry (Systematic Evaluation of Patients Treated With Neurothrombectomy Devices for Acute Ischemic Stroke)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Endovascular treatment with mechanical thrombectomy (MT) is beneficial for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with acute stroke suffering a large-vessel occlusion, although treatment efficacy is highly time-dependent. We hypothesized that interhospital transfer to endovascular-capable centers would result in treatment delays and worse clinical outcomes compared with direct presentation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>STRATIS (Systematic Evaluation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s Treated With Neurothrombectomy Devices for Acute Ischemic Stroke) was a prospective, multicenter, observational, single-arm study of real-world MT for acute stroke because of anterior-circulation large-vessel occlusion performed at 55 sites over 2 years, including 1000 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with severe stroke and treated within 8 hours. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s underwent MT with or without intravenous tissue plasminogen activator and were admitted to endovascular-capable centers via either interhospital transfer or direct presentation. The primary clinical outcome was functional independence (modified Rankin Score 0–2) at 90 days. We assessed (1) real-world time metrics of stroke care delivery, (2) outcome differences between direct and transfer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s undergoing MT, and (3) the potential impact of local hospital bypass.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 984 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s were analyzed. Median onset-to-revascularization time was 202.0 minutes for direct versus 311.5 minutes for transfer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s (<i>P</i><0.001). Clinical outcomes were better in the direct group, with 60.0% (299/498) achieving functional independence compared with 52.2% (213/408) in the transfer group (odds ratio, 1.38; 95% confidence interval, 1.06–1.79; <i>P</i>=0.02). Likewise, excellent outcome (modified Rankin Score 0–1) was achieved in 47.4% (236/498) of direct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s versus 38.0% (155/408) of transfer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s (odds ratio, 1.47; 95% confidence interval, 1.13–1.92; <i>P</i>=0.005). Mortality did not differ between the 2 groups (15.1% for direct, 13.7% for transfer; <i>P</i>=0.55). Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator did not impact outcomes. Hypothetical bypass modeling for all transferred <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s suggested that intravenous tissue plasminogen activator would be delayed by 12 minutes, but MT would be performed 91 minutes sooner if <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s were routed directly to endovascular-capable centers. If bypass is limited to a 20-mile radius from onset, then intravenous tissue plasminogen activator would be delayed by 7 minutes and MT performed 94 minutes earlier.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In this large, real-world study, interhospital transfer was associated with significant treatment delays and lower chance of good outcome. Strategies to facilitate more rapid identification of large-vessel occlusion and direct routing to endovascular-capable centers for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with severe stroke may improve outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Phenotypic Characterization of <i>EIF2AK4</i> Mutation Carriers in a Large Cohort of Patients Diagnosed Clinically With Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare disease with an emerging genetic basis. Heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding the bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 (<i>BMPR2</i>) are the commonest genetic cause of PAH, whereas biallelic mutations in the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 4 gene (<i>EIF2AK4</i>) are described in pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis. Here, we determine the frequency of these mutations and define the genotype-phenotype characteristics in a large cohort of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s diagnosed clinically with PAH.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Whole-genome sequencing was performed on DNA from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with idiopathic and heritable PAH and with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis recruited to the National Institute of Health Research BioResource–Rare Diseases study. Heterozygous variants in <i>BMPR2</i> and biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> variants with a minor allele frequency of <1:10 000 in control data sets and predicted to be deleterious (by combined annotation-dependent depletion, PolyPhen-2, and <i>sorting intolerant from tolerant</i> predictions) were identified as potentially causal. Phenotype data from the time of diagnosis were also captured.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Eight hundred sixty-four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with idiopathic or heritable PAH and 16 with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis were recruited. Mutations in <i>BMPR2</i> were identified in 130 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s (14.8%). Biallelic mutations in <i>EIF2AK4</i> were identified in 5 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with a clinical diagnosis of pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis. Furthermore, 9 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with a clinical diagnosis of PAH carried biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutations. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s had a reduced transfer coefficient for carbon monoxide (K<sc>co</sc>; 33% [interquartile range, 30%–35%] predicted) and younger age at diagnosis (29 years; interquartile range, 23–38 years) and more interlobular septal thickening and mediastinal lymphadenopathy on computed tomography of the chest compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with PAH without <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutations. However, radiological assessment alone could not accurately identify biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutation carriers. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with PAH with biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutations had a shorter survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutations are found in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s classified clinically as having idiopathic and heritable PAH. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s cannot be identified reliably by computed tomography, but a low K<sc>co</sc> and a young age at diagnosis suggests the underlying molecular diagnosis. Genetic testing can identify these misclassified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s, allowing appropriate management and early referral for lung transplantation.</p></sec>

Age and Outcomes of Primary Prevention Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators in Patients With Nonischemic Systolic Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The DANISH study (Danish Study to Assess the Efficacy of ICDs [Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators] in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s With Non-Ischemic Systolic Heart Failure on Mortality) did not demonstrate an overall effect on all-cause mortality with ICD implantation. However, the prespecified subgroup analysis suggested a possible age-dependent association between ICD implantation and mortality with survival benefit seen only in the youngest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s. The nature of this relationship between age and outcome of a primary prevention ICD in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with nonischemic systolic heart failure warrants further investigation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>All 1116 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s from the DANISH study were included in this prespecified subgroup analysis. We assessed the relationship between ICD implantation and mortality by age, and an optimal age cutoff was estimated nonparametrically with selection impact curves. Modes of death were divided into sudden cardiac death and nonsudden death and compared between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s younger and older than this age cutoff with the use of χ<sup>2</sup> analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Median age of the study population was 63 years (range, 21–84 years). There was a linearly decreasing relationship between ICD and mortality with age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.003–1.06; <i>P</i>=0.03). An optimal age cutoff for ICD implantation was present at ≤70 years. There was an association between reduced all-cause mortality and ICD in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s ≤70 years of age (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.51–0.96; <i>P</i>=0.03) but not in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s >70 years of age (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.68–1.62; <i>P</i>=0.84). For <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s ≤70 years old, the sudden cardiac death rate was 1.8 (95% CI, 1.3–2.5) and nonsudden death rate was 2.7 (95% CI, 2.1–3.5) events per 100 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>-years, whereas for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s >70 years old, the sudden cardiac death rate was 1.6 (95% CI, 0.8–3.2) and nonsudden death rate was 5.4 (95% CI, 3.7–7.8) events per 100 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>-years.

Risk for Major Bleeding in Patients Receiving Ticagrelor Compared With Aspirin After Transient Ischemic Attack or Acute Ischemic Stroke in the SOCRATES Study (Acute Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack Treated With Aspirin or Ticagrelor and Patient Outcomes)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with minor acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack are at high risk for subsequent stroke, and more potent antiplatelet therapy in the acute setting is needed. However, the potential benefit of more intense antiplatelet therapy must be assessed in relation to the risk for major bleeding. The SOCRATES trial (Acute Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack Treated With Aspirin or Ticagrelor and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong> Outcomes) was the first trial with ticagrelor in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack in which the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor were compared with those of aspirin. The main safety objective was assessment of PLATO (Platelet Inhibition and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong> Outcomes)–defined major bleeds on treatment, with special focus on intracranial hemorrhage (ICrH).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>An independent adjudication committee blinded to study treatment classified bleeds according to the PLATO, TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction), and GUSTO (Global Use of Strategies to Open Occluded Coronary Arteries) definitions. The definitions of ICrH and major bleeding excluded cerebral microbleeds and asymptomatic hemorrhagic transformations of cerebral infarctions so that the definitions better discriminated important events in the acute stroke population.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 13 130 of 13 199 randomized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s received at least 1 dose of study drug and were included in the safety analysis set. PLATO major bleeds occurred in 31 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s (0.5%) on ticagrelor and 38 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s (0.6%) on aspirin (hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.52–1.34). The most common locations of major bleeds were intracranial and gastrointestinal. ICrH was reported in 12 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s (0.2%) on ticagrelor and 18 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s (0.3%) on aspirin. Thirteen of all 30 ICrHs (4 on ticagrelor and 9 on aspirin) were hemorrhagic strokes, and 4 (2 in each group) were symptomatic hemorrhagic transformations of brain infarctions. The ICrHs were spontaneous in 6 and 13, traumatic in 3 and 3, and procedural in 3 and 2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s on ticagrelor and aspirin, respectively. In total, 9 fatal bleeds occurred on ticagrelor and 4 on aspirin. The composite of ICrH or fatal bleeding included 15 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s on ticagrelor and 18 on aspirin. Independently of bleeding classification, PLATO, TIMI, or GUSTO, the relative difference between treatments for major/severe bleeds was similar. Nonmajor bleeds were more common on ticagrelor.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack showed a bleeding profile similar to that of aspirin for major bleeds.

Medical Therapy for Secondary Prevention and Long-Term Outcome in Patients With Myocardial Infarction With Nonobstructive Coronary Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) occurs in 5% to 10% of all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with myocardial infarction. Clinical trials of secondary prevention treatment in MINOCA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s are lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the associations between treatment with statins, renin-angiotensin system blockers, β-blockers, dual antiplatelet therapy, and long-term cardiovascular events.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This is an observational study of MINOCA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s recorded in the SWEDEHEART registry (the Swedish Web-system for Enhancement and Development of Evidence-based care in Heart disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapy) between July 2003 and June 2013 and followed until December 2013 for outcome events in the Swedish Cause of Death Register and National <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong> Register. Of 199 162 myocardial infarction admissions, 9466 consecutive unique <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with MINOCA were identified. Among those, the 9136 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s surviving the first 30 days after discharge constituted the study population. Mean age was 65.3 years, and 61% were women. No <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong> was lost to follow-up. A stratified propensity score analysis was performed to match treated and untreated groups. The association between treatment and outcome was estimated by comparing between treated and untreated groups by using Cox proportional hazards models. The exposures were treatment at discharge with statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, β-blockers, and dual antiplatelet therapy. The primary end point was major adverse cardiac events defined as all-cause mortality, hospitalization for myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and heart failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>At discharge, 84.5%, 64.1%, 83.4%, and 66.4% of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s were on statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, β-blockers, and dual antiplatelet therapy, respectively. During the follow-up of a mean of 4.1 years, 2183 (23.9%) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s experienced a major adverse cardiac event. The hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for major adverse cardiac events were 0.77 (0.68–0.87), 0.82 (0.73–0.93), and 0.86 (0.74–1.01) in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s on statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, and β-blockers, respectively. For <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s on dual antiplatelet therapy followed for 1 year, the hazard ratio was 0.90 (0.74–1.08).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The results indicate long-term beneficial effects of treatment with statins and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers on outcome in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with MINOCA, a trend toward a positive effect of β-blocker treatment, and a neutral effect of dual antiplatelet therapy. Properly powered randomized clinical trials to confirm these results are warranted.</p></sec>

The stability of the hip after the use of a proximal femoral endoprosthesis for oncological indications
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Instability of the hip is the most common mode of failure after   reconstruction with a proximal femoral arthroplasty (PFA) using   an endoprosthesis after excision of a tumour. Small studies report   improved stability with capsular repair of the hip and other techniques,   but these have not been investigated in a large series of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s.   The aim of this study was to evaluate variables associated with   the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong> and the operation that affect post-operative stability.   We hypothesised an association between capsular repair and stability.</p></sec><sec><title><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s and Methods</title><p>In a retrospective cohort study, we identified 527 adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s   who were treated with a PFA for tumours. Our data included demographics,   the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patholog</span></strong>ical diagnosis, the amount of resection of the abductor   muscles, the techniques of reconstruction and the characteristics   of the implant. We used regression analysis to compare <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s   with and without post-operative instability.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 20 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s out of 527 (4%) had instability which   presented at a mean of 35 days (3 to 131) post-operatively. Capsular   repair was not associated with a reduced rate of instability. Bivariate   analysis showed that a posterolateral surgical approach (odds ratio   (OR) 0.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 0.86) and the type   of implant (p = 0.046) had a significant association with reduced   instability; age > 60 years predicted instability (OR 3.17, 95%   CI 1.00 to 9.98). Multivariate analysis showed age > 60 years (OR   5.09, 95% CI 1.23 to 21.07), female gender (OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.04   to 2.89), a malignant primary bone tumour (OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.06   to 3.95), and benign condition (OR 5.56, 95% CI 1.35 to 22.90),   but not metastatic disease or soft-tissue tumours, predicted instability,   while a posterolateral approach (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.53) was   protective against instability. No instability occurred when a synthetic   graft was used in 70 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Stability of the hip after PFA is influenced by variables associated   with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patholog</span></strong>y, the surgical technique and the   implant.

Multiple limb salvage attempts for diabetic foot infections
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Limb salvage for diabetic foot infections often require multiple   procedures. Some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s will eventually end up with below knee   amputation (BKA) when all limb salvage attempts fail. We seek to   study the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s’ ability to return to normal life, functional   status, prosthesis usage and perspectives on multiple limb salvage   procedures that culminated in BKA to review if they would undertake   a similar path if their situation was repeated.</p></sec><sec><title><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s and Methods</title><p>A total of 41 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s who underwent BKA between July 2011 and   June 2013 were reviewed.

Mid-term outcomes of routine proximal row carpectomy compared with proximal row carpectomy with dorsal capsular interposition arthroplasty for the treatment of late-stage arthropathy of the wrist
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aims of this study were to compare the mid-term outcomes   of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with late-stage arthritis of the wrist treated with   proximal row carpectomy (PRC) and dorsal capsular interposition   (DCI) arthroplasty with a matched cohort treated with routine PRC   alone.</p></sec><sec><title><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s and Methods</title><p>A total of 25 arthritic wrists (24 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s) with pre-existing   degenerative changes of the proximal capitate and/or the lunate   fossa of the radius were treated with PRC + DCI over a ten-year   period. This group of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s were matched 1:2 with a group of   50 wrists (48 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s) without degenerative changes in the capitate   or lunate fossa that were treated with a routine PRC alone during   the same period. The mean age of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s at the time of surgery   was 56.8 years (25 to 81), and the demographics and baseline range   of movement of the wrist, grip strength, Quick Disabilities of the   Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (QuickDASH) score, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>-Rated Wrist   Evaluation (PRWE) score were similar in both groups. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At a mean follow-up of 5.9 years (1.8 to 11.8), significant improvements   in mean grip strength, the flexion-extension arc of movement of   the wrist, QuickDASH, and PRWE scores were seen in both groups.   There was no diifference between the groups for any of the outcomes.   One <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong> in the PRC + DCI group required additional surgery for   a deep infection, while two in the PRC group had complications (one   wound dehiscence requiring revision closure, one transient radial   sensory neuritis).

Oral Anticoagulation in Very Elderly Patients With Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Stroke prevention with oral anticoagulants (OACs) is the cornerstone for the management of atrial fibrillation (AF). However, data about the use of OACs among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s ≥90 years of age are limited. We aimed to investigate the risk of ischemic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and the net clinical benefit of OAC treatment for very elderly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with AF (≥90 years of age).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This study used the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. Risks of ischemic stroke and ICH were compared between 11 064 and 14 658 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with and without AF ≥90 years of age without antithrombotic therapy from 1996 to 2011. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with AF (n=15 756) were divided into 3 groups (no treatment, antiplatelet agents, and warfarin), and the risks of stroke and ICH were analyzed. The risks of ischemic stroke and ICH were further compared between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s treated with warfarin and nonvitamin K antagonist OACs (NOACs) from 2012 to 2015 when NOACs were available in Taiwan.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s without AF, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with AF had an increased risk of ischemic stroke (event number/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong> number, incidence = 742/11 064, 5.75%/y versus 1399/14 658, 3.00%/y; hazard ratio, 1.93; 95% confidence interval, 1.74–2.14) and similar risk of ICH (131/11 064, 0.97%/y versus 206/14 658, 0.54%/y; hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.66–1.09) in competing risk analysis for mortality. Among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with AF, warfarin use was associated with a lower stroke risk (39/617, 3.83%/y versus 742/11 064, 5.75%/y; hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.49–0.96 in a competing risk model), with no difference in ICH risk compared with nontreatment. When compared with no antithrombotic therapy or antiplatelet drugs, warfarin was associated with a positive net clinical benefit. These findings persisted in propensity-matched analyses. Compared with warfarin, NOACs were associated with a lower risk of ICH (4/978, 0.42%/y versus 19/768, 1.63%/y; hazard ratio, 0.32; 95% confidence interval, 0.10–0.97 in a competing risk model), with no difference in risk of ischemic stroke.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with AF ≥90 years of age, warfarin was associated with a lower risk of ischemic stroke and positive net clinical benefit.

Benefit of Adding Ezetimibe to Statin Therapy on Cardiovascular Outcomes and Safety in Patients With Versus Without Diabetes Mellitus
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Ezetimibe, when added to simvastatin, reduces cardiovascular events after acute coronary syndrome.

The primary composite end point was cardiovascular death, major coronary events, and stroke. DM was a prespecified subgroup.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The 4933 (27%) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with DM were more often older and female, had had a prior myocardial infarction and revascularization, and presented more frequently with non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s without DM (each <i>P</i><0.001). The median admission low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was lower among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with DM (89 versus 97 mg/dL, <i>P</i><0.001). E/S achieved a significantly lower median time-weighted average low-density lipoprotein cholesterol compared with placebo/simvastatin, irrespective of DM (DM: 49 versus 67 mg/dL; no DM: 55 versus 71 mg/dL; both <i>P</i><0.001). In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with DM, E/S reduced the 7-year Kaplan–Meier primary end point event rate by 5.5% absolute (hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.78-0.94); in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s without DM, the absolute difference was 0.7% (hazard ratio, 0.98; 95% confidence interval, 0.91–1.04; <i>P</i><sub>int</sub>=0.02). The largest relative reductions in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with DM were in myocardial infarction (24%) and ischemic stroke (39%).

Coronary Plaque Characterization in Psoriasis Reveals High-Risk Features That Improve After Treatment in a Prospective Observational Study
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory disease associated with an accelerated risk of myocardial infarction, provides an ideal human model to study inflammatory atherogenesis in vivo. We hypothesized that the increased cardiovascular risk observed in psoriasis would be partially attributable to an elevated subclinical coronary artery disease burden composed of noncalcified plaques with high-risk features. However, inadequate efforts have been made to directly measure coronary artery disease in this vulnerable population. As such, we sought to compare total coronary plaque burden and noncalcified coronary plaque burden (NCB) and high-risk plaque (HRP) prevalence between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with psoriasis (n=105), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with hyperlipidemia eligible for statin therapy under National Cholesterol Education Program-Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines (n=100) who were ≈10 years older, and healthy volunteers without psoriasis (n=25).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s underwent coronary computed-tomography angiography for total coronary plaque burden and NCB quantification and HRP identification, defined as low attenuation (<30 hounsfield units), positive remodeling (>1.10), and spotty calcification. A consecutive sample of the first 50 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with psoriasis was scanned again 1 year after therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Despite being younger and at lower traditional risk than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with hyperlipidemia, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with psoriasis had increased NCB (mean±SD: 1.18±0.33 versus 1.11±0.32, <i>P</i>=0.02) and similar HRP prevalence (<i>P</i>=0.58). Furthermore, compared to healthy volunteers, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with psoriasis had increased total coronary plaque burden (1.22±0.31 versus 1.04±0.22, <i>P</i>=0.001), NCB (1.18±0.33 versus 1.03±0.21, <i>P</i>=0.004), and HRP prevalence beyond traditional risk (odds ratio, 6.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.1–31.7; <i>P</i>=0.03). Last, among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with psoriasis followed for 1 year, improvement in psoriasis severity was associated with improvement in total coronary plaque burden (β=0.45, 0.23–0.67; <i>P</i><0.001) and NCB (β=0.53, 0.32–0.74; <i>P</i><0.001) beyond traditional risk factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with psoriasis had greater NCB and increased HRP prevalence than healthy volunteers. In addition, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with psoriasis had elevated NCB and equivalent HRP prevalence as older <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with hyperlipidemia. Last, modulation of target organ inflammation (eg, skin) was associated with an improvement in NCB at 1 year, suggesting that control of remote sites of inflammation may translate into reduced coronary artery disease risk.</p></sec>

Brain Emboli After Left Ventricular Endocardial Ablation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Catheter ablation for ventricular tachycardia and premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) is common. Catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation is associated with a risk of cerebral emboli attributed to cardioversions and numerous ablation lesions in the low-flow left atrium, but cerebral embolic risk in ventricular ablation has not been evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We enrolled 18 consecutive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s meeting study criteria scheduled for ventricular tachycardia or PVC ablation over a 9-month period. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s undergoing left ventricular (LV) ablation were compared with a control group of those undergoing right ventricular ablation only. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s were excluded if they had implantable cardioverter defibrillators or permanent pacemakers. Radiofrequency energy was used for ablation in all cases and heparin was administered with goal-activated clotting times of 300 to 400 seconds for all LV procedures. Pre- and postprocedural brain MRI was performed on each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong> within a week of the ablation procedure. Embolic infarcts were defined as new foci of reduced diffusion and high signal intensity on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery brain MRI within a vascular distribution.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The mean age was 58 years, half of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s were men, half had a history of hypertension, and the majority had no known vascular disease or heart failure.

Prognostic Value of N-Terminal Pro-B-Type Natriuretic Peptide, Troponin-T, and Growth-Differentiation Factor 15 in Adult Congenital Heart Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) is rapidly increasing. To optimize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong> management, there is a great need to accurately identify high-risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s. Still, no biomarker has been firmly established as a clinically useful prognostic tool in this group. We studied the association of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), high-sensitive troponin-T, and growth-differentiation factor 15 with cardiovascular events in ACHD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Clinically stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with ACHD who routinely visited the out<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong> clinic between April 2011 and April 2013 underwent clinical assessment, electrocardiography, echocardiography, and biomarker measurement (NT-proBNP, high-sensitive troponin-T, and growth-differentiation factor 15) at the time of study inclusion. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s were prospectively followed for the occurrence of cardiovascular events (death, heart failure, hospitalization, arrhythmia, thromboembolic events, and reintervention). Survival curves were derived by the Kaplan-Meier method, and Cox regression was performed to investigate the relation between biomarkers and events with adjustment for multiple clinical and echocardiographic variables.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In total, 595 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s were included (median age, 33 years; interquartile range, 25–41 years; 58% male; 90% New York Heart Association class I). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s were followed during a median of 42 (interquartile range, 37–46) months. Of the 3 evaluated biomarkers, NT-proBNP in the upper quartile (>33.3 pmol/L) was most strongly associated with cardiovascular events (n=165, adjusted hazard ratio, 9.05 [3.24–25.3], <i>P</i><0.001) and with death or heart failure (n=50, adjusted hazard ratio, 16.0 [2.04–126], <i>P</i><0.001). When NT-proBNP was analyzed as a continuous variable, similar findings were retrieved. The cumulative proportion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with death and heart failure was only 1% in the lowest 2 NT-proBNP quartiles. Elevated NT-proBNP (>14 pmol/L), elevated high-sensitive troponin-T (>14 ng/L), and elevated growth-differentiation factor 15 (>1109 ng/L) identified those <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s at highest risk of cardiovascular events (log-rank <i>P</i><0.0001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>NT-proBNP provides prognostic information beyond a conventional risk marker model in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with ACHD and can reliably exclude the risk of death and heart failure. Elevated levels of NT-proBNP, high-sensitive troponin-T, and growth-differentiation factor 15 identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s at highest risk of cardiovascular events. These biomarkers therefore may play an important role in the monitoring and management of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with ACHD.</p></sec>

β<sub>2</sub>-Glycoprotein I/IgA Immune Complexes
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Antiphospholipid syndrome is characterized by recurrent thrombosis and gestational morbidity in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with antiphospholipid autoantibodies (aPLs). Predictive value of the presence of aPLs is low, and new markers are necessary to identify aPL carriers at higher risk and take preventive measures on them. The presence of circulating immune complexes of IgA bound to β<sub>2</sub>-glycoprotein I (B2A-CIC) has been associated with occurrence of acute thrombotic events. In this work we study its possible predictive value for the appearance of acute thrombotic events in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s who are going to undergo transplant surgery, a well-known trigger of acute thrombotic events in aPL carriers.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed a follow-up study based on the Magnum 12+12 Cohort of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s who received a kidney transplant (n=1339). Three groups were established: group 1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s who were positive for IgA anti-β<sub>2</sub>-glycoprotein I (aB2GP1) and B2A-CIC (n=125); group 2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s who were positive only for IgA aB2GP1 (n=240); and control group, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s who were negative for IgA aB2GP1 (n=974). Levels of autoantibodies and B2A-CIC were quantified immediately before the transplant surgery and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s were followed up for 6 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In group 1, 46.4% of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s experienced any type of thrombosis versus 10.4% in group 2 (<i>P</i><0.001) and 8.6% in the control group (<i>P</i><0.001). The incidence of graft thrombosis in group 1 (31.2%) was significantly higher than that observed in group 2 (3.3%, <i>P</i><0.001) and the control group (2.6%, <i>P</i><0.001). In a multivariate analysis, the presence of B2A-CIC was an independent variable to experience any type of posttransplant thrombosis (hazard ratio, 6.72; 95% confidence interval, 4.81–9.37) and, prominently, for graft thrombosis (hazard ratio, 14.75; 95% confidence interval, 9.11–23.89). No significant differences were found between B2A-CIC–negative and control group <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The presence of B2A-CIC is a predictor of acute thrombotic events. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s who were positive for IgA aB2GP1 only are at risk of experiencing thrombosis if they are B2A-CIC positive. If they are B2A-CIC–negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s, they have the same risk as the control group.

Patients With Long-QT Syndrome Caused by Impaired <i>hERG</i>-Encoded K<sub>v</sub>11.1 Potassium Channel Have Exaggerated Endocrine Pancreatic and Incretin Function Associated With Reactive Hypoglycemia
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Loss-of-function mutations in <i>hERG</i> (encoding the K<sub>v</sub>11.1 voltage-gated potassium channel) cause long-QT syndrome type 2 (LQT2) because of prolonged cardiac repolarization. However, K<sub>v</sub>11.1 is also present in pancreatic α and β cells and intestinal L and K cells, secreting glucagon, insulin, and the incretins glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide), respectively. These hormones are crucial for glucose regulation, and long-QT syndrome may cause disturbed glucose regulation. We measured secretion of these hormones and cardiac repolarization in response to glucose ingestion in LQT2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with functional mutations in <i>hERG</i> and matched healthy participants, testing the hypothesis that LQT2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s have increased incretin and β-cell function and decreased α-cell function, and thus lower glucose levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Eleven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with LQT2 and 22 sex-, age-, and body mass index–matched control participants underwent a 6-hour 75-g oral glucose tolerance test with ECG recording and blood sampling for measurements of glucose, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, GLP-1, and GIP.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In comparison with matched control participants, LQT2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s had 56% to 78% increased serum insulin, serum C-peptide, plasma GLP-1, and plasma GIP responses (<i>P</i>=0.03–0.001) and decreased plasma glucose levels after glucose ingestion (<i>P</i>=0.02) with more symptoms of hypoglycemia (<i>P</i>=0.04). Sixty-three percent of LQT2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s developed hypoglycemic plasma glucose levels (<70 mg/dL) versus 36% control participants (<i>P</i>=0.16), and 18% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s developed serious hypoglycemia (<50 mg/dL) versus none of the controls. LQT2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s had defective glucagon responses to low glucose, <i>P</i>=0.008. β-Cell function (Insulin Secretion Sensitivity Index-2) was 2-fold higher in LQT2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s than in controls (4398 [95% confidence interval, 2259–8562] versus 2156 [1961–3201], <i>P</i>=0.03). Pharmacological K<sub>v</sub>11.1 blockade (dofetilide) in rats had similar effect, and small interfering RNA inhibition of <i>hERG</i> in β and L cells increased insulin and GLP-1 secretion up to 50%. Glucose ingestion caused cardiac repolarization disturbances with increased QTc intervals in both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s and controls, but with a 122% greater increase in QTcF interval in LQT2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s (<i>P</i>=0.004).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Besides a prolonged cardiac repolarization phase, LQT2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s display increased GLP-1, GIP, and insulin secretion and defective glucagon secretion, causing decreased plasma glucose and thus increased risk of hypoglycemia.

Distribution of Estimated 10-Year Risk of Recurrent Vascular Events and Residual Risk in a Secondary Prevention Population
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with clinically manifest vascular disease, the risk of recurrent vascular events is likely to vary. We assessed the distribution of estimated 10-year risk of recurrent vascular events in a secondary prevention population. We also estimated the potential risk reduction and residual risk that can be achieved if <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s reach guideline-recommended risk factor targets.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The SMART score (Second Manifestations of Arterial Disease) for 10-year risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, or vascular death was applied to 6904 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with vascular disease. The risk score was externally validated in 18 436 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with various manifestations of vascular disease from the TNT (Treating to New Targets), IDEAL (Incremental Decrease in End Points Through Aggressive Lipid Lowering), SPARCL (Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels), and CAPRIE (Clopidogrel Versus Aspirin in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s at Risk of Ischemic Events) trials. The residual risk at guideline-recommended targets was estimated by applying relative risk reductions from meta-analyses to the estimated risk for targets for systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, physical activity, and use of antithrombotic agents.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The external performance of the SMART risk score was reasonable, apart from overestimation of risk in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with 10-year risk >40%. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with various manifestations of vascular disease, median 10-year risk of a recurrent major vascular event was 17% (interquartile range, 11%–28%), varying from <10% in 18% to >30% in 22% of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s. If risk factors were at guideline-recommended targets, the residual 10-year risk would be <10% in 47% and >30% in 9% of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s (median, 11%; interquartile range, 7%–17%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with vascular disease, there is very substantial variation in estimated 10-year risk of recurrent vascular events. If all modifiable risk factors were at guideline-recommended targets, half of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s would have a 10-year risk <10%. These data suggest that even with optimal treatment, many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with vascular disease will remain at >20% and even >30% 10-year risk, clearly delineating an area of substantial unmet medical need.</p></sec>

Unsatisfactory outcomes following unicompartmental knee arthroplasty in patients with partial thickness cartilage loss
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>While medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is indicated   for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with full-thickness cartilage loss, it is occasionally   used to treat those with partial-thickness loss. The aim of this   study was to investigate the five-year outcomes in a consecutive   series of UKAs used in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with partial thickness cartilage   loss in the medial compartment of the knee.</p></sec><sec><title><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s and Methods</title><p>Between 2002 and 2014, 94 consecutive UKAs were undertaken in   90 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with partial thickness cartilage loss and followed up   independently for a mean of six years (1 to 13). These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s   had partial thickness cartilage loss either on both femur and tibia   (13 knees), or on either the femur or the tibia, with full thickness   loss on the other surface of the joint (18 and 63 knees respectively).   Using propensity score analysis, these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s were matched 1:2 based   on age, gender and pre-operative Oxford Knee Score (OKS) with knees   with full thickness loss on both the femur and tibia. The functional   outcomes, implant survival and incidence of re-operations were assessed   at one, two and five years post-operatively. A subgroup of 36 knees   in 36 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with partial thickness cartilage loss, who had pre-operative   MRI scans, was assessed to identify whether there were any factors   identified on MRI that predicted the outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Knees with partial thickness cartilage loss had significantly   worse functional outcomes at one, two and five years post-operatively   compared with those with full thickness loss. A quarter of knees   with partial thickness loss had a fair or poor result and a fifth   failed to achieve a clinically significant improvement in OKS from   a baseline of four points or more; double that seen in knees with   full thickness loss. Whilst there was no difference in implant survival between   the groups, the rate of re-operation in knees with partial thickness   loss was three times higher. Most of the re-operations (three-quarters),   were arthroscopies for persistent pain.</p><p>Compared with those achieving good or excellent outcomes, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s   with partial thickness cartilage loss who achieved fair or poor   outcomes were younger and had worse pre-operative functional scores.   However, there were no other differences in the baseline demographics.   MRI findings of full thickness cartilage loss, subchondral oedema,   synovitis or effusion did not provide additional prognostic information.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Medial UKA should be reserved for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with full thickness   cartilage loss on both the femur and tibia. Whilst some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s   with partial thickness loss achieve a good result we cannot currently   identify which these will be and in this situation MRI is unhelpful   and misleading.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:475–82.</p></sec>

Delays in the diagnosis and treatment of bone and joint tuberculosis in the United Kingdom
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Tuberculosis (TB) infection of bones and joints accounts for   6.7% of TB cases in England, and is associated with significant   morbidity and disability. Public Health England reports that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s   with TB experience delays in diagnosis and treatment. Our aims were   to determine the demographics, presentation and investigation of   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with a TB infection of bones and joints, to help doctors   assessing potential cases and to identify avoidable delays.</p></sec><sec><title><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s and Methods</title><p>This was a retrospective observational study of all adults with   positive TB cultures on specimens taken at a tertiary orthopaedic   centre between June 2012 and May 2014.

The demographics, clinical presentation,   radiology, histo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patholog</span></strong>y and key clinical dates were obtained from   medical records.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 31 adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s were identified. Their median age   was 37 years (interquartile range (IQR): 29 to 53); 21 (68%) were   male; 89% were migrants. The main sites affected were joints (10,   32%), the spine (8, 26%) and long bones (6, 19%); 8 (26%) had multifocal   disease. The most common presenting symptoms were pain (29/31, 94%)   and swelling (26/28, 93%). ‘Typical’ symptoms of TB, such as fever,   sweats and weight loss, were uncommon. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s waited a median   of seven months (IQR 3 to 13.5) between the onset of symptoms and referral   to the tertiary centre and 2.3 months (IQR 1.6 to 3.4.)) between   referral and starting treatment.

Hemiarthroplasty proximal femoral endoprostheses following tumour reconstruction
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Dislocation rates are reportedly lower in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s requiring   proximal femoral hemiarthroplasty than for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s undergoing hip   arthroplasty for neoplasia. Without acetabular replacement, pain   due to acetabular wear necessitating revision surgery has been described.   We aimed to determine whether wear of the native acetabulum following   hemiarthroplasty necessitates revision surgery with secondary replacement   of the acetabulum after proximal femoral replacement (PFR) for tumour   reconstruction.</p></sec><sec><title><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s and Methods</title><p>We reviewed 100 consecutive PFRs performed between January 2003   and January 2013 without acetabular resurfacing.

Perioperative Myocardial Injury After Noncardiac Surgery
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Perioperative myocardial injury (PMI) seems to be a contributor to mortality after noncardiac surgery. Because the vast majority of PMIs are asymptomatic, PMI usually is missed in the absence of systematic screening.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed a prospective diagnostic study enrolling consecutive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s undergoing noncardiac surgery who had a planned postoperative stay of ≥24 hours and were considered at increased cardiovascular risk. All <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s received a systematic screening using serial measurements of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T in clinical routine. PMI was defined as an absolute high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T increase of ≥14 ng/L from preoperative to postoperative measurements. Furthermore, mortality was compared among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with PMI not fulfilling additional criteria (ischemic symptoms, new ECG changes, or imaging evidence of loss of viable myocardium) required for the diagnosis of spontaneous acute myocardial infarction versus those that did.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>From 2014 to 2015 we included 2018 consecutive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s undergoing 2546 surgeries. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s had a median age of 74 years and 42% were women. PMI occurred after 397 of 2546 surgeries (16%; 95% confidence interval, 14%–17%) and was accompanied by typical chest pain in 24 of 397 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s (6%) and any ischemic symptoms in 72 of 397 (18%). Crude 30-day mortality was 8.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.7–12.0) in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with PMI versus 1.5% (95% CI, 0.9–2.0) in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s without PMI (<i>P</i><0.001). Multivariable regression analysis showed an adjusted hazard ratio of 2.7 (95% CI, 1.5–4.8) for 30-day mortality. The difference was retained at 1 year with mortality rates of 22.5% (95% CI, 17.6–27.4) versus 9.3% (95% CI, 7.9–10.7). Thirty-day mortality was comparable among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with PMI not fulfilling any other of the additional criteria required for spontaneous acute myocardial infarction (280/397, 71%) versus those with at least 1 additional criterion (10.4%; 95% CI, 6.7–15.7, versus 8.7%; 95% CI, 4.2–16.7; <i>P</i>=0.684).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>PMI is a common complication after noncardiac surgery and, despite early detection during routine clinical screening, is associated with substantial short- and long-term mortality.

Clinical Profile and Consequences of Atrial Fibrillation in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common sustained arrhythmia in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), is capable of producing symptoms that impact quality of life and is associated with risk for embolic stroke. However, the influence of AF on clinical course and outcome in HCM remains incompletely resolved.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Records of 1558 consecutive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s followed at the Tufts Medical Center Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Institute for 4.8±3.4 years (from 2004 to 2014) were accessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of the 1558 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with HCM, 304 (20%) had episodes of AF, of which 226 (74%) were confined to symptomatic paroxysmal AF (average, 5±5; range, 1 to >20), whereas 78 (26%) developed permanent AF, preceded by 7±6 paroxysmal AF episodes. At last evaluation, 277 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s (91%) are alive at 62±13 years of age, including 89% in New York Heart Association class I or II. No difference was found in outcome measures for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with AF and age- and sex-matched <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with HCM without AF. Four percent of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with AF died of HCM-related causes (n=11), with annual mortality 0.7%; mortality directly attributable to AF (thromboembolism without prophylactic anticoagulation) was 0.1% per year (n=2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s were treated with antiarrhythmic drugs (most commonly amiodarone [n=103] or sotalol [n=78]) and AF catheter ablation (n=49) or the Maze procedure at surgical myectomy (n=72). Freedom from AF recurrence at 1 year was 44% for ablation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s and 75% with the Maze procedure (<i>P</i><0.001). Embolic events were less common with anticoagulation prophylaxis (4/233, 2%) than without (9/66, 14%) (<i>P</i><0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Transient symptomatic episodes of AF, often responsible for impaired quality of life, are unpredictable in frequency and timing, but amenable to effective contemporary treatments, and infrequently progress to permanent AF. AF is not a major contributor to heart failure morbidity or a cause of arrhythmic sudden death; when treated, it is associated with low disease-related mortality, no different than for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s without AF. AF is an uncommon primary cause of death in HCM virtually limited to embolic stroke, supporting a low threshold for initiating anticoagulation therapy.</p></sec>

Increase in Endovascular Therapy in Get With The Guidelines-Stroke After the Publication of Pivotal Trials
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Beginning in December 2014, a series of pivotal trials showed that endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) was highly effective, prompting calls to reorganize stroke systems of care. However, there are few data on how these trials influenced the frequency of EVT in clinical practice. We used data from the Get With The Guidelines-Stroke program to determine how the frequency of EVT changed in US practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We analyzed prospectively collected data from a cohort of 2 437 975 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with ischemic stroke admitted to 2222 participating hospitals between April 2003 and the third quarter of 2016. Weighted linear regression with 2 linear splines and a knot at January 2015 was used to compare the slope of the change in EVT use before and after the pivotal trials were published. Potentially eligible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s were defined as last known well to arrival time ≤4.5 hours and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score ≥6.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The frequency of EVT use was slowly increasing before January 2015 but then sharply accelerated thereafter. In the third quarter 2016, EVT was provided to 3.3% of all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with ischemic stroke at all hospitals, representing 15.1% of all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s who were potentially eligible for EVT based on stroke duration and severity. At EVT-capable hospitals, 7.5% of all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with ischemic stroke were treated in the third quarter of 2016, including 27.3% of the potentially eligible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s. From 2013 to 2016, case volumes nearly doubled at EVT-capable hospitals. Mean case volume per EVT-capable hospital was 37.6 per year in the last 4 quarters. EVT case volumes increased in nearly all US states from 2014 to the last 4 quarters, but with persistent geographic variation unexplained by differences in potential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong> eligibility.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>EVT use is increasing rapidly; however, there are still opportunities to treat more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s. Reorganizing stroke systems to route <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s to adequately resourced EVT-capable hospitals might increase treatment of eligible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s, improve outcomes, and reduce disparities.</p></sec>

Assessment of Remote Heart Rhythm Sampling Using the AliveCor Heart Monitor to Screen for Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Asymptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF) is increasingly common in the aging population and implicated in many ischemic strokes. Earlier identification of AF with appropriate anticoagulation may decrease stroke morbidity and mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a randomized controlled trial of AF screening using an AliveCor Kardia monitor attached to a WiFi-enabled iPod to obtain ECGs (iECGs) in ambulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s ≥65 years of age with a CHADS-VASc score ≥2 free from AF were randomized to the iECG arm or routine care (RC). iECG participants acquired iECGs twice weekly over 12 months (plus additional iECGs if symptomatic) onto a secure study server with overread by an automated AF detection algorithm and by a cardiac physiologist and/or consultant cardiologist. Time to diagnosis of AF was the primary outcome measure. The overall cost of the devices, ECG interpretation, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong> management were captured and used to generate the cost per AF diagnosis in iECG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s. Clinical events and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong> attitudes/experience were also evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We studied 1001 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s (500 iECG, 501 RC) who were 72.6±5.4 years of age; 534 were female. Mean CHADS-VASc score was 3.0 (heart failure, 1.4%; hypertension, 54%; diabetes mellitus, 30%; prior stroke/transient ischemic attack, 6.5%; arterial disease, 15.9%; all CHADS-VASc risk factors were evenly distributed between groups). Nineteen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s in the iECG group were diagnosed with AF over the 12-month study period versus 5 in the RC arm (hazard ratio, 3.9; 95% confidence interval=1.4–10.4; <i>P</i>=0.007) at a cost per AF diagnosis of $10 780 (£8255). There was a similar number of stroke/transient ischemic attack/systemic embolic events (6 versus 10, iECG versus RC; hazard ratio=0.61; 95% confidence interval=0.22–1.69; <i>P</i>=0.34). The majority of iECG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s were satisfied with the device, finding it easy to use without restricting activities or causing anxiety.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Screening with twice-weekly single-lead iECG with remote interpretation in ambulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s ≥65 years of age at increased risk of stroke is significantly more likely to identify incident AF than RC over a 12-month period. This approach is also highly acceptable to this group of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s, supporting further evaluation in an appropriately powered, event-driven clinical trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.isrctn.com</ext-link>.

Impact of Computed Tomography Perfusion Imaging on the Response to Tenecteplase in Ischemic Stroke

We tested the hypotheses that reperfusion therapy with tenecteplase would be superior to alteplase in improving functional outcomes in the group of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with target mismatch as identified with advanced imaging.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We investigated whether tenecteplase-treated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s had a different 24-hour reduction in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and a favorable odds ratio of a modified Rankin scale score of 0 to 1 versus 2 to 6 compared with alteplase-treated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s using linear regression to generate odds ratios. Imaging outcomes included rates of vessel recanalization and infarct growth at 24 hours and occurrence of large parenchymal hematoma. Baseline computed tomography perfusion was analyzed to assess whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s met the target mismatch criteria (absolute mismatch volume >15 mL, mismatch ratio >1.8, baseline ischemic core <70 mL, and volume of severely hypoperfused tissue <100 mL). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s meeting target mismatch criteria were analyzed as a subgroup to identify whether they had different treatment responses from the pooled group.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 146 pooled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s, 71 received alteplase and 75 received tenecteplase. Tenecteplase-treated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s had greater early clinical improvement (median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score change: tenecteplase, 7; alteplase, 2; <i>P</i>=0.018) and less parenchymal hematoma (2 of 75 versus 10 of 71; <i>P</i>=0.02).

Impact of Practice-Based Management of Pulmonary Artery Pressures in 2000 Patients Implanted With the CardioMEMS Sensor
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Elevated pulmonary artery (PA) pressures in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with heart failure are associated with a high risk for hospitalization and mortality. Recent clinical trial evidence demonstrated a direct relationship between lowering remotely monitored PA pressures and heart failure hospitalization risk reduction with a novel implantable PA pressure monitoring system (CardioMEMS HF System, St. Jude Medical). This study examines PA pressure changes in the first 2000 US <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s implanted in general practice use.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Deidentified data from the remote monitoring Merlin.net (St. Jude Medical) database were used to examine PA pressure trends from the first consecutive 2000 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with at least 6 months of follow-up. Changes in PA pressures were evaluated with an area under the curve methodology to estimate the total sum increase or decrease in pressures (mm Hg-day) during the follow-up period relative to the baseline pressure. As a reference, the PA pressure trends were compared with the historic CHAMPION clinical trial (CardioMEMS Heart Sensor Allows Monitoring of Pressure to Improve Outcomes in New York Heart Association [NYHA] Functional Class III Heart Failure <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s). The area under the curve results are presented as mean±2 SE, and <i>P</i> values comparing the area under the curve of the general-use cohort with outcomes in the CHAMPION trial were computed by the <i>t</i> test with equal variance.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s were on average 70±12 years old; 60% were male; 34% had preserved ejection fraction; and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s were followed up for an average of 333±125 days. At implantation, the mean PA pressure for the general-use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s was 34.9±10.2 mm Hg compared with 31.3±10.9 mm Hg for CHAMPION treatment and 32.0±10.5 mm Hg for CHAMPION control groups. The general-use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s had an area under the curve of −32.8 mm Hg-day at the 1-month time mark, −156.2 mm Hg-day at the 3-month time mark, and −434.0 mm Hg-day after 6 months of hemodynamic guided care, which was significantly lower than the treatment group in the CHAMPION trial. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s consistently transmitted pressure information with a median of 1.27 days between transmissions after 6 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The first 2000 general-use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s managed with hemodynamic-guided heart failure care had higher PA pressures at baseline and experienced greater reduction in PA pressure over time compared with the pivotal CHAMPION clinical trial.

Neuroprotective Effects of the Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Analog Exenatide After Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In-hospital mortality in comatose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s resuscitated from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is ≈50%. In OHCA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s, the leading cause of death is neurological injury secondary to ischemia and reperfusion. Glucagon-like peptide-1 analogs are approved for type 2 diabetes mellitus; preclinical and clinical data have suggested their organ-protective effects in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with ischemia and reperfusion injury. The aim of this trial was to investigate the neuroprotective effects of the glucagon-like peptide-1 analog exenatide in resuscitated OHCA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We randomly assigned 120 consecutive comatose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s resuscitated from OHCA in a double-blind, 2-center trial. They were administered 17.4 μg exenatide (Byetta) or placebo over a 6-hour and 15-minute infusion, in addition to standardized intensive care including targeted temperature management. The coprimary end points were feasibility, defined as initiation of the study drug in >90% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s within 240 minutes of return of spontaneous circulation, and efficacy, defined as the geometric area under the neuron-specific enolase curve from 24 to 72 hours after admission.

The impact of external fixation on mortality in patients with an unstable pelvic ring fracture
<sec><title>Aim</title><p>There is not adequate evidence to establish whether external   fixation (EF) of pelvic fractures leads to a reduced mortality.   We used the Japan Trauma Data Bank database to identify isolated   unstable pelvic ring fractures to exclude the possibility of blood   loss from other injuries, and analyzed the effectiveness of EF on   mortality in this group of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s and Methods</title><p>This was a registry-based comparison of 1163 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s who had   been treated for an isolated unstable pelvic ring fracture with   (386 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s) or without (777 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s) EF. An isolated pelvic   ring fracture was defined by an Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS) for   other injuries of < 3. An unstable pelvic ring fracture was defined   as having an AIS ≥ 4. The primary outcome of this study was mortality.   A subgroup analysis was carried out for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s who required blood   transfusion within 24 hours of arrival in the Emergency Department   and those who had massive blood loss (AIS code: 852610.5). Propensity-score   matching was used to identify a cohort like the EF and non-EF groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>With the use of propensity-score matching using the completed   data, 346 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s were matched. When the propensity-score matching   was adjusted, EF was associated with a significantly lower risk   of death (p = 0.047). In the subgroup analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s who needed   blood transfusion within 24 hours and those who had massive blood loss,   EF was associated with a significantly lower risk of death in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s   who needed blood transfusion within 24 hours (p = 0.014) and in   those with massive blood loss (p = 0.016).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The use of EF to treat unstable pelvic ring fractures was associated   with a significantly lower risk of death, especially in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s   with severe fractures.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:233–41.</p></sec>

Venous thromboembolic prophylaxis after simultaneous bilateral total knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aims of this study were to compare the efficacy of two agents,   aspirin and warfarin, for the prevention of venous thromboembolism   (VTE) after simultaneous bilateral total knee arthroplasty (SBTKA),   and to elucidate the risk of VTE conferred by this procedure compared   with unilateral TKA (UTKA).</p></sec><sec><title><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s and Methods</title><p>A retrospective, multi-institutional study was conducted on 18   951 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s, 3685 who underwent SBTKA and 15 266 who underwent   UTKA, using aspirin or warfarin as VTE prophylaxis. Each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>   was assigned an individualised baseline VTE risk score based on   a system using the Nationwide In<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong> Sample. Symptomatic VTE,   including pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT),   were identified in the first 90 days post-operatively. Statistical   analyses were performed with logistic regression accounting for   baseline VTE risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The adjusted incidence of PE following SBTKA was 1.0% (95% confidence   interval (CI) 0.86 to 1.2) with aspirin and 2.2% (95% CI 2.0 to   2.4) with warfarin. Similarly, the adjusted incidence of VTE following   SBTKA was 1.6% (95% CI 1.1 to 2.3) with aspirin and 2.5% (95% CI   1.9 to 3.3) with warfarin. The risk of PE and VTE were reduced by   66% (odds ratio (OR) 0.44, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.78) and 38% (OR 0.62,   95% CI 0.38 to 1.0), respectively, using aspirin. In addition, the risk   of PE was 204% higher for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s undergoing SBTKA relative to   those undergoing UTKA. For each ten-point increase in baseline VTE   risk, the risk of PE increased by 25.5% for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s undergoing   SBTKA compared with 10.5% for those undergoing UTKA. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with   a history of myocardial infarction or peripheral vascular disease had   the greatest increase in risk from undergoing SBTKA instead of UTKA.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Aspirin is more effective than warfarin for the prevention of   VTE following SBTKA, and serves as the more appropriate agent for   VTE prophylaxis for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s in all risk categories. Furthermore,   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s undergoing SBTKA are at a substantially increased risk   of VTE, even more so for those with significant underlying risk   factors. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s should be informed about the risks associated   with undergoing SBTKA.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B(1   Supple A):68–75.</p></sec>

Metal-on-metal total hip arthroplasty is not associated with cardiac disease
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Many case reports and small studies have suggested that cobalt   ions are a potential cause of cardiac complications, specifically   cardiomyopathy, after metal-on-metal (MoM) total hip arthroplasty   (THA). The impact of metal ions on the incidence of cardiac disease   after MoM THA has not been evaluated in large studies. The aim of   this study was to compare the rate of onset of new cardiac symptoms   in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s who have undergone MoM THA with those who have undergone   metal-on-polyethylene (MoP) THA.</p></sec><sec><title><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s and Methods</title><p>Data were extracted from the Standard Analytics Files database   for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s who underwent MoM THA between 2005 and 2012.

An age and gender-matched cohort of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s who underwent   MoP THA served as a comparison group.

Mechanisms of <i>prickle1a</i> function in zebrafish epilepsy and retinal neurogenesis
<p>Epilepsy is a complex neurological disorder characterized by unprovoked seizures. The etiology is heterogeneous with both genetic and environmental causes. Genes that regulate neurotransmitters and ion channels in the central nervous system have been associated with epilepsy. However, a recent screening in human epilepsy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s identified mutations in the <i>PRICKLE1</i> (<i>PK1</i>) locus, highlighting a potentially novel mechanism underlying seizures. PK1 is a core component of the planar cell polarity network that regulates tissue polarity. Zebrafish studies have shown that Pk1 coordinates cell movement, neuronal migration and axonal outgrowth during embryonic development. Yet how dysfunction of Pk1 relates to epilepsy is unknown. To address the mechanism underlying epileptogenesis, we used zebrafish to characterize Pk1a function and epilepsy-related mutant forms. We show that knockdown of <i>pk1a</i> activity sensitizes zebrafish larva to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convuls</span></strong>ant drug. To model defects in the central nervous system, we used the retina and found that <i>pk1a</i> knockdown induces neurite outgrowth defects; yet visual function is maintained. Furthermore, we characterized the functional and biochemical properties of the PK1 mutant forms identified in human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s. Functional analyses demonstrate that the wild-type Pk1a partially suppresses the gene knockdown retinal defects but not the mutant forms. Biochemical analysis reveals increased ubiquitylation of one mutant form and decreased translational efficiency of another mutant form compared with the wild-type Pk1a. Taken together, our results indicate that mutation of human PK1 could lead to defects in neurodevelopment and signal processing, providing insight into seizure predisposition in these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s.</p>

0/1-Hour Triage Algorithm for Myocardial Infarction in Patients With Renal Dysfunction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The European Society of Cardiology recommends a 0/1-hour algorithm for rapid rule-out and rule-in of non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction using high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) concentrations irrespective of renal function. Because <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with renal dysfunction (RD) frequently present with increased hs-cTn concentrations even in the absence of non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, concern has been raised regarding the performance of the 0/1-hour algorithm in RD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a prospective multicenter diagnostic study enrolling unselected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s presenting with suspected non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction to the emergency department, we assessed the diagnostic performance of the European Society of Cardiology 0/1-hour algorithm using hs-cTnT and hs-cTnI in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with RD, defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, and compared it to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with normal renal function. The final diagnosis was centrally adjudicated by 2 independent cardiologists using all available information, including cardiac imaging. Safety was quantified as sensitivity in the rule-out zone, accuracy as the specificity in the rule-in zone, and efficacy as the proportion of the overall cohort assigned to either rule-out or rule-in based on the 0- and 1-hour sample.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 3254 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s, RD was present in 487 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s (15%). The prevalence of non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction was substantially higher in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with RD compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with normal renal function (31% versus 13%, <i>P</i><0.001). Using hs-cTnT, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with RD had comparable sensitivity of rule-out (100.0% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 97.6–100.0] versus 99.2% [95% CI, 97.6–99.8]; <i>P</i>=0.559), lower specificity of rule-in (88.7% [95% CI, 84.8–91.9] versus 96.5% [95% CI, 95.7–97.2]; <i>P</i><0.001), and lower overall efficacy (51% versus 81%, <i>P</i><0.001), mainly driven by a much lower percentage of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s eligible for rule-out (18% versus 68%, <i>P</i><0.001) compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with normal renal function. Using hs-cTnI, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with RD had comparable sensitivity of rule-out (98.6% [95% CI, 95.0–99.8] versus 98.5% [95% CI, 96.5–99.5]; <i>P</i>=1.0), lower specificity of rule-in (84.4% [95% CI, 79.9–88.3] versus 91.7% [95% CI, 90.5–92.9]; <i>P</i><0.001), and lower overall efficacy (54% versus 76%, <i>P</i><0.001; proportion ruled out, 18% versus 58%, <i>P</i><0.001) compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with normal renal function.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s with RD, the safety of the European Society of Cardiology 0/1-hour algorithm is high, but specificity of rule-in and overall efficacy are decreased.

Does Use of Bilateral Internal Mammary Artery Grafting Reduce Long-Term Risk of Repeat Coronary Revascularization?
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although previous studies have demonstrated that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s receiving bilateral internal mammary artery (BIMA) conduits during coronary artery bypass grafting have better long-term survival than those receiving a single internal mammary artery (SIMA), data on risk of repeat revascularization are more limited. In this analysis, we compare the timing, frequency, and type of repeat coronary revascularization among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s receiving BIMA and SIMA.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a multicenter, retrospective analysis of 47 984 consecutive coronary artery bypass grafting surgeries performed from 1992 to 2014 among 7 medical centers reporting to a prospectively maintained clinical registry. Among the study population, 1482 coronary artery bypass grafting surgeries with BIMA were identified, and 1297 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s receiving BIMA were propensity-matched to 1297 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s receiving SIMA. The primary end point was freedom from repeat coronary revascularization.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The median duration of follow-up was 13.2 (IQR, 7.4–17.7) years. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s were well matched by age, body mass index, major comorbidities, and cardiac function. There was a higher freedom from repeat revascularization among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s receiving BIMA than among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s receiving SIMA (hazard ratio [HR], 0.78 [95% CI, 0.65–0.94]; <i>P</i>=0.009). Among the matched cohort, 19.4% (n=252) of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s receiving SIMA underwent repeat revascularization, whereas this frequency was 15.1% (n=196) among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patient</span></strong>s receiving BIMA (<i>P</i>=0.004). The majority of repeat revascularization procedures were percutaneous coronary interventions (94.2%), and this did not differ between groups (<i>P</i>=0.274). Groups also did not differ in the ratio of native versus graft vessel percutaneous coronary intervention (<i>P</i>=0.899), or regarding percutaneous coronary intervention target vessels; the most common targets in both groups were the right coronary (<i>P</i>=0.133) and circumflex arteries (<i>P</i>=0.093). In comparison with SIMA, BIMA grafting was associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality at 12 years of follow-up (HR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.69–0.91]; <i>P</i>=0.001), and there was no difference in in-hospital morbidity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>BIMA grafting was associated with a reduced risk of repeat revascularization and an improvement in long-term survival and should be considered more frequently during coronary artery bypass grafting.</p></sec>

Cap-specific terminal <i>N</i><sup>6</sup>-methylation of RNA by an RNA polymerase II–associated methyltransferase
<p><i>N</i><sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A), a major modification of messenger RNAs (mRNAs), plays critical roles in RNA metabolism and function. In addition to the internal m<sup>6</sup>A, <i>N</i><sup>6</sup>, 2′-<i>O</i>-dimethyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>Am) is present at the transcription start nucleotide of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cap</span></strong>ped mRNAs in vertebrates. However, its biogenesis and functional role remain elusive. Using a reverse genetics approach, we identified PCIF1, a factor that interacts with the serine-5–phosphorylated carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cap</span></strong>-specific adenosine methyltransferase (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cap</span></strong>AM) responsible for <i>N</i><sup>6</sup>-methylation of m<sup>6</sup>Am. The crystal structure of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cap</span></strong>AM in complex with substrates revealed the molecular basis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cap</span></strong>-specific m<sup>6</sup>A formation. A transcriptome-wide analysis revealed that <i>N</i><sup>6</sup>-methylation of m<sup>6</sup>Am promotes the translation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cap</span></strong>ped mRNAs. Thus, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cap</span></strong>-specific m<sup>6</sup>A writer promotes translation of mRNAs starting from m<sup>6</sup>Am.</p>

Structural basis of bacterial transcription activation
<p>In bacteria, the activation of gene transcription at many promoters is simple and only involves a single activator. The cyclic adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate receptor protein (CAP), a classic activator, is able to activate transcription independently through two different mechanisms. Understanding the class I mechanism requires an intact transcription activation complex (TAC) structure at a high resolution. Here we report a high-resolution cryo–electron microscopy structure of an intact <i>Escherichia coli</i> class I TAC containing a CAP dimer, a σ<sup>70</sup>–RNA polymerase (RNAP) holoenzyme, a complete class I CAP-dependent promoter DNA, and a de novo synthesized RNA oligonucleotide. The structure shows how CAP wraps the upstream DNA and how the interactions recruit RNAP. Our study provides a structural basis for understanding how activators activate transcription through the class I recruitment mechanism.</p>

<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Lead management is an increasingly important aspect of care in patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices; however, relatively little is known about long-term outcomes after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cap</span></strong>ping and abandoning leads.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using the 5% Medicare sample, we identified patients with de novo cardiac implantable electronic device implantations between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2013, and with a subsequent lead addition or extraction ≥12 months after the de novo implantation. Patients who underwent extraction for infection were excluded. Using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models, we compared cumulative incidence of all-cause mortality, device-related infection, device revision, and lead extraction at 1 and 5 years for the extraction versus the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cap</span></strong> and abandon group.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 6859 patients, 1113 (16.2%) underwent extraction, whereas 5746 (83.8%) underwent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cap</span></strong>ping and abandonment.

Heterohexamers Formed by CcmK3 and CcmK4 Increase the Complexity of Beta Carboxysome Shells
<p>Bacterial microcompartments (BMCs) en<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cap</span></strong>sulate enzymes within a selectively permeable, proteinaceous shell. Carboxysomes are BMCs containing ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase and carbonic anhydrase that enhance carbon dioxide fixation. The carboxysome shell consists of three structurally characterized protein types, each named after the oligomer they form: BMC-H (hexamer), BMC-P (pentamer), and BMC-T (trimer). These three protein types form cyclic homooligomers with pores at the center of symmetry that enable metabolite transport across the shell. Carboxysome shells contain multiple BMC-H paralogs, each with distinctly conserved residues surrounding the pore, which are assumed to be associated with specific metabolites. We studied the regulation of β-carboxysome shell composition by investigating the BMC-H genes <i>ccmK3</i> and <i>ccmK4</i> situated in a locus remote from other carboxysome genes. We made single and double deletion mutants of <i>ccmK3</i> and <i>ccmK4</i> in <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> PCC7942 and show that, unlike CcmK3, CcmK4 is necessary for optimal growth. In contrast to other CcmK proteins, CcmK3 does not form homohexamers; instead CcmK3 forms heterohexamers with CcmK4 with a 1:2 stoichiometry. The CcmK3-CcmK4 heterohexamers form stacked dodecamers in a pH-dependent manner. Our results indicate that CcmK3-CcmK4 heterohexamers potentially expand the range of permeability properties of metabolite channels in carboxysome shells. Moreover, the observed facultative formation of dodecamers in solution suggests that carboxysome shell permeability may be dynamically attenuated by “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cap</span></strong>ping” facet-embedded hexamers with a second hexamer. Because β-carboxysomes are obligately expressed, heterohexamer formation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cap</span></strong>ping could provide a rapid and reversible means to alter metabolite flux across the shell in response to environmental/growth conditions.</p>

Pea Border Cell Maturation and Release Involve Complex Cell Wall Structural Dynamics
<p>The adhesion of plant cells is vital for support and protection of the plant body and is maintained by a variety of molecular associations between cell wall components. In some specialized cases, though, plant cells are programmed to detach, and root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cap</span></strong>-derived border cells are examples of this. Border cells (in some species known as border-like cells) provide an expendable barrier between roots and the environment. Their maturation and release is an important but poorly characterized cell separation event. To gain a deeper insight into the complex cellular dynamics underlying this process, we undertook a systematic, detailed analysis of pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) root tip cell walls. Our study included immunocarbohydrate microarray profiling, monosaccharide composition determination, Fourier-transformed infrared microspectroscopy, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR of cell wall biosynthetic genes, analysis of hydrolytic activities, transmission electron microscopy, and immunolocalization of cell wall components. Using this integrated glycobiology approach, we identified multiple novel modes of cell wall structural and compositional rearrangement during root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cap</span></strong> growth and the release of border cells. Our findings provide a new level of detail about border cell maturation and enable us to develop a model of the separation process. We propose that loss of adhesion by the dissolution of homogalacturonan in the middle lamellae is augmented by an active biophysical process of cell curvature driven by the polarized distribution of xyloglucan and extensin epitopes.</p>

Three-orders-of-magnitude variation of carrier lifetimes with crystal phase of gold nanoclusters
<p>We report a three-orders-of-magnitude variation of carrier lifetimes in exotic crystalline phases of gold nanoclusters (NCs) in addition to the well-known face-centered cubic structure, including hexagonal close-packed (hcp) Au<sub>30</sub> and body-centered cubic (bcc) Au<sub>38</sub> NCs protected by the same type of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cap</span></strong>ping ligand. The bcc Au<sub>38</sub> NC had an exceptionally long carrier lifetime (4.7 microseconds) comparable to that of bulk silicon, whereas the hcp Au<sub>30</sub> NC had a very short lifetime (1 nanosecond). Although the presence of ligands may, in general, affect carrier lifetimes, experimental and theoretical results showed that the drastically different recombination lifetimes originate in the different overlaps of wave functions between the tetrahedral Au<sub>4</sub> building blocks in the hierarchical structures of these NCs.</p>

De novo design of self-assembling helical protein filaments
<p>We describe a general computational approach to designing self-assembling helical filaments from monomeric proteins and use this approach to design proteins that assemble into micrometer-scale filaments with a wide range of geometries in vivo and in vitro. Cryo–electron microscopy structures of six designs are close to the computational design models. The filament building blocks are idealized repeat proteins, and thus the diameter of the filaments can be systematically tuned by varying the number of repeat units. The assembly and disassembly of the filaments can be controlled by engineered anchor and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cap</span></strong>ping units built from monomers lacking one of the interaction surfaces. The ability to generate dynamic, highly ordered structures that span micrometers from protein monomers opens up possibilities for the fabrication of new multiscale metamaterials.</p>

Radar evidence of subglacial liquid water on Mars
<p>The presence of liquid water at the base of the martian polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cap</span></strong>s has long been suspected but not observed. We surveyed the Planum Australe region using the MARSIS (Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding) instrument, a low-frequency radar on the Mars Express spacecraft. Radar profiles collected between May 2012 and December 2015 contain evidence of liquid water trapped below the ice of the South Polar Layered Deposits. Anomalously bright subsurface reflections are evident within a well-defined, 20-kilometer-wide zone centered at 193°E, 81°S, which is surrounded by much less reflective areas. Quantitative analysis of the radar signals shows that this bright feature has high relative dielectric permittivity (>15), matching that of water-bearing materials. We interpret this feature as a stable body of liquid water on Mars.</p>

The rise, collapse, and compaction of Mt. Mantap from the 3 September 2017 North Korean nuclear test
<p>Surveillance of clandestine nuclear tests relies on a global seismic network, but the potential of spaceborne monitoring has been underexploited. We used satellite radar imagery to determine the complete surface displacement field of up to 3.5 meters of divergent horizontal motion with 0.5 meters of subsidence associated with North Korea’s largest underground nuclear test. Combining insight from geodetic and seismological remote sensing, we found that the aftermath of the initial explosive deformation involved subsidence associated with subsurface collapse and aseismic compaction of the damaged rocks of the test site. The explosive yield from the nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deton</span></strong>ation with best-fitting source parameters for 450-meter depth was 191 kilotonnes of TNT equivalent.

An unusual white dwarf star may be a surviving remnant of a subluminous Type Ia supernova
<p>Subluminous Type Ia supernovae, such as the Type Iax–class prototype SN 2002cx, are described by a variety of models such as the failed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deton</span></strong>ation and partial deflagration of an accreting carbon-oxygen white dwarf star or the explosion of an accreting, hybrid carbon-oxygen-neon core. These models predict that bound remnants survive such events with, according to some simulations, a high kick velocity. We report the discovery of a high proper motion, low-mass white dwarf (LP 40-365) that travels at a velocity greater than the Galactic es<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cap</span></strong>e velocity and whose peculiar atmosphere is dominated by intermediate-mass elements. Strong evidence indicates that this partially burnt remnant was ejected following a subluminous Type Ia supernova event. This supports the viability of single-degenerate supernova progenitors.</p>

The role of dimer asymmetry and protomer dynamics in enzyme catalysis
<p>Freeze-trapping x-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance, and computational techniques reveal the distribution of states and their interconversion rates along the reaction pathway of a bacterial homodimeric enzyme, fluoroacetate dehalogenase (FAcD). The crystal structure of apo-FAcD exhibits asymmetry around the dimer interface and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cap</span></strong> domain, priming one protomer for substrate binding. This asymmetry is dynamically averaged through conformational exchange on a millisecond time scale. During catalysis, the protomer conformational exchange rate becomes enhanced, the empty protomer exhibits increased local disorder, and water egresses. Computational studies identify allosteric pathways between protomers. Water release and enhanced dynamics associated with catalysis compensate for entropic losses from substrate binding while facilitating sampling of the transition state. The studies provide insights into how substrate-coupled allosteric modulation of structure and dynamics facilitates catalysis in a homodimeric enzyme.</p>

Senescent intimal foam cells are deleterious at all stages of atherosclerosis
<p>Advanced atherosclerotic lesions contain senescent cells, but the role of these cells in atherogenesis remains unclear. Using transgenic and pharmacological approaches to eliminate senescent cells in atherosclerosis-prone low-density lipoprotein receptor–deficient (<i>Ldlr</i><sup>–/–</sup>) mice, we show that these cells are detrimental throughout disease pathogenesis. We find that foamy macrophages with senescence markers accumulate in the subendothelial space at the onset of atherosclerosis, where they drive pathology by increasing expression of key atherogenic and inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. In advanced lesions, senescent cells promote features of plaque instability, including elastic fiber degradation and fibrous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cap</span></strong> thinning, by heightening metalloprotease production. Together, these results demonstrate that senescent cells are key drivers of atheroma formation and maturation and suggest that selective clearance of these cells by senolytic agents holds promise for the treatment of atherosclerosis.</p>

ANN1 and ANN2 Function in Post-Phloem Sugar Transport in Root Tips to Affect Primary Root Growth
<p>Annexins are a multigene family of calcium-dependent membrane-binding proteins that play important roles in plant cell signaling. Annexins are multifunctional proteins, and their function in plants is not comprehensively understood. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) annexins ANN1 and ANN2 are 64% identical in their primary structure, and both are highly expressed in seedlings. Here, we showed that <i>ann-mutant</i> seedlings grown in the absence of sugar show decreased primary root growth and altered columella cells in root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cap</span></strong>s; however, these mutant defects are rescued by Suc, Glc, or Fru. In seedlings grown without sugar, significant up-regulation of photosynthetic gene expression and chlorophyll accumulation was found in <i>ann-mutant</i> cotyledons compared to that in wild type, which indicates potential sugar starvation in the roots of <i>ann-mutant</i> seedlings. Unexpectedly, the overall sugar content of <i>ann-mutant</i> primary roots was significantly higher than that of wild-type roots when grown without sugar. To examine the diffusion of sugar along the entire root to the root tip, we examined the unloading pattern of carboxyfluorescein dye and found that post-phloem sugar transport was impaired in <i>ann-mutant</i> root tips compared to that in wild type. Increased levels of ROS and callose were detected in the root tips of <i>ann-mutant</i> seedlings grown without Suc, the latter of which would restrict plasmodesmal sugar transport to root tips. Our results indicate that ANN1 and ANN2 play an important role in post-phloem sugar transport to the root tip, which in turn indirectly influences photosynthetic rates in cotyledons. This study expands our understanding of the function of annexins in plants.</p>

Structure of eIF4E in Complex with an eIF4G Peptide Supports a Universal Bipartite Binding Mode for Protein Translation
<p>The association-dissociation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cap</span></strong>-binding protein eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) with eIF4G is a key control step in eukaryotic translation. The paradigm on the eIF4E-eIF4G interaction states that eIF4G binds to the dorsal surface of eIF4E through a single canonical alpha-helical motif, while metazoan eIF4E-binding proteins (m4E-BPs) advantageously compete against eIF4G via bimodal interactions involving this canonical motif and a second noncanonical motif of the eIF4E surface. Metazoan eIF4Gs share this extended binding interface with m4E-BPs, with significant implications on the understanding of translation regulation and the design of therapeutic molecules. Here we show the high-resolution structure of melon (<i>Cucumis melo</i>) eIF4E in complex with a melon eIF4G peptide and propose the first eIF4E-eIF4G structural model for plants. Our structural data together with functional analyses demonstrate that plant eIF4G binds to eIF4E through both the canonical and noncanonical motifs, similarly to metazoan eIF4E-eIF4G complexes. As in the case of metazoan eIF4E-eIF4G, this may have very important practical implications, as plant eIF4E-eIF4G is also involved in a significant number of plant diseases. In light of our results, a universal eukaryotic bipartite mode of binding to eIF4E is proposed.</p>

Capping Protein Modulates Actin Remodeling in Response to Reactive Oxygen Species during Plant Innate Immunity
<p>Plants perceive microbe-associated molecular patterns and damage-associated molecular patterns to activate innate immune signaling events, such as bursts of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The actin cytoskeleton remodels during the first 5 min of innate immune signaling in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis</i> <i>thaliana</i>) epidermal cells; however, the immune signals that impinge on actin cytoskeleton and its response regulators remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that rapid actin remodeling upon elicitation with diverse microbe-associated molecular patterns and damage-associated molecular patterns represent a conserved plant immune response. Actin remodeling requires ROS generated by the defense-associated NADPH oxidase, RBOHD. Moreover, perception of flg22 by its cognate receptor complex triggers actin remodeling through the activation of RBOHD-dependent ROS production. Our genetic studies reveal that the ubiquitous heterodimeric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cap</span></strong>ping protein transduces ROS signaling to the actin cytoskeleton during innate immunity. Additionally, we uncover a negative feedback loop between actin remodeling and flg22-induced ROS production.</p>

Transcriptome and Degradome Sequencing Reveals Dormancy Mechanisms of <i>Cunninghamia lanceolata</i> Seeds<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Seeds with physiological dormancy usually experience primary and secondary dormancy in the nature; however, little is known about the differential regulation of primary and secondary dormancy. We combined multiple approaches to investigate cytological changes, hormonal levels, and gene expression dynamics in <i>Cunninghamia lanceolata</i> seeds during primary dormancy release and secondary dormancy induction. Light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy revealed that protein bodies in the embryo cells coalesced during primary dormancy release and then separated during secondary dormancy induction. Transcriptomic profiling demonstrated that expression of genes negatively regulating gibberellic acid (GA) sensitivity reduced specifically during primary dormancy release, whereas the expression of genes positively regulating abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis increased during secondary dormancy induction. Parallel analysis of RNA ends revealed un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cap</span></strong>ped transcripts for ∼55% of all unigenes. A negative correlation between fold changes in expression levels of un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cap</span></strong>ped versus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cap</span></strong>ped mRNAs was observed during primary dormancy release. However, this correlation was loose during secondary dormancy induction. Our analyses suggest that the reversible changes in cytology and gene expression during dormancy release and induction are related to ABA/GA balance. Moreover, mRNA degradation functions as a critical posttranscriptional regulator during primary dormancy release. These findings provide a mechanistic framework for understanding physiological dormancy in seeds.</p>

Targeted mutagenesis using CRISPR/Cas system in medaka
<p>Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) system-based RNA-guided endonuclease (RGEN) has recently emerged as a simple and efficient tool for targeted genome editing. In this study, we showed successful targeted mutagenesis using RGENs in medaka, <i>Oryzias latipes</i>. Somatic and heritable mutations were induced with high efficiency at the targeted genomic sequence on the <i>DJ-1</i> gene in embryos that had been injected with the single guide RNA (sgRNA) transcribed by a T7 promoter and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cap</span></strong>ped RNA encoding a Cas9 nuclease. The sgRNAs that were designed for the target genomic sequences without the 5′ end of GG required by the T7 promoter induced the targeted mutations. This suggests that the RGEN can target any sequence adjacent to an NGG protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence, which occurs once every 8 bp. The off-target alterations at 2 genomic loci harboring double mismatches in the 18-bp targeting sequences were induced in the RGEN-injected embryos. However, we also found that the off-target effects could be reduced by lower dosages of sgRNA. Taken together, our results suggest that CRISPR/Cas-mediated RGENs may be an efficient and flexible tool for genome editing in medaka.</p>

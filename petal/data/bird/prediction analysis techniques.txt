Novel Desmin Mutation p.Glu401Asp Impairs Filament Formation, Disrupts Cell Membrane Integrity, and Causes Severe Arrhythmogenic Left Ventricular Cardiomyopathy/Dysplasia
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Desmin (<i>DES</i>) mutations cause severe skeletal and cardiac muscle disease with heterogeneous phenotypes. Recently, <i>DES</i> mutations were described in patients with inherited arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia, although their cellular and molecular pathomechanisms are not precisely known. Our aim is to describe clinically and functionally the novel <i>DES</i>-p.Glu401Asp mutation as a cause of inherited left ventricular arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy/dysplasia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We identified the novel <i>DES</i> mutation p.Glu401Asp in a large Spanish family with inherited left ventricular arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy/dysplasia and a high incidence of adverse cardiac events. A full clinical evaluation was performed on all mutation carriers and noncarriers to establish clinical and genetic cosegregation. In addition, desmin, and intercalar disc–related proteins expression were histologically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed in explanted cardiac tissue affected by the <i>DES</i> mutation. Furthermore, mesenchymal stem cells were isolated and cultured from 2 family members with the <i>DES</i> mutation (1 with mild and 1 with severe symptomatology) and a member without the mutation (control) and differentiated ex vivo to cardiomyocytes. Then, important genes related to cardiac differentiation and function were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Finally, the p.Glu401Asp mutated <i>DES</i> gene was transfected into cell lines and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed by confocal microscopy.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of the 66 family members screened for the <i>DES</i>-p.Glu401Asp mutation, 23 of them were positive, 6 were obligate carriers, and 2 were likely carriers. One hundred percent of genotype-positive patients presented data consistent with inherited arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy/dysplasia phenotype with variable disease severity expression, high-incidence of sudden cardiac death, and absence of skeletal myopathy or conduction system disorders. Immunohistochemistry was compatible with inherited arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy/dysplasia, and the functional study showed an abnormal growth pattern and cellular adhesion, reduced desmin RNA expression, and some other membrane proteins, as well, and desmin aggregates in transfected cells expressing the mutant desmin.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The <i>DES</i>-p.Glu401Asp mutation causes predominant inherited left ventricular arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy/dysplasia with a high incidence of adverse clinical events in the absence of skeletal myopathy or conduction system disorders. The pathogenic mechanism probably corresponds to an alteration in desmin dimer and oligomer assembly and its connection with membrane proteins within the intercalated disc.</p></sec>

Functional Characterization of the <i>GUCY1A3</i> Coronary Artery Disease Risk Locus
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>A chromosomal locus at 4q32.1 has been genome-wide significantly associated with coronary artery disease risk. The locus encompasses <i>GUCY1A3</i>, which encodes the α<sub>1</sub> subunit of the soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC), a key enzyme in the nitric oxide/cGMP signaling pathway. The mechanism linking common variants in this region with coronary risk is not known.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Gene expression and protein expression were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed with quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting, respectively. Putative allele-specific transcription factors were identified with in silico analyses and validated via allele-specific quantification of antibody-precipitated chromatin fractions. Regulatory properties of the lead risk variant region were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed with reporter gene assays. To assess the effect of zinc finger E box-binding homeobox 1 transcription factor (ZEB1), siRNA-mediated knockdown and overexpression experiments were performed. Association of <i>GUCY1A3</i> genotype and cellular phenotypes was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed with vascular smooth muscle cell migration assays and platelet aggregation analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Whole-blood <i>GUCY1A3</i> mRNA levels were significantly lower in individuals homozygous for the lead (rs7692387) risk variant. Likewise, reporter gene assays demonstrated significantly lower <i>GUCY1A3</i> promoter activity for constructs carrying this allele. In silico analyses located a DNase I hypersensitivity site to rs7692387 and predicted binding of the transcription factor ZEB1 rather to the nonrisk allele, which was confirmed experimentally. Knockdown of <i>ZEB1</i> resulted in more profound reduction of nonrisk allele promoter activity and a significant reduction of endogenous <i>GUCY1A3</i> expression. Ex vivo–studied platelets from homozygous nonrisk allele carriers displayed enhanced inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation by the nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside and the phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor sildenafil compared with homozygous risk allele carriers. Moreover, pharmacological stimulation of sGC led to reduced migration only in vascular smooth muscle cells homozygous for the nonrisk allele. In the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel, higher levels of <i>GUCY1A3</i> expression correlated with less atherosclerosis in the aorta.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Rs7692387 is located in an intronic site that modulates <i>GUCY1A3</i> promoter activity. The transcription factor ZEB1 binds preferentially to the nonrisk allele, leading to an increase in <i>GUCY1A3</i> expression, higher sGC levels, and higher sGC activity after stimulation. Finally, human and mouse data link augmented sGC expression to lower risk of atherosclerosis.</p></sec>

Identifying protein kinase–specific effectors of the osmostress response in yeast
<p>The budding yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> reacts to increased external osmolarity by modifying many cellular processes. Adaptive signaling relies primarily on the high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway, which is closely related to the mammalian p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in core architecture. To identify target proteins of the MAPK Hog1, we designed a mass spectrometry–based high-throughput experiment to measure the impact of Hog1 activation or inhibition on the <i>S</i>. <i>cerevisiae</i> phosphoproteome. In addition, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed how deletion of <i>RCK2</i>, which encodes a known effector protein kinase target of Hog1, modulated osmotic stress–induced phosphorylation. Our results not only provide an overview of the diversity of cellular functions that are directly and indirectly affected by the activity of the HOG pathway but also enabled an assessment of the Hog1-independent events that occur under osmotic stress conditions. We extended the number of putative Hog1 direct targets by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ing the modulation of motifs consisting of serine or threonine followed by a proline (S/T-P motif) and subsequently validated these with an in vivo interaction assay. Rck2 appears to act as a central hub for many Hog1-mediated secondary phosphorylation events. This study clarifies many of the direct and indirect effects of HOG signaling and its stress-adaptive functions.</p>

Diurnal Variation in Nonstructural Carbohydrate Storage in Trees: Remobilization and Vertical Mixing
<p>Nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) storage plays a critical role in tree function and survival, but understanding and predicting local NSC storage dynamics is challenging because NSC storage pools are dispersed throughout the complex architecture of trees and continuously exchange carbon between source and sink organs at different time scales. To address these knowledge gaps, characterization and understanding of NSC diel variation are necessary. Here, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed diurnal NSC dynamics in the overall architecture of almond (<i>Prunus dulcis</i>) trees. We also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed the allocation of newly assimilated carbon using isotopic labeling. We show that both components of NSC (i.e. soluble carbohydrates and starch) are highly dynamic at the diurnal time scale and that these trends are influenced by tissue type, age, and/or position within the canopy. In leaves, starch reserves can be depleted completely during the night, while woody tissue starch levels may vary by more than 50% over a daily cycle. Recently assimilated carbon showed a dispersed downward allocation across the entire tree. NSC diurnal fluctuations within the tree’s structure in combination with dispersed carbon allocation patterns provide evidence for the presence of vertical mixing and suggest that the xylem acts as a secondary NSC redistribution pathway.</p>

The Extra-Pathway Interactome of the TCA Cycle: Expected and Unexpected Metabolic Interactions
<p>The plant tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle provides essential precursors for respiration, amino acid biosynthesis, and general nitrogen metabolism; moreover, it is closely involved in biotic stress responses and cellular redox homeostasis. To further understand the in vivo function of the TCA cycle enzymes, we combined affinity purification with proteomics to generate a comprehensive extra-pathway protein-protein interaction network of the plant TCA cycle. We identified 125 extra-pathway interactions in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mostly related to the mitochondrial electron transport complex/ATP synthesis and amino acid metabolism but also to proteins associated with redox stress. We chose three high-scoring and two low-scoring interactions for complementary bimolecular fluorescence complementation and yeast two-hybrid assays, which highlighted the reliability of our approach, supported the intimate involvement of TCA cycle enzymes within many biological processes, and reflected metabolic changes reported previously for the corresponding mutant lines. To <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>e the function of a subset of these interactions, we selected two mutants of mitochondrial glutaredoxin S15 and Amidase, which have not yet been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed with respect to their TCA cycle function, and performed metabolite profiling and flux analysis. Consistent with their interactions identified in this study, TCA cycle metabolites and the relative TCA flux of the two mutants were altered significantly.</p>

Circadian, Carbon, and Light Control of Expansion Growth and Leaf Movement
<p>We used Phytotyping<sup>4D</sup> to investigate the contribution of clock and light signaling to the diurnal regulation of rosette expansion growth and leaf movement in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Wild-type plants and clock mutants with a short (<i>lhycca1</i>) and long (<i>prr7prr9</i>) period were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed in a T24 cycle and in T-cycles that were closer to the mutants’ period. Wild types also were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed in various photoperiods and after transfer to free-running light or darkness. Rosette expansion and leaf movement exhibited a circadian oscillation, with superimposed transients after dawn and dusk. Diurnal responses were modified in clock mutants. <i>lhycca1</i> exhibited an inhibition of growth at the end of night and growth rose earlier after dawn, whereas <i>prr7prr9</i> showed decreased growth for the first part of the light period. Some features were partly rescued by a matching T-cycle, like the inhibition in <i>lhycca1</i> at the end of the night, indicating that it is due to premature exhaustion of starch. Other features were not rescued, revealing that the clock also regulates expansion growth more directly. Expansion growth was faster at night than in the daytime, whereas published work has shown that the synthesis of cellular components is faster in the day than at nighttime. This temporal uncoupling became larger in short photoperiods and may reflect the differing dependence of expansion and biosynthesis on energy, carbon, and water. While it has been proposed that leaf expansion and movement are causally linked, we did not observe a consistent temporal relationship between expansion and leaf movement.</p>

Histone Modifications Define Expression Bias of Homoeologous Genomes in Allotetraploid Cotton
<p>Histone modifications regulate gene expression in eukaryotes, but their roles in gene expression changes in interspecific hybrids or allotetraploids are poorly understood. Histone modifications can be mapped by immunostaining of metaphase chromosomes at the single cell level and/or by chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ing individual genes. Here, we comparatively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed immunostained metaphase chromosomes and ChIP-seq of individual genes, which revealed a chromatin basis for biased homoeologous gene expression in polyploids. We examined H3K4me3 density and transcriptome maps in root-tip cells of allotetraploid cotton (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>). The overall H3K4me3 levels were relatively equal between A and D chromosomes, which were consistent with equal numbers of expressed genes between the two subgenomes. However, intensities per chromosomal area were nearly twice as high in the D homeologs as in the A homeologs. Consistent with the cytological observation, ChIP-seq analysis showed that more D homeologs with biased H3K4me3 levels than A homeologs with biased modifications correlated with the greater number of the genes with D-biased expression than that with A-biased expression in most homeologous chromosome pairs. Two chromosomes displayed different expression levels compared with other chromosomes, which correlate with known translocations and may affect the local chromatin structure and expression levels for the genes involved. This example of genome-wide histone modifications that determine expression bias of homeologous genes in allopolyploids provides a molecular basis for the evolution and domestication of polyploid species, including many important crops.</p>

Brown and Polar Bear Y Chromosomes Reveal Extensive Male-Biased Gene Flow within Brother Lineages
<p>Brown and polar bears have become prominent examples in phylogeography, but previous phylogeographic studies relied largely on maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or were geographically restricted. The male-specific Y chromosome, a natural counterpart to mtDNA, has remained underexplored. Although this paternally inherited chromosome is indispensable for comprehensive analyses of phylogeographic patterns, technical difficulties and low variability have hampered its application in most mammals. We developed 13 novel Y-chromosomal sequence and microsatellite markers from the polar bear genome and screened these in a broad geographic sample of 130 brown and polar bears. We also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed a 390-kb-long Y-chromosomal scaffold using sequencing data from published male ursine genomes. Y chromosome evidence support the emerging understanding that brown and polar bears started to diverge no later than the Middle Pleistocene. Contrary to mtDNA patterns, we found 1) brown and polar bears to be reciprocally monophyletic sister (or rather brother) lineages, without signals of introgression, 2) male-biased gene flow across continents and on phylogeographic time scales, and 3) male dispersal that links the Alaskan ABC islands population to mainland brown bears. Due to female philopatry, mtDNA provides a highly structured estimate of population differentiation, while male-biased gene flow is a homogenizing force for nuclear genetic variation. Our findings highlight the importance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ing both maternally and paternally inherited loci for a comprehensive view of phylogeographic history, and that mtDNA-based phylogeographic studies of many mammals should be reevaluated. Recent advances in sequencing technology render the analysis of Y-chromosomal variation feasible, even in nonmodel organisms.</p>

Efficient Inference of Recombination Hot Regions in Bacterial Genomes
<p>In eukaryotes, detailed surveys of recombination rates have shown variation at multiple genomic scales and the presence of “hotspots” of highly elevated recombination. In bacteria, studies of recombination rate variation are less developed, in part because there are few analysis methods that take into account the clonal context within which bacterial evolution occurs. Here, we focus in particular on identifying “hot regions” of the genome where DNA is transferred frequently between isolates. We present a computationally efficient algorithm based on the recently developed “chromosome painting” algorithm, which characterizes patterns of haplotype sharing across a genome. We compare the average genome wide painting, which principally reflects clonal descent, with the painting for each site which additionally reflects the specific deviations at the site due to recombination. Using simulated data, we show that hot regions have consistently higher deviations from the genome wide average than normal regions. We applied our approach to previously <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed <i>Escherichia coli</i> genomes and revealed that the new method is highly correlated with the number of recombination events affecting each site inferred by ClonalOrigin, a method that is only applicable to small numbers of genomes. Furthermore, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed recombination hot regions in <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i> by using 200 genomes. We identified three recombination hot regions, which are enriched for genes related to membrane proteins. Our approach and its implementation, which is downloadable from <ext-link>https://github.com/bioprojects/orderedPainting</ext-link>, will help to develop a new phase of population genomic studies of recombination in prokaryotes.</p>

Experimental analysis of the liquid-feeding mechanism of the butterfly <i>Pieris rapae</i>
<p>The butterfly <i>Pieirs rapae</i> drinks liquid using a long proboscis. A high pressure gradient is induced in the proboscis when cibarial pump muscles contract. However, liquid feeding through the long proboscis poses a disadvantage of high flow resistance. Hence, butterflies may possess special features to compensate for this disadvantage and succeed in foraging. The main objective of this study is to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>e the liquid-feeding mechanism of butterflies. The systaltic motion of the cibarial pump organ was visualized using the synchrotron X-ray imaging technique. In addition, an ellipsoidal pump model was established based on synchrotron X-ray micro-computed tomography. To determine the relationship between the cyclic variation of the pump volume and the liquid-feeding flow, velocity fields of the intake flow at the tip of the proboscis were measured using micro-particle image velocimetry. Reynolds and Womersley numbers of liquid-feeding flow in the proboscis were ~1.40 and 0.129, respectively. The liquid-feeding flow could be characterized as a quasi-steady state laminar flow. Considering these results, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed the dimensions of the feeding apparatus on the basis of minimum energy consumption during the liquid-feeding process. The relationship between the proboscis and the cibarial pump was determined when minimum energy consumption occurs. As a result, the volume of the cibarial pump is proportional to the cube of the radius of the proboscis. It seems that the liquid-feeding system of butterflies and other long-proboscid insects follow the cube relationship. The present results provide insights into the feeding strategies of liquid-feeding butterflies.</p>

Time to Endovascular Treatment and Outcome in Acute Ischemic Stroke
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Randomized, clinical trials in selected acute ischemic stroke patients reported that for every hour delay of endovascular treatment (EVT), chances of functional independence diminish by up to 3.4%. These findings may not be fully generalizable to clinical practice because of strict in- and exclusion criteria in these trials. Therefore, we aim to assess the association of time to EVT with functional outcome in current, everyday clinical practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The MR CLEAN Registry (Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in The Netherlands) is an ongoing, prospective, observational study in all centers that perform EVT in The Netherlands. Data were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed from patients treated between March 2014 and June 2016.

Every hour increase from stroke onset to EVT start resulted in a 5.3% decreased probability of functional independence (modified Rankin Scale, 0–2). In the 742 patients with successful reperfusion, every hour increase from stroke onset to reperfusion was associated with a 7.7% decreased probability of functional independence.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Time to EVT for acute ischemic stroke in current clinical practice is strongly associated with functional outcome.

Targeting Chondroitin Sulfate Glycosaminoglycans to Treat Cardiac Fibrosis in Pathological Remodeling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Heart failure is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity, and the search for novel therapeutic approaches continues. In the monogenic disease mucopolysaccharidosis VI, loss-of-function mutations in arylsulfatase B lead to myocardial accumulation of chondroitin sulfate (CS) glycosaminoglycans, manifesting as myriad cardiac symptoms. Here, we studied changes in myocardial CS in nonmucopolysaccharidosis failing hearts and assessed its generic role in pathological cardiac remodeling.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Healthy and diseased human and rat left ventricles were subjected to histological and immunostaining methods to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>e glycosaminoglycan distribution.

Expression changes in 20 CS-related genes were studied in 3 primary human cardiac cell types and THP-1–derived macrophages under each of 9 in vitro stimulatory conditions. In 2 rat models of pathological remodeling induced by transverse aortic constriction or isoprenaline infusion, recombinant human arylsulfatase B (rhASB), clinically used as enzyme replacement therapy in mucopolysaccharidosis VI, was administered intravenously for 7 or 5 weeks, respectively. Cardiac function, myocardial fibrosis, and inflammation were assessed by echocardiography and histology.

Relative composition of CS disaccharides remained unchanged. Transforming growth factor–β induced CS upregulation in cardiac fibroblasts. CS accumulation was also observed in both the pressure-overload and the isoprenaline models of pathological remodeling in rats. Early treatment with rhASB in the transverse aortic constriction model and delayed treatment in the isoprenaline model proved rhASB to be effective at preventing cardiac deterioration and augmenting functional recovery. Functional improvement was accompanied by reduced myocardial inflammation and overall fibrosis. Tumor necrosis factor–α was identified as a direct binding partner of CS glycosaminoglycan chains, and rhASB reduced tumor necrosis factor–α—induced inflammatory gene activation in vitro in endothelial cells and macrophages.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>CS glycosaminoglycans accumulate during cardiac pathological remodeling and mediate myocardial inflammation and fibrosis. rhASB targets CS effectively as a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of heart failure.</p></sec>

Operative mortality (defined as a death occurring within 30 days from surgery or during the same hospitalization) was lower after MV repair than after replacement in both the entire population (1.3% versus 4.7%; <i>P</i><0.001) and the propensity-matched population (0.2% versus 4.4%; <i>P</i><0.001).

A younger age at the time of repair (<i>P</i>=0.001), mixed (<i>P</i>=0.004) and infracardiac (<i>P</i>=0.035) TAPVC, preoperative PVO (<i>P</i>=0.027), prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass time (<i>P</i><0.001), and longer duration of ventilation (<i>P</i>=0.028) were associated with mortality. The median follow-up was 23.2 months (range; 1–112 months). Among the 717 survivors, recurrent PVO was observed in 111 patients (15%). Associated risk factors for recurrent PVO included preoperative PVO (<i>P</i><0.001), infracardiac TAPVC (<i>P</i><0.001), mixed TAPVC (<i>P</i>=0.013), and prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass time (<i>P</i><0.001). Sutureless technique was associated with a lower restenosis rate compared with conventional repair in patients with preoperative PVO (<i>P</i>=0.038), except in newborn patients (<i>P</i>=0.443). Reintervention for restenosis was performed in 24 patients. The function of most survivors (91%) was classified according to the New York Heart Association as functional class I or II.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Surgical correction in patients with TAPVC with a biventricular anatomy can achieve an acceptable outcome. Risk factors such as a younger age at the time of repair, infracardiac and mixed TAPVC, and preoperative PVO were associated with a poorer prognosis.</p></sec>

Does First-Trimester Screening Modify the Natural History of Congenital Heart Disease?
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The study <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed the impact of first-trimester screening on the spectrum of congenital heart defects (CHDs) later in pregnancy and on the outcome of fetuses and children born alive with a CHD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The spectrum of CHDs, associated comorbidities, and outcome of fetuses, either diagnosed with a CHD in the first trimester (Group I, 127 fetuses) or only in the second-trimester screening (Group II, 344 fetuses), were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed retrospectively between 2007 and 2013. Second-trimester fetuses diagnosed with a CHD between 2007 and 2013 were also compared with Group III (532 fetuses diagnosed with a CHD in the second trimester from 1996 to 2001, the period before first-trimester screening was introduced).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The spectrum of CHDs diagnosed in the first and second trimesters in the same time period differed significantly, with a greater number of comorbidities (<i>P</i><0.0001), CHDs with univentricular outcome (<i>P</i><0.0001), intrauterine deaths (<i>P</i>=0.01), and terminations of pregnancy (<i>P</i><0.0001) in Group I compared with Group II. In Group III, significantly more cases of CHDs with univentricular outcome (<i>P</i><0.0001), intrauterine demise (<i>P</i>=0.036), and early termination (<i>P</i><0.0001) were identified compared with fetuses diagnosed with CHDs in the second trimester between 2007 and 2013.

Exploring Coronary Circulatory Response to Stenosis and Its Association With Invasive Physiologic Indexes Using Absolute Myocardial Blood Flow and Coronary Pressure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although invasive physiological assessment for coronary stenosis has become a standard practice to guide treatment strategy, coronary circulatory response and changes in invasive physiological indexes, according to different anatomic and hemodynamic lesion severity, have not been fully demonstrated in patients with coronary artery disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>One hundred fifteen patients with left anterior descending artery stenosis who underwent both <sup>13</sup>N-ammonia positron emission tomography and invasive physiological measurement were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed. Myocardial blood flow (MBF) measured with positron emission tomography and invasively measured coronary pressures were used to calculate microvascular resistance and stenosis resistance.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>With progressive worsening of angiographic stenosis severity, both resting and hyperemic transstenotic pressure gradient and stenosis resistance increased (<i>P</i><0.001 for all) and hyperemic MBF (<i>P</i><0.001) and resting microvascular resistance (<i>P</i>=0.012) decreased. Resting MBF (<i>P</i>=0.383) and hyperemic microvascular resistance (<i>P</i>=0.431) were not changed and maintained stable. Both fractional flow reserve and instantaneous wave-free ratio decreased as angiographic stenosis severity, stenosis resistance, and transstenotic pressure gradient increased and hyperemic MBF decreased (all <i>P</i><0.001). When the presence of myocardial ischemia was defined by both low hyperemic MBF and low coronary flow reserve, the diagnostic accuracy of fractional flow reserve and instantaneous wave-free ratio did not differ, regardless of cutoff values of hyperemic MBF and coronary flow reserve.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This study demonstrated how the coronary circulation changes in response to increasing coronary stenosis severity using <sup>13</sup>N-ammonium positron emission tomography–derived MBF and invasively measured pressure data.

A Population-Based Study of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Treatment in Finland 2000 to 2014
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In the event of rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), mortality is very high. AAA prevalence and incidence of ruptures have been reported to be decreasing. The treatment of AAA has also undergone a change in recent decades with a shift toward endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). Our aim was to evaluate how these changes have affected the elective and emergency treatment of AAA and their results in Finland.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>All patients treated for AAA in Finland, a country with a population of 5.5 million, during 2000 to 2014 were searched from the registry of the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare. Data on all patients who had died of AAA during the same time period were obtained from Statistics Finland. The data were combined and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The annual incidence of ruptured AAA was 16.4 per 100 000 population over 50 years and decreased significantly during the study period. Over half of the 4949 patients who had a ruptured AAA died outside the hospital. Thirty-day mortality after emergency repair was 39.4%. Intact AAA repairs numbered 4956. The absolute number of annual repairs increased during the study period, and the use of EVAR became the dominant method of elective repair. Thirty-day mortality in elective AAA repair dropped significantly from 6.3% in 2000 to 2004 to 2.7% in 2010 to 2014 mostly because of the increased number of EVAR procedures with lower mortality. Long-term mortality in patients treated with EVAR was higher than in patients treated with open repair. Mortality after elective AAA repair was primarily attributable to cardiovascular causes, but there was a slightly higher proportion of AAA-related late deaths in patients treated with EVAR.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Ruptured AAA incidence for men >65 years has declined by nearly 30% in Finland, likely because of the decrease in AAA prevalence. The treatment results have improved as well for both elective and emergency repair. Increased use of EVAR has resulted in a decrease of mortality after elective AAA repair, but results of open repair have improved as well. However, late mortality from elective EVAR is surprisingly high in comparison with open repair, which may have been exaggerated by patient selection.</p></sec>

Left Ventricular Assist Device Malfunctions
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Reports of left ventricular assist device (LVAD) malfunction have focused on pump thrombosis. However, the device consists of the pump, driveline, and peripherals, all of which are potentially subject to failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Prospectively collected data were reviewed for all LVAD device malfunctions (DMs) occurring in rotary LVADs implanted at a single center between April 2004 and May 2016. Durable LVADs included 108 Heartmate II (HM II) and 105 HeartWare VAD (HVAD). DM data were categorized according to device type and into categories related to the component that failed: (1) controller, (2) peripheral components, and (3) implantable blood pump or its integral electric driveline. Pump-related events were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed as pump-specific (suspected or confirmed thrombosis) or nonpump-specific (driveline failure). DM rates were reported as events per 1000 patient-days, and Cox proportional hazard models were used for time-to-event analyses. Cumulative rates of malfunction were examined for the main components of each type of LVAD.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Types of DM included controller failure (30%), battery failure (19%), or patient cable failure (14%), whereas only 13% were because of pump failure. DMs were more common in the HM II device (3.73 per 1000 patient-days versus 3.06 per 1000 patient-days for the HVAD, <i>P</i><0.01). A higher rate of pump-specific malfunctions was discovered in those implanted with an HM II versus an HVAD (0.55 versus 0.39, respectively; <i>P</i><0.01) and peripheral malfunctions (2.32 versus 1.78 for the HM II and HVAD, respectively; <i>P</i><0.01); no difference occurred in the incidence of controller DM between the 2 LVADs. Patients with HVAD were 90% free of a pump-specific malfunction at 3 years compared with 56% for the HM II (log-rank <i>P</i><0.003). Only 74% of the patients with HM II were free of pump thrombosis at 3 years compared with 90% of the patients with HVAD. Freedom from failure of the integrated driveline was 79% at 3 years for the HM II but 100% for the HVAD (log-rank <i>P</i><0.02).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Device malfunction is much broader than pump failure alone and occurs for different components at different rates based on the type of LVAD.</p></sec>

The Fluid Mechanics of Transcatheter Heart Valve Leaflet Thrombosis in the Neosinus
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Transcatheter heart valve (THV) thrombosis has been increasingly reported. In these studies, thrombus quantification has been based on a 2-dimensional assessment of a 3-dimensional phenomenon.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Postprocedural, 4-dimensional, volume-rendered CT data of patients with CoreValve, Evolut R, and SAPIEN 3 transcatheter aortic valve replacement enrolled in the RESOLVE study (Assessment of Transcatheter and Surgical Aortic Bioprosthetic Valve Dysfunction With Multimodality Imaging and Its Treatment with Anticoagulation) were included in this analysis. Patients on anticoagulation were excluded. SAPIEN 3 and CoreValve/Evolut R patients with and without hypoattenuated leaflet thickening were included to study differences between groups. Patients were classified as having THV thrombosis if there was any evidence of hypoattenuated leaflet thickening. Anatomic and THV deployment geometries were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed, and thrombus volumes were computed through manual 3-dimensional reconstruction. We aimed to identify and evaluate risk factors that contribute to THV thrombosis through the combination of retrospective clinical data analysis and in vitro imaging in the space between the native and THV leaflets (neosinus).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>SAPIEN 3 valves with leaflet thrombosis were on average 10% further expanded (by diameter) than those without (95.5±5.2% versus 85.4±3.9%; <i>P</i><0.001). However, this relationship was not evident with the CoreValve/Evolut R. In CoreValve/Evolut Rs with thrombosis, the thrombus volume increased linearly with implant depth (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup>=0.7, <i>P</i><0.001). This finding was not seen in the SAPIEN 3. The in vitro analysis showed that a supraannular THV deployment resulted in a nearly 7-fold decrease in stagnation zone size (velocities <0.1 m/s) when compared with an intraannular deployment. In addition, the in vitro model indicated that the size of the stagnation zone increased as cardiac output decreased.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Although transcatheter aortic valve replacement thrombosis is a multifactorial process involving foreign materials, patient-specific blood chemistry, and complex flow patterns, our study indicates that deployed THV geometry may have implications on the occurrence of thrombosis. In addition, a supraannular neosinus may reduce thrombosis risk because of reduced flow stasis. Although additional prospective studies are needed to further develop strategies for minimizing thrombus burden, these results may help identify patients at higher thrombosis risk and aid in the development of next-generation devices with reduced thrombosis risk.</p></sec>

Factors associated with event-free survival, relapse-free survival, and incidences of vascular complications were assessed. Risk factors for vascular complications were identified in a multivariable model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The median age at TA diagnosis was 36 [25–47] years, and 276 patients (86.8%) were women. After a median follow-up of 6.1 years, relapses were observed in 43%, vascular complications in 38%, and death in 5%. Progressive clinical course was observed in 45%, carotidodynia in 10%, and retinopathy in 4%. The 5- and 10-year event-free survival, relapse-free survival, and complication-free survival were 48.2% (42.2; 54.9) and 36.4% (30.3; 43.9), 58.6% (52.7; 65.1) and 47.7% (41.2; 55.1), and 69.9% (64.3; 76.0) and 53.7% (46.8; 61.7), respectively. Progressive disease course (<i>P</i>=0.018) and carotidynia (<i>P</i>=0.036) were independently associated with event-free survival. Male sex (<i>P</i>=0.048), elevated C-reactive protein (<i>P</i>=0.013), and carotidynia (<i>P</i>=0.003) were associated with relapse-free survival.

A Cytokine-Like Protein Dickkopf-Related Protein 3 Is Atheroprotective
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Dickkopf-related protein 3 (DKK3) is a secreted protein that is involved in the regulation of cardiac remodeling and vascular smooth muscle cell differentiation, but little is known about its role in atherosclerosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We tested the hypothesis that DKK3 is atheroprotective using both epidemiological and experimental approaches. Blood DKK3 levels were measured in the Bruneck Study in 2000 (n=684) and then in 2005 (n=574). <i>DKK3</i>-deficient mice were crossed with <i>apolipoprotein E</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice to evaluate atherosclerosis development and vessel injury-induced neointimal formation. Endothelial cell migration and the underlying mechanisms were studied using in vitro cell culture models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In the prospective population-based Bruneck Study, the level of plasma DKK3 was inversely related to carotid artery intima-media thickness and 5-year progression of carotid atherosclerosis independently from standard risk factors for atherosclerosis. Experimentally, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed the area of atherosclerotic lesions, femoral artery injury-induced reendothelialization, and neointima formation in both <i>DKK3</i><sup><i>-/-</i></sup><i>/apolipoprotein E</i><sup><i>-/-</i></sup> and <i>DKK3</i><sup><i>+/+</i></sup><i>/apolipoprotein E</i><sup><i>-/-</i></sup> mice. It was demonstrated that DKK3 deficiency accelerated atherosclerosis and delayed reendothelialization with consequently exacerbated neointima formation. To explore the underlying mechanisms, we performed transwell and scratch migration assays using cultured human endothelial cells, which exhibited a significant induction in cell migration in response to DKK3 stimulation. This DKK3-induced migration activated ROR2 and DVL1, activated Rac1 GTPases, and upregulated JNK and c-jun phosphorylation in endothelial cells. Knockdown of the ROR2 receptor using specific siRNA or transfection of a dominant-negative form of Rac1 in endothelial cells markedly inhibited cell migration and downstream JNK and c-jun phosphorylation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This study provides the evidence for a role of DKK3 in the protection against atherosclerosis involving endothelial migration and repair, with great therapeutic potential implications against atherosclerosis.</p></sec>

Optical Coherence Tomography Findings in Patients With Coronary Stent Thrombosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Stent thrombosis (ST) is a serious complication following coronary stenting. Intravascular optical coherence tomography (OCT) may provide insights into mechanistic processes leading to ST. We performed a prospective, multicenter study to evaluate OCT findings in patients with ST.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Consecutive patients presenting with ST were prospectively enrolled in a registry by using a centralized telephone registration system. After angiographic confirmation of ST, OCT imaging of the culprit vessel was performed with frequency domain OCT. Clinical data were collected according to a standardized protocol. OCT acquisitions were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed at a core laboratory. Dominant and contributing findings were adjudicated by an imaging adjudication committee.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Two hundred thirty-one patients presenting with ST underwent OCT imaging; 14 (6.1%) had image quality precluding further analysis. Of the remaining patients, 62 (28.6%) and 155 (71.4%) presented with early and late/very late ST, respectively. The underlying stent type was a new-generation drug-eluting stent in 50.3%. Mean reference vessel diameter was 2.9±0.6 mm and mean reference vessel area was 6.8±2.6 mm<sup>2</sup>. Stent underexpansion (stent expansion index <0.8) was observed in 44.4% of patients. The predicted average probability (95% confidence interval) that any frame had uncovered (or thrombus-covered) struts was 99.3% (96.1–99.9), 96.6% (92.4–98.5), 34.3% (15.0–60.7), and 9.6% (6.2–14.5) and malapposed struts was 21.8% (8.4–45.6), 8.5% (4.6–15.3), 6.7% (2.5–16.3), and 2.0% (1.2–3.3) for acute, subacute, late, and very late ST, respectively. The most common dominant finding adjudicated for acute ST was uncovered struts (66.7% of cases); for subacute ST, the most common dominant finding was uncovered struts (61.7%) and underexpansion (25.5%); for late ST, the most common dominant finding was uncovered struts (33.3%) and severe restenosis (19.1%); and for very late ST, the most common dominant finding was neoatherosclerosis (31.3%) and uncovered struts (20.2%). In patients presenting very late ST, uncovered stent struts were a common dominant finding in drug-eluting stents, and neoatherosclerosis was a common dominant finding in bare metal stents.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In patients with ST, uncovered and malapposed struts were frequently observed with the incidence of both decreasing with longer time intervals between stent implantation and presentation. The most frequent dominant observation varied according to time intervals from index stenting: uncovered struts and underexpansion in acute/subacute ST and neoatherosclerosis and uncovered struts in late/very late ST.</p></sec>

Brain Emboli After Left Ventricular Endocardial Ablation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Catheter ablation for ventricular tachycardia and premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) is common. Catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation is associated with a risk of cerebral emboli attributed to cardioversions and numerous ablation lesions in the low-flow left atrium, but cerebral embolic risk in ventricular ablation has not been evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We enrolled 18 consecutive patients meeting study criteria <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">schedul</span></strong>ed for ventricular tachycardia or PVC ablation over a 9-month period. Patients undergoing left ventricular (LV) ablation were compared with a control group of those undergoing right ventricular ablation only. Patients were excluded if they had implantable cardioverter defibrillators or permanent pacemakers. Radiofrequency energy was used for ablation in all cases and heparin was administered with goal-activated clotting times of 300 to 400 seconds for all LV procedures. Pre- and postprocedural brain MRI was performed on each patient within a week of the ablation procedure. Embolic infarcts were defined as new foci of reduced diffusion and high signal intensity on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery brain MRI within a vascular distribution.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The mean age was 58 years, half of the patients were men, half had a history of hypertension, and the majority had no known vascular disease or heart failure. LV ablation was performed in 12 patients (ventricular tachycardia, n=2; PVC, n=10) and right ventricular ablation was performed exclusively in 6 patients (ventricular tachycardia, n=1; PVC, n=5). Seven patients (58%) undergoing LV ablation experienced a total of 16 cerebral emboli, in comparison with zero patients undergoing right ventricular ablation (<i>P</i>=0.04). Seven of 11 patients (63%) undergoing a retrograde approach to the LV developed at least 1 new brain lesion.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>More than half of patients undergoing routine LV ablation procedures (predominately PVC ablations) experienced new brain emboli after the procedure.

Risk Factors for Coarctation of the Aorta on Prenatal Ultrasound
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Prenatal diagnosis of coarctation of the aorta (CoA) is still challenging and affected by high rates of false-positive diagnoses. The aim of this study was to ascertain the strength of association and to quantify the diagnostic accuracy of different ultrasound signs in predicting CoA prenatally.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane databases were searched. Random-effects and hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic model meta-analyses were used to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>e the data.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Seven hundred ninety-four articles were identified, and 12 (922 fetuses at risk for CoA) articles were included. Mean mitral valve diameter <i>z</i> score was lower (<i>P</i><0.001) and the mean tricuspid valve diameter <i>z</i> score was higher in fetuses with CoA than in those without CoA (<i>P</i>=0.01). Mean aortic valve diameter <i>z</i> score was lower in fetuses with CoA than in healthy fetuses (<i>P</i>≤0.001), but the ascending aorta diameter, expressed as <i>z</i> score or millimeters, was similar between groups (<i>P</i>=0.07 and 0.47, respectively). Mean aortic isthmus diameter <i>z</i> scores measured either in sagittal (<i>P</i>=0.02) or in 3-vessel trachea view (<i>P</i><0.001) were lower in fetuses with CoA. Conversely, the mean pulmonary artery diameter <i>z</i> score, the right/left ventricular and pulmonary artery/ascending aorta diameter ratios were higher (<i>P</i><0.001, <i>P</i>=0.02, and <i>P</i>=0.02, respectively) in fetuses with CoA in comparison with controls, although aortic isthmus/arterial duct diameter ratio was lower in fetuses with CoA than in those without CoA (<i>P</i><0.001). The presence of coarctation shelf and aortic arch hypoplasia were more common in fetuses with CoA than in controls (odds ratio, 26.0; 95% confidence interval, 4.42–153; <i>P</i><0.001 and odds ratio, 38.2; 95% confidence interval, 3.01–486; <i>P</i>=0.005), whereas persistent left superior vena cava (<i>P</i>=0.85), ventricular septal defect (<i>P</i>=0.12), and bicuspid aortic valve (<i>P</i>=0.14) did not carry an increased risk for this anomaly. Multiparametric diagnostic models integrating different ultrasound signs for the detection of CoA were associated with an increased detection rate.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The detection rate of CoA may improve when a multiple-criteria prediction model is adopted. Further large multicenter studies sharing the same imaging protocols are needed to develop objective models for risk assessment in these fetuses.</p></sec>

Low-Dose Aspirin for Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Events in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

After that trial ended in 2008, we followed up with the patients until 2015, with no attempt to change the previously assigned therapy.

Sex-Based Differences in Cardiometabolic Biomarkers
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Few data are available comparing cardiovascular disease (CVD) biomarker profiles between women and men in the general population. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed sex-based differences in multiple biomarkers reflecting distinct pathophysiological pathways, accounting for differences between women and men in CVD risk factors, body composition, and cardiac morphology.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A cross-sectional analysis was performed using data from the Dallas Heart Study, a multiethnic population-based study. Associations between sex and 30 distinct biomarkers representative of 6 pathophysiological categories were evaluated using multivariable linear regression adjusting for age, race, traditional CVD risk factors, kidney function, insulin resistance, MRI and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry measures of body composition and fat distribution, and left ventricular mass.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>After excluding participants with CVD, the study population included 3439 individuals, mean age 43 years, 56% women, and 52% black. Significant sex-based differences were seen in multiple categories of biomarkers, including lipids, adipokines, and biomarkers of inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, myocyte injury and stress, and kidney function. In fully adjusted models, women had higher levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein particle concentration, leptin, <sc>d</sc>-dimer, homoarginine, and N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide, and lower levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, adiponectin, lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 mass and activity, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, soluble endothelial cell adhesion molecule, symmetrical dimethylarginine, asymmetrical dimethylarginine, high-sensitivity troponin T, and cystatin C.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Biomarker profiles differ significantly between women and men in the general population. Sex differences were most apparent for biomarkers of adiposity, endothelial dysfunction, inflammatory cell recruitment, and cardiac stress and injury. Future studies are needed to characterize whether pathophysiological processes delineated by these biomarkers contribute to sex-based differences in the development and complications of CVD.</p></sec>

Impact of Computed Tomography Perfusion Imaging on the Response to Tenecteplase in Ischemic Stroke
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>We pooled 2 clinical trials of tenecteplase compared with alteplase for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke, 1 that demonstrated superiority of tenecteplase and the other that showed no difference between the treatments in patient clinical outcomes. We tested the hypotheses that reperfusion therapy with tenecteplase would be superior to alteplase in improving functional outcomes in the group of patients with target mismatch as identified with advanced imaging.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We investigated whether tenecteplase-treated patients had a different 24-hour reduction in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and a favorable odds ratio of a modified Rankin scale score of 0 to 1 versus 2 to 6 compared with alteplase-treated patients using linear regression to generate odds ratios. Imaging outcomes included rates of vessel recanalization and infarct growth at 24 hours and occurrence of large parenchymal hematoma. Baseline computed tomography perfusion was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed to assess whether patients met the target mismatch criteria (absolute mismatch volume >15 mL, mismatch ratio >1.8, baseline ischemic core <70 mL, and volume of severely hypoperfused tissue <100 mL). Patients meeting target mismatch criteria were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed as a subgroup to identify whether they had different treatment responses from the pooled group.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 146 pooled patients, 71 received alteplase and 75 received tenecteplase. Tenecteplase-treated patients had greater early clinical improvement (median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score change: tenecteplase, 7; alteplase, 2; <i>P</i>=0.018) and less parenchymal hematoma (2 of 75 versus 10 of 71; <i>P</i>=0.02). The pooled group did not show improved patient outcomes when treated with tenecteplase (modified Rankin scale score 0–1: odds ratio, 1.77; 95% confidence interval, 0.89–3.51; <i>P</i>=0.102) compared with alteplase therapy. However, in patients with target mismatch (33 tenecteplase, 35 alteplase), treatment with tenecteplase was associated with greater early clinical improvement (median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score change: tenecteplase, 6; alteplase, 1; <i>P</i><0.001) and better late independent recovery (modified Rankin scale score 0–1: odds ratio, 2.33; 95% confidence interval, 1.13–5.94; <i>P</i>=0.032) than those treated with alteplase.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Tenecteplase may offer an improved efficacy and safety profile compared with alteplase, benefits possibly exaggerated in patients with baseline computed tomography perfusion–defined target mismatch.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Impact of Left Atrial Appendage Closure During Cardiac Surgery on the Occurrence of Early Postoperative Atrial Fibrillation, Stroke, and Mortality
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Prophylactic exclusion of the left atrial appendage (LAA) is often performed during cardiac surgery ostensibly to reduce the risk of stroke. However, the clinical impact of LAA closure in humans remains inconclusive.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Of 10 633 adults who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting and valve surgery between January 2000 and December 2005, 9792 patients with complete baseline characteristics, surgery procedure, and follow-up data were included in this analysis. A propensity score–matching analysis based on 28 pretreatment covariates was performed and 461 matching pairs were derived and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed to estimate the association of LAA closure with early postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) (atrial fibrillation ≤30 days of surgery), ischemic stroke, and mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In the propensity-matched cohort, the overall incidence of POAF was 53.9%. In this group, the rate of early POAF among the patients who underwent LAA closure was 68.6% versus 31.9% for those who did not undergo the procedure (<i>P</i><0.001). LAA closure was independently associated with an increased risk of early POAF (adjusted odds ratio, 3.88; 95% confidence interval, 2.89–5.20), but did not significantly influence the risk of stroke (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.07; 95% confidence interval, 0.72–1.58) or mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.92; 95% confidence interval, 0.75–1.13).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>After adjustment for treatment allocation bias, LAA closure during routine cardiac surgery was significantly associated with an increased risk of early POAF, but it did not influence the risk of stroke or mortality. It remains uncertain whether prophylactic exclusion of the LAA is warranted for stroke prevention during non–atrial fibrillation-related cardiac surgery.</p></sec>

P2X<sub>7</sub> Deficiency Blocks Lesional Inflammasome Activity and Ameliorates Atherosclerosis in Mice
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binds as a danger signal to purinergic receptor P2X<sub>7</sub> and promotes inflammasome assembly and interleukin-1β expression. We hypothesized a functional role of the signal axis ATP–P2X<sub>7</sub> in inflammasome activation and the chronic inflammation driving atherosclerosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>P2X<sub>7</sub>-competent and P2X<sub>7</sub>-deficient macrophages were isolated and stimulated with lipopolysaccharide, ATP, or both. To assess whether P2X<sub>7</sub> may have a role in atherosclerosis, P2X<sub>7</sub> expression was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed in aortic arches from low density lipoprotein receptor<sup>-/-</sup> mice consuming a high-cholesterol or chow diet. P2X<sub>7</sub><sup>+/+</sup> and P2X<sub>7</sub><sup>−/−</sup> low density lipoprotein receptor<sup>−/−</sup> mice were fed a high-cholesterol diet to investigate the functional role of P2X<sub>7</sub> knockout in atherosclerosis. Human plaques were derived from carotid endarterectomy and stained against P2X<sub>7</sub>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Lipopolysaccharide or ATP stimulation alone did not activate caspase 1 in isolated macrophages. However, priming with lipopolysaccharide, followed by stimulation with ATP, led to an activation of caspase 1 and interleukin-1β in P2X<sub>7</sub>-competent macrophages. In contrast, P2X<sub>7</sub>-deficient macrophages showed no activation of caspase 1 after sequential stimulation while still expressing a basal amount of interleukin-1β. P2X<sub>7</sub> receptor was higher expressed in murine atherosclerotic lesions, particularly by lesional macrophages. After 16 weeks of a high-cholesterol diet, P2X<sub>7</sub>-deficient mice showed smaller atherosclerotic lesions than P2X<sub>7</sub>-competent mice (0.162 cm<sup>2</sup>±0.023 [n=9], P2X<sub>7</sub><sup>−/−</sup> low density lipoprotein receptor<sup>−/−</sup> : 0.084 cm<sup>2</sup>±0.01 [n=11], <i>P</i>=0.004) with a reduced amount of lesional macrophages. In accord with our in vitro findings, lesional caspase 1 activity was abolished in P2X<sub>7</sub><sup>−/−</sup> mice. In addition, intravital microscopy revealed reduced leukocyte rolling and adhesion in P2X<sub>7</sub>-deficient mice. Last, we observe increased P2X<sub>7</sub> expression in human atherosclerotic lesions, suggesting that our findings in mice are relevant for human disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>P2X<sub>7</sub> deficiency resolved plaque inflammation by inhibition of lesional inflammasome activation and reduced experimental atherosclerosis. Therefore, P2X<sub>7</sub> represents an interesting potential new target to combat atherosclerosis.</p></sec>

Thresholds for Ambulatory Blood Pressure Among African Americans in the Jackson Heart Study
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring is the reference standard for out-of-clinic BP measurement. Thresholds for identifying ambulatory hypertension (daytime systolic BP [SBP]/diastolic BP [DBP] ≥135/85 mm Hg, 24-hour SBP/DBP ≥130/80 mm Hg, and nighttime SBP/DBP ≥120/70 mm Hg) have been derived from European, Asian, and South American populations. We determined BP thresholds for ambulatory hypertension in a US population-based sample of African American adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed data from the Jackson Heart Study, a population-based cohort study comprised exclusively of African American adults (n=5306). Analyses were restricted to 1016 participants who completed ambulatory BP monitoring at baseline in 2000 to 2004. Mean SBP and DBP levels were calculated for daytime (10:00 am–8:00 pm), 24-hour (all available readings), and nighttime (midnight–6:00 am) periods, separately. Daytime, 24-hour, and nighttime BP thresholds for ambulatory hypertension were identified using regression- and outcome-derived approaches. The composite of a cardiovascular disease or an all-cause mortality event was used in the outcome-derived approach. For this latter approach, BP thresholds were identified only for SBP because clinic DBP was not associated with the outcome. Analyses were stratified by antihypertensive medication use.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among participants not taking antihypertensive medication, the regression-derived thresholds for daytime, 24-hour, and nighttime SBP/DBP corresponding to clinic SBP/DBP of 140/90 mm Hg were 134/85 mm Hg, 130/81 mm Hg, and 123/73 mm Hg, respectively. The outcome-derived thresholds for daytime, 24-hour, and nighttime SBP corresponding to a clinic SBP ≥140 mm Hg were 138 mm Hg, 134 mm Hg, and 129 mm Hg, respectively. Among participants taking antihypertensive medication, the regression-derived thresholds for daytime, 24-hour, and nighttime SBP/DBP corresponding to clinic SBP/DBP of 140/90 mm Hg were 135/85 mm Hg, 133/82 mm Hg, and 128/76 mm Hg, respectively. The corresponding outcome-derived thresholds for daytime, 24-hour, and nighttime SBP were 140 mm Hg, 137 mm Hg, and 133 mm Hg, respectively, among those taking antihypertensive medication.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>On the basis of the outcome-derived approach for SBP and regression-derived approach for DBP, the following definitions for daytime, 24-hour, and nighttime hypertension corresponding to clinic SBP/DBP ≥140/90 mm Hg are proposed for African American adults: daytime SBP/DBP ≥140/85 mm Hg, 24-hour SBP/DBP ≥135/80 mm Hg, and nighttime SBP/DBP ≥130/75 mm Hg, respectively.</p></sec>

Ischemic Cerebroprotection Conferred by Myeloid Lineage-Restricted or Global CD39 Transgene Expression
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cerebral tissue damage after an ischemic event can be exacerbated by inflammation and thrombosis. Elevated extracellular ATP and ADP levels are associated with cellular injury, inflammation, and thrombosis. Ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase-1 (CD39), an enzyme expressed on the plasmalemma of leukocytes and endothelial cells, suppresses platelet activation and leukocyte infiltration by phosphohydrolyzing ATP/ADP. To investigate the effects of increased CD39 in an in vivo cerebral ischemia model, we developed a transgenic mouse expressing human CD39 (hCD39).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A floxed-stop sequence was inserted between the promoter and the hCD39 transcriptional start site, generating a mouse in which the expression of hCD39 can be controlled tissue-specifically using Cre recombinase mice. We generated mice that express hCD39 globally or in myeloid-lineage cells only. Cerebral ischemia was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion. Infarct volumes were quantified by MRI after 48 hours.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Both global and transgenic hCD39- and myeloid lineage CD39-overexpressing mice (transgenic, n=9; myeloid lineage, n=6) demonstrated significantly smaller cerebral infarct volumes compared with wild-type mice. Leukocytes from ischemic and contralateral hemispheres were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed by flow cytometry. Although contralateral hemispheres had equal numbers of macrophages and neutrophils, ischemic hemispheres from transgenic mice had less infiltration (n=4). Transgenic mice showed less neurological deficit compared with wild-type mice (n=6).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This is the first report of transgenic overexpression of CD39 in mice imparting a protective phenotype after stroke, with reduced leukocyte infiltration, smaller infarct volumes, and decreased neurological deficit. CD39 overexpression, either globally or in myeloid lineage cells, quenches postischemic leukosequestration and reduces stroke-induced neurological injury.</p></sec>

Systolic Blood Pressure Trajectory, Frailty, and All-Cause Mortality >80 Years of Age
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Clinical trials show benefit from lowering systolic blood pressure (SBP) in people ≥80 years of age, but nonrandomized epidemiological studies suggest lower SBP may be associated with higher mortality. This study aimed to evaluate associations of SBP with all-cause mortality by frailty category >80 years of age and to evaluate SBP trajectories before death.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A population-based cohort study was conducted using electronic health records of 144 403 participants ≥80 years of age registered with family practices in the United Kingdom from 2001 to 2014. Participants were followed for ≤5 years. Clinical records of SBP were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed. Frailty status was classified using the e-Frailty Index into the categories of fit, mild, moderate, and severe. All-cause mortality was evaluated by frailty status and mean SBP in Cox proportional-hazards models. SBP trajectories were evaluated using person months as observations, with mean SBP and antihypertensive treatment status estimated for each person month. Fractional polynomial models were used to estimate SBP trajectories over 5 years before death.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>During follow-up, 51 808 deaths occurred. Mortality rates increased with frailty level and were greatest at SBP <110 mm Hg. In fit women, mortality was 7.7 per 100 person years at SBP 120 to 139 mm Hg, 15.2 at SBP 110 to 119 mm Hg, and 22.7 at SBP <110 mm Hg. For women with severe frailty, rates were 16.8, 25.2, and 39.6, respectively. SBP trajectories showed an accelerated decline in the last 2 years of life. The relative odds of SBP <120 mm Hg were higher in the last 3 months of life than 5 years previously in both treated (odds ratio, 6.06; 95% confidence interval, 5.40–6.81) and untreated (odds ratio, 6.31; 95% confidence interval, 5.30–7.52) patients. There was no evidence of intensification of antihypertensive therapy in the final 2 years of life.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>A terminal decline of SBP in the final 2 years of life suggests that nonrandomized epidemiological associations of low SBP with higher mortality may be accounted for by reverse causation if participants with lower blood pressure values are closer, on average, to the end of life.</p></sec>

Loss of Cardioprotective Effects at the <i>ADAMTS7</i> Locus as a Result of Gene-Smoking Interactions
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Common diseases such as coronary heart disease (CHD) are complex in etiology. The interaction of genetic susceptibility with lifestyle factors may play a prominent role. However, gene-lifestyle interactions for CHD have been difficult to identify. Here, we investigate interaction of smoking behavior, a potent lifestyle factor, with genotypes that have been shown to associate with CHD risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed data on 60 919 CHD cases and 80 243 controls from 29 studies for gene-smoking interactions for genetic variants at 45 loci previously reported to be associated with CHD risk. We also studied 5 loci associated with smoking behavior. Study-specific gene-smoking interaction effects were calculated and pooled using fixed-effects meta-analyses. Interaction analyses were declared to be significant at a <i>P</i> value of <1.0×10<sup>–3</sup> (Bonferroni correction for 50 tests).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We identified novel gene-smoking interaction for a variant upstream of the <i>ADAMTS7</i> gene.

The protective T allele at rs7178051 was also associated with reduced <i>ADAMTS7</i> expression in human aortic endothelial cells and lymphoblastoid cell lines.

Three-dimensional confocal microscopy and computational image analysis were applied to assess t-system structure, density, and distance of ryanodine receptor clusters to the sarcolemma, including the t-system. Recovery of cardiac function in response to mechanical unloading was assessed by echocardiography during turndown of the LVAD.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The majority of HF myocytes showed remarkable t-system remodeling, particularly sheet-like invaginations of the sarcolemma. Circularity of t-system components was decreased in HF versus controls (0.37±0.01 versus 0.46±0.02; <i>P</i><0.01), and the volume/length ratio was increased in HF (0.36±0.01 versus 0.25±0.02 µm<sup>2</sup>; <i>P</i><0.0001). T-system density was reduced in HF, leading to increased ryanodine receptor–sarcolemma distances (0.96±0.05 versus 0.64±0.1 µm; <i>P</i><0.01). Low ryanodine receptor–sarcolemma distances at the time of LVAD implantation predicted high post-LVAD left ventricular ejection fractions (<i>P</i><0.01) and ejection fraction increases during unloading (<i>P</i><0.01). Ejection fraction in patients with pre-LVAD ryanodine receptor–sarcolemma distances >1 µm did not improve after mechanical unloading. In addition, calcium transients were recorded in field-stimulated isolated human cardiomyocytes and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed with respect to local t-system density. Calcium release in HF myocytes was restricted to regions proximal to the sarcolemma. Local calcium upstroke was delayed (23.9±4.9 versus 10.3±1.7 milliseconds; <i>P</i><0.05) and more asynchronous (18.1±1.5 versus 8.9±2.2 milliseconds; <i>P</i><0.01) in HF cells with low t-system density versus cells with high t-system density.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The t-system in end-stage human HF presents a characteristic novel phenotype consisting of sheet-like invaginations of the sarcolemma. Our results suggest that the remodeled t-system impairs excitation-contraction coupling and functional recovery during chronic LVAD unloading. An intact t-system at the time of LVAD implantation may constitute a precondition and predictor for functional cardiac recovery after mechanical unloading.</p></sec>

Weight Loss and Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Associations of obesity with incidence of heart failure have been observed, but the causality is uncertain. We hypothesized that gastric bypass surgery leads to a lower incidence of heart failure compared with intensive lifestyle modification in obese people.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We included obese people without previous heart failure from a Swedish nationwide registry of people treated with a structured intensive lifestyle program and the Scandinavian Obesity Surgery Registry. All analyses used inverse probability weights based on baseline body mass index and a propensity score estimated from baseline variables. Treatment groups were well balanced in terms of weight, body mass index, and most potential confounders. Associations of treatment with heart failure incidence, as defined in the National Patient Register, were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed with Cox regression.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The 25 804 gastric bypass surgery patients had on average lost 18.8 kg more weight after 1 year and 22.6 kg more after 2 years than the 13 701 lifestyle modification patients. During a median of 4.1 years, surgery patients had lower heart failure incidence than lifestyle modification patients (hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% confidence interval, 0.36–0.82). A 10-kg achieved weight loss after 1 year was related to a hazard ratio for heart failure of 0.77 (95% confidence interval, 0.60–0.97) in both treatment groups combined. Results were robust in sensitivity analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Gastric bypass surgery was associated with approximately one half the incidence of heart failure compared with intensive lifestyle modification in this study of 2 large nationwide registries. We also observed a graded association between increasing weight loss and decreasing risk of heart failure.</p></sec>

Evaluation of Cell Therapy on Exercise Performance and Limb Perfusion in Peripheral Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Atherosclerotic peripheral artery disease affects 8% to 12% of Americans >65 years of age and is associated with a major decline in functional status, increased myocardial infarction and stroke rates, and increased risk of ischemic amputation. Current treatment strategies for claudication have limitations. PACE (Patients With Intermittent Claudication Injected With ALDH Bright Cells) is a National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute–sponsored, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 exploratory clinical trial designed to assess the safety and efficacy of autologous bone marrow–derived aldehyde dehydrogenase bright (ALDHbr) cells in patients with peripheral artery disease and to explore associated claudication physiological mechanisms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>All participants, randomized 1:1 to receive ALDHbr cells or placebo, underwent bone marrow aspiration and isolation of ALDHbr cells, followed by 10 injections into the thigh and calf of the index leg. The coprimary end points were change from baseline to 6 months in peak walking time (PWT), collateral count, peak hyperemic popliteal flow, and capillary perfusion measured by magnetic resonance imaging, as well as safety.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 82 patients with claudication and infrainguinal peripheral artery disease were randomized at 9 sites, of whom 78 had <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>able data (57 male, 21 female patients; mean age, 66±9 years). The mean±SEM differences in the change over 6 months between study groups for PWT (0.9±0.8 minutes; 95% confidence interval [CI] −0.6 to 2.5; <i>P</i>=0.238), collateral count (0.9±0.6 arteries; 95% CI, −0.2 to 2.1; P=0.116), peak hyperemic popliteal flow (0.0±0.4 mL/s; 95% CI, −0.8 to 0.8; <i>P</i>=0.978), and capillary perfusion (−0.2±0.6%; 95% CI, −1.3 to 0.9; P=0.752) were not significant. In addition, there were no significant differences for the secondary end points, including quality-of-life measures. There were no adverse safety outcomes. Correlative relationships between magnetic resonance imaging measures and PWT were not significant. A post hoc exploratory analysis suggested that ALDHbr cell administration might be associated with an increase in the number of collateral arteries (1.5±0.7; 95% CI, 0.1–2.9; <i>P</i>=0.047) in participants with completely occluded femoral arteries.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>ALDHbr cell administration did not improve PWT or magnetic resonance outcomes, and the changes in PWT were not associated with the anatomic or physiological magnetic resonance imaging end points.

Releasing the Brakes on the Fibrinolytic System in Pulmonary Emboli
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In patients with hemodynamically significant pulmonary embolism, physiological fibrinolysis fails to dissolve thrombi acutely and r-tPA (recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator) therapy may be required, despite its bleeding risk. To examine potential mechanisms, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed the expression of key fibrinolytic molecules in experimental pulmonary emboli, assessed the contribution of α2-antiplasmin to fibrinolytic failure, and compared the effects of plasminogen activation and α2-antiplasmin inactivation on experimental thrombus dissolution and bleeding.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Pulmonary embolism was induced by jugular vein infusion of <sup>125</sup>I-fibrin or fluorescein isothiocyanate-fibrin labeled emboli in anesthetized mice. Thrombus site expression of key fibrinolytic molecules was determined by immunofluorescence staining. The effects of r-tPA and α2-antiplasmin inactivation on fibrinolysis and bleeding were examined in a humanized model of pulmonary embolism.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The plasminogen activation and plasmin inhibition system assembled at the site of acute pulmonary emboli in vivo. Thrombus dissolution was markedly accelerated in mice with normal α2-antiplasmin levels treated with an α2-antiplasmin–inactivating antibody (<i>P</i><0.0001). Dissolution of pulmonary emboli by α2-antiplasmin inactivation alone was comparable to 3 mg/kg r-tPA. Low-dose r-tPA alone did not dissolve emboli, but was synergistic with α2-antiplasmin inactivation, causing more embolus dissolution than clinical-dose r-tPA alone (<i>P</i><0.001) or α2-antiplasmin inactivation alone (<i>P</i><0.001). Despite greater thrombus dissolution, α2-antiplasmin inactivation alone, or in combination with low-dose r-tPA, did not lead to fibrinogen degradation, did not cause bleeding (versus controls), and caused less bleeding than clinical-dose r-tPA (<i>P</i><0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Although the fibrinolytic system assembles at the site of pulmonary emboli, thrombus dissolution is halted by α2-antiplasmin. Inactivation of α2-antiplasmin was comparable to pharmacological r-tPA for dissolving thrombi. However, α2-antiplasmin inactivation showed a unique pattern of thrombus specificity, because unlike r-tPA, it did not degrade fibrinogen or enhance experimental bleeding. This suggests that modifying the activity of a key regulator of the fibrinolytic system, like α2-antiplasmin, may have unique therapeutic value in pulmonary embolism.</p></sec>

Duration of Prehospital Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Favorable Neurological Outcomes for Pediatric Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrests
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The appropriate duration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCAs) remains unclear and may differ based on initial rhythm. We aimed to determine the relationship between the duration of prehospital CPR by emergency medical services (EMS) personnel and post-OHCA outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed the records of 12 877 pediatric patients who experienced OHCAs (<18 years of age). Data were recorded in a nationwide Japanese database between 2005 and 2012. Study end points were 30-day survival and 30-day survival with favorable neurological outcomes (Cerebral Performance Category [CPC] scale 1–2). Prehospital EMS-initiated CPR duration was defined as the time from CPR initiation by EMS personnel to prehospital return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) or to hospital arrival when prehospital ROSC was not achieved during prehospital CPR efforts.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The rates of 30-day survival and 30-day CPC 1 to 2 were 9.1% (n=1167) and 2.5% (n=325), respectively. Prehospital EMS-initiated CPR duration was significantly and inversely associated with 30-day outcomes (adjusted odds ratio for 1-minute increments: 0.94, 95% confidence interval: 0.93–0.95 for survival; adjusted odds ratio: 0.90, 95% confidence interval: 0.88–0.92 for CPC 1–2). The duration of prehospital EMS-initiated CPR, beyond which the chance for favorable outcomes diminished to <1%, was 42 minutes for each key outcome, 30-day survival, and 30-day survival with CPC 1 to 2. When categorized by initial rhythm, the prehospital EMS-initiated CPR durations beyond which the chance for 30-day survival with CPC 1 to 2 diminished to <1% were 39 minutes for shockable rhythms, 42 minutes for pulseless electric activity, and 46 minutes for asystole, respectively.

MicroRNA-Based Therapy of GATA2-Deficient Vascular Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The transcription factor GATA2 orchestrates the expression of many endothelial-specific genes, illustrating its crucial importance for endothelial cell function. The capacity of this transcription factor in orchestrating endothelial-important microRNAs (miRNAs/miR) is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Endothelial GATA2 was functionally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed in human endothelial cells in vitro. Endogenous short interfering RNA–mediated knockdown and lentiviral-based overexpression were applied to decipher the capacity of GATA2 in regulating cell viability and capillary formation. Next, the GATA2-dependent miR transcriptome was identified by using a profiling approach on the basis of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Transcriptional control of miR promoters was assessed via chromatin immunoprecipitation, luciferase promoter assays, and bisulfite sequencing analysis of sites in proximity. Selected miRs were modulated in combination with GATA2 to identify signaling pathways at the angiogenic cytokine level via proteome profiler and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Downstream miR targets were identified via bioinformatic target prediction and luciferase reporter gene assays. In vitro findings were translated to a mouse model of carotid injury in an endothelial <i>GATA2</i> knockout background. Nanoparticle-mediated delivery of proangiogenic miR-126 was tested in the reendothelialization model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>GATA2 gain- and loss-of-function experiments in human umbilical vein endothelial cells identified a key role of GATA2 as master regulator of multiple endothelial functions via miRNA-dependent mechanisms. Global miRNAnome-screening identified several GATA2-regulated miRNAs including miR-126 and miR-221. Specifically, proangiogenic miR-126 was regulated by GATA2 transcriptionally and targeted antiangiogenic SPRED1 and FOXO3a contributing to GATA2-mediated formation of normal vascular structures, whereas GATA2 deficiency led to vascular abnormalities. In contrast to GATA2 deficiency, supplementation with miR-126 normalized vascular function and expression profiles of cytokines contributing to proangiogenic paracrine effects. GATA2 silencing resulted in endothelial DNA hypomethylation leading to induced expression of antiangiogenic miR-221 by GATA2-dependent demethylation of a putative CpG island in the miR-221 promoter. Mechanistically, a reverted GATA2 phenotype by endogenous suppression of miR-221 was mediated through direct proangiogenic miR-221 target genes ICAM1 and ETS1. In a mouse model of carotid injury, GATA2 was reduced, and systemic supplementation of miR-126–coupled nanoparticles enhanced miR-126 availability in the carotid artery and improved reendothelialization of injured carotid arteries in vivo.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>GATA2-mediated regulation of miR-126 and miR-221 has an important impact on endothelial biology. Hence, modulation of GATA2 and its targets miR-126 and miR-221 is a promising therapeutic strategy for treatment of many vascular diseases.</p></sec>

NLRP3 Inflammasome Mediates Aldosterone-Induced Vascular Damage
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Inflammation is a key feature of aldosterone-induced vascular damage and dysfunction, but molecular mechanisms by which aldosterone triggers inflammation remain unclear. The NLRP3 inflammasome is a pivotal immune sensor that recognizes endogenous danger signals triggering sterile inflammation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed vascular function and inflammatory profile of wild-type (WT), NLRP3 knockout (<i>NLRP3</i><sup>−/−</sup>), caspase-1 knockout (<i>Casp-1</i><sup>−/−</sup>), and interleukin-1 receptor knockout (<i>IL-1R</i><sup>−/−</sup>) mice treated with vehicle or aldosterone (600 µg·kg<sup>−1</sup>·d<sup>−1</sup> for 14 days through osmotic mini-pump) while receiving 1% saline to drink.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Here, we show that NLRP3 inflammasome plays a central role in aldosterone-induced vascular dysfunction. Long-term infusion of aldosterone in mice resulted in elevation of plasma interleukin-1β levels and vascular abnormalities. Mice lacking the IL-1R or the inflammasome components NLRP3 and caspase-1 were protected from aldosterone-induced vascular damage. In vitro, aldosterone stimulated NLRP3-dependent interleukin-1β secretion by bone marrow–derived macrophages by activating nuclear factor-κB signaling and reactive oxygen species generation. Moreover, chimeric mice reconstituted with NLRP3-deficient hematopoietic cells showed that NLRP3 in immune cells mediates aldosterone-induced vascular damage. In addition, aldosterone increased the expression of NLRP3, active caspase-1, and mature interleukin-1β in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Hypertensive patients with hyperaldosteronism or normal levels of aldosterone exhibited increased activity of NLRP3 inflammasome, suggesting that the effect of hyperaldosteronism on the inflammasome may be mediated through high blood pressure.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Together, these data demonstrate that NLRP3 inflammasome, through activation of IL-1R, is critically involved in the deleterious vascular effects of aldosterone, placing NLRP3 as a potential target for therapeutic interventions in conditions with high aldosterone levels.</p></sec>

This nationwide study assessed outcomes after OR and EVAR for MAAA in a population-based cohort.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>All patients treated for MAAAs in Sweden between 1994 and 2014 were identified in the Swedish vascular registry. The primary aim was to assess survival after MAAA with OR and EVAR. Secondary aims were analyses of the rate of recurrent infections and reoperations, and time trends in surgical treatment. Survival was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed using Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests. A propensity score–weighted correction for risk factor differences in the 2 groups was performed, including the operation year to account for differences in treatment and outcomes over time.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We identified 132 patients (0.6% of all operated abdominal aortic aneurysms in Sweden). Mean age was 70 years (standard deviation, 9.2), and 50 presented with rupture. Survival at 3 months was 86% (95% confidence interval, 80%–92%), at 1 year 79% (72%–86%), and at 5 years 59% (50%–68%). The preferred operative technique shifted from OR to EVAR after 2001 (proportion EVAR 1994–2000 0%, 2001–2007 58%, 2008–2014 60%). Open repair was performed in 62 patients (47%): aortic resection and extra-anatomic bypass (n=7), in situ reconstruction (n=50), and patch plasty (n=3); 2 patients died intraoperatively. EVAR was performed in 70 patients (53%): standard EVAR (n=55), fenestrated/branched EVAR (n=8), and visceral deviation with stent grafting (n=7); no deaths occurred intraoperatively. Survival at 3 months was lower for OR than for EVAR (74% versus 96%, <i>P</i><0.001), with a similar trend present at 1 year (73% versus 84%, <i>P</i>=0.054). A propensity score–weighted risk-adjusted analysis confirmed the early better survival associated with EVAR.

CaMKII protein abundance was increased only in sarcomere-mutation HCM (<i>P</i><0.001). The CaMKII target pT17-phospholamban was 5.5-fold increased only in sarcomere-mutation HCM (<i>P</i>=0.01), as was autophosphorylated CaMKII (<i>P</i><0.01), suggestive of constitutive activation. Calcineurin (<i>PPP3CB</i>) mRNA was not increased, nor was <i>RCAN1</i> mRNA level, indicating a lack of calcineurin activation. Furthermore, myocyte enhancer factor 2 and nuclear factor of activated T cell transcription factor activity was not increased in HCM, suggesting that calcineurin pathway activation is not an upstream cause of increased CAMKII protein abundance or activation. <i>SERCA2A</i> mRNA transcript levels were reduced in HCM regardless of genotype, as was sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticular calcium ATPase 2/phospholamban protein ratio (45% reduced; <i>P</i>=0.03). <sup>45</sup>Ca sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticular calcium ATPaseuptake assay showed reduced uptake velocity in HCM regardless of genotype (<i>P</i>=0.01).

Untreated Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Hypertension is a significant risk factor for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Although ethnic/racial disparities related to hypertension and ICH have been reported, these previous studies were limited by a lack of Hispanics and inadequate power to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>e by ICH location. In the current study, while overcoming these prior limitations, we investigated whether there was variation by ethnicity/race of treated and untreated hypertension as risk factors for ICH.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The ERICH study (Ethnic/Racial Variations of Intracerebral Hemorrhage) is a prospective, multicenter, case-control study of ICH among whites, blacks, and Hispanics. Cases were enrolled from 42 recruitment sites. Controls matched to cases 1:1 by age (±5 years), sex, ethnicity/race, and metropolitan area were identified by random-digit dialing. Subjects were interviewed to determine history of hypertension and use of antihypertensive medications. Cases and controls within ethnic groups were compared by using conditional logistic regression. Multivariable conditional logistic regression models were computed for ICH as an overall group and separately for the location subcategories deep, lobar, and infratentorial (brainstem/cerebellar).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Nine hundred fifty-eight white, 880 black, and 766 Hispanic ICH patients were enrolled. For ICH cases, untreated hypertension was higher in blacks (43.6%, <i>P</i><0.0001) and Hispanics (46.9%, <i>P</i><0.0001) versus whites (32.7%). In multivariable analyses adjusted for alcohol use, anticoagulation, hypercholesterolemia, education, and medical insurance status, treated hypertension was a significant risk factor across all locations of ICH in whites (odds ratio [OR], 1.57; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24–1.98; <i>P</i><0.0001), blacks (OR, 3.02; 95% CI, 2.16–4.22; <i>P</i><0.0001), and Hispanics (OR, 2.50; 95% CI, 1.73–3.62; <i>P</i><0.0001). Untreated hypertension was a substantially greater risk factor for all 3 racial/ethnic groups across all locations of ICH: whites (OR, 8.79; 95% CI, 5.66–13.66; <i>P</i><0.0001), blacks (OR, 12.46; 95% CI, 8.08–19.20; <i>P</i><0.0001), and Hispanics (OR, 10.95; 95% CI, 6.58–18.23; <i>P</i><0.0001).

Closing the Gap in Hypertension Control Between Younger and Older Adults
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Joint National Committee goal blood pressure for all adults was <140/<90 mm Hg or lower from 1984 to 2013. Adults aged ≥60 years (older) have mainly isolated systolic hypertension, with major trials attaining systolic blood pressure <150 but not <140 mm Hg. The main objective was to assess changes in hypertension control to <140/<90 mm Hg in younger (aged <60 years) and older adults and <150/<90 mm Hg in the latter.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) 1988 to 1994, 1999 to 2004, and 2005 to 2010 were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed in adults aged ≥18 years. From 1988 to 1994 to 2005 to 2010, hypertension control to <140/<90 mm Hg improved in older (31.6% to 53.1%; <i>P</i><0.001) and younger (45.7% to 55.9%; <i>P</i><0.001) patients. The age gap in control declined from 14.1% (<i>P</i><0.01) in 1988 to 1994 to 2.8% (<i>P</i>=0.13) in 2005 to 2010. Better hypertension control reflected increased percentages of older (55.6% to 77.5%) and younger (34.6% to 54.7%) patients on treatment and treated older (45.7% to 64.9%) and younger (56.8% to 73.4%) patients controlled (all <i>P</i><0.001). Control to <150/<90 mm Hg rose from 48.8% to 69.9% in older adults. Antihypertensive medication number and percentages on ≥3 medications increased in both age groups but increased more in older patients (<i>P</i><0.01). Blood pressure control was higher in both age groups with ≥2 healthcare visits per year and on statin therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>The age gap in hypertension control to <140/<90 mm Hg was virtually eliminated in 2005 to 2010 as clinicians intensified therapy, especially in older patients in whom isolated systolic hypertension predominates, controlling 70% to <150/<90 mm Hg. More frequent healthcare visits and the use of statin therapy may improve hypertension control in all adults.</p></sec>

<i>CCBE1</i> Enhances Lymphangiogenesis via A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease With Thrombospondin Motifs-3–Mediated Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-C Activation
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Hennekam lymphangiectasia–lymphedema syndrome (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man 235510) is a rare autosomal recessive disease, which is associated with mutations in the <i>CCBE1</i> gene. Because of the striking phenotypic similarity of embryos lacking either the <i>Ccbe1</i> gene or the lymphangiogenic growth factor <i>Vegfc</i> gene, we searched for collagen- and calcium-binding epidermal growth factor domains 1 (CCBE1) interactions with the vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) growth factor signaling pathway, which is critical in embryonic and adult lymphangiogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>By <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ing VEGF-C produced by CCBE1-transfected cells, we found that, whereas CCBE1 itself does not process VEGF-C, it promotes proteolytic cleavage of the otherwise poorly active 29/31-kDa form of VEGF-C by the A disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin motifs-3 protease, resulting in the mature 21/23-kDa form of VEGF-C, which induces increased VEGF-C receptor signaling. Adeno-associated viral vector–mediated transduction of CCBE1 into mouse skeletal muscle enhanced lymphangiogenesis and angiogenesis induced by adeno-associated viral vector–VEGF-C.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>These results identify A disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin motifs-3 as a VEGF-C–activating protease and reveal a novel type of regulation of a vascular growth factor by a protein that enhances its proteolytic cleavage and activation. The results suggest that CCBE1 is a potential therapeutic tool for the modulation of lymphangiogenesis and angiogenesis in a variety of diseases that involve the lymphatic system, such as lymphedema or lymphatic metastasis.</p></sec>

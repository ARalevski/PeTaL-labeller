Carbon nanotube transistors scaled to a 40-nanometer footprint
<p>The International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors challenges the device research community to reduce the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transistor</span></strong> footprint containing all components to 40 nanometers within the next decade. We report on a p-channel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transistor</span></strong> scaled to such an extremely small dimension. Built on one semiconducting carbon nanotube, it occupies less than half the space of leading silicon technologies, while delivering a significantly higher pitch-normalized current density—above 0.9 milliampere per micrometer at a low supply voltage of 0.5 volts with a subthreshold swing of 85 millivolts per decade. Furthermore, we show <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transistor</span></strong>s with the same small footprint built on actual high-density arrays of such nanotubes that deliver higher current than that of the best-competing silicon devices under the same overdrive, without any normalization. We achieve this using low-resistance end-bonded contacts, a high-purity semiconducting carbon nanotube source, and self-assembly to pack nanotubes into full surface-coverage aligned arrays.</p>

Epitaxial lift-off of electrodeposited single-crystal gold foils for flexible electronics
<p>We introduce a simple and inexpensive procedure for epitaxial lift-off of wafer-size flexible and transparent foils of single-crystal gold using silicon as a template. Lateral electrochemical undergrowth of a sacrificial SiO<i><sub>x</sub></i> layer was achieved by photoelectrochemically oxidizing silicon under light irradiation. A 28-nanometer-thick gold foil with a sheet resistance of 7 ohms per square showed only a 4% increase in resistance after 4000 bending cycles. A flexible organic light-emitting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diod</span></strong>e based on tris(bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) that was spin-coated on a foil exploited the transmittance and flexibility of the gold foil. Cuprous oxide as an inorganic semiconductor that was epitaxially electrodeposited onto the gold foils exhibited a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diod</span></strong>e quality factor <i>n</i> of 1.6 (where <i>n</i> = 1.0 for an ideal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diod</span></strong>e), compared with a value of 3.1 for a polycrystalline deposit. Zinc oxide nanowires electrodeposited epitaxially on a gold foil also showed flexibility, with the nanowires intact up to 500 bending cycles.</p>

Printed subthreshold organic transistors operating at high gain and ultralow power
<p>Overcoming the trade-offs among power consumption, fabrication cost, and signal amplification has been a long-standing issue for wearable electronics. We report a high-gain, fully inkjet-printed Schottky barrier organic thin-film <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transistor</span></strong> amplifier circuit. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transistor</span></strong> signal amplification efficiency is 38.2 siemens per ampere, which is near the theoretical thermionic limit, with an ultralow power consumption of <1 nanowatt. The use of a Schottky barrier for the source gave the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transistor</span></strong> geometry-independent electrical characteristics and accommodated the large dimensional variation in inkjet-printed features. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transistor</span></strong>s exhibited good reliability with negligible threshold-voltage shift. We demonstrated this capability with an ultralow-power high-gain amplifier for the detection of electrophysiological signals and showed a signal-to-noise ratio of >60 decibels and noise voltage of <0.3 microvolt per hertz<sup>1/2</sup> at 100 hertz.</p>

Aptamer–field-effect transistors overcome Debye length limitations for small-molecule sensing
<p>Detection of analytes by means of field-effect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transistor</span></strong>s bearing ligand-specific receptors is fundamentally limited by the shielding created by the electrical double layer (the “Debye length” limitation). We detected small molecules under physiological high–ionic strength conditions by modifying printed ultrathin metal-oxide field-effect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transistor</span></strong> arrays with deoxyribonucleotide aptamers selected to bind their targets adaptively. Target-induced conformational changes of negatively charged aptamer phosphodiester backbones in close proximity to semiconductor channels gated conductance in physiological buffers, resulting in highly sensitive detection. Sensing of charged and electroneutral targets (serotonin, dopamine, glucose, and sphingosine-1-phosphate) was enabled by specifically isolated aptameric stem-loop receptors.</p>

A single-photon switch and transistor enabled by a solid-state quantum memory
<p>Single-photon switches and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transistor</span></strong>s generate strong photon-photon interactions that are essential for quantum circuits and networks. However, the deterministic control of an optical signal with a single photon requires strong interactions with a quantum memory, which has been challenging to achieve in a solid-state platform. We demonstrate a single-photon switch and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transistor</span></strong> enabled by a solid-state quantum memory. Our device consists of a semiconductor spin qubit strongly coupled to a nanophotonic cavity. The spin qubit enables a single 63-picosecond gate photon to switch a signal field containing up to an average of 27.7 photons before the internal state of the device resets. Our results show that semiconductor nanophotonic devices can produce strong and controlled photon-photon interactions that could enable high-bandwidth photonic quantum information processing.</p>

Highly stretchable polymer semiconductor films through the nanoconfinement effect
<p>Soft and conformable wearable electronics require stretchable semiconductors, but existing ones typically sacrifice charge transport mobility to achieve stretchability. We explore a concept based on the nanoconfinement of polymers to substantially improve the stretchability of polymer semiconductors, without affecting charge transport mobility. The increased polymer chain dynamics under nanoconfinement significantly reduces the modulus of the conjugated polymer and largely delays the onset of crack formation under strain. As a result, our fabricated semiconducting film can be stretched up to 100% strain without affecting mobility, retaining values comparable to that of amorphous silicon. The fully stretchable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transistor</span></strong>s exhibit high biaxial stretchability with minimal change in on current even when poked with a sharp object. We demonstrate a skinlike finger-wearable driver for a light-emitting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diod</span></strong>e.</p>

Photocatalytic decarboxylative alkylations mediated by triphenylphosphine and sodium iodide
<p>Most photoredox catalysts in current use are precious metal complexes or synthetically elaborate organic dyes, the cost of which can impede their application for large-scale industrial processes.

Deaminative alkylation using Katritzky’s N-alkylpyridinium salts and trifluoromethylation using Togni’s reagent are also demonstrated. Moreover, the phosphine/iodide-based photoredox system catalyzes Minisci-type alkylation of N-heterocycles and can operate in tandem with chiral phosphoric acids to achieve high enantioselectivity in this reaction.</p>

Eliminating nonradiative decay in Cu(I) emitters: >99% quantum efficiency and microsecond lifetime

We achieve photoluminescence efficiencies >99% and microsecond lifetimes, which lead to an efficient blue-emitting OLED. Photophysical analysis and simulations reveal a temperature-dependent interplay between emissive singlet and triplet charge-transfer states and amide-localized triplet states.</p>

Controlled crack propagation for atomic precision handling of wafer-scale two-dimensional materials
<p>Although flakes of two-dimensional (2D) heterostructures at the micrometer scale can be formed with adhesive-tape exfoliation methods, isolation of 2D flakes into monolayers is extremely time consuming because it is a trial-and-error process. Controlling the number of 2D layers through direct growth also presents difficulty because of the high nucleation barrier on 2D materials. We demonstrate a layer-resolved 2D material splitting technique that permits high-throughput production of multiple monolayers of wafer-scale (5-centimeter diameter) 2D materials by splitting single stacks of thick 2D materials grown on a single wafer. Wafer-scale uniformity of hexagonal boron nitride, tungsten disulfide, tungsten diselenide, molybdenum disulfide, and molybdenum diselenide monolayers was verified by photoluminescence response and by substantial retention of electronic conductivity. We fabricated wafer-scale van der Waals heterostructures, including field-effect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transistor</span></strong>s, with single-atom thickness resolution.</p>

Dirac-source field-effect transistors as energy-efficient, high-performance electronic switches

We show that a graphene Dirac source (DS) with a much narrower electron density distribution around the Fermi level than that of conventional FETs can lower SS. A DS-FET with a carbon nanotube channel provided an average SS of 40 millivolts per decade over four decades of current at room temperature and high device current <i>I</i><sub>60</sub> of up to 40 microamperes per micrometer at 60 millivolts per decade. When compared with state-of-the-art silicon 14-nanometer node FETs, a similar on-state current <i>I</i><sub>on</sub> is realized but at a much lower supply voltage of 0.5 volts (versus 0.7 volts for silicon) and a much steeper SS below 35 millivolts per decade in the off-state.</p>

Enhanced water permeability and tunable ion selectivity in subnanometer carbon nanotube porins

Intermolecular hydrogen-bond rearrangement, required for entry into the nanotube, dominates the energy barrier and can be manipulated to enhance water transport rates. CNTPs block anion transport, even at salinities that exceed seawater levels, and their ion selectivity can be tuned to configure them into switchable ionic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diod</span></strong>es.

Robust epitaxial growth of two-dimensional heterostructures, multiheterostructures, and superlattices

A reverse flow during the temperature-swing stage in the sequential vapor deposition growth process allowed us to cool the existing 2D crystals to prevent undesired thermal degradation and uncontrolled homogeneous nucleation, thus enabling highly robust block-by-block epitaxial growth. Raman and photoluminescence mapping studies showed that a wide range of 2D heterostructures (such as WS<sub>2</sub>-WSe<sub>2</sub> and WS<sub>2</sub>-MoSe<sub>2</sub>), multiheterostructures (such as WS<sub>2</sub>-WSe<sub>2</sub>-MoS<sub>2</sub> and WS<sub>2</sub>-MoSe<sub>2</sub>-WSe<sub>2</sub>), and superlattices (such as WS<sub>2</sub>-WSe<sub>2</sub>-WS<sub>2</sub>-WSe<sub>2</sub>-WS<sub>2</sub>) were readily prepared with precisely controlled spatial modulation.

High-performance light-emitting diodes based on carbene-metal-amides
<p>Organic light-emitting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diod</span></strong>es (OLEDs) promise highly efficient lighting and display technologies. We introduce a new class of linear donor-bridge-acceptor light-emitting molecules, which enable solution-processed OLEDs with near-100% internal quantum efficiency at high brightness. Key to this performance is their rapid and efficient utilization of triplet states. Using time-resolved spectroscopy, we establish that luminescence via triplets occurs within 350 nanoseconds at ambient temperature, after reverse intersystem crossing to singlets. We find that molecular geometries exist at which the singlet-triplet energy gap (exchange energy) is close to zero, so that rapid interconversion is possible. Calculations indicate that exchange energy is tuned by relative rotation of the donor and acceptor moieties about the bridge. Unlike other systems with low exchange energy, substantial oscillator strength is sustained at the singlet-triplet degeneracy point.</p>

Dynamics of cortical dendritic membrane potential and spikes in freely behaving rats

We measured neocortical sub- and suprathreshold dendritic membrane potential (DMP) from putative distal-most dendrites using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tetrod</span></strong>es in freely behaving rats over multiple days with a high degree of stability and submillisecond temporal resolution. DAP firing rates were several-fold larger than somatic rates.

Parietal DAP and DMP exhibited egocentric spatial maps comparable to pyramidal neurons. These results have important implications for neural coding and plasticity.</p>

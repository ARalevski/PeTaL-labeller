A computationally identified compound antagonizes excess FGF-23 signaling in renal tubules and a mouse model of hypophosphatemia
<p>Fibroblast growth factor–23 (FGF-23) interacts with a binary receptor complex composed of α-Klotho (α-KL) and FGF receptors (FGFRs) to regulate phosphate and vitamin D metabolism in the kidney. Excess FGF-23 production, which causes hypophosphatemia, is genetically inherited or occurs with chronic kidney disease. Among other symptoms, hypophosphatemia causes vitamin D deficiency and the bone-softening disorder rickets. Current therapeutics that target the receptor complex have limited utility clinically. Using a computationally driven, structure-based, ensemble <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dock</span></strong>ing and virtual high-throughput screening approach, we identified four novel compounds predicted to selectively inhibit FGF-23–induced activation of the FGFR/α-KL complex. Additional modeling and functional analysis found that Zinc13407541 bound to FGF-23 and disrupted its interaction with the FGFR1/α-KL complex; experiments in a heterologous cell expression system showed that Zinc13407541 selectivity inhibited α-KL–dependent FGF-23 signaling. Zinc13407541 also inhibited FGF-23 signaling in isolated renal tubules ex vivo and partially reversed the hypophosphatemic effects of excess FGF-23 in a mouse model. These chemical probes provide a platform to develop lead compounds to treat disorders caused by excess FGF-23.</p>

Thyroid hormone receptor and ERRα coordinately regulate mitochondrial fission, mitophagy, biogenesis, and function
<p>Thyroid hormone receptor β1 (THRB1) and estrogen-related receptor α (ESRRA; also known as ERRα) both play important roles in mitochondrial activity. To understand their potential interactions, we performed transcriptome and ChIP-seq analyses and found that many genes that were co-regulated by both THRB1 and ESRRA were involved in mitochondrial metabolic pathways. These included oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and β-oxidation of fatty acids. TH increased ESRRA expression and activity in a THRB1-dependent manner through the induction of the transcriptional coactivator PPARGC1A (also known as PGC1α). Moreover, TH induced mitochondrial biogenesis, fission, and mitophagy in an ESRRA-dependent manner. TH also induced the expression of the autophagy-regulating kinase ULK1 through ESRRA, which then promoted DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission. In addition, ULK1 activated the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dock</span></strong>ing receptor protein FUNDC1 and its interaction with the autophagosomal protein MAP1LC3B-II to induce mitophagy. siRNA knockdown of <i>ESRRA</i>, <i>ULK1</i>, <i>DRP1</i>, or <i>FUNDC1</i> inhibited TH-induced autophagic clearance of mitochondria through mitophagy and decreased OXPHOS. These findings show that many of the mitochondrial actions of TH are mediated through stimulation of ESRRA expression and activity, and co-regulation of mitochondrial turnover through the PPARGC1A-ESRRA-ULK1 pathway is mediated by their regulation of mitochondrial fission and mitophagy. Hormonal or pharmacologic induction of ESRRA expression or activity could improve mitochondrial quality in metabolic disorders.</p>

Phagocytosed photoreceptor outer segments activate mTORC1 in the retinal pigment epithelium
<p>The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) transports nutrients and metabolites between the microvascular bed that maintains the outer retina and photoreceptor neurons. The RPE removes photoreceptor outer segments (POS) by receptor-mediated phagocytosis, a process that peaks in the morning. Uptake and degradation of POS initiates signaling cascades in the RPE. Upstream stimuli from various metabolic activities converge on mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), and aberrant mTORC1 signaling is implicated in aging and age-related degeneration of the RPE. We measured mTORC1-mediated responses to RPE phagocytosis in vivo and in vitro. During the morning burst of POS shedding, there was transient activation of mTORC1-mediated signaling in the RPE. POS activated mTORC1 through lysosome-independent mechanisms, and engulfed POS served as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dock</span></strong>ing platform for mTORC1 assembly. The identification of POS as endogenous stimuli of mTORC1 in the RPE provides a mechanistic link underlying the photoreceptor-RPE interaction in the outer retina.</p>

Tuning ITAM multiplicity on T cell receptors can control potency and selectivity to ligand density
<p>The T cell antigen receptor (TCR) recognizes peptides from pathogenic proteins bound in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). To convert this binding event into downstream signaling, the TCR complex contains immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) that act as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dock</span></strong>ing sites for the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase ZAP-70. Unique among antigen receptors, the TCR complex uses 10 ITAMs to transduce peptide-MHC binding to the cell interior. Using synthetic, drug-inducible receptor-ligand pairs, it was found that greater ITAM multiplicity primarily enhanced the efficiency with which ligand binding was converted into an intracellular signal. This manifested as an increase in the fraction of cells that became activated in response to antigen, and a more synchronous initiation of TCR-proximal signaling, rather than direct amplification of the intracellular signals. Exploiting these findings, the potency and selectivity of chimeric antigen receptors targeted against cancer were substantially enhanced by modulating the number of encoded ITAMs.</p>

A human postcatalytic spliceosome structure reveals essential roles of metazoan factors for exon ligation
<p>During exon ligation, the <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> spliceosome recognizes the 3′-splice site (3′SS) of precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) through non–Watson-Crick pairing with the 5′SS and the branch adenosine, in a conformation stabilized by Prp18 and Prp8. Here we present the 3.3-angstrom cryo–electron microscopy structure of a human postcatalytic spliceosome just after exon ligation. The 3′SS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dock</span></strong>s at the active site through conserved RNA interactions in the absence of Prp18. Unexpectedly, the metazoan-specific FAM32A directly bridges the 5′-exon and intron 3′SS of pre-mRNA and promotes exon ligation, as shown by functional assays. CACTIN, SDE2, and NKAP—factors implicated in alternative splicing—further stabilize the catalytic conformation of the spliceosome during exon ligation. Together these four proteins act as exon ligation factors. Our study reveals how the human spliceosome has co-opted additional proteins to modulate a conserved RNA-based mechanism for 3′SS selection and to potentially fine-tune alternative splicing at the exon ligation stage.</p>

Programmable protein circuits in living cells
<p>Synthetic protein-level circuits could enable engineering of powerful new cellular behaviors. Rational protein circuit design would be facilitated by a composable protein-protein regulation system in which individual protein components can regulate one another to create a variety of different circuit architectures. In this study, we show that engineered viral proteases can function as composable protein components, which can together implement a broad variety of circuit-level functions in mammalian cells. In this system, termed CHOMP (circuits of hacked orthogonal modular proteases), input proteases <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dock</span></strong> with and cleave target proteases to inhibit their function. These components can be connected to generate regulatory cascades, binary logic gates, and dynamic analog signal-processing functions. To demonstrate the utility of this system, we rationally designed a circuit that induces cell death in response to upstream activators of the Ras oncogene. Because CHOMP circuits can perform complex functions yet be encoded as single transcripts and delivered without genomic integration, they offer a scalable platform to facilitate protein circuit engineering for biotechnological applications.</p>

Ribonucleotide incorporation enables repair of chromosome breaks by nonhomologous end joining
<p>The nonhomologous end–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">join</span></strong>ing (NHEJ) pathway preserves genome stability by ligating the ends of broken chromosomes together. It employs end-processing enzymes, including polymerases, to prepare ends for ligation. We show that two such polymerases incorporate primarily ribonucleotides during NHEJ—an exception to the central dogma of molecular biology—both during repair of chromosome breaks made by Cas9 and during V(D)J recombination. Moreover, additions of ribonucleotides but not deoxynucleotides effectively promote ligation. Repair kinetics suggest that ribonucleotide-dependent first-strand ligation is followed by complementary strand repair with deoxynucleotides, then by replacement of ribonucleotides embedded in the first strand with deoxynucleotides. Our results indicate that as much as 65% of cellular NHEJ products have transiently embedded ribonucleotides, which promote flexibility in repair at the cost of more fragile intermediates.</p>

Redemption for self-reactive antibodies

Postcatalytic spliceosome structure reveals mechanism of 3′–splice site selection
<p>Introns are removed from eukaryotic messenger RNA precursors by the spliceosome in two transesterification reactions—branching and exon ligation. The mechanism of 3′–splice site recognition during exon ligation has remained unclear. Here we present the 3.7-angstrom cryo–electron microscopy structure of the yeast P-complex spliceosome immediately after exon ligation. The 3′–splice site AG dinucleotide is recognized through non–Watson-Crick pairing with the 5′ splice site and the branch-point adenosine. After the branching reaction, protein factors work together to remodel the spliceosome and stabilize a conformation competent for 3′–splice site <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dock</span></strong>ing, thereby promoting exon ligation. The structure accounts for the strict conservation of the GU and AG dinucleotides at the 5′ and 3′ ends of introns and provides insight into the catalytic mechanism of exon ligation.</p>

Atomic structure of the human cytomegalovirus capsid with its securing tegument layer of pp150
<p>Herpesviruses possess a genome-pressurized capsid. The 235-kilobase genome of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is by far the largest of any herpesvirus, yet it has been unclear how its capsid, which is similar in size to those of other herpesviruses, is stabilized. Here we report a HCMV atomic structure consisting of the herpesvirus-conserved capsid proteins MCP, Tri1, Tri2, and SCP and the HCMV-specific tegument protein pp150—totaling ~4000 molecules and 62 different conformers. MCPs manifest as a complex of insertions around a bacteriophage HK97 gp5–like domain, which gives rise to three classes of capsid floor–defining interactions; triplexes, composed of two “embracing” Tri2 conformers and a “third-wheeling” Tri1, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fasten</span></strong> the capsid floor. HCMV-specific strategies include using hexon channels to accommodate the genome and pp150 helix bundles to secure the capsid via cysteine tetrad–to-SCP interactions. Our structure should inform rational design of countermeasures against HCMV, other herpesviruses, and even HIV/AIDS.</p>

DNA-PKcs structure suggests an allosteric mechanism modulating DNA double-strand break repair

We show that the 4128–amino acid structure comprises three large structural units: the N-terminal unit, the Circular Cradle, and the Head. Conformational differences between the two molecules in the asymmetric unit are correlated with changes in accessibility of the kinase active site, which are consistent with an allosteric mechanism to bring about kinase activation. The location of KU80ct<sub>194</sub> in the vicinity of the breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) binding site suggests competition with BRCA1, leading to pathway selection between NHEJ and homologous recombination.</p>

Mechanism of Activation of Protein Kinase JAK2 by the Growth Hormone Receptor
<p>Signaling from JAK (Janus kinase) protein kinases to STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) transcription factors is key to many aspects of biology and medicine, yet the mechanism by which cytokine receptors initiate signaling is enigmatic. We present a complete mechanistic model for activation of receptor-bound JAK2, based on an archetypal cytokine receptor, the growth hormone receptor. For this, we used fluorescence resonance energy transfer to monitor positioning of the JAK2 binding motif in the receptor dimer, substitution of the receptor extracellular domains with Jun zippers to control the position of its transmembrane (TM) helices, atomistic modeling of TM helix movements, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dock</span></strong>ing of the crystal structures of the JAK2 kinase and its inhibitory pseudokinase domain with an opposing kinase-pseudokinase domain pair. Activation of the receptor dimer induced a separation of its JAK2 binding motifs, driven by a ligand-induced transition from a parallel TM helix pair to a left-handed crossover arrangement. This separation leads to removal of the pseudokinase domain from the kinase domain of the partner JAK2 and pairing of the two kinase domains, facilitating trans-activation. This model may well generalize to other class I cytokine receptors.</p>

The SUMO Conjugation Complex Self-Assembles into Nuclear Bodies Independent of SIZ1 and COP1
<p>Attachment of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) to substrate proteins modulates their turnover, activity, or interaction partners. However, how this SUMO conjugation activity concentrates the proteins involved and the substrates into uncharacterized nuclear bodies (NBs) remains poorly understood. Here, we characterized the requirements for SUMO NB formation and for their subsequent colocalization with the E3 ubiquitin ligase CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1), a master regulator of plant growth. COP1 activity results in degradation of transcription factors, which primes the transcriptional response that underlies elongation growth induced by darkness and high ambient temperatures (skoto- and thermomorphogenesis, respectively). SUMO conjugation activity alone was sufficient to target the SUMO machinery into NBs. Colocalization of these bodies with COP1 required, in addition to SUMO conjugation activity, a SUMO acceptor site in COP1 and the SUMO E3 ligase SAP and Miz 1 (SIZ1). We found that SIZ1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dock</span></strong>s in the substrate-binding pocket of COP1 via two valine-proline peptide motifs, which represent a known interaction motif of COP1 substrates. The data reveal that SIZ1 physically connects COP1 and SUMO conjugation activity in the same NBs that can also contain the blue-light receptors CRYPTOCHROME 1 and CRYPTOCHROME 2. Our findings thus suggest that sumoylation stimulates COP1 activity within NBs. Moreover, the presence of SIZ1 and SUMO in these NBs explains how both the timing and amplitude of the high-temperature growth response is controlled. The strong colocalization of COP1 and SUMO in these NBs might also explain why many COP1 substrates are sumoylated.</p>

A Pectin Methylesterase Inhibitor Enhances Resistance to <i>Verticillium</i> Wilt
<p>Pectins are major components of the primary plant cell wall, which functions as the primary barrier against pathogens. Pectin methylesterases (PMEs) catalyze the demethylesterification of the homogalacturonan domains of pectin in the plant cell wall. Their activity is regulated by PME inhibitors (PMEIs). Here, we provide evidence that the pectin methylesterase-inhibiting protein GhPMEI3 from cotton (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>) functions in plant responses to infection by the fungus <i>Verticillium dahliae</i>. GhPMEI3 interacts with PMEs and regulates the expression of a specific fungal polygalacturonase (VdPG1). Ectopic expression of GhPMEI3 increased pectin methyl esterification and limited fungal disease in cotton, while also modulating root elongation. Enzymatic analyses revealed that GhPMEI3 efficiently inhibited the activity of cotton GhPME2/GhPME31. Experiments using transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants expressing the <i>GhPMEI3</i> gene under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter revealed that GhPMEI3 inhibits the endogenous PME activity in vitro. Moreover, the enhanced resistance to <i>V. dahliae</i> was associated with altered <i>VdPG1</i> expression. Virus-induced silencing of <i>GhPMEI3</i> resulted in increased susceptibility to <i>V. dahliae</i>. Further, we investigated the interaction between GhPMEI3 and GhPME2/GhPME31 using inhibition assays and molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dock</span></strong>ing simulations. The peculiar structural features of GhPMEI3 were responsible for the formation of a 1:1 stoichiometric complex with GhPME2/GhPME31. Together, these results suggest that GhPMEI3 enhances resistance to <i>Verticillium</i> wilt. Moreover, GhPMEI3-GhPMEs interactions would be needed before drawing the correlation between structure-function and are crucial for plant development against the ever-evolving fungal pathogens.</p>

Biochemical and Structural Analysis of Substrate Specificity of a Phenylalanine Ammonia-Lyase
<p>Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) is the first enzyme of the general phenylpropanoid pathway catalyzing the nonoxidative elimination of ammonia from <sc>l</sc>-phenylalanine to give <i>trans</i>-cinnamate. In monocots, PAL also displays tyrosine ammonia lyase (TAL) activity, leading to the formation of <i>p</i>-coumaric acid.

This first crystal structure of a monocotyledonous PAL displayed a unique conformation in its flexible inner loop of the 4-methylidene-imidazole-5-one (MIO) domain compared with that of dicotyledonous plants. The side chain of histidine-123 in the MIO domain dictated the distance between the catalytic MIO prosthetic group created from <sup>189</sup>Ala-Ser-Gly<sup>191</sup> residues and the bound <sc>l</sc>-phenylalanine and <sc>l</sc>-tyrosine, conferring the deamination reaction through either the Friedel-Crafts or E<sub>2</sub> reaction mechanism. Several recombinant mutant SbPAL1 enzymes were generated via structure-guided mutagenesis, one of which, H123F-SbPAL1, has 6.2 times greater PAL activity without significant TAL activity. Additional PAL isozymes of sorghum were characterized and categorized into three groups. Taken together, this approach identified critical residues and explained substrate preferences among PAL isozymes in sorghum and other monocots, which can serve as the basis for the engineering of plants with enhanced biomass conversion properties, disease resistance, or nutritional quality.</p>

Cylindrical Inclusion Protein of Turnip Mosaic Virus Serves as a Docking Point for the Intercellular Movement of Viral Replication Vesicles
<p>Plant viruses move from the initially infected cell to adjacent cells through plasmodesmata (PDs). To do so, viruses encode dedicated protein(s) that facilitate this process. How viral proteins act together to support the intercellular movement of viruses is poorly defined. Here, by using an infection-free intercellular vesicle movement assay, we investigate the action of CI (cylindrical inclusion) and P3N-PIPO (amino-terminal half of P3 fused to Pretty Interesting Potyviridae open reading frame), the two PD-localized potyviral proteins encoded by <i>Turnip mosaic virus</i> (TuMV), in the intercellular movement of the viral replication vesicles. We provide evidence that CI and P3N-PIPO are sufficient to support the PD targeting and intercellular movement of TuMV replication vesicles induced by 6K2, a viral protein responsible for the generation of replication vesicles. 6K2 interacts with CI but not P3N-PIPO. When this interaction is impaired, the intercellular movement of TuMV replication vesicles is inhibited. Furthermore, in transmission electron microscopy, vesicular structures are observed in connection with the cylindrical inclusion bodies at structurally modified PDs in cells coexpressing 6K2, CI, and P3N-PIPO. CI is directed to PDs through its interaction with P3N-PIPO. We hypothesize that CI serves as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dock</span></strong>ing point for PD targeting and the intercellular movement of TuMV replication vesicles. This work contributes to a better understanding of the roles of different viral proteins in coordinating the intercellular movement of viral replication vesicles.</p>

<p>Grape (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) color somatic variants that can be used to develop new grapevine cultivars occasionally appear associated with deletion events of uncertain origin. To understand the mutational mechanisms generating somatic structural variation in grapevine, we compared the Tempranillo Blanco (TB) white berry somatic variant with its black berry ancestor, Tempranillo Tinto. Whole-genome sequencing uncovered a catastrophic genome rearrangement in TB that caused the hemizygous deletion of 313 genes, including the loss of the functional copy for the <i>MYB</i> transcription factors required for anthocyanin pigmentation in the berry skin. Loss of heterozygosity and decreased copy number delimited interspersed monosomic and disomic regions in the right arm of linkage groups 2 and 5. At least 11 validated clustered breakpoints involving intrachromosomal and interchromosomal translocations between three linkage groups flanked the deleted fragments, which, according to segregation analyses, are phased in a single copy of each of the affected chromosomes. These hallmarks, along with the lack of homology between breakpoint <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">join</span></strong>s and the randomness of the order and orientation of the rearranged fragments, are all consistent with a chromothripsis-like pattern generated after chromosome breakage and illegitimate re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">join</span></strong>ing. This unbalanced genome reshuffling has additional consequences in reproductive development. In TB, lack of sexual transmission of rearranged chromosomes associates with low gamete viability, which compromises fruit set and decreases fruit production. Our findings show that catastrophic genome rearrangements arise spontaneously and stabilize during plant somatic growth. These dramatic rearrangements generate new interesting phenotypes that can be selected for the improvement of vegetatively propagated plant species.</p>

SCYL2 Genes Are Involved in Clathrin-Mediated Vesicle Trafficking and Essential for Plant Growth
<p>Protein transport between organelles is an essential process in all eukaryotic cells and is mediated by the regulation of processes such as vesicle formation, transport, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dock</span></strong>ing, and fusion. In animals, SCY1-LIKE2 (SCYL2) binds to clathrin and has been shown to play roles in trans-Golgi network-mediated clathrin-coated vesicle trafficking. Here, we demonstrate that SCYL2A and SCYL2B, which are Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) homologs of animal SCYL2, are vital for plant cell growth and root hair development. Studies of the SCYL2 isoforms using multiple single or double loss-of-function alleles show that SCYL2B is involved in root hair development and that SCYL2A and SCYL2B are essential for plant growth and development and act redundantly in those processes. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and a β-glucuronidase-aided promoter assay show that <i>SCYL2A</i> and <i>SCYL2B</i> are differentially expressed in various tissues. We also show that SCYL2 proteins localize to the Golgi, trans-Golgi network, and prevacuolar compartment and colocalize with Clathrin Heavy Chain1 (CHC1). Furthermore, bimolecular fluorescence complementation and coimmunoprecipitation data show that SCYL2B interacts with CHC1 and two Soluble NSF Attachment Protein Receptors (SNAREs): Vesicle Transport through t-SNARE Interaction11 (VTI11) and VTI12. Finally, we present evidence that the root hair tip localization of Cellulose Synthase-Like D3 is dependent on SCYL2B. These findings suggest the role of SCYL2 genes in plant cell developmental processes via clathrin-mediated vesicle membrane trafficking.</p>

A Novel Chemical Inhibitor of ABA Signaling Targets All ABA Receptors
<p>Abscisic acid (ABA), the most important stress-induced phytohormone, regulates seed dormancy, germination, plant senescence, and the abiotic stress response. ABA signaling is repressed by group A type 2C protein phosphatases (PP2Cs), and then ABA binds to its receptor of the ACTIN RESISTANCE1 (PYR1), PYR1-LIKE (PYL), and REGULATORY COMPONENTS OF ABA RECEPTORS (RCAR) family, which, in turn, inhibits PP2Cs and activates downstream ABA signaling. The agonist/antagonist of ABA receptors have the potential to reveal the ABA signaling machinery and to become lead compounds for agrochemicals; however, until now, no broad-spectrum antagonists of ABA receptors blocking all PYR/PYL-PP2C interactions have been identified. Here, using chemical genetics screenings, we identified ABA ANTAGONIST1 (AA1), the first broad-spectrum antagonist of ABA receptors in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Physiological analyses revealed that AA1 is sufficiently active to block ABA signaling. AA1 interfered with all the PYR/PYL-HAB1 interactions, and the diminished PYR/PYL-HAB1 interactions, in turn, restored the activity of HAB1. AA1 binds to all 13 members. Molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dock</span></strong>ings, the non-AA1-bound PYL2 variant, and competitive binding assays demonstrated that AA1 enters into the ligand-binding pocket of PYL2. Using AA1, we tested the genetic relationships of ABA receptors with other core components of ABA signaling, demonstrating that AA1 is a powerful tool with which to sidestep this genetic redundancy of PYR/PYLs. In addition, the application of AA1 delays leaf senescence. Thus, our study developed an efficient broad-spectrum antagonist of ABA receptors and demonstrated that plant senescence can be chemically controlled through AA1, with a simple and easy-to-synthesize structure, allowing its availability and utility as a chemical probe synthesized in large quantities, indicating its potential application in agriculture.</p>

Structural and Biochemical Characterization of Cinnamoyl-CoA Reductases
<p>Cinnamoyl-coenzyme A reductase (CCR) catalyzes the reduction of hydroxycinnamoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) esters using NADPH to produce hydroxycinnamyl aldehyde precursors in lignin synthesis. The catalytic mechanism and substrate specificity of cinnamoyl-CoA reductases from sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>), a strategic plant for bioenergy production, were deduced from crystal structures, site-directed mutagenesis, and kinetic and thermodynamic analyses. Although SbCCR1 displayed higher affinity for caffeoyl-CoA or <i>p</i>-coumaroyl-CoA than for feruloyl-CoA, the enzyme showed significantly higher activity for the latter substrate. Through molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dock</span></strong>ing and comparisons between the crystal structures of the <i>Vitis vinifera</i> dihydroflavonol reductase and SbCCR1, residues threonine-154 and tyrosine-310 were pinpointed as being involved in binding CoA-conjugated phenylpropanoids. Threonine-154 of SbCCR1 and other CCRs likely confers strong substrate specificity for feruloyl-CoA over other cinnamoyl-CoA thioesters, and the T154Y mutation in SbCCR1 led to broader substrate specificity and faster turnover. Through data mining using our structural and biochemical information, four additional putative <i>CCR</i> genes were discovered from sorghum genomic data. One of these, SbCCR2, displayed greater activity toward <i>p</i>-coumaroyl-CoA than did SbCCR1, which could imply a role in the synthesis of defense-related lignin. Taken together, these findings provide knowledge about critical residues and substrate preference among CCRs and provide, to our knowledge, the first three-dimensional structure information for a CCR from a monocot species.</p>

Characterization of Class III Peroxidases from Switchgrass
<p>Class III peroxidases (CIIIPRX) catalyze the oxidation of monolignols, generate radicals, and ultimately lead to the formation of lignin. In general, CIIIPRX genes encode a large number of isozymes with ranges of in vitro substrate specificities. In order to elucidate the mode of substrate specificity of these enzymes, we characterized one of the CIIIPRXs (PviPRX9) from switchgrass (<i>Panicum virgatum</i>), a strategic plant for second-generation biofuels. The crystal structure, kinetic experiments, molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dock</span></strong>ing, as well as expression patterns of PviPRX9 across multiple tissues and treatments, along with its levels of coexpression with the majority of genes in the monolignol biosynthesis pathway, revealed the function of PviPRX9 in lignification. Significantly, our study suggested that PviPRX9 has the ability to oxidize a broad range of phenylpropanoids with rather similar efficiencies, which reflects its role in the fortification of cell walls during normal growth and root development and in response to insect feeding. Based on the observed interactions of phenylpropanoids in the active site and analysis of kinetics, a catalytic mechanism involving two water molecules and residues histidine-42, arginine-38, and serine-71 was proposed. In addition, proline-138 and gluntamine-140 at the <sup>137</sup>P-X-P-X<sup>140</sup> motif, leucine-66, proline-67, and asparagine-176 may account for the broad substrate specificity of PviPRX9. Taken together, these observations shed new light on the function and catalysis of PviPRX9 and potentially benefit efforts to improve biomass conservation properties in bioenergy and forage crops.</p>

cis-Cinnamic Acid Is a Novel, Natural Auxin Efflux Inhibitor That Promotes Lateral Root Formation
<p>Auxin steers numerous physiological processes in plants, making the tight control of its endogenous levels and spatiotemporal distribution a necessity. This regulation is achieved by different mechanisms, including auxin biosynthesis, metabolic conversions, degradation, and transport. Here, we introduce cis-cinnamic acid (<i>c</i>-CA) as a novel and unique addition to a small group of endogenous molecules affecting in planta auxin concentrations. <i>c-CA</i> is the photo-isomerization product of the phenylpropanoid pathway intermediate trans-CA (<i>t</i>-CA). When grown on <i>c</i>-CA-containing medium, an evolutionary diverse set of plant species were shown to exhibit phenotypes characteristic for high auxin levels, including inhibition of primary root growth, induction of root hairs, and promotion of adventitious and lateral rooting. By molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dock</span></strong>ing and receptor binding assays, we showed that <i>c</i>-CA itself is neither an auxin nor an anti-auxin, and auxin profiling data revealed that <i>c</i>-CA does not significantly interfere with auxin biosynthesis. Single cell-based auxin accumulation assays showed that <i>c</i>-CA, and not <i>t</i>-CA, is a potent inhibitor of auxin efflux. Auxin signaling reporters detected changes in spatiotemporal distribution of the auxin response along the root of <i>c</i>-CA-treated plants, and long-distance auxin transport assays showed no inhibition of rootward auxin transport. Overall, these results suggest that the phenotypes of <i>c</i>-CA-treated plants are the consequence of a local change in auxin accumulation, induced by the inhibition of auxin efflux. This work reveals a novel mechanism how plants may regulate auxin levels and adds a novel, naturally occurring molecule to the chemical toolbox for the studies of auxin homeostasis.</p>

Rice Cellulose SynthaseA8 Plant-Conserved Region Is a Coiled-Coil at the Catalytic Core Entrance
<p>The crystallographic structure of a rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) cellulose synthase, OsCesA8, plant-conserved region (P-CR), one of two unique domains in the catalytic domain of plant CesAs, was solved to 2.4 ÅÅ resolution. Two antiparallel α-helices form a coiled-coil domain linked by a large extended connector loop containing a conserved trio of aromatic residues. The P-CR structure was fit into a molecular envelope for the P-CR domain derived from small-angle X-ray scattering data. The P-CR structure and molecular envelope, combined with a homology-based chain trace of the CesA8 catalytic core, were modeled into a previously determined CesA8 small-angle X-ray scattering molecular envelope to produce a detailed topological model of the CesA8 catalytic domain. The predicted position for the P-CR domain from the molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dock</span></strong>ing models places the P-CR connector loop into a hydrophobic pocket of the catalytic core, with the coiled-coil aligned near the entrance of the substrate UDP-glucose into the active site. In this configuration, the P-CR coiled-coil alone is unlikely to regulate substrate access to the active site, but it could interact with other domains of CesA, accessory proteins, or other CesA catalytic domains to control substrate delivery.</p>

Quartet-Net: A Quartet-Based Method to Reconstruct Phylogenetic Networks
<p>Phylogenetic networks can model reticulate evolutionary events such as hybridization, recombination, and horizontal gene transfer. However, reconstructing such networks is not trivial. Popular character-based methods are computationally inefficient, whereas distance-based methods cannot guarantee reconstruction accuracy because pairwise genetic distances only reflect partial information about a reticulate phylogeny. To balance accuracy and computational efficiency, here we introduce a quartet-based method to construct a phylogenetic network from a multiple sequence alignment. Unlike distances that only reflect the relationship between a pair of taxa, quartets contain information on the relationships among four taxa; these quartets provide adequate capacity to infer a more accurate phylogenetic network. In applications to simulated and biological data sets, we demonstrate that this novel method is robust and effective in reconstructing reticulate evolutionary events and it has the potential to infer more accurate phylogenetic distances than other conventional phylogenetic network construction methods such as Neighbor-Joining, Neighbor-Net, and Split Decomposition. This method can be used in constructing phylogenetic networks from simple evolutionary events involving a few reticulate events to complex evolutionary histories involving a large number of reticulate events. A software called “Quartet-Net” is implemented and available at <ext-link>http://sysbio.cvm.msstate.edu/QuartetNet/</ext-link>.</p>

Outcomes after early return to theatre following hip hemiarthroplasty for intracapsular fracture of the femoral neck
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Hip hemiarthroplasty is a standard treatment for intracapsular   proximal femoral fractures in the frail elderly.

Age,   gender, laterality, time from admission to primary procedure, American   Society of Anesthesiologists grade, and implant type were similar   for those requiring early return to theatre and those who did not.   Early return to theatre was associated with a significantly higher   length of stay (mean 33.6 days (7 to 107) <i>versus</i> 18.6   days (0 to 152), p < 0.001), re-admission rate (38.2% <i>versus</i> 8.6%,   p < 0.001), and subsequent revision rate (17.6% <i>versus</i> 1.3%,   p < 0.001).

Elabela/Toddler Is an Endogenous Agonist of the Apelin APJ Receptor in the Adult Cardiovascular System, and Exogenous Administration of the Peptide Compensates for the Downregulation of Its Expression in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Elabela/toddler (ELA) is a critical cardiac developmental peptide that acts through the G-protein–coupled apelin receptor, despite lack of sequence similarity to the established ligand apelin. Our aim was to investigate the receptor pharmacology, expression pattern, and in vivo function of ELA peptides in the adult cardiovascular system, to seek evidence for alteration in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in which apelin signaling is downregulated, and to demonstrate attenuation of PAH severity with exogenous administration of ELA in a rat model.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p><i>In silico</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dock</span></strong>ing analysis, competition binding experiments, and downstream assays were used to characterize ELA receptor binding in human heart and signaling in cells expressing the apelin receptor. ELA expression in human cardiovascular tissues and plasma was determined using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, dual-labeling immunofluorescent staining, and immunoassays. Acute cardiac effects of ELA-32 and [Pyr<sup>1</sup>]apelin-13 were assessed by MRI and cardiac catheterization in anesthetized rats. Cardiopulmonary human and rat tissues from PAH patients and monocrotaline- and Sugen/hypoxia-exposed rats were used to show changes in ELA expression in PAH. The effect of ELA treatment on cardiopulmonary remodeling in PAH was investigated in the monocrotaline rat model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>ELA competed for binding of apelin in human heart with overlap for the 2 peptides indicated by <i>in silico</i> modeling. ELA activated G-protein– and β-arrestin–dependent pathways. We detected ELA expression in human vascular endothelium and plasma. Comparable to apelin, ELA increased cardiac contractility, ejection fraction, and cardiac output and elicited vasodilatation in rat in vivo. ELA expression was reduced in cardiopulmonary tissues from PAH patients and PAH rat models, respectively. ELA treatment significantly attenuated elevation of right ventricular systolic pressure and right ventricular hypertrophy and pulmonary vascular remodeling in monocrotaline-exposed rats.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These results show that ELA is an endogenous agonist of the human apelin receptor, exhibits a cardiovascular profile comparable to apelin, and is downregulated in human disease and rodent PAH models, and exogenous peptide can reduce the severity of cardiopulmonary remodeling and function in PAH in rats. This study provides additional proof of principle that an apelin receptor agonist may be of therapeutic use in PAH in humans.</p></sec>

Normalization of NAD<sup>+</sup> Redox Balance as a Therapy for Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Impairments of mitochondrial function in the heart are linked intricately to the development of heart failure, but there is no therapy for mitochondrial dysfunction.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We assessed the reduced/oxidized ratio of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio) and protein acetylation in the failing heart. Proteome and acetylome analyses were followed by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dock</span></strong>ing calculation, mutagenesis, and mitochondrial calcium uptake assays to determine the functional role of specific acetylation sites. The therapeutic effects of normalizing mitochondrial protein acetylation by expanding the NAD<sup>+</sup> pool also were tested.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Increased NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> and protein hyperacetylation, previously observed in genetic models of defective mitochondrial function, also are present in human failing hearts as well as in mouse hearts with pathologic hypertrophy. Elevation of NAD<sup>+</sup> levels by stimulating the NAD<sup>+</sup> salvage pathway suppressed mitochondrial protein hyperacetylation and cardiac hypertrophy, and improved cardiac function in responses to stresses. Acetylome analysis identified a subpopulation of mitochondrial proteins that was sensitive to changes in the NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio. Hyperacetylation of mitochondrial malate-aspartate shuttle proteins impaired the transport and oxidation of cytosolic NADH in the mitochondria, resulting in altered cytosolic redox state and energy deficiency. Furthermore, acetylation of oligomycin-sensitive conferring protein at lysine-70 in adenosine triphosphate synthase complex promoted its interaction with cyclophilin D, and sensitized the opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pore. Both could be alleviated by normalizing the NAD<sup>+</sup> redox balance either genetically or pharmacologically.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We show that mitochondrial protein hyperacetylation due to NAD<sup>+</sup> redox imbalance contributes to the pathologic remodeling of the heart via 2 distinct mechanisms. Our preclinical data demonstrate a clear benefit of normalizing NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> imbalance in the failing hearts. These findings have a high translational potential as the pharmacologic strategy of increasing NAD<sup>+</sup> precursors are feasible in humans.</p></sec>

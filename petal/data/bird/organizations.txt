How Do Resuscitation Teams at Top-Performing Hospitals for In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Succeed?
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is common, and outcomes vary substantially across US hospitals, but reasons for these differences are largely unknown. We set out to better understand how top-performing hospitals organize their resuscitation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">team</span></strong>s to achieve high survival rates for IHCA.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We calculated risk-standardized IHCA survival to discharge rates across American Heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation Get With The Guidelines–Resuscitation registry hospitals between 2012 and 2014. We identified geographically and academically diverse hospitals in the top, middle, and bottom quartiles of survival for IHCA and performed a qualitative study that included site visits with in-depth interviews of clinical and administrative staff at 9 hospitals. With the use of thematic analysis, data were analyzed to identify salient themes of perceived performance by informants.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Across 9 hospitals, we interviewed 158 individuals from multiple disciplines including physicians (17.1%), nurses (45.6%), other clinical staff (17.1%), and administration (20.3%). We identified 4 broad themes related to resuscitation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">team</span></strong>s: (1) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">team</span></strong> design, (2) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">team</span></strong> composition and roles, (3) communication and leadership during IHCA, and (4) training and education. Resuscitation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">team</span></strong>s at top-performing hospitals demonstrated the following features: dedicated or designated resuscitation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">team</span></strong>s; participation of diverse disciplines as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">team</span></strong> members during IHCA; clear roles and responsibilities of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">team</span></strong> members; better communication and leadership during IHCA; and in-depth mock codes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Resuscitation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">team</span></strong>s at hospitals with high IHCA survival differ from non–top-performing hospitals. Our findings suggest core elements of successful resuscitation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">team</span></strong>s that are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with better outcomes and form the basis for future work to improve IHCA.</p></sec>

Association Between Fetal Congenital Heart Defects and Maternal Risk of Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy in the Same Pregnancy and Across Pregnancies
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Both pregnant women carrying fetuses with heart defects and women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy often exhibit angiogenic imbalances, suggesting that the same mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of the former and the pathophysiology of the latter. We conducted a register-based cohort study to determine whether offspring congenital heart defects are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with an increased risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and whether the mechanisms driving any <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation are primarily maternal or fetal.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Among singleton pregnancies without chromosomal abnormalities lasting ≥20 weeks in Denmark from 1978 to 2011 (n= 1 972 857), we identified pregnancies complicated by offspring congenital heart defects or early preterm preeclampsia, late preterm preeclampsia, term preeclampsia, and gestational hypertension. We used polytomous logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ations between offspring congenital heart defects and maternal hypertensive disorders of pregnancy overall and for specific heart defects.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Offspring congenital heart defects were strongly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with early preterm preeclampsia (OR, 7.00; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.11–8.03) and late preterm preeclampsia (OR, 2.82; 95% CI, 2.38–3.34) in the same pregnancy and weakly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with term preeclampsia (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.06–1.27), but they were not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with gestational hypertension (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.92–1.25). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation strengths were consistent across heart defect types. Offspring congenital heart defects in a previous pregnancy were also strongly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with preterm preeclampsia in subsequent pregnancies (early preterm preeclampsia: OR, 2.37; 95% CI, 1.68–3.34; late preterm preeclampsia: OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.52–2.75) but were only modestly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with term preeclampsia and not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with gestational hypertension. Similarly, preterm preeclampsia in a previous pregnancy, but not term preeclampsia or gestational hypertension, was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with offspring congenital heart defects in later pregnancies (early preterm preeclampsia: OR, 7.91; 95% CI, 6.06–10.3; late preterm preeclampsia: OR, 2.83; 95% CI, 2.11–3.79; term preeclampsia: OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.88–1.10; gestational hypertension: OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.92–1.38).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Linked pathophysiological mechanisms may be involved in some congenital heart defects and preterm preeclampsia.

Association of Pediatric Medical Emergency Teams With Hospital Mortality
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Implementation of medical emergency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">team</span></strong>s has been identified as a potential strategy to reduce hospital deaths, because these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">team</span></strong>s respond to patients with acute physiological decline in an effort to prevent in-hospital cardiac arrest. However, prior studies of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation between medical emergency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">team</span></strong>s and hospital mortality have been limited and typically have not accounted for preimplementation mortality trends.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Within the Pediatric Health Information System for freestanding pediatric hospitals, annual risk-adjusted mortality rates were calculated for sites between 2000 and 2015. A random slopes interrupted time series analysis then examined whether implementation of a medical emergency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">team</span></strong> was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with lower-than-expected mortality rates based on preimplementation trends.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Across 38 pediatric hospitals, mean annual hospital admission volume was 15 854 (range, 6684–33 024), and there were a total of 1 659 059 hospitalizations preimplementation and 4 392 392 hospitalizations postimplementation. Before medical emergency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">team</span></strong> implementation, hospital mortality decreased by 6.0% annually (odds ratio [OR], 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.92–0.96) across all hospitals. After medical emergency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">team</span></strong> implementation, hospital mortality continued to decrease by 6% annually (OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.93–0.95), with no deepening of the mortality slope (ie, not lower OR) in comparison with the preimplementation trend, for the overall cohort (<i>P</i>=0.98) or when analyzed separately within each of the 38 study hospitals. Five years after medical emergency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">team</span></strong> implementation across study sites, there was no difference between predicted (hospital mean of 6.18 deaths per 1000 admissions based on preimplementation trends) and actual mortality rates (hospital mean of 6.48 deaths per 1000 admissions; <i>P</i>=0.57).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Implementation of medical emergency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">team</span></strong>s in a large sample of pediatric hospitals in the United States was not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with a reduction in hospital mortality beyond existing preimplementation trends.</p></sec>

Genetic Architecture of the Cardiovascular Risk Proteome

Here we hypothesized that performing genome-wide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation studies and exome array analyses on the levels of each of these 156 proteins might identify genetic determinants of risk-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated circulating factors and provide insights into early cardiovascular pathophysiology.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation of genetic variants with the plasma levels of each of the 156 Framingham Cardiovascular Disease Risk Score–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated proteins using linear mixed-effects models in 2 population-based cohorts. We performed discovery analyses on plasma samples from 759 participants of the Framingham Heart Study Offspring cohort, an observational study of the offspring of the original Framingham Heart Study and their spouses, and validated these findings in plasma samples from 1421 participants of the MDCS (Malmö Diet and Cancer Study). To evaluate the utility of this strategy in identifying new biological pathways relevant to cardiovascular disease pathophysiology, we performed studies in a cell-model system to experimentally validate the functional significance of an especially novel genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation with circulating apolipoprotein E levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We identified 120 locus-protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ations in genome-wide analyses and 41 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ations in exome array analyses, the majority of which have not been described previously. These loci explained up to 66% of interindividual plasma protein-level variation and, on average, accounted for 3 times the amount of variation explained by common clinical factors, such as age, sex, and diabetes mellitus status. We described overlap among many of these loci and cardiovascular disease genetic risk variants. Finally, we experimentally validated a novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation between circulating apolipoprotein E levels and the transcription factor phosphatase 1G. Knockdown of phosphatase 1G in a human liver cell model resulted in decreased apolipoprotein E transcription and apolipoprotein E protein levels in cultured supernatants.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We identified dozens of novel genetic determinants of proteins <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with the Framingham Cardiovascular Disease Risk Score and experimentally validated a new role for phosphatase 1G in lipoprotein biology.

Genome- and Phenome-Wide Analyses of Cardiac Conduction Identifies Markers of Arrhythmia Risk
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>ECG QRS duration, a measure of cardiac intraventricular conduction, varies ≈2-fold in individuals without cardiac disease.

The most significant loci were evaluated within the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium QRS genome-wide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation study meta-analysis. Twenty-three single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 5 loci, previously described by CHARGE, were replicated in the eMERGE samples; 18 single-nucleotide polymorphisms were in the chromosome 3 <i>SCN5A</i> and <i>SCN10A</i> loci, where the most significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms were rs1805126 in <i>SCN5A</i> with <i>P</i>=1.2×10<sup>−8</sup> (eMERGE) and <i>P</i>=2.5×10<sup>−20</sup> (CHARGE) and rs6795970 in <i>SCN10A</i> with <i>P</i>=6×10<sup>−6</sup> (eMERGE) and <i>P</i>=5×10<sup>−27</sup> (CHARGE). The other loci were in <i>NFIA</i>, near <i>CDKN1A</i>, and near <i>C6orf204.</i> We then performed phenome-wide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation studies on variants in these 5 loci in 13859 European Americans to search for diagnoses <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with these markers.

Primary Myocardial Fibrosis as an Alternative Phenotype Pathway of Inherited Cardiac Structural Disorders
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Myocardial fibrosis is a common postmortem finding among young individuals with sudden cardiac death. Because there is no known single cause, we tested the hypothesis that some cases of myocardial fibrosis in the absence of identifiable causes (primary myocardial fibrosis [PMF]) are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with genetic variants.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Tissue was obtained at autopsy from 4031 consecutive individuals with sudden cardiac death in Northern Finland, among whom PMF was the only structural finding in 145 subjects with sudden cardiac death. We performed targeted next-generation sequencing using a panel of 174 genes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with myocardial structure and ion channel function when autopsies did not identify a secondary basis for myocardial fibrosis. All variants with an effect on protein and with a minor allele frequency <0.01 were classified as pathogenic or variants of uncertain significance on the basis of American College of Medical Genetics consensus guidelines.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among the 96 specimens with DNA passing quality control (66%), postmortem genetic tests identified 24 variants of known or uncertain significance in 26 subjects (27%). Ten were pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in 10 subjects (10%), and 14 were variants of uncertain significance in 11 genes among 16 subjects (17%). Five variants were in genes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, 6 in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated genes, and 11 in dilated cardiomyopathy–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated genes; 2 were not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with these disorders. Four unique variants of uncertain significance cosegregated among multiple unrelated subjects with PMF. No pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants were detected in ion channel–encoding genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>A large proportion of subjects with PMF at autopsy had variants in genes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy without autopsy findings of those diseases, suggesting that PMF can be an alternative phenotypic expression of structural disease–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated genetic variants or that risk-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated fibrosis was expressing before the primary disease. These findings have clinical implications for postmortem genetic testing and family risk profiling.</p></sec>

Genetic Risk Prediction of Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) has a substantial genetic basis.

We examined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ations between AF genetic risk scores and ischemic stroke in a separate study of 509 ischemic stroke cases (202 cardioembolic [40%]) and 3028 referents. Scores were based on 11 to 719 common variants (≥5%) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with AF at <i>P</i> values ranging from <1×10<sup>−3</sup> to <1×10<sup>−8</sup> in a prior independent genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation study.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Incident AF occurred in 1032 individuals (5.5%). AF genetic risk scores were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with new-onset AF after adjustment for clinical risk factors. The pooled hazard ratio for incident AF for the highest versus lowest quartile of genetic risk scores ranged from 1.28 (719 variants; 95% confidence interval, 1.13–1.46; <i>P</i>=1.5×10<sup>−4</sup>) to 1.67 (25 variants; 95% confidence interval, 1.47–1.90; <i>P</i>=9.3×10<sup>−15</sup>). Discrimination of combined clinical and genetic risk scores varied across studies and scores (maximum C statistic, 0.629–0.811; maximum ΔC statistic from clinical score alone, 0.009–0.017). AF genetic risk was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with stroke in age- and sex-adjusted models. For example, individuals in the highest versus lowest quartile of a 127-variant score had a 2.49-fold increased odds of cardioembolic stroke (95% confidence interval, 1.39–4.58; <i>P</i>=2.7×10<sup>−3</sup>). The effect persisted after the exclusion of individuals (n=70) with known AF (odds ratio, 2.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.20–4.40; <i>P</i>=0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Comprehensive AF genetic risk scores were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with incident AF beyond <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ations for clinical AF risk factors but offered small improvements in discrimination. AF genetic risk was also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with cardioembolic stroke in age- and sex-adjusted analyses.

Phenotypic Consequences of a Genetic Predisposition to Enhanced Nitric Oxide Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Nitric oxide signaling plays a key role in the regulation of vascular tone and platelet activation. Here, we seek to understand the impact of a genetic predisposition to enhanced nitric oxide signaling on risk for cardiovascular diseases, thus informing the potential utility of pharmacological stimulation of the nitric oxide pathway as a therapeutic strategy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We analyzed the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation of common and rare genetic variants in 2 genes that mediate nitric oxide signaling (Nitric Oxide Synthase 3 [<i>NOS3</i>] and Guanylate Cyclase 1, Soluble, Alpha 3 [<i>GUCY1A3</i>]) with a range of human phenotypes. We selected 2 common variants (rs3918226 in <i>NOS3</i> and rs7692387 in <i>GUCY1A3</i>) known to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ate with increased <i>NOS3</i> and <i>GUCY1A3</i> expression and reduced mean arterial pressure, combined them into a genetic score, and standardized this exposure to a 5 mm Hg reduction in mean arterial pressure. Using individual-level data from 335 464 participants in the UK Biobank and summary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation results from 7 large-scale genome-wide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation studies, we examined the effect of this nitric oxide signaling score on cardiometabolic and other diseases. We also examined whether rare loss-of-function mutations in <i>NOS3</i> and <i>GUCY1A3</i> were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with coronary heart disease using gene sequencing data from the Myocardial Infarction Genetics Consortium (n=27 815).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A genetic predisposition to enhanced nitric oxide signaling was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with reduced risks of coronary heart disease (odds ratio, 0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31-0.45; <i>P</i>=5.5*10<sup>–26</sup>], peripheral arterial disease (odds ratio 0.42; 95% CI, 0.26-0.68; <i>P</i>=0.0005), and stroke (odds ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.37-0.76; <i>P</i>=0.0006).

Association Between Early Hyperoxia Exposure After Resuscitation From Cardiac Arrest and Neurological Disability
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Studies examining the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation between hyperoxia exposure after resuscitation from cardiac arrest and clinical outcomes have reported conflicting results. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that early postresuscitation hyperoxia is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with poor neurological outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This was a multicenter prospective cohort study. We included adult patients with cardiac arrest who were mechanically ventilated and received targeted temperature management after return of spontaneous circulation. We excluded patients with cardiac arrest caused by trauma or sepsis. Per protocol, partial pressure of arterial oxygen (Pa<sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub>) was measured at 1 and 6 hours after return of spontaneous circulation. Hyperoxia was defined as a Pa<sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub> >300 mm Hg during the initial 6 hours after return of spontaneous circulation. The primary outcome was poor neurological function at hospital discharge, defined as a modified Rankin Scale score >3. Multivariable generalized linear regression with a log link was used to test the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation between Pa<sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub> and poor neurological outcome. To assess whether there was an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation between other supranormal Pa<sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub> levels and poor neurological outcome, we used other Pa<sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub> cut points to define hyperoxia (ie, 100, 150, 200, 250, 350, 400 mm Hg).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of the 280 patients included, 105 (38%) had exposure to hyperoxia. Poor neurological function at hospital discharge occurred in 70% of patients in the entire cohort and in 77% versus 65% among patients with versus without exposure to hyperoxia respectively (absolute risk difference, 12%; 95% confidence interval, 1–23). Hyperoxia was independently <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with poor neurological function (relative risk, 1.23; 95% confidence interval, 1.11–1.35). On multivariable analysis, a 1-hour-longer duration of hyperoxia exposure was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with a 3% increase in risk of poor neurological outcome (relative risk, 1.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.02–1.05).

Anti-Müllerian Hormone Trajectories Are Associated With Cardiovascular Disease in Women
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Earlier age at menopause is widely considered to be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. However, the underlying mechanisms of this relationship remain undetermined. Indications suggest that anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), an ovarian reserve marker, plays a physiological role outside of the reproductive system. Therefore, we investigated whether longitudinal AMH decline trajectories are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) occurrence.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This study included 3108 female participants between 20 and 60 years of age at baseline of the population-based Doetinchem Cohort. Participants completed ≥1 of 5 consecutive quinquennial visits between 1987 and 2010, resulting in a total follow-up time of 20 years. AMH was measured in 8507 stored plasma samples. Information on total CVD, stroke, and coronary heart disease was obtained through a hospital discharge registry linkage. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation of AMH trajectories with CVD was quantified with joint modeling, with adjustment for age, smoking, oral contraceptive use, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone therapy use, diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and glucose levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>By the end of follow-up, 8.2% of the women had suffered from CVD, 4.9% had suffered from coronary heart disease, and 2.6% had experienced a stroke. After adjustment, each ng/mL lower <sub>log</sub>AMH level was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with a 21% higher risk of CVD (hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.07–1.36) and a 26% higher risk of coronary heart disease (hazard ratio, 1.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.08–1.46). Each additional ng/mL/year decrease of <sub>log</sub>AMH was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with a significantly higher risk of CVD (hazard ratio, 1.46; 95% confidence interval, 1.14–1.87) and coronary heart disease (hazard ratio, 1.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.15–2.12). No <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation between AMH and stroke was found.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These results indicate that AMH trajectories in women are independently <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with CVD risk. Therefore, we postulate that the decline of circulating AMH levels may be part of the pathophysiology of the increased cardiovascular risk of earlier menopause. Confirmation of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation and elucidation of its underlying mechanisms are needed to place these results in a clinical perspective.</p></sec>

Association of Bystander Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Survival According to Ambulance Response Times After Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest

The main objective was to examine the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation of bystander CPR with survival as time to advanced treatment increases.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied 7623 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients between 2005 and 2011, identified through the nationwide Danish Cardiac Arrest Registry. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to examine the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation between time from 911 call to emergency medical service arrival (response time) and survival according to whether bystander CPR was provided (yes or no). Reported are 30-day survival chances with 95% bootstrap confidence intervals.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>With increasing response times, adjusted 30-day survival chances decreased for both patients with bystander CPR and those without. However, the contrast between the survival chances of patients with versus without bystander CPR increased over time: within 5 minutes, 30-day survival was 14.5% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 12.8–16.4) versus 6.3% (95% CI: 5.1–7.6), corresponding to 2.3 times higher chances of survival <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with bystander CPR; within 10 minutes, 30-day survival chances were 6.7% (95% CI: 5.4–8.1) versus 2.2% (95% CI: 1.5–3.1), corresponding to 3.0 times higher chances of 30-day survival <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with bystander CPR. The contrast in 30-day survival became statistically insignificant when response time was >13 minutes (bystander CPR vs no bystander CPR: 3.7% [95% CI: 2.2–5.4] vs 1.5% [95% CI: 0.6–2.7]), but 30-day survival was still 2.5 times higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with bystander CPR. Based on the model and Danish out-of-hospital cardiac arrest statistics, an additional 233 patients could potentially be saved annually if response time was reduced from 10 to 5 minutes and 119 patients if response time was reduced from 7 (the median response time in this study) to 5 minutes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The absolute survival <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with bystander CPR declined rapidly with time. Yet bystander CPR while waiting for an ambulance was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with a more than doubling of 30-day survival even in case of long ambulance response time.

Worsening Renal Function in Patients With Acute Heart Failure Undergoing Aggressive Diuresis Is Not Associated With Tubular Injury
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Worsening renal function (WRF) in the setting of aggressive diuresis for acute heart failure treatment may reflect renal tubular injury or simply indicate a hemodynamic or functional change in glomerular filtration. Well-validated tubular injury biomarkers, <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase, neutrophil gelatinase-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated lipocalin, and kidney injury molecule 1, are now available that can quantify the degree of renal tubular injury. The ROSE-AHF trial (Renal Optimization Strategies Evaluation–Acute Heart Failure) provides an experimental platform for the study of mechanisms of WRF during aggressive diuresis for acute heart failure because the ROSE-AHF protocol dictated high-dose loop diuretic therapy in all patients. We sought to determine whether tubular injury biomarkers are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with WRF in the setting of aggressive diuresis and its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation with prognosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients in the multicenter ROSE-AHF trial with baseline and 72-hour urine tubular injury biomarkers were analyzed (n=283). WRF was defined as a ≥20% decrease in glomerular filtration rate estimated with cystatin C.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Consistent with protocol-driven aggressive dosing of loop diuretics, participants received a median 560 mg IV furosemide equivalents (interquartile range, 300–815 mg), which induced a urine output of 8425 mL (interquartile range, 6341–10 528 mL) over the 72-hour intervention period. Levels of <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase and kidney injury molecule 1 did not change with aggressive diuresis (both <i>P</i>>0.59), whereas levels of neutrophil gelatinase-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated lipocalin decreased slightly (−8.7 ng/mg; interquartile range, −169 to 35 ng/mg; <i>P</i><0.001).

Long-Term Potassium Monitoring and Dynamics in Heart Failure and Risk of Mortality

Mean potassium at discharge was 4.3±0.48 mEq/L. Hypokalemia (<3.5 mEq/L), normokalemia (3.5–5.0 mEq/L), and hyperkalemia (>5 mEq/L) were observed at the index admission in 77 (3.6%), 1965 (90.8%), and 122 (5.6%) patients, respectively. At a median follow-up of 2.8 years (range, 0.03–12.8 years), 1090 patients died (50.4%). On a continuous scale, the multivariable-adjusted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation of potassium values and mortality revealed a nonlinear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation (U-shaped) with higher risk at both ends of its distribution (omnibus <i>P</i>=0.001).

We repeated analyses for Alzheimer disease and accounting for stroke. We used linear regression to determine change in cognitive performance during 2 consecutive examination rounds in relation to perfusion. Finally, we investigated whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ations were modified by baseline severity of white matter hyperintensities.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 4759 participants (median age 61.3 years, 55.2% women) with a median follow-up of 6.9 years, 123 participants developed dementia (97 Alzheimer disease).

Risk of dementia with hypoperfusion was higher with increasing severity of white matter hyperintensities (with severe white matter hyperintensities; hazard ratio, 1.54; 95% confidence interval, 1.11–2.14). At cognitive reexamination after on average 5.7 years, lower baseline perfusion was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with accelerated decline in cognition (global cognition: β=−0.029, <i>P</i>=0.003), which was similar after excluding those with incident dementia, and again most profound in individuals with higher volume of white matter hyperintensities (<i>P</i> value for interaction=0.019).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Cerebral hypoperfusion is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with accelerated cognitive decline and an increased risk of dementia in the general population.</p></sec>

Prolonged, Uninterrupted Sedentary Behavior and Glycemic Biomarkers Among US Hispanic/Latino Adults
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Excessive sedentary time is ubiquitous in developed nations and is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with deleterious health outcomes. Few studies have examined whether the manner in which sedentary time is accrued (in short or long bouts) carries any clinical relevance.

Homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance and glycosylated hemoglobin were measured from a fasting blood sample, and 2-hour glucose was measured after an oral glucose tolerance test. Sedentary time was objectively measured with a hip-mounted accelerometer. Prolonged, uninterrupted sedentariness was expressed as mean sedentary bout length.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>After adjustment for potential confounders and moderate to vigorous physical activity, longer sedentary bout duration was dose-dependently <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with increased homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (<i>P</i> for trend<0.001) and 2-hour glucose levels (<i>P</i> for trend=0.015). These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ations were not independent of total sedentary time; however, a significant interaction between sedentary bout duration and total sedentary time was observed. Evaluation of the joint <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation of total sedentary time and sedentary bout duration showed that participants in the upper quartile for both sedentary characteristics (ie, high total sedentary time and high sedentary bout duration) had the highest levels of homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (<i>P</i><0.001 versus low group for both sedentary characteristics) and 2-hour glucose (<i>P</i>=0.002 versus low group for both sedentary characteristics).

Association of Traditional Cardiovascular Risk Factors With Venous Thromboembolism
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Much controversy surrounds the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation of traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors with venous thromboembolism (VTE).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed an individual level random-effect meta-analysis including 9 prospective studies with measured baseline cardiovascular disease risk factors and validated VTE events. Definitions were harmonized across studies. Traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors were modeled categorically and continuously using restricted cubic splines. Estimates were obtained for overall VTE, provoked VTE (ie, VTE occurring in the presence of 1 or more established VTE risk factors), and unprovoked VTE, pulmonary embolism, and deep-vein thrombosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The studies included 244 865 participants with 4910 VTE events occurring during a mean follow-up of 4.7 to 19.7 years per study. Age, sex, and body mass index-adjusted hazard ratios for overall VTE were 0.98 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.89−1.07) for hypertension, 0.97 (95% CI: 0.88−1.08) for hyperlipidemia, 1.01 (95% CI: 0.89−1.15) for diabetes mellitus, and 1.19 (95% CI: 1.08−1.32) for current smoking. After full adjustment, these estimates were numerically similar. When modeled continuously, an inverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation was observed for systolic blood pressure (hazard ratio=0.79 [95% CI: 0.68−0.92] at systolic blood pressure 160 vs 110 mm Hg) but not for diastolic blood pressure or lipid measures with VTE. An important finding from VTE subtype analyses was that cigarette smoking was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with provoked but not unprovoked VTE. Fully adjusted hazard ratios for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ations of current smoking with provoked and unprovoked VTE were 1.36 (95% CI: 1.22−1.52) and 1.08 (95% CI: 0.90−1.29), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Except for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation between cigarette smoking and provoked VTE, which is potentially mediated through comorbid conditions such as cancer, the modifiable traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors are not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with increased VTE risk.

Detailed Echocardiographic Phenotyping in Breast Cancer Patients
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiovascular disease in patients with breast cancer is of growing concern. The longitudinal effects of commonly used therapies, including doxorubicin and trastuzumab, on cardiac remodeling and function remain unknown in this population. We aimed to define the changes in echocardiographic parameters of structure, function, and ventricular-arterial coupling, and their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ations with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and heart failure symptoms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a longitudinal prospective cohort study of 277 breast cancer participants receiving doxorubicin (Dox), trastuzumab (Tras), or both (Dox+Tras), we obtained 1249 echocardiograms over a median follow-up of 2.0 (interquartile range, 1.0–3.0) years. Left ventricular structure, diastolic and contractile function, and ventricular-arterial coupling measures were quantified in a core laboratory blinded to participant characteristics. We evaluated changes in echocardiographic parameters over time, and used repeated-measures regression models to define their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation with LVEF decline and recovery. Linear regression models defined the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation between early changes in these parameters and subsequent changes in LVEF and heart failure symptoms.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, 177 (64%) received Dox, 51 (18%) received Tras, and 49 (18%) received Dox+Tras. With Dox, there was a sustained, modest decrease in LVEF over the follow-up duration (1-year change in LVEF –3.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI], –4.4% to –2.8%; 3-year change –3.8%; 95% CI, –5.1% to –2.5%). With Tras, a similar LVEF decline was observed at 1 year (–4.5%; 95% CI, –6.0% to –2.9%) and 3 years (–2.8%; 95%CI, –5.3 to –0.4%). Participants receiving Dox+Tras demonstrated the greatest declines at 1 year (–6.6%; 95% CI, –8.2 to –5.0%), with partial recovery at 3 years (–2.8%; 95% CI, –4.8 to –0.8%). LVEF declines and recovery were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated primarily with changes in systolic volumes, longitudinal and circumferential strain, and ventricular-arterial coupling indices, effective arterial elastance (Ea) and the coupling ratio Ea/Ees<sub>sb</sub>, without evidence for effect modification across therapies. Early changes in volumes, strain, and Ea/Ees<sub>sb</sub> at 4 to 6 months were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with 1- and 2-year LVEF changes.

Glycerophosphocholine Metabolites and Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors in Adolescents
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Glycerophosphocholine (GPC) metabolites modulate atherosclerosis and thus risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Preclinical CVD may start during adolescence. Here, we used targeted serum lipidomics to identify a new panel of GPCs, and tested whether any of these GPCs are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated, in adolescence, with classical risk factors of CVD, namely excess visceral fat (VF), elevated blood pressure, insulin resistance, and atherogenic dyslipidemia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied a population-based sample of 990 adolescents (12–18 years, 48% male), as part of the Saguenay Youth Study.

The Sobel test of mediation revealed that both GPCs mediated their respective relations between VF (as a potential primary exposure) and CVD risk factors (as outcomes, <i>P</i> values<1.3×10<sup>–3</sup>). Furthermore, a GPC shown recently to predict incident coronary heart disease in older adults, PC18:2/0:0, was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with several CVD risk factors in adolescents; these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ations were less strong than those with the newly identified GPCs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We identified novel GPCs strongly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with multiple CVD risk factors in adolescents.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
The Genetics of Leaf Flecking in Maize and Its Relationship to Plant Defense and Disease Resistance
<p>Physiological leaf spotting, or flecking, is a mild-lesion phenotype observed on the leaves of several commonly used maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) inbred lines and has been anecdotally linked to enhanced broad-spectrum disease resistance. Flecking was assessed in the maize nested <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation mapping (NAM) population, comprising 4,998 recombinant inbred lines from 25 biparental families, and in an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation population, comprising 279 diverse maize inbreds. Joint family linkage analysis was conducted with 7,386 markers in the NAM population. Genome-wide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation tests were performed with 26.5 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the NAM population and with 246,497 SNPs in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation population, resulting in the identification of 18 and three loci <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with variation in flecking, respectively. Many of the candidate genes colocalizing with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated SNPs are similar to genes that function in plant defense response via cell wall modification, salicylic acid- and jasmonic acid-dependent pathways, redox homeostasis, stress response, and vesicle trafficking/remodeling. Significant positive correlations were found between increased flecking, stronger defense response, increased disease resistance, and increased pest resistance. A nonlinear relationship with total kernel weight also was observed whereby lines with relatively high levels of flecking had, on average, lower total kernel weight. We present evidence suggesting that mild flecking could be used as a selection criterion for breeding programs trying to incorporate broad-spectrum disease resistance.</p>

The stability of the hip after the use of a proximal femoral endoprosthesis for oncological indications
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Instability of the hip is the most common mode of failure after   reconstruction with a proximal femoral arthroplasty (PFA) using   an endoprosthesis after excision of a tumour. Small studies report   improved stability with capsular repair of the hip and other techniques,   but these have not been investigated in a large series of patients.   The aim of this study was to evaluate variables <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with   the patient and the operation that affect post-operative stability.   We hypothesised an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation between capsular repair and stability.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>In a retrospective cohort study, we identified 527 adult patients   who were treated with a PFA for tumours. Our data included demographics,   the pathological diagnosis, the amount of resection of the abductor   muscles, the techniques of reconstruction and the characteristics   of the implant. We used regression analysis to compare patients   with and without post-operative instability.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 20 patients out of 527 (4%) had instability which   presented at a mean of 35 days (3 to 131) post-operatively. Capsular   repair was not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with a reduced rate of instability. Bivariate   analysis showed that a posterolateral surgical approach (odds ratio   (OR) 0.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 0.86) and the type   of implant (p = 0.046) had a significant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation with reduced   instability; age > 60 years predicted instability (OR 3.17, 95%   CI 1.00 to 9.98). Multivariate analysis showed age > 60 years (OR   5.09, 95% CI 1.23 to 21.07), female gender (OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.04   to 2.89), a malignant primary bone tumour (OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.06   to 3.95), and benign condition (OR 5.56, 95% CI 1.35 to 22.90),   but not metastatic disease or soft-tissue tumours, predicted instability,   while a posterolateral approach (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.53) was   protective against instability. No instability occurred when a synthetic   graft was used in 70 patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Stability of the hip after PFA is influenced by variables <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated   with the patient, the pathology, the surgical technique and the   implant. We did not find an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation between capsular repair   and improved stability. Extension of the tumour often dictates surgical   technique; however, our results indicate that PFA using a posterolateral   approach with a hemiarthroplasty and synthetic augment for soft-tissue   repair confers the lowest risk of instability. Patients who are   elderly, female, or with a primary benign or malignant bone tumour   should be counselled about an increased risk of instability.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:531–7.</p></sec>

Time to Endovascular Treatment and Outcome in Acute Ischemic Stroke
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Randomized, clinical trials in selected acute ischemic stroke patients reported that for every hour delay of endovascular treatment (EVT), chances of functional independence diminish by up to 3.4%. These findings may not be fully generalizable to clinical practice because of strict in- and exclusion criteria in these trials. Therefore, we aim to assess the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation of time to EVT with functional outcome in current, everyday clinical practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The MR CLEAN Registry (Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in The Netherlands) is an ongoing, prospective, observational study in all centers that perform EVT in The Netherlands. Data were analyzed from patients treated between March 2014 and June 2016. In the primary analysis we assessed the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation of time from stroke onset to start of EVT and time from stroke onset to successful reperfusion with functional outcome (measured with the modified Rankin Scale), by means of ordinal logistic regression.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We analyzed 1488 patients with acute ischemic stroke who underwent EVT. An increased time to start of EVT was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with worse functional outcome (adjusted common odds ratio, 0.83 per hour; 95% confidence interval, 0.77–0.89) and a 2.2% increase in mortality. Every hour increase from stroke onset to EVT start resulted in a 5.3% decreased probability of functional independence (modified Rankin Scale, 0–2). In the 742 patients with successful reperfusion, every hour increase from stroke onset to reperfusion was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with a 7.7% decreased probability of functional independence.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Time to EVT for acute ischemic stroke in current clinical practice is strongly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with functional outcome.

Prognostic Value of Follow-Up Hemodynamic Variables After Initial Management in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension

Recent studies have suggested that pulmonary arterial compliance may also predict prognosis in PAH. The prognostic importance of hemodynamic values achieved after treatment initiation is less well established.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Our objective was to evaluate the prognostic importance of clinical and hemodynamic variables during follow-up, including pulmonary arterial compliance, after initial management in PAH. We evaluated incident patients with idiopathic, drug- and toxin-induced, or heritable PAH enrolled in the French pulmonary hypertension registry between 2006 and 2016 who had a follow-up right-sided heart catheterization (RHC). The primary outcome was death or lung transplantation. We used stepwise Cox regression and the Kaplan-Meier method to assess variables obtained at baseline and at first follow-up RHC.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 981 patients, a primary outcome occurred in 331 patients (33.7%) over a median follow-up duration of 2.8 years (interquartile range, 1.1–4.6 years). In a multivariable model considering only baseline variables, no hemodynamic variables independently predicted prognosis. Median time to first follow-up RHC was 4.6 months (interquartile range, 3.7–7.8 months). At first follow-up RHC (n=763), New York Heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation functional class, 6-minute walk distance, stroke volume index (SVI), and right atrial pressure were independently <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with death or lung transplantation, adjusted for age, sex, and type of PAH. Pulmonary arterial compliance did not independently predict outcomes at baseline or during follow-up. The adjusted hazard ratio for SVI was 1.28 (95% confidence interval, 1.11–1.49; <i>P</i><0.01) per 10-mL/m<sup>2</sup> decrease and for right atrial pressure was 1.05 (95% confidence interval, 1.02–1.09; <i>P</i><0.01) per 1–mm Hg increase.

Ventricular Fibrillation Conversion Testing After Implantation of a Subcutaneous Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Compared with transvenous implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), subcutaneous (S)-ICDs require a higher energy for effective defibrillation. Although ventricular fibrillation conversion testing (CT) is recommended after S-ICD implantation to ensure an adequate margin between the defibrillation threshold and maximum device output (80J), prior work found that adherence to this recommendation is declining.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied first-time recipients of S-ICDs (between September 28, 2012, and April 1, 2016) in the National Cardiovascular Database Registry ICD Registry to determine predictors of use of CT, predictors of an insufficient safety margin (ISM, defined as ventricular fibrillation conversion energy >65J) during testing, and inhospital outcomes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with use of CT. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to predict use of CT and ISM. Inverse probability weighted logistic regression analysis was used to examine the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation between use of CT and inhospital adverse events including death.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>CT testing was performed in 70.7% (n=5624) of 7960 patients with S-ICDs. Although deferral of CT was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with several patient characteristics (including increased body mass index, increased body surface area, severely reduced ejection fraction, dialysis dependence, warfarin use, anemia, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), the facility effect was comparatively more important (area under the curve for patient level versus generalized linear mixed model: 0.619 versus 0.877). An ISM occurred in 6.9% (n=336) of 4864 patients without a prior ICD and was more common among white patients and those with ventricular pacing on the preimplant ECG, higher preimplant blood pressure, larger body surface area, higher body mass index, and lower ejection fraction. A risk score was able to identify patients at low (<5%), medium (5% to 10%), and high risk (>10%) for ISM. CT testing was not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with a composite of inhospital complications including death.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Use of CT testing after S-ICD implantation was driven by facility preference to a greater extent than patient factors and was not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with a composite of inhospital complications or death.

Particulate Matter Air Pollution Exposure and Heart Disease Mortality Risks by Race and Ethnicity in the United States
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Most US studies of mortality and air pollution have been conducted on largely non-Hispanic white study populations. However, many health and mortality outcomes differ by race and ethnicity, and non-Hispanic white persons experience lower air pollution exposure than those who are non-Hispanic black or Hispanic. This study examines whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ations between air pollution and heart disease mortality differ by race/ethnicity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used data from the 1997 to 2009 National Health Interview Survey linked to mortality records through December 2011 and annual estimates of fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) by census tract. Proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals between PM<sub>2.5</sub> (per 10 µg/m<sup>3</sup>) and heart disease mortality using the full sample and the sample adults, which have information on additional health variables. Interaction terms were used to examine differences in the PM<sub>2.5</sub>-mortality <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation by race/ethnicity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, 65 936 of the full sample died during follow-up, and 22 152 died from heart disease.

Thyroid Function Within the Normal Range, Subclinical Hypothyroidism, and the Risk of Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a highly prevalent disorder leading to heart failure, stroke, and death. Enhanced understanding of modifiable risk factors may yield opportunities for prevention. The risk of AF is increased in subclinical hyperthyroidism, but it is uncertain whether variations in thyroid function within the normal range or subclinical hypothyroidism are also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with AF.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a systematic review and obtained individual participant data from prospective cohort studies that measured thyroid function at baseline and assessed incident AF. Studies were identified from MEDLINE and EMBASE databases from inception to July 27, 2016. The euthyroid state was defined as thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) 0.45 to 4.49 mIU/L, and subclinical hypothyroidism as TSH 4.5 to 19.9 mIU/L with free thyroxine (fT4) levels within reference range. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation of TSH levels in the euthyroid and subclinical hypothyroid range with incident AF was examined by using Cox proportional hazards models. In euthyroid participants, we additionally examined the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation between fT4 levels and incident AF.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 30 085 participants from 11 cohorts (278 955 person-years of follow-up), 1958 (6.5%) had subclinical hypothyroidism and 2574 individuals (8.6%) developed AF during follow-up. TSH at baseline was not significantly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with incident AF in euthyroid participants or those with subclinical hypothyroidism. Higher fT4 levels at baseline in euthyroid individuals were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with increased AF risk in age- and sex-adjusted analyses (hazard ratio, 1.45; 95% confidence interval, 1.26–1.66, for the highest quartile versus the lowest quartile of fT4; <i>P</i> for trend ≤0.001 across quartiles). Estimates did not substantially differ after further adjustment for preexisting cardiovascular disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In euthyroid individuals, higher circulating fT4 levels, but not TSH levels, are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with increased risk of incident AF.</p></sec>

Genetic Obesity and the Risk of Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Observational studies have identified an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation between body mass index (BMI) and incident atrial fibrillation (AF). Inferring causality from observational studies, however, is subject to residual confounding, reverse causation, and bias. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the causal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation between BMI and AF by using genetic predictors of BMI.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We identified 51 646 individuals of European ancestry without AF at baseline from 7 prospective population-based cohorts initiated between 1987 and 2002 in the United States, Iceland, and the Netherlands with incident AF ascertained between 1987 and 2012. Cohort-specific mean follow-up ranged from 7.4 to 19.2 years, over which period there was a total of 4178 cases of incident AF. We performed a Mendelian randomization with instrumental variable analysis to estimate a cohort-specific causal hazard ratio for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation between BMI and AF. Two genetic instruments for BMI were used: <i>FTO</i> genotype (rs1558902) and a BMI gene score comprising 39 single-nucleotide polymorphisms identified by genome-wide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation studies to be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with BMI. Cohort-specific estimates were combined by random-effects, inverse variance–weighted meta-analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In age- and sex-adjusted meta-analysis, both genetic instruments were significantly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with BMI (<i>FTO</i>: 0.43 [95% confidence interval, 0.32–0.54] kg/m<sup>2</sup> per A-allele, <i>P</i><0.001; BMI gene score: 1.05 [95% confidence interval, 0.90–1.20] kg/m<sup>2</sup> per 1-U increase, <i>P</i><0.001) and incident AF (<i>FTO</i>, hazard ratio, 1.07 [1.02–1.11] per A-allele, <i>P</i>=0.004; BMI gene score, hazard ratio, 1.11 [1.05–1.18] per 1-U increase, <i>P</i><0.001). Age- and sex-adjusted instrumental variable estimates for the causal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation between BMI and incident AF were hazard ratio, 1.15 (1.04–1.26) per kg/m<sup>2</sup>, <i>P</i>=0.005 (<i>FTO</i>) and 1.11 (1.05–1.17) per kg/m<sup>2</sup>, <i>P</i><0.001 (BMI gene score). Both of these estimates were consistent with the meta-analyzed estimate between observed BMI and AF (age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio 1.05 [1.04–1.06] per kg/m<sup>2</sup>, <i>P</i><0.001). Multivariable adjustment did not significantly change findings.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our data are consistent with a causal relationship between BMI and incident AF. These data support the possibility that public health initiatives targeting primordial prevention of obesity may reduce the incidence of AF.</p></sec>

Loss of Cardioprotective Effects at the <i>ADAMTS7</i> Locus as a Result of Gene-Smoking Interactions
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Common diseases such as coronary heart disease (CHD) are complex in etiology. The interaction of genetic susceptibility with lifestyle factors may play a prominent role. However, gene-lifestyle interactions for CHD have been difficult to identify. Here, we investigate interaction of smoking behavior, a potent lifestyle factor, with genotypes that have been shown to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ate with CHD risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We analyzed data on 60 919 CHD cases and 80 243 controls from 29 studies for gene-smoking interactions for genetic variants at 45 loci previously reported to be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with CHD risk. We also studied 5 loci <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with smoking behavior. Study-specific gene-smoking interaction effects were calculated and pooled using fixed-effects meta-analyses. Interaction analyses were declared to be significant at a <i>P</i> value of <1.0×10<sup>–3</sup> (Bonferroni correction for 50 tests).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We identified novel gene-smoking interaction for a variant upstream of the <i>ADAMTS7</i> gene.

The protective T allele at rs7178051 was also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with reduced <i>ADAMTS7</i> expression in human aortic endothelial cells and lymphoblastoid cell lines.

Crohn's Disease Loci Are Common Targets of Protozoa-Driven Selection
<p>Previous studies indicated that a few risk variants for autoimmune diseases are subject to pathogen-driven selection. Nonetheless, the proportion of risk loci that has been targeted by pathogens and the type of infectious agent(s) that exerted the strongest pressure remain to be evaluated. We assessed whether different pathogens exerted a pressure on known Crohn's disease (CD) risk variants and demonstrate that these single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are preferential targets of protozoa-driven selection (<i>P</i> = 0.008). In particular, 19% of SNPs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with CD have been subject to protozoa-driven selective pressure. Analysis of <i>P</i> values from genome-wide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation studies (GWASs) and meta-analyses indicated that protozoan-selected SNPs display significantly stronger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation with CD compared with nonselected variants. This same behavior was not observed for GWASs of other autoimmune diseases. Thus, we integrated selection signatures and meta-analysis results to prioritize five genic SNPs for replication in an Italian cohort. Three SNPs were significantly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with CD risk, and combination with meta-analysis results yielded <i>P</i> values < 4 × 10<sup>−6</sup>. The bona fide risk alleles are located in <i>ARHGEF2</i>, an interactor of <i>NOD2, NSF</i>, a gene involved in autophagy, and <i>HEBP1</i>, encoding a possible mediator of inflammation. Pathway analysis indicated that <i>ARHGEF2</i> and <i>NSF</i> participate in a molecular network, which also contains <i>VAMP3</i> (previously <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated to CD) and is centered around miR-31 (known to be disregulated in CD). Thus, we show that protozoa-driven selective pressure had a major role in shaping predisposition to CD. We next used this information for the identification of three bona fide novel susceptibility loci.</p>

Oral Anticoagulation in Very Elderly Patients With Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Stroke prevention with oral anticoagulants (OACs) is the cornerstone for the management of atrial fibrillation (AF). However, data about the use of OACs among patients ≥90 years of age are limited. We aimed to investigate the risk of ischemic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and the net clinical benefit of OAC treatment for very elderly patients with AF (≥90 years of age).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This study used the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. Risks of ischemic stroke and ICH were compared between 11 064 and 14 658 patients with and without AF ≥90 years of age without antithrombotic therapy from 1996 to 2011. Patients with AF (n=15 756) were divided into 3 groups (no treatment, antiplatelet agents, and warfarin), and the risks of stroke and ICH were analyzed. The risks of ischemic stroke and ICH were further compared between patients treated with warfarin and nonvitamin K antagonist OACs (NOACs) from 2012 to 2015 when NOACs were available in Taiwan.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Compared with patients without AF, patients with AF had an increased risk of ischemic stroke (event number/patient number, incidence = 742/11 064, 5.75%/y versus 1399/14 658, 3.00%/y; hazard ratio, 1.93; 95% confidence interval, 1.74–2.14) and similar risk of ICH (131/11 064, 0.97%/y versus 206/14 658, 0.54%/y; hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.66–1.09) in competing risk analysis for mortality. Among patients with AF, warfarin use was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with a lower stroke risk (39/617, 3.83%/y versus 742/11 064, 5.75%/y; hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.49–0.96 in a competing risk model), with no difference in ICH risk compared with nontreatment. When compared with no antithrombotic therapy or antiplatelet drugs, warfarin was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with a positive net clinical benefit. These findings persisted in propensity-matched analyses. Compared with warfarin, NOACs were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with a lower risk of ICH (4/978, 0.42%/y versus 19/768, 1.63%/y; hazard ratio, 0.32; 95% confidence interval, 0.10–0.97 in a competing risk model), with no difference in risk of ischemic stroke.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among patients with AF ≥90 years of age, warfarin was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with a lower risk of ischemic stroke and positive net clinical benefit. Compared with warfarin, NOACs were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with a lower risk of ICH.

Time to Epinephrine Administration and Survival From Nonshockable Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Among Children and Adults
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that earlier epinephrine administration is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with improved survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with shockable initial rhythms. However, the effect of epinephrine timing on patients with nonshockable initial rhythms is unclear. The objective of this study was to measure the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation between time to epinephrine administration and survival in adults and children with emergency medical services (EMS)–treated OHCA with nonshockable initial rhythms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed a secondary analysis of OHCAs prospectively identified by the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium network from June 4, 2011, to June 30, 2015. We included patients of all ages with an EMS-treated OHCA and an initial nonshockable rhythm. We excluded those with return of spontaneous circulation in <10 minutes. We conducted a subgroup analysis involving patients <18 years of age. The primary exposure was time (minutes) from arrival of the first EMS agency to the first dose of epinephrine. Secondary exposure was time to epinephrine dichotomized as early (<10 minutes) or late (≥10 minutes). The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. We adjusted for Utstein covariates and Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium study site.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>From 55 568 EMS-treated OHCAs, 32 101 patients with initial nonshockable rhythms were included. There were 12 238 in the early group, 14 517 in the late group, and 5346 not treated with epinephrine. After adjusting for potential confounders, each minute from EMS arrival to epinephrine administration was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with a 4% decrease in odds of survival for adults, odds ratio=0.96 (95% confidence interval, 0.95–0.98).

During a median follow-up of 3.3 years, cardiovascular events occurred in 1014 patients (7.3%), and 502 patients died (3.7%). For both blood pressure targets, an identical shape of the J curve was present, with a nadir for cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality just below the SBP target. Patients in the lowest SBP stratum were older, had a higher body mass index, smoked more often, and had a higher frequency of diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular events.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Low on-treatment SBP levels are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with increased cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation is independent of the attained blood pressure level because the J curve aligns with the SBP target.

Sex Differences and Similarities in Atrial Fibrillation Epidemiology, Risk Factors, and Mortality in Community Cohorts
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac disease in aging populations with high comorbidity and mortality. Sex differences in AF epidemiology are insufficiently understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In N=79 793 individuals without AF diagnosis at baseline (median age, 49.6 years; age range, 24.1–97.6 years; 51.7% women) from 4 community-based European studies (FINRISK, DanMONICA, Moli-sani Northern Sweden) of the BiomarCaRE consortium (Biomarker for Cardiovascular Risk Assessment in Europe), we examined AF incidence, its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation with mortality, common risk factors, biomarkers, and prevalent cardiovascular disease, and their attributable risk by sex. Median follow-up time was 12.6 (to a maximum of 28.2) years.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Fewer AF cases were observed in women (N=1796; 4.4%), than in men (N=2465; 6.4%). Cardiovascular risk factor distribution and lipid profile at baseline were less beneficial in men than in women, and cardiovascular disease was more prevalent in men. Cumulative incidence increased markedly after the age of 50 years in men and after 60 years in women. The lifetime risk was similar (>30%) for both sexes. Subjects with incident AF had a 3.5-fold risk of death in comparison with those without AF. Multivariable-adjusted models showed sex differences for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation of body mass index and AF (hazard ratio per standard deviation increase, 1.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12–1.23 in women versus 1.31; 95% CI 1.25–1.38 in men; interaction <i>P</i> value of 0.001). Total cholesterol was inversely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with incident AF with a greater risk reduction in women (hazard ratio per SD, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.81–0.90 versus 0.92; 95% CI, 0.88–0.97 in men; interaction <i>P</i> value of 0.023). No sex differences were seen for C-reactive protein and N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide. The population-attributable risk of all risk factors combined was 41.9% in women and 46.0% in men. About 20% of the risk was observed for body mass index.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Lifetime risk of AF was high, and AF was strongly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with increased mortality both in women and men. Body mass index explained the largest proportion of AF risk. Observed sex differences in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation of body mass index and total cholesterol with AF need to be evaluated for underlying pathophysiology and relevance to sex-specific prevention strategies.</p></sec>

Discovery and Validation of Agonistic Angiotensin Receptor Autoantibodies as Biomarkers of Adverse Outcomes

Higher AT1RaAbs correlated significantly with interleukin-6 (Spearman <i>r</i>=0.33, <i>P</i><0.0001), systolic blood pressure (Spearman <i>r</i>=0.28, <i>P</i><0.0001), body mass index (Spearman <i>r</i>=0.28, <i>P</i><0.0001), weaker grip strength (Spearman <i>r</i>=–0.34, <i>P</i><0.01), and slower walking speed (Spearman <i>r</i>=–0.30, <i>P</i><0.05). Individuals with high AT1RaAbs were 3.9 (95% confidence interval, 1.38–11.0) times more likely to be at high risk after adjusting for age (<i>P</i><0.05). Every 1 µg/mL increase in AT1RaAbs increased the odds of falling 30% after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, and blood pressure. The Chicago group had 46 subjects with falls and 60 deaths. Serum AT1RaAb levels were significantly correlated with grip strength (Spearman <i>r</i>=–0.57, <i>P</i><0.005), walking speed (Spearman <i>r</i>=–0.47, <i>P</i><0.005), and falls (Spearman <i>r</i>=0.30, <i>P</i><0.05). Every 1 µg/mL increase in AT1RaAbs, decreased time to death by 9% after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, and blood pressure.

Contemporary Assessment of Left Ventricular Diastolic Function in Older Adults
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although age-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated changes in left ventricular diastolic function are well recognized, limited data exist characterizing measures of diastolic function in older adults, including both reference ranges reflecting the older adult population and prognostically relevant values for incident heart failure (HF), as well as their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ations with circulating biomarkers of HF risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Among 5801 elderly participants in the ARIC study (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities; age range, 67–90 years; mean age, 76±5 years; 42% male; 21% black), we determined the continuous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation of diastolic measures (tissue Doppler imaging [TDI] e’, E/e’, and left atrial size) with concomitant N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide and subsequent HF hospitalization or death. We also determined sex-specific 10th and 90th percentile limits for these measures using quantile regression in 401 participants free of prevalent cardiovascular disease and risk factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Each measure of diastolic function was robustly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide and incident HF or death. ARIC-based reference limits for TDI e’ (4.6 and 5.2 cm/s for septal and lateral TDI e’, respectively) were substantially lower than guideline cut points (7 and 10 cm/s, respectively), whereas E/e’ and left atrial size demonstrated good agreement with guideline cut points. TDI e’ was nonlinearly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with incident HF or death, with inflection points for risk supportive of ARIC-based limits. ARIC-based limits for diastolic function improved risk discrimination over guideline-based cut points based on the integrated discrimination improvement (<i>P</i><0.001) and continuous net reclassification improvement (<i>P</i><0.001), reclassifying 42% of the study population as having normal diastolic function. We replicate these findings in the Copenhagen City Heart Study. With these limits, 46% had normal diastolic function and were at low risk of HF hospitalization or death (1%/y over a mean 1.7-year follow-up), 49% had 1 or 2 abnormal measures and were at intermediate risk (2.4%/y), and all 3 diastolic measures were abnormal in 5% who were at high risk (7.5%/y).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings suggest that left ventricular longitudinal relaxation velocity declines as a part of healthy aging and is largely prognostically benign. The use of age-based normative values when considering an elderly population improves the risk discrimination of diastolic measures for incident HF or death.</p></sec>

Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Connection
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC) is a rare form of congenital heart disease. This study describes current surgical treatment strategies and experiences in a cohort of patients from 2 congenital cardiac centers in Shanghai and Guangdong in China.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This retrospective study included 768 patients operated on between 2005 and 2014. Although most patients (n=690) underwent conventional repair, a sutureless technique was used in 10% (n=78) of cases. A multilevel mixed-effects parametric survival model and a competing-risk analysis were used to analyze <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated risk factors for death and recurrent pulmonary venous obstruction (PVO), respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to analyze the overall survival. The Nelson-Aalen cumulative risk curve was used to compare distributions of time with recurrent PVO.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The mean surgical age and weight were 214.9±39.2 days and 5.4±3.6 kg, respectively. Obstructed TAPVC (PVO) was documented in 192 (25%) of the 768 patients. There were 38 intraoperative deaths and 13 late deaths. A younger age at the time of repair (<i>P</i>=0.001), mixed (<i>P</i>=0.004) and infracardiac (<i>P</i>=0.035) TAPVC, preoperative PVO (<i>P</i>=0.027), prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass time (<i>P</i><0.001), and longer duration of ventilation (<i>P</i>=0.028) were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with mortality. The median follow-up was 23.2 months (range; 1–112 months). Among the 717 survivors, recurrent PVO was observed in 111 patients (15%). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated risk factors for recurrent PVO included preoperative PVO (<i>P</i><0.001), infracardiac TAPVC (<i>P</i><0.001), mixed TAPVC (<i>P</i>=0.013), and prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass time (<i>P</i><0.001). Sutureless technique was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with a lower restenosis rate compared with conventional repair in patients with preoperative PVO (<i>P</i>=0.038), except in newborn patients (<i>P</i>=0.443).

The function of most survivors (91%) was classified according to the New York Heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation as functional class I or II.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Surgical correction in patients with TAPVC with a biventricular anatomy can achieve an acceptable outcome. Risk factors such as a younger age at the time of repair, infracardiac and mixed TAPVC, and preoperative PVO were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with a poorer prognosis.</p></sec>

High-Sensitive Cardiac Troponin T as an Early Biochemical Signature for Clinical and Subclinical Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although small elevations of high-sensitive cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with incident heart failure (HF) in the general population, the underlying mechanisms are not well defined. Evaluating the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation of hs-cTnT with replacement fibrosis and progression of structural heart disease before symptoms is fundamental to understanding the potential of this biomarker in a HF prevention strategy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We measured hs-cTnT at baseline among 4986 participants in MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis), a cohort initially free of overt cardiovascular disease (CVD). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was performed at baseline. Repeat cardiac magnetic resonance was performed 10 years later among 2831 participants who remained free of interim CVD events; of these, 1723 received gadolinium-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance for characterization of replacement fibrosis by late gadolinium enhancement. Progression of subclinical CVD was defined by 10-year change in left ventricular structure and function. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ations of hs-cTnT with incident HF, CV-related mortality, and coronary heart disease were estimated using Cox regression models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Late gadolinium enhancement for replacement fibrosis was detectable in 6.3% participants without interim CVD events by follow-up cardiac magnetic resonance. A graded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation was observed between higher baseline hs-cTnT categories and late gadolinium enhancement (≥7.42 ng/L versus <limit of detection [<3 ng/L]; adjusted odds ratio, 2.87; 95% confidence interval, 1.38–5.94). Higher hs-cTnT was also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with a greater probability of an increase in LV mass >12% (highest category versus <limit of detection; odds ratio, 1.50; 95% confidence interval, 1.09–2.07), but not with decline in left ventricular ejection fraction.

Impact of Smoking on Circulating Cardiac Troponin I Concentrations and Cardiovascular Events in the General Population
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Both tobacco smoking and circulating cardiac troponin I (cTnI) levels are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with the risk of acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and cardiovascular death. However, whether cTnI levels differ according to smoking status and whether smoking modifies the prognostic relationship between cTnI and outcomes remain unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using data from a large, population-based cohort, we assessed the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation between smoking and cTnI and the impact of smoking on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ations between cTnI levels and the incidence of acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and cardiovascular death. cTnI was measured with a high-sensitivity assay in 3824 never smokers, 2341 former smokers, and 2550 current smokers participating in the prospective observational HUNT Study (Nord-Trøndelag Health Study). All subjects were free from known prior cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus at baseline.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The age of the participants ranged from 19 to 94 years; 55.5% were women. Current smokers exhibited significantly lower levels of cTnI (median, 2.9 ng/L; interquartile range, 2.0–4.1 ng/L) than never smokers (3.2 ng/L; interquartile range, 2.2–4.7 ng/L; <i>P</i><0.001) and former smokers (3.4 ng/L; interquartile range, 2.3–5.0 ng/L; <i>P</i><0.001). This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation remained significant after adjustment for potential confounders (B=−0.098; 95% confidence interval, −0.129 to −0.068). We observed an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation between increasing concentrations of cTnI and clinical end points in the total study cohort (adjusted hazard ratio per log unit increase in cTnI, 1.41; 95% confidence interval, 1.29–1.54). This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation was attenuated for current smokers (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95% confidence interval, 0.98–1.40) and was significantly weaker than in never/former smokers (<i>P</i> for interaction=0.003). Prognostic accuracy, as assessed by C statistics, was significantly lower in current smokers than in never smokers (<i>P</i><0.001). In addition, cTnI provided no incremental prognostic information to the Framingham Cardiovascular Disease risk score in current smokers (<i>P</i>=0.08).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Current smoking is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with lower concentrations of cTnI, suggesting that substances in tobacco smoke may affect cardiomyocyte injury. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ation between cTnI levels and cardiovascular end points is stronger in never/former smokers than in current smokers, compatible with the theory that the detrimental cardiovascular impact of current smoking is mediated via mechanisms other than subclinical myocardial injury.</p></sec>

Comparative Prognostic Utility of Indexes of Microvascular Function Alone or in Combination in Patients With an Acute ST-Segment–Elevation Myocardial Infarction

The index of microvascular resistance (IMR) is a novel invasive measure of coronary microvascular function. We aimed to investigate the pathological and prognostic significance of an IMR>40, alone or in combination with a coronary flow reserve (CFR≤2.0), in the culprit artery after emergency percutaneous coronary intervention for acute ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients with acute ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction were prospectively enrolled during emergency percutaneous coronary intervention and categorized according to IMR (≤40 or >40) and CFR (≤2.0 or >2.0). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was acquired 2 days and 6 months after myocardial infarction. All-cause death or first heart failure hospitalization was a prespecified outcome (median follow-up, 845 days).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>IMR and CFR were measured in the culprit artery at the end of percutaneous coronary intervention in 283 patients with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction (mean±SD age, 60±12 years; 73% male). The median IMR and CFR were 25 (interquartile range, 15–48) and 1.6 (interquartile range, 1.1–2.1), respectively. An IMR>40 was a multivariable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ate of myocardial hemorrhage (odds ratio, 2.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–4.27; <i>P</i>=0.042). An IMR>40 was closely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with microvascular obstruction. Symptom-to-reperfusion time, TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) blush grade, and no (≤30%) ST-segment resolution were not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ated with these pathologies. An IMR>40 was a multivariable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">associ</span></strong>ate of the changes in left ventricular ejection fraction (coefficient, −2.12; 95% confidence interval, −4.02 to −0.23; <i>P</i>=0.028) and left ventricular end-diastolic volume (coefficient, 7.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.41–15.29; <i>P</i>=0.039) at 6 months independently of infarct size.

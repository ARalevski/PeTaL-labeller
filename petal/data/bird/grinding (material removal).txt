Hemiarthroplasty proximal femoral endoprostheses following tumour reconstruction
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Dislocation rates are reportedly lower in patients requiring   proximal femoral hemiarthroplasty than for patients undergoing hip   arthroplasty for neoplasia.

The rate of wear of second-generation highly crosslinked polyethylene liners five years post-operatively does not increase if large femoral heads are used
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The increased <i>in vivo</i> resistance to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wear</span></strong> of   highly crosslinked polyethylene (HXLPE) in total hip arthroplasty   (THA) has led to an increased use of larger articulations which   have been shown to reduce the incidence of early dislocation.

Prediction of higher-selectivity catalysts by computer-driven workflow and machine learning
<p>Catalyst design in asymmetric reaction development has traditionally been driven by empiricism, wherein experimentalists attempt to qualitatively recognize structural patterns to improve selectivity. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">machin</span></strong>e learning algorithms and chemoinformatics can potentially accelerate this process by recognizing otherwise inscrutable patterns in large datasets. Herein we report a computationally guided workflow for chiral catalyst selection using chemoinformatics at every stage of development. Robust molecular descriptors that are agnostic to the catalyst scaffold allow for selection of a universal training set on the basis of steric and electronic properties. This set can be used to train <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">machin</span></strong>e learning methods to make highly accurate predictive models over a broad range of selectivity space. Using support vector <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">machin</span></strong>es and deep feed-forward neural networks, we demonstrate accurate predictive modeling in the chiral phosphoric acid–catalyzed thiol addition to <i>N</i>-acylimines.</p>

3D charge and 2D phonon transports leading to high out-of-plane <i>ZT</i> in n-type SnSe crystals
<p>Thermoelectric technology enables the harvest of waste heat and its direct conversion into electricity. The conversion efficiency is determined by the materials figure of merit <i>ZT</i>. Here we show a maximum <i>ZT</i> of ~2.8 ± 0.5 at 773 kelvin in n-type tin selenide (SnSe) crystals out of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plane</span></strong>. The thermal conductivity in layered SnSe crystals is the lowest in the out-of-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plane</span></strong> direction [two-dimensional (2D) phonon transport]. We doped SnSe with bromine to make n-type SnSe crystals with the overlapping interlayer charge density (3D charge transport). A continuous phase transition increases the symmetry and diverges two converged conduction bands. These two factors improve carrier mobility, while preserving a large Seebeck coefficient. Our findings can be applied in 2D layered materials and provide a new strategy to enhance out-of-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plane</span></strong> electrical transport properties without degrading thermal properties.</p>

The preprophase band of microtubules controls the robustness of division orientation in plants
<p>Controlling cell division <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plane</span></strong> orientation is essential for morphogenesis in multicellular organisms. In plant cells, the future cortical division <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plane</span></strong> is marked before mitotic entry by the preprophase band (PPB). Here, we characterized an <i>Arabidopsis trm</i> (TON1 Recruiting Motif) mutant that impairs PPB formation but does not affect interphase microtubules. Unexpectedly, PPB disruption neither abolished the capacity of root cells to define a cortical division zone nor induced aberrant cell division patterns but rather caused a loss of precision in cell division orientation. Our results advocate for a reassessment of PPB function and division <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plane</span></strong> determination in plants and show that a main output of this microtubule array is to limit spindle rotations in order to increase the robustness of cell division.</p>

Semantics derived automatically from language corpora contain human-like biases
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">machin</span></strong>e learning is a means to derive artificial intelligence by discovering patterns in existing data. Here, we show that applying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">machin</span></strong>e learning to ordinary human language results in human-like semantic biases. We replicated a spectrum of known biases, as measured by the Implicit Association Test, using a widely used, purely statistical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">machin</span></strong>e-learning model trained on a standard corpus of text from the World Wide Web. Our results indicate that text corpora contain recoverable and accurate imprints of our historic biases, whether morally neutral as toward insects or flowers, problematic as toward race or gender, or even simply veridical, reflecting the status quo distribution of gender with respect to careers or first names. Our methods hold promise for identifying and addressing sources of bias in culture, including technology.</p>

A coherent Ising machine for 2000-node optimization problems
<p>The analysis and optimization of complex systems can be reduced to mathematical problems collectively known as combinatorial optimization. Many such problems can be mapped onto ground-state search problems of the Ising model, and various artificial spin systems are now emerging as promising approaches. However, physical Ising <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">machin</span></strong>es have suffered from limited numbers of spin-spin couplings because of implementations based on localized spins, resulting in severe scalability problems. We report a 2000-spin network with all-to-all spin-spin couplings. Using a measurement and feedback scheme, we coupled time-multiplexed degenerate optical parametric oscillators to implement maximum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong> problems on arbitrary graph topologies with up to 2000 nodes. Our coherent Ising <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">machin</span></strong>e outperformed simulated annealing in terms of accuracy and computation time for a 2000-node complete graph.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Division Plane Orientation Defects Revealed by a Synthetic Double Mutant Phenotype
<p>TANGLED1 (TAN1) and AUXIN-INDUCED-IN-ROOTS9 (AIR9) are microtubule-binding proteins that localize to the division site in plants. Their function in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) remained unclear because neither <i>tan1</i> nor <i>air9</i> single mutants have a strong phenotype. We show that <i>tan1 air9</i> double mutants have a synthetic phenotype consisting of short, twisted roots with disordered cortical microtubule arrays that are hypersensitive to a microtubule-depolymerizing drug. The <i>tan1 air9</i> double mutants have significant defects in division <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plane</span></strong> orientation due to failures in placing the new cell wall at the correct division site. Full-length TAN1 fused to yellow fluorescent protein, <i>TAN1-YFP</i>, and several deletion constructs were transformed into the double mutant to assess which regions of TAN1 are required for its function in root growth, root twisting, and division <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plane</span></strong> orientation. <i>TAN1-YFP</i> expressed in <i>tan1 air9</i> significantly rescued the double mutant phenotype in all three respects. Interestingly, TAN1 missing the first 126 amino acids, TAN1-ΔI-YFP, failed to rescue the double mutant phenotype, while TAN1 missing a conserved middle region, TAN1-ΔII-YFP, significantly rescued the mutant phenotype in terms of root growth and division <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plane</span></strong> orientation but not root twisting. We use the <i>tan1 air9</i> double mutant to discover new functions for TAN1 and AIR9 during phragmoplast guidance and root morphogenesis.</p>

Convergence in morphology and masticatory function between the pharyngeal jaws of grass carp, <i>Ctenopharyngodon idella</i>, and oral jaws of amniote herbivores
<p>The cellulose-rich walls that protect plant cells are difficult to digest, and therefore mechanical food processing is a key aspect of herbivory across vertebrates. Cell walls are typically broken down by translation of flattened teeth in the occlusal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plane</span></strong> (i.e. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grind</span></strong>ing) as part of a complex, rhythmic chewing stroke. The grass carp, <i>Ctenopharyngodon idella</i>, is a voracious, invasive herbivorous fish that relies solely on its pharyngeal teeth, located in the back of the throat, for mechanical processing of plant material. Here, we describe the musculoskeletal anatomy of the pharyngeal jaws of grass carp and use XROMM to quantify chewing kinematics and muscle strain. The pharyngeal jaws are suspended in a sling of 11 muscles and maintain no bony articulation with any other skeletal elements in the head. The jaws bear long, serrated teeth that are worn during use into flattened tooth cusps. Our kinematic data show that this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wear</span></strong> is the result of the teeth being elevated into occlusion against the basioccipital process and keratinous chewing pad, not tooth-on-tooth occlusion. Pharyngeal jaw elevation results from large strains in the jaw elevator muscle, the levator arcus branchialis V, to drive a pulley-like mechanism that rotates the jaws about a pivot point at the symphysis between the left and right pharyngeal jaws. These complex, rhythmic jaw rotations translate the teeth laterally across the chewing surface throughout the occlusion phase. The grass carp chewing system is strikingly similar in gross morphology and masticatory function to herbivorous chewing strategies in other vertebrates.</p>

Contemporary Assessment of Left Ventricular Diastolic Function in Older Adults
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although age-associated changes in left ventricular diastolic function are well recognized, limited data exist characterizing measures of diastolic function in older adults, including both reference ranges reflecting the older adult population and prognostically relevant values for incident heart failure (HF), as well as their associations with circulating biomarkers of HF risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Among 5801 elderly participants in the ARIC study (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities; age range, 67–90 years; mean age, 76±5 years; 42% male; 21% black), we determined the continuous association of diastolic measures (tissue Doppler imaging [TDI] e’, E/e’, and left atrial size) with concomitant N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide and subsequent HF hospitalization or death. We also determined sex-specific 10th and 90th percentile limits for these measures using quantile regression in 401 participants free of prevalent cardiovascular disease and risk factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Each measure of diastolic function was robustly associated with N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide and incident HF or death. ARIC-based reference limits for TDI e’ (4.6 and 5.2 cm/s for septal and lateral TDI e’, respectively) were substantially lower than guideline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong> points (7 and 10 cm/s, respectively), whereas E/e’ and left atrial size demonstrated good agreement with guideline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong> points. TDI e’ was nonlinearly associated with incident HF or death, with inflection points for risk supportive of ARIC-based limits. ARIC-based limits for diastolic function improved risk discrimination over guideline-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong> points based on the integrated discrimination improvement (<i>P</i><0.001) and continuous net reclassification improvement (<i>P</i><0.001), reclassifying 42% of the study population as having normal diastolic function. We replicate these findings in the Copenhagen City Heart Study. With these limits, 46% had normal diastolic function and were at low risk of HF hospitalization or death (1%/y over a mean 1.7-year follow-up), 49% had 1 or 2 abnormal measures and were at intermediate risk (2.4%/y), and all 3 diastolic measures were abnormal in 5% who were at high risk (7.5%/y).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings suggest that left ventricular longitudinal relaxation velocity declines as a part of healthy aging and is largely prognostically benign. The use of age-based normative values when considering an elderly population improves the risk discrimination of diastolic measures for incident HF or death.</p></sec>

Tree Physiology
An empirical study of the wound effect on sap flux density measured with thermal dissipation probes
<p>The insertion of thermal dissipation (TD) sensors on tree stems for sap flux density (SFD) measurements can lead to SFD underestimations due to a wound formation close to the drill hole. However, the wound effect has not been assessed experimentally for this method yet. Here, we propose an empirical approach to investigate the effect of the wound healing on measured sap flux with TD probes. The approach was performed for both, diffuse-porous (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i> (Linnaeus)) and ring-porous (<i>Quercus petraea</i> (Lieblein)) species. Thermal dissipation probes were installed on different dates along the growing season to document the effects of the dynamic wound formation. The trees were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong> in autumn and additional sensors were installed in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong> stems, therefore, without potential effects of wound development. A range of water pressures was applied to the stem segments and SFDs were simultaneously measured by TD sensors as well as gravimetrically in the laboratory. The formation of wounds around sensors installed in living tree stems led to underestimation of SFD by 21.4 ± 3 and 47.5 ± 3.8% in beech and oak, respectively. The differences between SFD underestimations of diffuse-porous beech and ring-porous oak were, however, not statistically significant. Sensors with 5-, 11- and 22-week-old wounds also showed no significant differences, which implies that the influence of wound formation on SFD estimates was completed within the first few weeks after perforation. These results were confirmed by time courses of SFD measurements in the field. Field SFD values decreased immediately after sensor installation and reached stable values after ~2 weeks with similar underestimations to the ones observed in the laboratory. We therefore propose a feasible approach to correct directly field observations of SFD for potential underestimations due to the wound effect.</p>

Spin coating epitaxial films
<p>Spin-coated films, such as photoresists for lithography or perovskite films for solar cells, are either amorphous or polycrystalline. We show that epitaxial films of inorganic materials such as cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr<sub>3</sub>), lead(II) iodide (PbI<sub>2</sub>), zinc oxide (ZnO), and sodium chloride (NaCl) can be deposited onto a variety of single-crystal and single-crystal–like substrates by simply spin coating either solutions of the material or precursors to the material. The out-of-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plane</span></strong> and in-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plane</span></strong> orientations of the spin-coated films are determined by the substrate. The thin stagnant layer of supersaturated solution produced during spin coating promotes heterogeneous nucleation of the material onto the single-crystal substrate over homogeneous nucleation in the bulk solution, and ordered anion adlayers may lower the activation energy for nucleation on the surface. The method can be used to produce functional materials such as inorganic semiconductors or to deposit water-soluble materials such as NaCl that can serve as growth templates.</p>

Chirally coupled nanomagnets
<p>Magnetically coupled nanomagnets have multiple applications in nonvolatile memories, logic gates, and sensors. The most effective couplings have been found to occur between the magnetic layers in a vertical stack. We achieved strong coupling of laterally adjacent nanomagnets using the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. This coupling is mediated by chiral domain walls between out-of-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plane</span></strong> and in-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plane</span></strong> magnetic regions and dominates the behavior of nanomagnets below a critical size. We used this concept to realize lateral exchange bias, field-free current-induced switching between multistate magnetic configurations as well as synthetic antiferromagnets, skyrmions, and artificial spin ices covering a broad range of length scales and topologies. Our work provides a platform to design arrays of correlated nanomagnets and to achieve all-electric control of planar logic gates and memory devices.</p>

Colossal grain growth yields single-crystal metal foils by contact-free annealing
<p>Single-crystal metals have distinctive properties owing to the absence of grain boundaries and strong anisotropy. Commercial single-crystal metals are usually synthesized by bulk crystal growth or by deposition of thin films onto substrates, and they are expensive and small. We prepared extremely large single-crystal metal foils by “contact-free annealing” from commercial polycrystalline foils. The colossal grain growth (up to 32 square centimeters) is achieved by minimizing contact stresses, resulting in a preferred in-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plane</span></strong> and out-of-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plane</span></strong> crystal orientation, and is driven by surface energy minimization during the rotation of the crystal lattice followed by “consumption” of neighboring grains. Industrial-scale production of single-crystal metal foils is possible as a result of this discovery.</p>

Giant polarization in super-tetragonal thin films through interphase strain
<p>Strain engineering has emerged as a powerful tool to enhance the performance of known functional materials. Here we demonstrate a general and practical method to obtain super-tetragonality and giant polarization using interphase strain. We use this method to create an out-of-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plane</span></strong>–to–in-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plane</span></strong> lattice parameter ratio of 1.238 in epitaxial composite thin films of tetragonal lead titanate (PbTiO<sub>3</sub>), compared to 1.065 in bulk. These thin films with super-tetragonal structure possess a giant remanent polarization, 236.3 microcoulombs per square centimeter, which is almost twice the value of known ferroelectrics. The super-tetragonal phase is stable up to 725°C, compared to the bulk transition temperature of 490°C. The interphase-strain approach could enhance the physical properties of other functional materials.</p>

Multivalent counterions diminish the lubricity of polyelectrolyte brushes
<p>Polyelectrolyte brushes provide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wear</span></strong> protection and lubrication in many technical, medical, physiological, and biological applications. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wear</span></strong> resistance and low friction are attributed to counterion osmotic pressure and the hydration layer surrounding the charged polymer segments. However, the presence of multivalent counterions in solution can strongly affect the interchain interactions and structural properties of brush layers. We evaluated the lubrication properties of polystyrene sulfonate brush layers sliding against each other in aqueous solutions containing increasing concentrations of counterions. The presence of multivalent ions (Y<sup>3+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Ba<sup>2+</sup>), even at minute concentrations, markedly increases the friction forces between brush layers owing to electrostatic bridging and brush collapse. Our results suggest that the lubricating properties of polyelectrolyte brushes in multivalent solution are hindered relative to those in monovalent solution.</p>

Neural scene representation and rendering
<p>Scene representation—the process of converting visual sensory data into concise descriptions—is a requirement for intelligent behavior. Recent work has shown that neural networks excel at this task when provided with large, labeled datasets. However, removing the reliance on human labeling remains an important open problem. To this end, we introduce the Generative Query Network (GQN), a framework within which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">machin</span></strong>es learn to represent scenes using only their own sensors. The GQN takes as input images of a scene taken from different viewpoints, constructs an internal representation, and uses this representation to predict the appearance of that scene from previously unobserved viewpoints. The GQN demonstrates representation learning without human labels or domain knowledge, paving the way toward <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">machin</span></strong>es that autonomously learn to understand the world around them.</p>

Predicting reaction performance in C–N cross-coupling using machine learning
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">machin</span></strong>e learning methods are becoming integral to scientific inquiry in numerous disciplines. We demonstrated that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">machin</span></strong>e learning can be used to predict the performance of a synthetic reaction in multidimensional chemical space using data obtained via high-throughput experimentation. We created scripts to compute and extract atomic, molecular, and vibrational descriptors for the components of a palladium-catalyzed Buchwald-Hartwig cross-coupling of aryl halides with 4-methylaniline in the presence of various potentially inhibitory additives. Using these descriptors as inputs and reaction yield as output, we showed that a random forest algorithm provides significantly improved predictive performance over linear regression analysis. The random forest model was also successfully applied to sparse training sets and out-of-sample prediction, suggesting its value in facilitating adoption of synthetic methodology.</p>

A whirling plane of satellite galaxies around Centaurus A challenges cold dark matter cosmology
<p>The Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies are each surrounded by a thin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plane</span></strong> of satellite dwarf galaxies that may be corotating. Cosmological simulations predict that most satellite galaxy systems are close to isotropic with random motions, so those two well-studied systems are often interpreted as rare statistical outliers. We test this assumption using the kinematics of satellite galaxies around the Centaurus A galaxy. Our statistical analysis reveals evidence for corotation in a narrow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plane</span></strong>: Of the 16 Centaurus A satellites with kinematic data, 14 follow a coherent velocity pattern aligned with the long axis of their spatial distribution. In standard cosmological simulations, <0.5% of Centaurus A–like systems show such behavior. Corotating satellite systems may be common in the universe, challenging small-scale structure formation in the prevailing cosmological paradigm.</p>

Crystal structure of a TAPBPR–MHC I complex reveals the mechanism of peptide editing in antigen presentation
<p>Central to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell–mediated immunity is the recognition of peptide–major histocompatibility complex class I (p–MHC I) proteins displayed by antigen-presenting cells. Chaperone-mediated loading of high-affinity peptides onto MHC I is a key step in the MHC I antigen presentation pathway. However, the structure of MHC I with a chaperone that facilitates peptide loading has not been determined. We report the crystal structure of MHC I in complex with the peptide editor TAPBPR (TAP-binding protein–related), a tapasin homolog. TAPBPR remodels the peptide-binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">groov</span></strong>e of MHC I, resulting in the release of low-affinity peptide. Changes include <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">groov</span></strong>e relaxation, modifications of key binding pockets, and domain adjustments. This structure captures a peptide-receptive state of MHC I and provides insights into the mechanism of peptide editing by TAPBPR and, by analogy, tapasin.</p>

Structure of the TAPBPR–MHC I complex defines the mechanism of peptide loading and editing
<p>Adaptive immunity is shaped by a selection of peptides presented on major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) molecules. The chaperones Tapasin (Tsn) and TAP-binding protein–related (TAPBPR) facilitate MHC I peptide loading and high-affinity epitope selection. Despite the pivotal role of Tsn and TAPBPR in controlling the hierarchical immune response, their catalytic mechanism remains unknown. Here, we present the x-ray structure of the TAPBPR–MHC I complex, which delineates the central step of catalysis. TAPBPR functions as peptide selector by remodeling the MHC I α2-1-helix region, stabilizing the empty binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">groov</span></strong>e, and inserting a loop into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">groov</span></strong>e that interferes with peptide binding. The complex explains how mutations in MHC I–specific chaperones cause defects in antigen processing and suggests a unifying mechanism of peptide proofreading.</p>

Transition from turbulent to coherent flows in confined three-dimensional active fluids
<p>Transport of fluid through a pipe is essential for the operation of macroscale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">machin</span></strong>es and microfluidic devices. Conventional fluids only flow in response to external pressure. We demonstrate that an active isotropic fluid, composed of microtubules and molecular motors, autonomously flows through meter-long three-dimensional channels. We establish control over the magnitude, velocity profile, and direction of the self-organized flows and correlate these to the structure of the extensile microtubule bundles. The inherently three-dimensional transition from bulk-turbulent to confined-coherent flows occurs concomitantly with a transition in the bundle orientational order near the surface and is controlled by a scale-invariant criterion related to the channel profile. The nonequilibrium transition of confined isotropic active fluids can be used to engineer self-organized soft <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">machin</span></strong>es.</p>

Active sites in heterogeneous ice nucleation—the example of K-rich feldspars
<p>Ice formation on aerosol particles is a process of crucial importance to Earth’s climate and the environmental sciences, but it is not understood at the molecular level. This is partly because the nature of active sites, local surface features where ice growth commences, is still unclear. Here we report direct electron-microscopic observations of deposition growth of aligned ice crystals on feldspar, an atmospherically important component of mineral dust. Our molecular-scale computer simulations indicate that this alignment arises from the preferential nucleation of prismatic crystal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plane</span></strong>s of ice on high-energy (100) surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plane</span></strong>s of feldspar. The microscopic patches of (100) surface, exposed at surface defects such as steps, cracks, and cavities, are thought to be responsible for the high ice nucleation efficacy of potassium (K)–feldspar particles.</p>

External rotation of the femoral component increases asymmetry of the posterior condyles
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The morphometry of the distal femur was largely studied to improve   bone-implant fit in total knee arthroplasty (TKA), but little is   known about the asymmetry of the posterior condyles.

The height and width of each condyle   were measured at the posterior femoral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong> in neutral position,   and in 3º and 5º of external rotation, using both central and medial   referencing systems.

Anterior knee pain and evidence of osteoarthritis of the patellofemoral joint should not be considered contraindications to mobile-bearing unicompartmental knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>It is not clear whether anterior knee pain and osteoarthritis   (OA) of the patellofemoral joint (PFJ) are contraindications to   medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA). Our aim was to   investigate the long-term outcome of a conse<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong>ive series of patients,   some of whom had anterior knee pain and PFJ OA managed with UKA.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We assessed the ten-year functional outcomes and 15-year implant   survival of 805 knees (677 patients) following medial mobile-bearing   UKA. The intra-operative status of the PFJ was documented and, with   the exception of bone loss with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">groov</span></strong>ing to the lateral side, neither   the clinical or radiological state of the PFJ nor the presence of   anterior knee pain were considered a contraindication. The impact   of radiographic findings and anterior knee pain was studied in a   subgroup of 100 knees (91 patients).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was no relationship between functional outcomes, at a mean   of ten years, or 15-year implant survival, and pre-operative anterior   knee pain, or the presence or degree of cartilage loss documented   intra-operatively at the medial patella or trochlea, or radiographic   evidence of OA in the medial side of the PFJ. In 6% of cases there   was full thickness cartilage loss on the lateral side of the patella.   In these cases, the overall ten-year function and 15-year survival   was similar to those without cartilage loss; however they had slightly   more difficulty with descending stairs.

Less   severe damage to the lateral side of the PFJ and damage to the medial   side, however severe, does not compromise the overall function or   survival, so should not be considered to be a contraindication. However,   if a patient does have full thickness cartilage loss on the lateral   side of the PFJ they may have a slight compromise in their ability   to descend stairs. Pre-operative anterior knee pain also does not   compromise the functional outcome or survival and should not be   considered to be a contraindication.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:632–9</p></sec>

We retrospectively studied the plain   radiographs and CT scans in 84 hips of 84 patients who underwent   primary THR. Intra- and inter-observer reliability were high for   the measurement of inclination and anteversion with all methods   on plain radiographs and CT scans.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Predictive Models of Spatial Transcriptional Response to High Salinity
<p>Plants are exposed to a variety of environmental conditions, and their ability to respond to environmental variation depends on the proper regulation of gene expression in an organ-, tissue-, and cell type-specific manner. Although our knowledge of how stress responses are regulated is accumulating, a genome-wide model of how plant transcription factors (TFs) and cis-regulatory elements control spatially specific stress response has yet to emerge. Using Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) as a model, we identified a set of 1,894 putative cis-regulatory elements (pCREs) that are associated with high-salinity (salt) up-regulated genes in the root or the shoot. We used these pCREs to develop computational models that can better predict salt up-regulated genes in the root and shoot compared with models based on known TF binding motifs. In addition, we incorporated TF binding sites identified via large-scale in vitro assays, chromatin accessibility, evolutionary conservation, and pCRE combinatorial relationships in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">machin</span></strong>e learning models and found that only consideration of pCRE combinations led to better performance in salt up-regulation prediction in the root and shoot. Our results suggest that the plant organ transcriptional response to high salinity is regulated by a core set of pCREs and provide a genome-wide view of the cis-regulatory code of plant spatial transcriptional responses to environmental stress.</p>

Illuminating the Base of the Annelid Tree Using Transcriptomics
<p>Annelida is one of three animal groups possessing segmentation and is central in considerations about the evolution of different character traits. It has even been proposed that the bilaterian ancestor resembled an annelid. However, a robust phylogeny of Annelida, especially with respect to the basal relationships, has been lacking. Our study based on transcriptomic data comprising 68,750–170,497 amino acid sites from 305 to 622 proteins resolves annelid relationships, including Chaetopteridae, Amphinomidae, Sipuncula, Oweniidae, and Magelonidae in the basal part of the tree. Myzostomida, which have been indicated to belong to the basal radiation as well, are now found deeply nested within Annelida as sister group to Errantia in most analyses. On the basis of our reconstruction of a robust annelid phylogeny, we show that the basal branching taxa include a huge variety of life styles such as tube dwelling and deposit feeding, endobenthic and burrowing, tubicolous and filter feeding, and errant and carnivorous forms. Ancestral character state reconstruction suggests that the ancestral annelid possessed a pair of either sensory or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">groov</span></strong>ed palps, bicellular eyes, biramous parapodia bearing simple chaeta, and lacked nuchal organs. Because the oldest fossil of Annelida is reported for Sipuncula (520 Ma), we infer that the early diversification of annelids took place at least in the Lower Cambrian.</p>

The prevention of a lateral hinge fracture as a complication of a medial opening wedge high tibial osteotomy
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We aimed to investigate factors related to the technique of medial   opening wedge high tibial osteotomy which might predispose to the   development of a lateral hinge fracture.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 71 patients with 82 osteotomies were included in the   study. Their mean age was 62.9 years (37 to 80). The classification   of the type of osteotomy was based on whether it extended beyond   the fibular head. The level of the osteotomy was classified according   to the height of its endpoint.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At a mean follow-up of 20 months (6 to 52), a total of 15 lateral   hinge fractures (18.3%) were identified. A sufficient osteotomy,   in which both anterior and posterior tibial cortices were involved   with extension into the lateral aspect of the plateau in relation   to an anteroposterior line tangential to the medial edge of the   fibular head in the CT axial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plane</span></strong>, was seen in 48 knees (71.6%)   in those without a lateral hinge fracture and in seven (46.7%) in   those with a lateral hinge fracture. An osteotomy which ended above   the level of the fibular head was seen in nine (13.4%) of the knees   without a lateral hinge fracture and seven (46.7%) of the those   with a lateral hinge fracture. There was a significant relationship   between the absence of a lateral hinge fracture and both a sufficient   osteotomy and one whose endpoint was at the level of the fibular   head (p = 0.0451 and p = 0.0214, respectively).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>A sufficient osteotomy involving both the anterior and posterior   cortices, whose endpoint is at the level of the fibular head, should   be performed when undertaking a medial opening wedge high tibial   osteotomy if a lateral hinge fracture is to be avoided as a complication.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:887–93.</p></sec>

Risk factors for wear-related failures after hip resurfacing in patients with a low contact patch to rim distance
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>A contact patch to rim (CPR) distance of < 10 mm has been   associated with edge-loading and excessive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wear</span></strong>. However, not all   arthroplasties with a low CPR distance show problems with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wear</span></strong>.   Therefore, CPR distance may not be the only variable affecting the   post-operative metal ion concentrations.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We used multiple logistic regression to determine what variables   differed between the patients who had high and low cobalt (CoS)   and chromium (CrS) serum ion concentrations within a cohort of patients   with low (< 10 mm) CPR distances. A total of 56 patients treated   with unilateral hip resurfacing arthroplasty (HRA) had CoS and CrS   ion studies performed more than one year after surgery. The mean   age of the patients at the time of surgery was 51.7 years (29 to   70), with 38 women (68%) and 18 men (32%).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>It was seen that 47 patients had low ion levels (< 7µg/L)   and nine had high ion levels (≥ 7µg/L). We found increased risks   of high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wear</span></strong> with decreasing CPR distance.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The use of CPR distance measurements to predict hips at risk   for elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wear</span></strong> is needed for all patients with HRA. We recommend   that patients with low CPR distances have at least one serum ion   study performed while patients with CPR distance > 10 mm do not   need routine ion studies. We believe that patients with low CPR   distance and low ions do not need repeat ion studies unless the   patient becomes symptomatic or has substantial radiographic changes.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:865–71.</p></sec>

Hypertrophy of the extra-articular tendon of the long head of biceps correlates with the location and size of a rotator cuff tear
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to assess hypertrophy of the extra-articular   tendon of the long head of biceps (LHB) in patients with a rotator   cuff tear.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The study involved 638 shoulders in 334 patients (175 men, 159   women, mean age 62.6 years; 25 to 81) with unilateral symptomatic   rotator cuff tears. The cross-sectional area (CSA) of the LHB tendon   in the bicipital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">groov</span></strong>e was measured pre-operatively in both shoulders   using ultrasound. There were 154 asymptomatic rotator cuff tears   in the contralateral shoulder. Comparisons were made between those   with a symptomatic tear, an asymptomatic tear and those with no   rotator cuff tear. In the affected shoulders, the CSAs were compared   in relation to the location and size of the rotator cuff tear. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean CSA was 21.0 mm<sup>2 </sup>(4 to 71) in those with   a symptomatic rotator cuff tear, 19.9 mm<sup>2</sup> (4 to 75) in   those with an asymptomatic rotator cuff tear and 14.1 mm<sup>2 </sup>(5   to 43) in those with no rotator cuff tear. The mean CSA in patients   with both symptomatic and asymptomatic rotator cuff tears was significantly   larger than in those with no rotator cuff tear (p < 0.001).

Oxidised zirconium <i>versus</i> cobalt alloy bearing surfaces in total knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We sought to establish whether an oxidised zirconium (OxZr) femoral   component causes less loss of polyethylene volume than a cobalt   alloy (CoCr) femoral component in total knee arthroplasty.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A total of 20 retrieved tibial inserts that had articulated with   OxZr components were matched with 20 inserts from CoCr articulations   for patient age, body mass index, length of implantation, and revision   diagnosis. Changes in dimensions of the articular surfaces were compared   with those of pristine inserts using laser scanning. The differences   in volume between the retrieved and pristine surfaces of the two   groups were calculated and compared.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The loss of polyethylene volume was 122 mm<sup>3</sup> (standard   deviation (<sc>sd</sc>) 87) in the OxZr group and 170 mm<sup>3</sup> (<sc>sd</sc> 96)   in the CoCr group (p = 0.033).

Mediolateral force distribution at the knee joint shifts across activities and is driven by tibiofemoral alignment
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Tibiofemoral alignment is important to determine the rate of   progression of osteoarthritis and implant survival after total knee   arthroplasty (TKA). Normally, surgeons aim for neutral tibiofemoral   alignment following TKA, but this has been questioned in recent   years. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether varus or valgus   alignment indeed leads to increased medial or lateral tibiofemoral   forces during static and dynamic weight-bearing activities.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Tibiofemoral contact forces and moments were measured in nine   patients with instrumented knee implants. Medial force ratios were   analysed during nine daily activities, including activities with   single-limb support (e.g. walking) and double-limb support (e.g.   knee bend). Hip-knee-ankle angles in the frontal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plane</span></strong> were analysed   using full-leg coronal radiographs. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The medial force ratio strongly correlated with the tibiofemoral   alignment in the static condition of one-legged stance (R² = 0.88)   and dynamic single-limb loading (R² = 0.59) with varus malalignment   leading to increased medial force ratios of up to 88%. In contrast,   the correlation between leg alignment and magnitude of medial compartment force   was much less pronounced. A lateral shift of force occurred during   activities with double-limb support and higher knee flexion angles. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The medial force ratio depends on both the tibiofemoral alignment   and the nature of the activity involved. It cannot be generalised   to a single value. Higher medial ratios during single-limb loading   are associated with varus malalignment in TKA. The current trend   towards a ‘constitutional varus’ after joint replacement, in terms   of overall tibiofemoral alignment, should be considered carefully   with respect to the increased medial force ratio.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:779–87.</p></sec>

Mid-term results of the BIOLOX delta ceramic-on-ceramic total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We conducted a prospective study of a delta ceramic total hip   arthroplasty (THA) to determine the rate of ceramic fracture, to   characterise post-operative noise, and to evaluate the mid-term   results and survivorship.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between March 2009 and March 2011, 274 patients (310 hips) underwent   cementless THA using a delta ceramic femoral head and liner. At   each follow-up, clinical and radiological outcomes were recorded.   A Kaplan-Meier analysis was undertaken to estimate survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Four patients (four hips) died and 18 patients (20 hips) were   lost to follow-up within five years. The remaining 252 patients   (286 hips) were followed for a mean of 66.5 months (60 to 84). There   were 144 men (166 hips) and 108 women (120 hips) with a mean age   of 49.7 years (16 to 83) at surgery. The mean pre-operative Harris   Hip Score of 47.1 points improved to 93.8 points at final follow-up.   Six patients reported squeaking in seven hips; however, none were   audible. Radiolucent lines involving Gruen zones one and/or seven   were seen in 52 hips (18.2%). No hip had detectable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wear</span></strong>, focal   osteolysis or signs of loosening. One hip was revised because of   fracture of the ceramic liner, which occurred due to an undetected   malseating of the ceramic liner at the time of surgery. One hip   was revised for a periprosthetic fracture of the femur, and one   hip was treated for periprosthetic joint infection. The six-year survivorship   with re-operation for any reason as the endpoint was 99.0% (95%   confidence interval 97.8% to 100%).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The rate of delta ceramic fracture was 0.3% (one of 286). While   ceramic head fracture was dominant in previous ceramic-on-ceramic   THA, fracture of the delta ceramic liner due to malseating is a   concern.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:741–8.</p></sec>

Radiographic scoring system for the evaluation of stability of cementless acetabular components in the presence of osteolysis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The stability of cementless acetabular components is an important   factor for surgical planning in the treatment of patients with pelvic   osteolysis after total hip arthroplasty (THA). However, the methods   for determining the stability of the acetabular component from pre-operative   radiographs remain controversial. Our aim was to develop a scoring   system to help in the assessment of the stability of the acetabular   component under these circumstances.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The new scoring system is based on the mechanism of failure of   these components and the location of the osteolytic lesion, according   to the DeLee and Charnley classification. Each zone is evaluated   and scored separately. The sum of the individual scores from the   three zones is reported as a total score with a maximum of 10 points.   The study involved 96 revision procedures which were undertaken   for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wear</span></strong> or osteolysis in 91 patients between July 2002 and December   2012. Pre-operative anteroposterior pelvic radiographs and Judet   views were reviewed. The stability of the acetabular component was   confirmed intra-operatively.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Intra-operatively, it was found that 64 components were well-fixed   and 32 were loose. Mean total scores in the well-fixed and loose   components were 2.9 (0 to 7) and 7.2 (1 to 10), respectively (p   < 0.001). In hips with a low score (0 to 2), the component was   only loose in one of 33 hips (3%). The incidence of loosening increased   with increasing scores: in those with scores of 3 and 4, two of   19 components (10.5%) were loose; in hips with scores of 5 and 6, eight   of 19 components (44.5%) were loose; in hips with scores of 7 or   8, 13 of 17 components (70.6%) were loose; and for hips with scores   of 9 and 10, nine of nine components (100%) were loose. Receiver-operating-characteristic curve   analysis demonstrated very good accuracy (area under the curve =   0.90, p < 0.001). The optimal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cut</span></strong>off point was a score of ≥ 5   with a sensitivity of 0.79, and a specificity of 0.87.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>There was a strong correlation between the scoring system and   the probability of loosening of a cementless acetabular component.   This scoring system provides a clinically useful tool for pre-operative   planning, and the evaluation of the outcome of revision surgery   for patients with loosening of a cementless acetabular component   in the presence of osteolysis.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:601–6.</p></sec>

Assessment of the equivalence of a generic to a branded femoral stem
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to compare the design of the generic   OptiStem XTR femoral stem with the established Exeter femoral stem.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We obtained five boxed, as manufactured, implants of both designs   at random (ten in total). Two examiners were blinded to the implant   design and independently measured the mass, volume, trunnion surface   topography, trunnion roughness, trunnion cone angle, Caput-Collum-Diaphyseal   (CCD) angle, femoral offset, stem length, neck length, and the width   and roughness of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polish</span></strong>ed stem shaft using peer-reviewed methods.   We then compared the stems using these parameters.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We found that the OptiStems were lighter (p < 0.001), had   a rougher trunnion surface (p < 0.001) with a greater spacing   and depth of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">machin</span></strong>ed threads (p < 0.001), had greater trunnion   cone angles (p = 0.007), and a smaller radius at the top of the   trunnion (p = 0.007).

Augmenting the osseointegration of endoprostheses using laser-sintered porous collars
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Massive endoprostheses rely on extra-cortical bone bridging (ECBB)   to enhance fixation. The aim of this study was to investigate the   role of selective laser sintered (SLS) porous collars in augmenting   the osseointegration of these prostheses.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The two novel designs of porous SLS collars, one with small pores   (Ø700 μm, SP) and one with large pores (Ø1500 μm, LP), were compared   in an ovine tibial diaphyseal model. Osseointegration of these collars   was compared with that of a clinically used solid, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">groov</span></strong>ed design   (G). At six months post-operatively, the ovine tibias were retrieved and   underwent radiological and histological analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Porous collars provided a significantly greater surface (p <   0.001) for the ingrowth of bone than the standard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">groov</span></strong>ed design.   Significantly greater extracortical pedicle formation was seen radiologically   around the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">groov</span></strong>ed design (length p = 0.002, thickness p < 0.001,   surface area p = 0.002) than around the porous collars. However,   the ingrowth of bone occurred from the transection site into the   porous structure of both types of collar. A fivefold increase in   integration was seen with the SP and a threefold increase in the   LP design when compared with G (p < 0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>SLS porous collars allow the direct ingrowth of more bone and   are better than current designs which rely on surface ongrowth and   ECBB.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:276–82.</p></sec>

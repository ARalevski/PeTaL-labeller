Proteome-Wide Analysis of Cysteine Reactivity during Effector-Triggered Immunity
<p>A surge in the accumulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ants generates shifts in the cellular redox potential during early stages of plant infection with pathogens and activation of effector-triggered immunity (ETI). The redoxome, defined as the proteome-wide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative modifications of proteins caused by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ants, has a well-known impact on stress responses in metazoans. However, the identity of proteins and the residues sensitive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation during the plant immune response remain largely unknown. Previous studies of the thimet oligopeptidases TOP1 and TOP2 placed them in the salicylic acid dependent branch of ETI, with a current model wherein TOPs sustain interconnected organellar and cytosolic pathways that modulate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative burst and development of cell death. Herein, we characterized the ETI redoxomes in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) wild-type Col-0 and <i>top1top2</i> mutant plants using a differential alkylation-based enrichment technique coupled with label-free mass spectrometry-based quantification. We identified cysteines sensitive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation in a wide range of protein families at multiple time points after pathogen infection. Differences were detected between Col-0 and <i>top1top2</i> redoxomes regarding the identity and number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized cysteines, and the amplitude of time-dependent fluctuations in protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation. Our results support a determining role for TOPs in maintaining the proper level and dynamics of proteome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation during ETI. This study significantly expands the repertoire of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation-sensitive plant proteins and can guide future mechanistic studies.</p>

Oxidation of Translation Factor EF-Tu Inhibits the Repair of Photosystem II<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The repair of photosystem II (PSII) is particularly sensitive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of repair is associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative damage to the translational elongation system in the cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion are unknown. We previously demonstrated in vitro that EF-Tu, a translation factor that delivers aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosome, is inactivated by reactive oxygen species via <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation of the Cys residue Cys-82. In this study, we examined the physiological role of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation of EF-Tu in <i>Synechocystis</i>. Under strong light, EF-Tu was rapidly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized to yield <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized monomers in vivo. We generated a <i>Synechocystis</i> transformant that expressed mutated EF-Tu in which Cys-82 had been replaced with a Ser residue. Under strong light, the de novo synthesis of proteins that are required for PSII repair, such as D1, was enhanced in the transformant and photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of PSII was alleviated. However, photodamage to PSII, measured in the presence of lincomycin, was similar between the transformant and wild-type cells, suggesting that expression of mutated EF-Tu might enhance the repair of PSII. Alleviating photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion through mutation of EF-Tu did not alter cell growth under strong light, perhaps due to the enhanced production of reactive oxygen species. These observations suggest that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation of EF-Tu under strong light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>s PSII repair, resulting in the stimulation of photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion.</p>

A unique type of GSK-3 inhibitor brings new opportunities to the clinic
<p>Development of protein kinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ors is a focus of many drug discovery programs. A major problem, however, is the limited specificity of the commonly used adenosine triphosphate–competitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ors and the weak <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of the more selective substrate-competitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ors. Glycogen synthase kinase–3 (GSK-3) is a promising drug target for treating neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but most GSK-3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ors have not reached the clinic. We describe a new type of GSK-3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>or, L807mts, that acts through a substrate-to-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>or conversion mechanism that occurs within the catalytic site of the enzyme. We determined that L807mts was a potent and highly selective GSK-3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>or with reasonable pharmacological and safety properties when tested in rodents. Treatment with L807mts enhanced the clearance of β-amyloid loads, reduced inflammation, enhanced autophagic flux, and improved cognitive and social skills in the 5XFAD AD mouse model. This new modality of GSK-3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion may be therapeutic in patients with AD or other central nervous system disorders associated with dysregulated GSK-3.</p>

Identification of a selective small-molecule inhibitor of type 1 adenylyl cyclase activity with analgesic properties
<p>Adenylyl cyclase 1 (AC1) belongs to a group of adenylyl cyclases (ACs) that are stimulated by calcium in a calmodulin-dependent manner. Studies with AC1 knockout mice suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ors of AC1 may be useful for treating pain and opioid dependence. However, nonselective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of AC isoforms could result in substantial adverse effects. We used chemical library screening to identify a selective AC1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>or with a chromone core structure that may represent a new analgesic agent. After demonstrating that the compound (ST034307) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed Ca<sup>2+</sup>-stimulated adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells stably transfected with AC1 (HEK-AC1 cells), we confirmed selectivity for AC1 by testing against all isoforms of membrane-bound ACs.

ST034307 reduced pain responses in a mouse model of inflammatory pain. Our data indicate that ST034307 is a selective small-molecule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>or of AC1 and suggest that selective AC1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ors may be useful for managing pain.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Carnosic Acid and Carnosol, Two Major Antioxidants of Rosemary, Act through Different Mechanisms
<p>Carnosic acid, a phenolic diterpene specific to the Lamiaceae family, is highly abundant in rosemary (<i>Rosmarinus officinalis</i>). Despite numerous industrial and medicinal/pharmaceutical applications of its anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative features, this compound in planta and its anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ant mechanism have received little attention, except a few studies of rosemary plants under natural conditions. In vitro analyses, using high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet and luminescence imaging, revealed that carnosic acid and its major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized derivative, carnosol, protect lipids from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation. Both compounds preserved linolenic acid and monogalactosyldiacylglycerol from singlet oxygen and from hydroxyl radical. When applied exogenously, they were both able to protect thylakoid membranes prepared from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves against lipid per<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation. Different levels of carnosic acid and carnosol in two contrasting rosemary varieties correlated with tolerance to lipid per<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation. Upon reactive oxygen species (ROS) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation of lipids, carnosic acid was consumed and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized into various derivatives, including into carnosol, while carnosol resisted, suggesting that carnosic acid is a chemical quencher of ROS. The anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative function of carnosol relies on another mechanism, occurring directly in the lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation process. Under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative conditions that did not involve ROS generation, carnosol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed lipid per<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation, contrary to carnosic acid. Using spin probes and electron paramagnetic resonance detection, we confirmed that carnosic acid, rather than carnosol, is a ROS quencher. Various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized derivatives of carnosic acid were detected in rosemary leaves in low light, indicating chronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation of this compound, and accumulated in plants exposed to stress conditions, in parallel with a loss of carnosic acid, confirming that chemical quenching of ROS by carnosic acid takes place in planta.</p>

Structure Annotation and Quantification of Wheat Seed Oxidized Lipids by High-Resolution LC-MS/MS
<p>Lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation is a process ubiquitous in life, but the direct and comprehensive analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized lipids has been limited by available analytical methods. We applied high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to quantify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized lipids (glycerides, fatty acids, phospholipids, lysophospholipids, and galactolipids) and implemented a platform-independent high-throughput-amenable analysis pipeline for the high-confidence annotation and acyl composition analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized lipids. Lipid contents of 90 different naturally aged wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) seed stocks were quantified in an untargeted high-resolution LC-MS experiment, resulting in 18,556 quantitative mass-to-charge ratio features. In a posthoc liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry experiment, high-resolution MS/MS spectra (5 mD accuracy) were recorded for 8,957 out of 12,080 putatively monoisotopic features of the LC-MS data set. A total of 353 non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized and 559 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized lipids with up to four additional oxygen atoms were annotated based on the accurate mass recordings (1.5 ppm tolerance) of the LC-MS data set and filtering procedures. MS/MS spectra available for 828 of these annotations were analyzed by translating experimentally known fragmentation rules of lipids into the fragmentation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized lipids. This led to the identification of 259 non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized and 365 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized lipids by both accurate mass and MS/MS spectra and to the determination of acyl compositions for 221 non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized and 295 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized lipids. Analysis of 15-year aged wheat seeds revealed increased lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation and hydrolysis in seeds stored in ambient versus cold conditions.</p>

Phenotypic Consequences of a Genetic Predisposition to Enhanced Nitric Oxide Signaling

What Quantity of Photosystem I Is Optimum for Safe Photosynthesis?
<p>PSI has the potential to generate reactive oxygen species and be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>atively inactivated by the reactive oxygen species. The photo-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative damage of PSI (also called PSI photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion) causes the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of the plant growth and is a lethal event for plants. It has been reported that PSI photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion does not occur as long as the reaction-center chlorophyll (P700) remains <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized, even in excess light conditions. This process is termed P700 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation and is supported by various regulatory mechanisms and likely also by the stoichiometric quantities of photosynthetic apparatus. In this study, we assessed how decreased photochemically active PSI in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) affected a variety of photosynthetic parameters, including P700 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation. Inactivation of PSI was rapidly and selectively induced by repetitive short-pulse illumination. PSI photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion correlated linearly with decreases in effective quantum yield of PSII and nonphotochemical quenching; however, the photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate was less affected, as exemplified by ∼50% of the normal CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate maintained with an 80% loss in PSI photochemical activity. In contrast, effective quantum yield of PSI was enhanced following PSI photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion, mainly owing to a decrease in the electron donor-side limitation of PSI. Based on these results, we propose that the stoichiometric quantity of PSI is optimized to induce P700 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation for dissipating excess light energy in PSI, thus avoiding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation caused by PSI photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion.</p>

Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 Induces Aortic Valve Calcification by Inhibiting Insulin-Like Growth Factor-1 Signaling in Valvular Interstitial Cells
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Calcification of the aortic valve leads to increased leaflet stiffness and consequently to the development of calcific aortic valve disease. However, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms of calcification remain unclear. Here, we identified that dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4, also known as CD26) increases valvular calcification and promotes calcific aortic valve disease progression.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We obtained the aortic valve tissues from humans and murine models (wild-type and endothelial nitric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e synthase-deficient-mice) and cultured the valvular interstitial cells (VICs) and valvular endothelial cells from the cusps.

After 12 weeks, we harvested the heart and evaluated the aortic valve tissue using immunohistochemistry.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We found that nitric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e depletion in human valvular endothelial cells activates NF-κB in human VICs.

Trans-inhibition of activation and proliferation signals by Fc receptors in mast cells and basophils
<p>Allergic and autoimmune inflammation are associated with the activation of mast cells and basophils by antibodies against allergens or auto-antigens, respectively. Both cell types express several receptors for the Fc portion of antibodies, the engagement of which by antigen-antibody complexes controls their responses. When aggregated on the plasma membrane, high-affinity immunoglobulin E (IgE) receptors (FcεRI) and low-affinity IgG receptors (FcγRIIIA in mice, FcγRIIA in humans) induce these cells to release and secrete proinflammatory mediators, chemokines, and cytokines that account for clinical symptoms. When coaggregated with activating receptors on the same cells, other low-affinity IgG receptors (FcγRIIB in both species) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong> mast cell and basophil activation. We found that FcγRIIB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed not only signals triggered by activating receptors with which they were coengaged (cis-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion), but also signals triggered by receptors engaged independently (trans-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion). Trans-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion acted upon the FcεRI-dependent activation of mouse mast cells, mouse basophils, and human basophils, and upon growth factor receptor (Kit)–dependent normal mouse mast cell proliferation, as well as the constitutive in vitro proliferation and the in vivo growth of oncogene (v-Abl)–transformed mastocytoma cells. Trans-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion was induced by receptors, whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ory (FcγRIIB) or activating (FcεRI), which recruited the lipid phosphatase SHIP1. By hydrolyzing PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>, SHIP1 induced a global unresponsiveness that affected biological responses triggered by receptors that use phosphoinositide 3-kinase to signal. These data suggest that trans-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion controls numerous physiological and pathological processes, and that it may be used as a therapeutic tool in inflammation, especially but not exclusively, in allergy and autoimmunity.</p>

Androgen receptor inhibitor–induced “BRCAness” and PARP inhibition are synthetically lethal for castration-resistant prostate cancer
<p>Cancers with loss-of-function mutations in <i>BRCA1</i> or <i>BRCA2</i> are deficient in the DNA damage repair pathway called homologous recombination (HR), rendering these cancers exquisitely vulnerable to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ors. This functional state and therapeutic sensitivity is referred to as “BRCAness” and is most commonly associated with some breast cancer types. Pharmaceutical induction of BRCAness could expand the use of PARP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ors to other tumor types. For example, <i>BRCA</i> mutations are present in only ~20% of prostate cancer patients. We found that castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells showed increased expression of a set of HR-associated genes, including <i>BRCA1</i>, <i>RAD54L</i>, and <i>RMI2</i>. Although androgen-targeted therapy is typically not effective in CRPC patients, the androgen receptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>or enzalutamide suppressed the expression of those HR genes in CRPC cells, thus creating HR deficiency and BRCAness. A “lead-in” treatment strategy, in which enzalutamide was followed by the PARP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>or olaparib, promoted DNA damage–induced cell death and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed clonal proliferation of prostate cancer cells in culture and suppressed the growth of prostate cancer xenografts in mice. Thus, antiandrogen and PARP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>or combination therapy may be effective for CRPC patients and suggests that pharmaceutically inducing BRCAness may expand the clinical use of PARP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ors.</p>

Flavan-3-ols Are an Effective Chemical Defense against Rust Infection
<p>Phenolic secondary metabolites are often thought to protect plants against attack by microbes, but their role in defense against pathogen infection in woody plants has not been investigated comprehensively. We studied the biosynthesis, occurrence, and antifungal activity of flavan-3-ols in black poplar (<i>Populus nigra</i>), which include both monomers, such as catechin, and oligomers, known as proanthocyanidins (PAs). We identified and biochemically characterized three leucoanthocyanidin reductases and two anthocyanidin reductases from <i>P. nigra</i> involved in catalyzing the last steps of flavan-3-ol biosynthesis, leading to the formation of catechin [2,3-trans-(+)-flavan-3-ol] and epicatechin [2,3-cis-(−)-flavan-3-ol], respectively. Poplar trees that were inoculated with the biotrophic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rust</span></strong> fungus (<i>Melampsora larici-populina</i>) accumulated higher amounts of catechin and PAs than uninfected trees. The de novo-synthesized catechin and PAs in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rust</span></strong>-infected poplar leaves accumulated significantly at the site of fungal infection in the lower epidermis. In planta concentrations of these compounds strongly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rust</span></strong> spore germination and reduced hyphal growth. Poplar genotypes with constitutively higher levels of catechin and PAs as well as hybrid aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus alba</i>) overexpressing the <i>MYB134</i> transcription factor were more resistant to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rust</span></strong> infection. Silencing <i>PnMYB134</i>, on the other hand, decreased flavan-3-ol biosynthesis and increased susceptibility to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rust</span></strong> infection. Taken together, our data indicate that catechin and PAs are effective antifungal defenses in poplar against foliar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rust</span></strong> infection.</p>

Nitric Oxide Modulates Histone Acetylation at Stress Genes by Inhibition of Histone Deacetylases
<p>Histone acetylation, which is an important mechanism to regulate gene expression, is controlled by the opposing action of histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (HDACs). In animals, several HDACs are subjected to regulation by nitric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e (NO); in plants, however, it is unknown whether NO affects histone acetylation. We found that treatment with the physiological NO donor <i>S</i>-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) increased the abundance of several histone acetylation marks in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), which was strongly diminished in the presence of the NO scavenger 2-4-carboxyphenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e. This increase was likely triggered by NO-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of HDAC activity, since GSNO and <i>S</i>-nitroso-<i>N</i>-acetyl-<sc>dl</sc>-penicillamine significantly and reversibly reduced total HDAC activity in vitro (in nuclear extracts) and in vivo (in protoplasts). Next, genome-wide H3K9/14ac profiles in Arabidopsis seedlings were generated by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, and changes induced by GSNO, GSNO/2-4-carboxyphenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e or trichostatin A (an HDAC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>or) were quantified, thereby identifying genes that display putative NO-regulated histone acetylation. Functional classification of these genes revealed that many of them are involved in the plant defense response and the abiotic stress response. Furthermore, salicylic acid, which is the major plant defense hormone against biotrophic pathogens, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed HDAC activity and increased histone acetylation by inducing endogenous NO production. These data suggest that NO affects histone acetylation by targeting and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ing HDAC complexes, resulting in the hyperacetylation of specific genes. This mechanism might operate in the plant stress response by facilitating the stress-induced transcription of genes.</p>

Regulation of succinate-fuelled mitochondrial respiration in liver and skeletal muscle of hibernating thirteen-lined ground squirrels
<p>Hibernating ground squirrels (<i>Ictidomys tridecemlineatus</i>) alternate between two distinct metabolic states throughout winter: torpor, during which metabolic rate (MR) and body temperature (<i>T</i><sub>b</sub>) are considerably suppressed, and interbout euthermia (IBE), during which MR and <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> briefly return to euthermic levels. Previous studies showed suppression of succinate-fuelled respiration during torpor in liver and skeletal muscle mitochondria; however, these studies used only a single, saturating succinate concentration. Therefore, they could not address whether mitochondrial metabolic suppression occurs under physiological substrate concentrations or whether differences in the kinetics of mitochondrial responses to changing substrate concentration might also contribute to mitochondrial metabolic regulation during torpor. The present study confirmed that succinate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation is reduced during torpor in liver and skeletal muscle at 37 and 10°C over a 100-fold range of succinate concentrations. At 37°C, this suppression resulted from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), which had a greater affinity for oxaloacetate (an SDH <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>or) during torpor. At 10°C, SDH was not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed, suggesting that SDH <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion initiates but does not maintain mitochondrial suppression during torpor. Moreover, in both liver and skeletal muscle, mitochondria from torpid animals maintained relatively higher respiration rates at low succinate concentrations, which reduces the extent of energy savings that can be achieved during torpor, but may also maintain mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative capacity above some lower critical threshold, thereby preventing cellular and/or mitochondrial injury during torpor and facilitating rapid recruitment of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative capacity during arousal.</p>

Targeting NOTCH activation in small cell lung cancer through LSD1 inhibition
<p>Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a recalcitrant, aggressive neuroendocrine-type cancer for which little change to first-line standard-of-care treatment has occurred within the last few decades. Unlike nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), SCLC harbors few actionable mutations for therapeutic intervention. Lysine-specific histone demethylase 1A (LSD1 also known as KDM1A) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ors were previously shown to have selective activity in SCLC models, but the underlying mechanism was elusive. Here, we found that exposure to the selective LSD1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>or ORY-1001 activated the NOTCH pathway, resulting in the suppression of the transcription factor ASCL1 and the repression of SCLC tumorigenesis. Our analyses revealed that LSD1 bound to the <i>NOTCH1</i> locus, thereby suppressing NOTCH1 expression and downstream signaling. Reactivation of NOTCH signaling with the LSD1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>or reduced the expression of ASCL1 and neuroendocrine cell lineage genes. Knockdown studies confirmed the pharmacological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>or-based results. In vivo, sensitivity to LSD1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion in SCLC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models correlated with the extent of consequential NOTCH pathway activation and repression of a neuroendocrine phenotype. Complete and durable tumor regression occurred with ORY-1001–induced NOTCH activation in a chemoresistant PDX model. Our findings reveal how LSD1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ors function in this tumor and support their potential as a new and targeted therapy for SCLC.</p>

Skp2-dependent reactivation of AKT drives resistance to PI3K inhibitors
<p>The PI3K-AKT kinase signaling pathway is frequently deregulated in human cancers, particularly breast cancer, where amplification and somatic mutations of <i>PIK3CA</i> occur with high frequency in patients. Numerous small-molecule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ors targeting both PI3K and AKT are under clinical evaluation, but dose-limiting toxicities and the emergence of resistance limit therapeutic efficacy. Various resistance mechanisms to PI3K <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ors have been identified, including de novo mutations, feedback activation of AKT, or cross-talk pathways. We found a previously unknown resistance mechanism to PI3K pathway <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion that results in AKT rebound activation. In a subset of triple-negative breast cancer cell lines, treatment with a PI3K <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>or or depletion of <i>PIK3CA</i> expression ultimately promoted AKT reactivation in a manner dependent on the E3 ubiquitin ligase Skp2, the kinases IGF-1R (insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor) and PDK-1 (phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1), and the cell growth and metabolism-regulating complex mTORC2 (mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2), but was independent of PI3K activity or PIP<sub>3</sub> production. Resistance to PI3K <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ors correlated with the increased abundance of Skp2, ubiquitylation of AKT, cell proliferation in culture, and xenograft tumor growth in mice. These findings reveal a ubiquitin signaling feedback mechanism by which PI3K <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>or resistance may emerge in aggressive breast cancer cells.</p>

A silicon Brillouin laser
<p>Brillouin laser oscillators offer powerful and flexible dynamics as the basis for mode-locked lasers, microwave oscillators, and optical gyroscopes in a variety of optical systems. However, Brillouin interactions are markedly weak in conventional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silicon</span></strong> photonic waveguides, stifling progress toward <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silicon</span></strong>-based Brillouin lasers.

Highly elastic binders integrating polyrotaxanes for silicon microparticle anodes in lithium ion batteries
<p>Lithium-ion batteries with ever-increasing energy densities are needed for batteries for advanced devices and all-electric vehicles. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silicon</span></strong> has been highlighted as a promising <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anod</span></strong>e material because of its superior specific capacity.

This limits cycle life via particle pulverization and an unstable electrode-electrolyte interface, especially when the particle sizes are in the micrometer range.

Jasmonic Acid Inhibits Auxin-Induced Lateral Rooting Independently of the CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 Receptor
<p>Plant root systems are indispensable for water uptake, nutrient acquisition, and anchoring plants in the soil. Previous studies using auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ors definitively established that auxin plays a central role regulating root growth and development. Most auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ors affect all auxin signaling at the same time, which obscures an understanding of individual events. Here, we report that jasmonic acid (JA) functions as a lateral root (LR)-preferential auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>or in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) in a manner that is independent of the JA receptor, CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 (COI1). Treatment of wild-type Arabidopsis with either (−)-JA or (+)-JA reduced primary root length and LR number; the reduction of LR number was also observed in <i>coi1</i> mutants. Treatment of seedlings with (−)-JA or (+)-JA suppressed auxin-inducible genes related to LR formation, diminished accumulation of the auxin reporter <i>DR5::GUS</i>, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed auxin-dependent DII-VENUS degradation. A structural mimic of (−)-JA and (+)-coronafacic acid also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed LR formation and stabilized DII-VENUS protein. COI1-independent activity was retained in the double mutant of <i>transport <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>or response1</i> and <i>auxin signaling f-box protein2</i> (<i>tir1 afb2</i>) but reduced in the <i>afb5</i> single mutant. These results reveal JAs and (+)-coronafacic acid to be selective counter-auxins, a finding that could lead to new approaches for studying the mechanisms of LR formation.</p>

A Maternally Deposited Endosperm Cuticle Contributes to the Physiological Defects of <i>transparent testa</i> Seeds
<p>Mature dry seeds are highly resilient plant structures where the encapsulated embryo is kept protected and dormant to facilitate its ultimate dispersion. Seed viability is heavily dependent on the seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>’s capacity to shield living tissues from mechanical and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>, also called the testa, arises after the differentiation of maternal ovular integuments during seed development. We recently described a thick cuticle tightly embedded in the mature seed’s endosperm cell wall. We show here that it is produced by the maternal inner integument 1 layer and, remarkably, transferred to the developing endosperm. Arabidopsis <i>transparent testa</i> (<i>tt</i>) mutations cause maternally derived seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> pigmentation defects. <i>TT</i> gene products encode proteins involved in flavonoid metabolism and regulators of seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> development. <i>tt</i> mutants have abnormally high seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> permeability, resulting in lower seed viability and dormancy. However, the biochemical basis of this high permeability is not fully understood. We show that the cuticles of developing <i>tt</i> mutant integuments have profound structural defects, which are associated with enhanced cuticle permeability. Genetic analysis indicates that a functional proanthocyanidin synthesis pathway is required to limit cuticle permeability, and our results suggest that proanthocyanidins could be intrinsic components of the cuticle. Together, these results show that the formation of a maternal cuticle is an intrinsic part of the normal integumental differentiation program leading to testa formation and is essential for the seed’s physiological properties.</p>

<i>MYB52</i> Negatively Regulates Pectin Demethylesterification in Seed Coat Mucilage
<p>Pectin, which is a major component of the plant primary cell walls, is synthesized and methyl-esterified in the Golgi apparatus and then demethylesterified by pectin methylesterases (PMEs) located in the cell wall. The degree of methylesterification affects the functional properties of pectin, and thereby influences plant growth, development and defense. However, little is known about the mechanisms that regulate pectin demethylesterification. Here, we show that in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> mucilage, the absence of the <i>MYB52</i> transcription factor is correlated with an increase in PME activity and a decrease in the degree of pectin methylesterification. Decreased methylesterification in the <i>myb52</i> mutant is also correlated with an increase in the calcium content of the seed mucilage. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis and molecular genetic studies suggest that <i>MYB52</i> transcriptionally activates <i>PECTIN METHYLESTERASE INHIBITOR6</i> (<i>PMEI6</i>), <i>PMEI14</i>, and <i>SUBTILISIN-LIKE SER PROTEASE1.7</i> (<i>SBT1.7</i>) by binding to their promoters. <i>PMEI6</i> and <i>SBT1.7</i> have previously been shown to be involved in seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> mucilage demethylesterification. Our characterization of two <i>PMEI14</i> mutants suggests that PMEI14 has a role in seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> mucilage demethylesterification, although its activity may be confined to the seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> in contrast to PMEI6, which functions in the whole seed. Our demonstration that <i>MYB52</i> negatively regulates pectin demethylesterification in seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> mucilage, and the identification of components of the molecular network involved, provides new insight into the regulatory mechanism controlling pectin demethylesterification and increases our understanding of the transcriptional regulation network involved in seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> mucilage formation.</p>

Jasmonic Acid Enhances Al-Induced Root Growth Inhibition<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>Phytohormones such as ethylene and auxin are involved in the regulation of the aluminum (Al)-induced root growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion. Although jasmonate (JA) has been reported to play a crucial role in the regulation of root growth and development in response to environmental stresses through interplay with ethylene and auxin, its role in the regulation of root growth response to Al stress is not yet known. In an attempt to elucidate the role of JA, we found that exogenous application of JA enhanced the Al-induced root growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion. Furthermore, phenotype analysis with mutants defective in either JA biosynthesis or signaling suggests that JA is involved in the regulation of Al-induced root growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion. The expression of the JA receptor CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 (COI1) and the key JA signaling regulator MYC2 was up-regulated in response to Al stress in the root tips. This process together with COI1-mediated Al-induced root growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion under Al stress was controlled by ethylene but not auxin. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that many responsive genes under Al stress were regulated by JA signaling. The differential responsive of microtubule organization-related genes between the wild-type and <i>coi1-2</i> mutant is consistent with the changed depolymerization of cortical microtubules in <i>coi1</i> under Al stress. In addition, ALMT-mediated malate exudation and thus Al exclusion from roots in response to Al stress was also regulated by COI1-mediated JA signaling. Together, this study suggests that root growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion is regulated by COI1-mediated JA signaling independent from auxin signaling and provides novel insights into the phytohormone-mediated root growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion in response to Al stress.</p>

Ferredoxin:NADP(H) Oxidoreductase Abundance and Location Influences Redox Poise and Stress Tolerance
<p>In linear photosynthetic electron transport, ferredoxin:NADP(H) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>oreductase (FNR) transfers electrons from ferredoxin (Fd) to NADP<sup>+</sup>. Both NADPH and reduced Fd (Fd<sup>red</sup>) are required for reductive assimilation and light/dark activation/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deactiv</span></strong>ation of enzymes. FNR is therefore a hub, connecting photosynthetic electron transport to chloroplast redox metabolism. A correlation between FNR content and tolerance to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress is well established, although the precise mechanism remains unclear. We investigated the impact of altered FNR content and localization on electron transport and super<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e radical evolution in isolated thylakoids, and probed resulting changes in redox homeostasis, expression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress markers, and tolerance to high light in planta. Our data indicate that the ratio of Fd<sup>red</sup> to FNR is critical, with either too much or too little FNR potentially leading to increased super<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e production, and perception of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress at the level of gene transcription. In FNR overexpressing plants, which show more NADP(H) and glutathione pools, improved tolerance to high-light stress indicates that disturbance of chloroplast redox poise and increased free radical generation may help “prime” the plant and induce protective mechanisms. In <i>fnr1</i> knock-outs, the NADP(H) and glutathione pools are more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized relative to the wild type, and the photoprotective effect is absent despite perception of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress at the level of gene transcription.</p>

Interleukin-10 Inhibits Bone Marrow Fibroblast Progenitor Cell–Mediated Cardiac Fibrosis in Pressure-Overloaded Myocardium

Furthermore, WT bone marrow (from enhanced green fluorescent protein mice) transplantation in bone marrow–depleted IL10KO mice (IL10KO chimeric mice) reduced transverse aortic constriction–induced BM-FPC mobilization compared with IL10KO mice. Green fluorescent protein costaining with α-smooth muscle actin or collagen 1α in left ventricular tissue sections of IL10KO chimeric mice suggests that myofibroblasts were derived from bone marrow after transverse aortic constriction. Finally, WT bone marrow transplantation in IL10KO mice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed transverse aortic constriction–induced cardiac fibrosis and improved heart function. At the molecular level, IL10 treatment significantly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed transforming growth factor-β–induced transdifferentiation and fibrotic signaling in WT BM-FPCs in vitro. Furthermore, fibrosis-associated microRNA (miRNA) expression was highly upregulated in IL10KO-FPCs compared with WT-FPCs.

The level of endothelial senescence was assessed as senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity using flow cytometry, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress using the redox-sensitive probe dihydroethidium, tissue factor activity using an enzymatic Tenase assay, the level of target protein expression by Western blot analysis, platelet aggregation using an aggregometer, and shear stress using a cone-and-plate viscometer.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Senescence, as assessed by senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, was induced by the passaging of porcine coronary artery ECs from passage P1 to P4, and was associated with a progressive shedding of procoagulant MPs. Exposure of P1 ECs to MPs shed from senescent P3 cells or circulating MPs from ACS patients induced increased senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress, early phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and Akt, and upregulation of p53, p21, and p16. Ex vivo, the prosenescent effect of circulating MPs from ACS patients was evidenced only under conditions of low shear stress. Depletion of endothelial-derived MPs from ACS patients reduced the induction of senescence. Prosenescent MPs promoted EC thrombogenicity through tissue factor upregulation, shedding of procoagulant MPs, endothelial nitric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e synthase downregulation, and reduced nitric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e–mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of platelet aggregation. These MPs exhibited angiotensin-converting enzyme activity and upregulated AT1 receptors and angiotensin-converting enzyme in P1 ECs.

Augmentation of Muscle Blood Flow by Ultrasound Cavitation Is Mediated by ATP and Purinergic Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Augmentation of tissue blood flow by therapeutic ultrasound is thought to rely on convective shear. Microbubble contrast agents that undergo ultrasound-mediated cavitation markedly amplify these effects. We hypothesized that purinergic signaling is responsible for shear-dependent increases in muscle perfusion during therapeutic cavitation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Unilateral exposure of the proximal hindlimb of mice (with or without ischemia produced by iliac ligation) to therapeutic ultrasound (1.3 MHz, mechanical index 1.3) was performed for 10 minutes after intravenous injection of 2×10<sup>8</sup> lipid microbubbles. Microvascular perfusion was evaluated by low-power contrast ultrasound perfusion imaging. In vivo muscle ATP release and in vitro ATP release from endothelial cells or erythrocytes were assessed by a luciferin-luciferase assay. Purinergic signaling pathways were assessed by studying interventions that (1) accelerated ATP degradation; (2) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed P2Y receptors, adenosine receptors, or K<sub>ATP</sub> channels; or (3) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed downstream signaling pathways involving endothelial nitric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e synthase or prostanoid production (indomethacin). Augmentation in muscle perfusion by ultrasound cavitation was assessed in a proof-of-concept clinical trial in 12 subjects with stable sickle cell disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Therapeutic ultrasound cavitation increased muscle perfusion by 7-fold in normal mice, reversed tissue ischemia for up to 24 hours in the murine model of peripheral artery disease, and doubled muscle perfusion in patients with sickle cell disease. Augmentation in flow extended well beyond the region of ultrasound exposure. Ultrasound cavitation produced an ≈40-fold focal and sustained increase in ATP, the source of which included both endothelial cells and erythrocytes. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ory studies indicated that ATP was a critical mediator of flow augmentation that acts primarily through either P2Y receptors or adenosine produced by ectonucleotidase activity. Combined indomethacin and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of endothelial nitric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e synthase abolished the effects of therapeutic ultrasound, indicating downstream signaling through both nitric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e and prostaglandins.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Therapeutic ultrasound using microbubble cavitation to increase muscle perfusion relies on shear-dependent increases in ATP, which can act through a diverse portfolio of purinergic signaling pathways. These events can reverse hindlimb ischemia in mice for >24 hours and increase muscle blood flow in patients with sickle cell disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Inhibition of Aberrant MicroRNA-133a Expression in Endothelial Cells by Statin Prevents Endothelial Dysfunction by Targeting GTP Cyclohydrolase 1 in Vivo

MicroRNAs (miRs) are a class of regulatory RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression. We investigated whether statins prevent endothelial dysfunction via miR-dependent GCH1 upregulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Endothelial function was assessed by measuring acetylcholine-induced vasorelaxation in the organ chamber. MiR-133a expression was assessed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and fluorescence in situ hybridization.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We first demonstrated that GCH1 mRNA is a target of miR-133a. In endothelial cells, miR-133a was robustly induced by cytokines/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ants and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed by lovastatin. Furthermore, lovastatin upregulated GCH1 and tetrahydrobiopterin, and recoupled endothelial nitric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e synthase in stressed endothelial cells. These actions of lovastatin were abolished by enforced miR-133a expression and were mirrored by a miR-133a antagomir. In mice, hyperlipidemia- or hyperglycemia-induced ectopic miR-133a expression in the vascular endothelium, reduced GCH1 protein and tetrahydrobiopterin levels, and impaired endothelial function, which were reversed by lovastatin or miR-133a antagomir. These beneficial effects of lovastatin in mice were abrogated by in vivo miR-133a overexpression or GCH1 knockdown. In rats, multiple cardiovascular risk factors including hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and hyperhomocysteinemia resulted in increased miR-133a vascular expression, reduced GCH1 expression, uncoupled endothelial nitric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e synthase function, and induced endothelial dysfunction, which were prevented by lovastatin.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Statin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>s aberrant miR-133a expression in the vascular endothelium to prevent endothelial dysfunction by targeting GCH1. Therefore, miR-133a represents an important therapeutic target for preventing cardiovascular diseases.</p></sec>

The nociceptin receptor inhibits axonal regeneration and recovery from spinal cord injury
<p>Axonal growth after traumatic spinal cord injury is limited by endogenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ors, selective blockade of which promotes partial neurological recovery. The partial repair phenotypes suggest that compensatory pathways limit improvement. Gene expression profiles of mice deficient in <i>Ngr1</i>, which encodes a receptor for myelin-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ors of axonal regeneration such as Nogo, revealed that trauma increased the mRNA expression of <i>ORL1</i>, which encodes the receptor for the opioid-related peptide nociceptin. Endogenous and overexpressed ORL1 coimmunoprecipitated with immature NgR1 protein, and ORL1 enhanced the O-linked glycosylation and surface expression of NgR1 in HEK293T and Neuro2A cells and primary neurons. ORL1 overexpression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed cortical neuron axon regeneration independently of NgR1. Furthermore, regeneration was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed by an ORL1 agonist and enhanced by the ORL1 antagonist J113397 through a ROCK-dependent mechanism. Mice treated with J113397 after dorsal hemisection of the mid-thoracic spinal cord recovered greater locomotor function and exhibited lumbar raphespinal axon sprouting. These effects were further enhanced by combined <i>Ngr1</i> deletion and ORL1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion. Thus, ORL1 limits neural repair directly and indirectly by enhancing NgR1 maturation, and ORL1 antagonists enhance recovery from traumatic CNS injuries in wild-type and <i>Ngr1</i> null mice.</p>

ATM directs DNA damage responses and proteostasis via genetically separable pathways
<p>The protein kinase ATM is a master regulator of the DNA damage response but also responds directly to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress. Loss of ATM causes ataxia telangiectasia, a neurodegenerative disorder with pleiotropic symptoms that include cerebellar dysfunction, cancer, diabetes, and premature aging. We genetically separated the activation of ATM by DNA damage from that by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress using separation-of-function mutations. We found that deficient activation of ATM by the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex and DNA double-strand breaks resulted in loss of cell viability, checkpoint activation, and DNA end resection in response to DNA damage. In contrast, loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative activation of ATM had minimal effects on DNA damage–related outcomes but blocked ATM-mediated initiation of checkpoint responses after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress and resulted in deficiencies in mitochondrial function and autophagy. In addition, expression of a variant ATM incapable of activation by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress resulted in widespread protein aggregation. These results indicate a direct relationship between the mechanism of ATM activation and its effects on cellular metabolism and DNA damage responses in human cells and implicate ATM in the control of protein homeostasis.</p>

MEK inhibitor trametinib does not prevent the growth of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)–addicted neuroblastomas
<p>Activation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway is implicated in driving the initiation and progression of multiple cancers. Several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ors targeting the RAS-MAPK pathway are clinically approved as single- or polyagent therapies for patients with specific types of cancer. One example is the MEK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>or trametinib, which is included as a rational polytherapy strategy for treating EML4-ALK–positive, EGFR-activated, or KRAS-mutant lung cancers and neuroblastomas that also contain activating mutations in the RAS-MAPK pathway. In addition, in neuroblastoma, a heterogeneous disease, relapse cases display an increased rate of mutations in <i>ALK</i>, <i>NRAS</i>, and <i>NF1</i>, leading to increased activation of RAS-MAPK signaling. Co-targeting ALK and the RAS-MAPK pathway is an attractive option, because monotherapies have not yet produced effective results in ALK-addicted neuroblastoma patients. We evaluated the response of neuroblastoma cell lines to MEK-ERK pathway <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion by trametinib. In contrast to RAS-MAPK pathway-mutated neuroblastoma cell lines, ALK-addicted neuroblastoma cells treated with trametinib showed increased activation (inferred by phosphorylation) of the kinases AKT and ERK5. This feedback response was mediated by the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2–associated protein SIN1, resulting in increased survival and proliferation that depended on AKT signaling. In xenografts in mice, trametinib <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed the growth of EML4-ALK–positive non–small cell lung cancer and RAS-mutant neuroblastoma but not ALK-addicted neuroblastoma. Thus, our results advise against the seemingly rational option of using MEK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ors to treat ALK-addicted neuroblastoma.</p>

Differential abundance of CK1α provides selectivity for pharmacological CK1α activators to target WNT-dependent tumors
<p>Constitutive WNT activity drives the growth of various human tumors, including nearly all colorectal cancers (CRCs). Despite this prominence in cancer, no WNT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>or is currently approved for use in the clinic largely due to the small number of druggable signaling components in the WNT pathway and the substantial toxicity to normal gastrointestinal tissue. We have shown that pyrvinium, which activates casein kinase 1α (CK1α), is a potent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>or of WNT signaling. However, its poor bioavailability limited the ability to test this first-in-class WNT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>or in vivo. We characterized a novel small-molecule CK1α activator called SSTC3, which has better pharmacokinetic properties than pyrvinium, and found that it <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed the growth of CRC xenografts in mice. SSTC3 also attenuated the growth of a patient-derived metastatic CRC xenograft, for which few therapies exist. SSTC3 exhibited minimal gastrointestinal toxicity compared to other classes of WNT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ors. Consistent with this observation, we showed that the abundance of the SSTC3 target, CK1α, was decreased in WNT-driven tumors relative to normal gastrointestinal tissue, and knocking down CK1α increased cellular sensitivity to SSTC3. Thus, we propose that distinct CK1α abundance provides an enhanced therapeutic index for pharmacological CK1α activators to target WNT-driven tumors.</p>

A liquid metal reaction environment for the room-temperature synthesis of atomically thin metal oxides

Auxin Efflux Carrier ZmPGP1 Mediates Root Growth Inhibition under Aluminum Stress
<p>Auxin has been shown to enhance root growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion under aluminum (Al) stress in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). However, in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), auxin may play a negative role in the Al-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of root growth. In this study, we identified mutants deficient in the maize auxin efflux carrier P-glycoprotein (ZmPGP1) after ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis and used them to elucidate the contribution of ZmPGP1 to Al-induced root growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion. Root growth in the <i>zmpgp1</i> mutant, which forms shortened roots and is hyposensitive to auxin, was less <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed by Al stress than that in the inbred line B73. In the <i>zmpgp1</i> mutants, the root tips displayed higher auxin accumulation and enhanced auxin signaling under Al stress, which was also consistent with the increased expression of auxin-responsive genes. Based on the behavior of the auxin-responsive marker transgene, <i>DR5rev:RFP</i>, we concluded that Al stress reduced the level of auxin in the root tip, which contrasts with the tendency of Al stress-induced Arabidopsis plants to accumulate more auxin in their root tips. In addition, Al stress induced the expression of <i>ZmPGP1</i>. Therefore, in maize, Al stress is associated with reduced auxin accumulation in root tips, a process that is regulated by ZmPGP1 and thus causes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of root growth. This study provides further evidence about the role of auxin and auxin polar transport in Al-induced root growth regulation in maize.</p>

Biotin Attachment Domain-Containing Proteins Irreversibly Inhibit Acetyl CoA Carboxylase
<p>The first committed step in fatty acid synthesis is mediated by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase), a biotin-dependent enzyme that carboxylates acetyl-CoA to produce malonyl-CoA. ACCase can be feedback regulated by short-term or long-term exposure to fatty acids in the form of Tween 80 (predominantly containing oleic acid), which results in reversible or irreversible ACCase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion, respectively. Biotin attachment domain-containing (BADC) proteins are inactive analogs of biotin carboxyl transfer proteins that lack biotin, and their incorporation into ACCase down-regulates its activity by displacing active (biotin-containing) biotin carboxyltransferase protein subunits. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) lines containing T-DNA insertions in <i>BADC1</i>, <i>BADC2</i>, and <i>BADC3</i> were used to generate <i>badc1 badc2</i> and <i>badc1 badc3</i> double mutants. The <i>badc1 badc3</i> mutant exhibited normal growth and development; however, ACCase activity was 26% higher in <i>badc1 badc3</i> and its seeds contained 30.1% more fatty acids and 32.6% more triacylgycerol relative to wild-type plants. To assess whether BADC contributes to the irreversible phase of ACCase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion, cell suspension cultures were generated from the leaves of <i>badc1 badc3</i> and wild-type plants and treated with 10 m<sc>m</sc> Tween 80. Reversible ACCase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion was similar in <i>badc1 badc3</i> and wild-type cultures after 2 d of Tween 80 treatment, but irreversible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion was reduced by 50% in <i>badc1 badc3</i> relative to wild-type plants following 4 d of Tween 80 treatment. In this study, we present evidence for two important homeostatic roles for BADC proteins in down-regulating ACCase activity: by acting during normal growth and development and by contributing to its long-term irreversible feedback <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion resulting from the oversupply of fatty acids.</p>

A Pectin Methylesterase Inhibitor Enhances Resistance to <i>Verticillium</i> Wilt
<p>Pectins are major components of the primary plant cell wall, which functions as the primary barrier against pathogens. Pectin methylesterases (PMEs) catalyze the demethylesterification of the homogalacturonan domains of pectin in the plant cell wall. Their activity is regulated by PME <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ors (PMEIs). Here, we provide evidence that the pectin methylesterase-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ing protein GhPMEI3 from cotton (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>) functions in plant responses to infection by the fungus <i>Verticillium dahliae</i>. GhPMEI3 interacts with PMEs and regulates the expression of a specific fungal polygalacturonase (VdPG1). Ectopic expression of GhPMEI3 increased pectin methyl esterification and limited fungal disease in cotton, while also modulating root elongation. Enzymatic analyses revealed that GhPMEI3 efficiently <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed the activity of cotton GhPME2/GhPME31. Experiments using transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants expressing the <i>GhPMEI3</i> gene under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter revealed that GhPMEI3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>s the endogenous PME activity in vitro. Moreover, the enhanced resistance to <i>V. dahliae</i> was associated with altered <i>VdPG1</i> expression. Virus-induced silencing of <i>GhPMEI3</i> resulted in increased susceptibility to <i>V. dahliae</i>. Further, we investigated the interaction between GhPMEI3 and GhPME2/GhPME31 using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion assays and molecular docking simulations. The peculiar structural features of GhPMEI3 were responsible for the formation of a 1:1 stoichiometric complex with GhPME2/GhPME31. Together, these results suggest that GhPMEI3 enhances resistance to <i>Verticillium</i> wilt. Moreover, GhPMEI3-GhPMEs interactions would be needed before drawing the correlation between structure-function and are crucial for plant development against the ever-evolving fungal pathogens.</p>

Cytosolic and Chloroplastic DHARs Cooperate in Oxidative Stress-Driven Activation of the Salicylic Acid Pathway
<p>The complexity of plant anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative systems gives rise to many unresolved questions. One relates to the functional importance of dehydroascorbate reductases (DHARs) in interactions between ascorbate and glutathione. To investigate this issue, we produced a complete set of loss-of-function mutants for the three annotated Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) DHARs. The combined loss of <i>DHAR1</i> and <i>DHAR3</i> expression decreased extractable activity to very low levels but had little effect on phenotype or ascorbate and glutathione pools in standard conditions. An analysis of the subcellular localization of the DHARs in Arabidopsis lines stably transformed with GFP fusion proteins revealed that DHAR1 and DHAR2 are cytosolic while DHAR3 is chloroplastic, with no evidence for peroxisomal or mitochondrial localizations. When the mutations were introduced into an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress genetic background (<i>cat2</i>), the <i>dhar1 dhar2</i> combination decreased glutathione <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed <i>cat2</i>-triggered induction of the salicylic acid pathway. These effects were reversed in <i>cat2 dhar1 dhar2 dhar3</i> complemented with any of the three DHARs. The data suggest that (1) DHAR can be decreased to negligible levels without marked effects on ascorbate pools, (2) the cytosolic isoforms are particularly important in coupling intracellular hydrogen per<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e metabolism to glutathione <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation, and (3) DHAR-dependent glutathione <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation influences redox-driven salicylic acid accumulation.</p>

Aldehyde Oxidase 4 Plays a Critical Role in Delaying Silique Senescence by Catalyzing Aldehyde Detoxification
<p>The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) aldehyde <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ases are a multigene family of four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ases (AAO1–AAO4) that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ize a variety of aldehydes, among them abscisic aldehyde, which is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized to the phytohormone abscisic acid. Toxic aldehydes are generated in plants both under normal conditions and in response to stress. The detoxification of such aldehydes by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation is attributed to aldehyde dehydrogenases but never to aldehyde <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ases. The feasibility of the detoxification of aldehydes in siliques via <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation by AAO4 was demonstrated, first, by its ability to efficiently <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ize an array of aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes, including the reactive carbonyl species (RCS) acrolein, hydroxyl-2-nonenal, and malondialdehyde. Next, exogenous application of several aldehydes to siliques in AAO4 knockout (KO) Arabidopsis plants induced severe tissue damage and enhanced malondialdehyde levels and senescence symptoms, but not in wild-type siliques. Furthermore, abiotic stresses such as dark and ultraviolet C irradiation caused an increase in endogenous RCS and higher expression levels of senescence marker genes, leading to premature senescence of KO siliques, whereas RCS and senescence marker levels in wild-type siliques were hardly affected. Finally, in naturally senesced KO siliques, higher endogenous RCS levels were associated with enhanced senescence molecular markers, chlorophyll degradation, and earlier seed shattering compared with the wild type. The aldehyde-dependent differential generation of super<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e and hydrogen per<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e by AAO4 and the induction of AAO4 expression by hydrogen per<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e shown here suggest a self-amplification mechanism for detoxifying additional reactive aldehydes produced during stress. Taken together, our results indicate that AAO4 plays a critical role in delaying senescence in siliques by catalyzing aldehyde detoxification.</p>

The MYB107 Transcription Factor Positively Regulates Suberin Biosynthesis
<p>Suberin, a lipophilic polymer deposited in the outer integument of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>, represents an essential sealing component controlling water and solute movement and protecting seed from pathogenic infection. Although many genes responsible for suberin synthesis are identified, the regulatory components controlling its biosynthesis have not been definitively determined. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis MYB107 transcription factor acts as a positive regulator controlling suberin biosynthetic gene expression in the seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>. <i>MYB107</i> coexpresses with suberin biosynthetic genes in a temporal manner during seed development. Disrupting <i>MYB107</i> particularly suppresses the expression of genes involved in suberin but not cutin biosynthesis, lowers seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> suberin accumulation, alters suberin lamellar structure, and consequently renders higher seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> permeability and susceptibility to abiotic stresses. Furthermore, MYB107 directly binds to the promoters of suberin biosynthetic genes, verifying its primary role in regulating their expression. Identifying MYB107 as a positive regulator for seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> suberin synthesis offers a basis for discovering the potential transcriptional network behind one of the most abundant lipid-based polymers in nature.</p>

Combined Experimental and Computational Approaches Reveal Distinct pH Dependence of Pectin Methylesterase Inhibitors
<p>The fine-tuning of the degree of methylesterification of cell wall pectin is a key to regulating cell elongation and ultimately the shape of the plant body. Pectin methylesterification is spatiotemporally controlled by pectin methylesterases (PMEs; 66 members in Arabidopsis [<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>]). The comparably large number of proteinaceous pectin methylesterase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ors (PMEIs; 76 members in Arabidopsis) questions the specificity of the PME-PMEI interaction and the functional role of such abundance. To understand the difference, or redundancy, between PMEIs, we used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to predict the behavior of two PMEIs that are coexpressed and have distinct effects on plant development: AtPMEI4 and AtPMEI9. Simulations revealed the structural determinants of the pH dependence for the interaction of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ors with AtPME3, a major PME expressed in roots. Key residues that are likely to play a role in the pH dependence were identified. The predictions obtained from MD simulations were confirmed in vitro, showing that AtPMEI9 is a stronger, less pH-independent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>or compared with AtPMEI4. Using pollen tubes as a developmental model, we showed that these biochemical differences have a biological significance. Application of purified proteins at pH ranges in which PMEI <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion differed between AtPMEI4 and AtPMEI9 had distinct consequences on pollen tube elongation. Therefore, MD simulations have proven to be a powerful tool to predict functional diversity between PMEIs, allowing the discovery of a strategy that may be used by PMEIs to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong> PMEs in different microenvironmental conditions and paving the way to identify the specific role of PMEI diversity in muro.</p>

Phytoglobins Improve Hypoxic Root Growth by Alleviating Apical Meristem Cell Death
<p>Hypoxic root growth in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) is influenced by the expression of phytoglobins (<i>ZmPgbs</i>). Relative to the wild type, suppression of <i>ZmPgb1.1</i> or <i>ZmPgb1.2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>s the growth of roots exposed to 4% oxygen, causing structural abnormalities in the root apical meristems. These effects were accompanied by increasing levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), possibly through the transcriptional induction of four <i>Respiratory Burst <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ase Homologs</i>. TUNEL-positive nuclei in meristematic cells indicated the involvement of programmed cell death (PCD) in the process. These cells also accumulated nitric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e and stained heavily for ethylene biosynthetic transcripts. A sharp increase in the expression level of several 1-aminocyclopropane synthase (<i>ZmAcs2</i>, <i>ZmAcs6</i>, and <i>ZmAcs7</i>), 1-aminocyclopropane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ase (<i>Aco15</i>, <i>Aco20</i>, <i>Aco31</i>, and <i>Aco35</i>), and ethylene-responsive (<i>ZmErf2</i> and <i>ZmEbf1</i>) genes was observed in hypoxic <i>ZmPgb</i>-suppressing roots, which overproduced ethylene. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ing ROS synthesis with diphenyleneiodonium or ethylene perception with 1-methylcyclopropene suppressed PCD, increased <i>BAX <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>or-1</i>, an effective attenuator of the death programs in eukaryotes, and restored root growth. Hypoxic roots overexpressing <i>ZmPgbs</i> had the lowest level of ethylene and showed a reduction in ROS staining and TUNEL-positive nuclei in the meristematic cells. These roots retained functional meristems and exhibited the highest growth performance when subjected to hypoxic conditions. Collectively, these results suggest a novel function of Pgbs in protecting root apical meristems from hypoxia-induced PCD through mechanisms initiated by nitric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e and mediated by ethylene via ROS.</p>

Differential effects of vitamins E and C and carotenoids on growth, resistance to oxidative stress, fledging success and plumage colouration in wild great tits
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress is the imbalance between the production of reactive species and anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ants, which causes damage to lipids, proteins and DNA. Anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ants, like vitamins and carotenoids, can limit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative damage and can therefore regulate the trade-off between growth, which is a period of high reactive species production, and self-maintenance. However, the role of carotenoids as anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ants <i>in vivo</i> has been debated, and it has been suggested that carotenoid-based signals indicate the availability of non-pigmentary anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ants (e.g. vitamins) that protect carotenoids from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation, known as the ‘protection hypothesis’. To evaluate the importance of vitamins versus carotenoids as anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ants during growth and to test the protection hypothesis, we supplemented nestling great tits, <i>Parus major</i>, 3, 5 and 7 days after hatching with a single dose of carotenoids and/or vitamins in a 2×2 full-factorial design. We subsequently measured body condition, anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ant capacity, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative damage, fledging success and plumage reflectance. Vitamins enhanced anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ant capacity, but did not affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative damage. Vitamin-treated nestlings had higher growth rates and higher probability of fledging. In contrast, carotenoids did not affect any of these traits. Furthermore, carotenoid-based colouration increased over the breeding season in nestlings that received vitamins only. This study shows that vitamins are limiting for growth rate and fledging success, and suggests that vitamins could regulate the trade-off between growth and self-maintenance in favour of the former. Moreover, our results are consistent with the idea that carotenoids are minor anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ants in birds, but they do not support the protection hypothesis.</p>

Skeletal muscle fuel selection occurs at the mitochondrial level
<p>Mammals exponentially increase the rate of carbohydrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation as exercise intensity rises, while birds combust lipid almost exclusively while flying at high percentages of aerobic capacity. The fuel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized by contracting muscle depends on many factors: whole-body fuel storage mass, mobilization, blood transport, cellular uptake, and substrate selection at the level of the mitochondrion. We examined the fuel preferences of mitochondria isolated from mammalian and avian locomotory muscles using two approaches. First, the influence of substrates on the kinetics of respiration (<i>K</i><sub>m,ADP</sub> and <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>) was evaluated. For all substrates and combinations, <i>K</i><sub>m,ADP</sub> was generally twofold higher in avian mitochondria. Second, fuel competition between pyruvate, glutamate and/or palmitoyl-<sc>l</sc>-carnitine at three levels of ATP free energy was determined using the principle of mass balance and the measured rates of O<sub>2</sub> consumption and metabolite accumulation/utilization. Avian mitochondria strongly spared pyruvate from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation when another substrate was available and fatty acid was the dominant substrate, regardless of energy state. Mammalian mitochondria exhibited some preference for fatty acid over pyruvate at lower flux (higher energy state), but exhibited a much greater tendency to select pyruvate and glutamate when available. Studies in sonicated mitochondria revealed twofold higher electron transport chain electron conductance in avian mitochondria. We conclude that substantial fuel selection occurs at the level of the mitochondrial matrix and that avian flight muscle mitochondria are particularly biased toward the selection of fatty acid, possibly by facilitating high β-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation flux by maintaining a more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized matrix.</p>

Development of the GABA-ergic signaling system and its role in larval swimming in sea urchin
<p>The present study aimed to elucidate the development and γ-amino butyric acid (GABA)-ergic regulation of larval swimming in the sea urchin <i>Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus</i> by cloning glutamate decarboxylase (<i>Hp-gad</i>), GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor (<i>Hp-gabrA</i>) and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-associated protein (<i>Hp-gabarap</i>), and by performing immunohistochemistry. The regulation of larval swimming was increasingly dependent on the GABAergic system, which was active from the 2 days post-fertilization (d.p.f.) pluteus stage onwards. GABA-immunoreactive cells were detected as a subpopulation of secondary mesenchyme cells during gastrulation and eventually constituted the ciliary band and a subpopulation of blastocoelar cells during the pluteus stage. <i>Hp-gad</i> transcription was detected by RT-PCR during the period when Hp-Gad-positive cells were seen as a subpopulation of blastocoelar cells and on the apical side of the ciliary band from the 2 d.p.f. pluteus stage. Consistent with these observations, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of GAD with 3-mercaptopropioninc acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed GABA immunoreactivity and larval swimming dose dependently. <i>Hp-gabrA</i> amplimers were detected weakly in unfertilized eggs and 4 d.p.f. plutei but strongly from fertilized eggs to 2 d.p.f. plutei, and Hp-GabrA, together with GABA, was localized at the ciliary band in association with dopamine receptor D1 from the two-arm pluteus stage. <i>Hp-gabarap</i> transcription and protein expression were detected from the swimming blastula stage. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor by bicuculline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed larval swimming dose dependently. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of larval swimming by either 3-mercaptopropionic acid or bicuculline was more severe in older larvae (17 and 34 d.p.f. plutei) than in younger ones (1 d.p.f. prism larvae).</p>

Effects of PCSK9 Inhibition With Alirocumab on Lipoprotein Metabolism in Healthy Humans
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Alirocumab, a monoclonal antibody to proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), lowers plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and apolipoprotein B100 (apoB). Although studies in mice and cells have identified increased hepatic LDL receptors as the basis for LDL lowering by PCSK9 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ors, there have been no human studies characterizing the effects of PCSK9 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ors on lipoprotein metabolism. In particular, it is not known whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of PCSK9 has any effects on very low-density lipoprotein or intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL) metabolism. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of PCSK9 also results in reductions of plasma lipoprotein (a) levels. The regulation of plasma Lp(a) levels, including the role of LDL receptors in the clearance of Lp(a), is poorly defined, and no mechanistic studies of the Lp(a) lowering by alirocumab in humans have been published to date.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Eighteen (10 F, 8 mol/L) participants completed a placebo-controlled, 2-period study. They received 2 doses of placebo, 2 weeks apart, followed by 5 doses of 150 mg of alirocumab, 2 weeks apart. At the end of each period, fractional clearance rates (FCRs) and production rates (PRs) of apoB and apo(a) were determined. In 10 participants, postprandial triglycerides and apoB48 levels were measured.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Alirocumab reduced ultracentrifugally isolated LDL-C by 55.1%, LDL-apoB by 56.3%, and plasma Lp(a) by 18.7%. The fall in LDL-apoB was caused by an 80.4% increase in LDL-apoB FCR and a 23.9% reduction in LDL-apoB PR. The latter was due to a 46.1% increase in IDL-apoB FCR coupled with a 27.2% decrease in conversion of IDL to LDL. The FCR of apo(a) tended to increase (24.6%) without any change in apo(a) PR. Alirocumab had no effects on FCRs or PRs of very low-density lipoproteins-apoB and very low-density lipoproteins triglycerides or on postprandial plasma triglycerides or apoB48 concentrations.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Alirocumab decreased LDL-C and LDL-apoB by increasing IDL- and LDL-apoB FCRs and decreasing LDL-apoB PR. These results are consistent with increases in LDL receptors available to clear IDL and LDL from blood during PCSK9 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion. The increase in apo(a) FCR during alirocumab treatment suggests that increased LDL receptors may also play a role in the reduction of plasma Lp(a).</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

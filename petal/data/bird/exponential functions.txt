Probing entanglement in a many-body–localized system
<p>An interacting quantum system that is subject to disorder may cease to thermalize owing to localization of its constituents, thereby marking the breakdown of thermodynamics. The key to understanding this phenomenon lies in the system’s entanglement, which is experimentally challenging to measure. We realize such a many-body–localized system in a disordered Bose-Hubbard chain and characterize its entanglement properties through particle fluctuations and correlations. We observe that the particles become localized, suppressing transport and preventing the thermalization of subsystems. Notably, we measure the development of nonlocal correlations, whose evolution is consistent with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">logarithm</span></strong>ic growth of entanglement entropy, the hallmark of many-body localization. Our work experimentally establishes many-body localization as a qualitatively distinct phenomenon from localization in noninteracting, disordered systems.</p>

The role of electron-electron interactions in two-dimensional Dirac fermions
<p>The role of electron-electron interactions in two-dimensional Dirac fermion systems remains enigmatic. Using a combination of nonperturbative numerical and analytical techniques that incorporate both the contact and long-range parts of the Coulomb interaction, we identify the two previously discussed regimes: a Gross-Neveu transition to a strongly correlated Mott insulator and a semimetallic state with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">logarithm</span></strong>ically diverging Fermi velocity accurately described by the random phase approximation. We predict that experimental realizations of Dirac fermions span this crossover and that this determines whether the Fermi velocity is increased or decreased by interactions. We explain several long-standing mysteries, including why the observed Fermi velocity in graphene is consistently about 20% larger than values obtained from ab initio calculations and why graphene on different substrates shows different behaviors.</p>

The effect of operating lights on laminar flow
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The interaction between surgical lighting and laminar airflow   is poorly understood. We undertook an experiment to identify any   effect contemporary surgical lights have on laminar flow and recommend   practical strategies to limit any negative effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Neutrally buoyant bubbles were introduced into the surgical field   of a simulated setup for a routine total knee arthroplasty in a   laminar flow theatre. Patterns of airflow were observed and the   number of bubbles remaining above the surgical field over time identified.   Five different lighting configurations were assessed. Data were analysed   using simple linear regression after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">logarithm</span></strong>ic transformation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In the absence of surgical lights, laminar airflow was observed,   bubbles were cleared rapidly and did not accumulate. If lights were   placed above the surgical field laminar airflow was abolished and   bubbles rose from the surgical field to the lights then circulated   back to the surgical field. The value of the decay parameter (slope)   of the two setups differed significantly; no light (b = -1.589) <i>versus</i> one   light (b = -0.1273, p < 0.001).</p><p>Two lights touching (b = -0.1191) above the surgical field had   a similar effect to that of a single light (p = 0. 2719). Two lights   positioned by arms outstretched had a similar effect    (b = -0.1204) to two lights touching (p = 0.998) and one light (p   = 0.444). When lights were separated widely (160 cm), laminar airflow   was observed but the rate of clearance of the bubbles remained slower   (b = -1.1165) than with no lights present (p = 0.004). </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Surgical lights have a significantly negative effect on laminar   airflow. Lights should be positioned as far away as practicable   from the surgical field to limit this effect.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1061–6.</p></sec>

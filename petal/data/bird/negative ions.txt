Mid-term changes in blood metal ion levels after Articular Surface Replacement arthroplasty of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Our first aim was to determine whether there are significant   changes in the level of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in the blood at mid-term follow-up,   in patients with an Articular Surface Replacement (ASR) arthroplasty.   Secondly, we sought to identify risk factors for any increases.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The study involved 435 patients who underwent unilateral, metal-on-metal   (MoM) hip resurfacing (HRA) or total hip arthroplasty (THA). These   patients all had one measurement of the level of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in the   blood before seven years had passed post-operatively (early evaluat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>)   and one after seven years had passed post-operatively (mid-term evaluat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>).   Changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> levels were tested using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test.   We identified subgroups at the highest risk of increase using a   multivariable linear logistic regress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were significant increases in the levels of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s   for patients who underwent both MoM HRA (Chromium (Cr): 0.5 parts   per bill<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (ppb); Cobalt (Co): 1.1 ppb) and MoM THA (Cr: 0.5 ppb;   Co: 0.7 ppb). In a multivariable model considering MoM HRAs, the   change in the levels of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s was influenced by female gender   (Co: Odds Ratio (OR) 1.42; p = 0.002 and Cr: OR 1.08; p = 0.006).   The change was found to be irrespective of the initial level for   the MoM HRAs, whereas there was a negative relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship between   the initial level and the change in the level for those with a MoM   THA (Co: OR -0.43; p < 0.001 and Cr: OR -0.14; p = 0.033).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong></title><p>The levels of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in the blood increase significantly   over the period until mid-term follow-up in patients with both a   MoM HRA and those with a MoM THA. We recommend that the levels of   metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s be measured most frequently for women with a MoM HRA.   While those with a MoM THA appear to stabilise at a certain level,   the accuracy of this trend is not yet clear. Vigilant follow-up   is still recommended. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B(4   Supple B):33–40.</p></sec>

Room-temperature cycling of metal fluoride electrodes: Liquid electrolytes for high-energy fluoride ion cells
<p>Fluoride <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> batteries are potential “next-generat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>” electrochemical storage devices that offer high energy density. At present, such batteries are limited to operat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> at high temperatures because suitable fluoride <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>–conducting electrolytes are known only in the solid state. We report a liquid fluoride <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>–conducting electrolyte with high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ic conductivity, wide operating voltage, and robust chemical stability based on dry tetraalkylammonium fluoride salts in ether solvents. Pairing this liquid electrolyte with a copper–lanthanum trifluoride (Cu@LaF<sub>3</sub>) core-shell cathode, we demonstrate reversible fluorinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and defluorinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in a fluoride <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> electrochemical cell cycled at room temperature.

Risk factors for wear-related failures after hip resurfacing in patients with a low contact patch to rim distance
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>A contact patch to rim (CPR) distance of < 10 mm has been   associated with edge-loading and excessive wear.

Chloride Sensing by WNK1 Involves Inhibition of Autophosphorylation
<sec><title>Inhibited by Chloride in the Active Site</title><p>Chloride <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s are essential for regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of blood pressure and electrolyte homeostasis.

An evolutionarily conserved gene family encodes proton-selective ion channels
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels form the basis for cellular electrical signaling. Despite the scores of genetically identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels selective for other monatomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, only one type of proton-selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel has been found in eukaryotic cells. By comparative transcriptome analysis of mouse taste receptor cells, we identified Otopetrin1 (OTOP1), a protein required for development of gravity-sensing otoconia in the vestibular system, as forming a proton-selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel. We found that murine OTOP1 is enriched in acid-detecting taste receptor cells and is required for their zinc-sensitive proton conductance. Two related murine genes, <i>Otop2</i> and <i>Otop3</i>, and a <i>Drosophila</i> ortholog also encode proton channels. Evolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ary conservat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the gene family and its widespread tissue distribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> suggest a broad role for proton channels in physiology and pathophysiology.</p>

Dynamic multinuclear sites formed by mobilized copper ions in NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> selective catalytic reduction
<p>Copper <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s exchanged into zeolites are active for the selective catalytic reduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (SCR) of nitrogen oxides (NO<i><sub>x</sub></i>) with ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>), but the low-temperature rate dependence on copper (Cu) volumetric density is inconsistent with react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> at single sites. We combine steady-state and transient kinetic measurements, x-ray absorpt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> spectroscopy, and first-principles calculat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s to demonstrate that under react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, mobilized Cu <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s can travel through zeolite windows and form transient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> pairs that participate in an oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>)–mediated Cu<sup>I</sup>→Cu<sup>II</sup> redox step integral to SCR. Electrostatic tethering to framework aluminum centers limits the volume that each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> can explore and thus its capacity to form an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> pair.

The ion channel TRPM7 is required for B cell lymphopoiesis
<p>The transient receptor potential (TRP) family is a large family of widely expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels that regulate the intracellular concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and metals and respond to various chemical and physical stimuli. TRP subfamily M member 7 (TRPM7) is unusual in that it contains both an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel and a kinase domain. TRPM7 is a divalent cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel with preference for Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>. It is required for the survival of DT40 cells, a B cell line; however, delet<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of TRPM7 in T cells does not impair their development. We found that express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of TRPM7 was required for B cell development in mice. Mice that lacked TRPM7 in B cells failed to generate peripheral B cells because of a developmental block at the pro-B cell stage. The loss of TRPM7 kinase activity alone did not affect the proport<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of peripheral mature B cells or the development of B cells in the bone marrow. However, supplementat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> with a high concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> partially rescued the development of TRPM7-deficient B cells in vitro. Thus, our findings identify a critical role for TRPM7 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel activity in B cell development.</p>

Size effect in ion transport through angstrom-scale slits
<p>In the field of nanofluidics, it has been an ultimate but seemingly distant goal to controllably fabricate capillaries with dimens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s approaching the size of small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and water molecules. We report <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> transport through ultimately narrow slits that are fabricated by effectively removing a single atomic plane from a bulk crystal. The atomically flat angstrom-scale slits exhibit little surface charge, allowing elucidat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the role of steric effects. We find that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s with hydrated diameters larger than the slit size can still permeate through, albeit with reduced mobility. The confinement also leads to a notable asymmetry between an<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of the same diameter. Our results provide a platform for studying the effects of angstrom-scale confinement, which is important for the development of nanofluidics, molecular separat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, and other nanoscale technologies.</p>

Rapid cold hardening improves recovery of ion homeostasis and chill coma recovery time in the migratory locust, <i>Locusta migratoria</i>
<p>Chill tolerance of insects is defined as the ability to tolerate low temperature under circumstances not involving freezing of intracellular or extracellular fluids. For many insects chill tolerance is crucial for their ability to persist in cold environments and mounting evidence indicates that chill tolerance is associated with the ability to maintain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and water homeostasis, thereby ensuring muscular funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and preventing chill injury at low temperature. The present study describes the relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship between muscle and haemolymph <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis and time to regain posture following cold shock (CS, 2 h at −4°C) in the chill-susceptible locust <i>Locusta migratoria</i>. This relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship was examined in animals with and without a prior rapid cold-hardening treatment (RCH, 2 h at 0°C) to investigate the physiological underpinnings of RCH. CS elicited a doubling of haemolymph [K<sup>+</sup>] and this disturbance was greater in locusts pre-exposed to RCH. Recovery of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis was, however, markedly faster in RCH-treated animals, which correlated well with whole-organism performance as hardened individuals regained posture faster than non-hardened individuals following CS. The present study indicates that loss and recovery of muscular funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> are associated with the resting membrane potential of excitable membranes as attested by the changes in the equilibrium potential for K<sup>+</sup> (<i>E</i><sub>K</sub>) following CS. Both hardened and non-hardened animals regained movement once K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis had recovered to a fixed level (<i>E</i><sub>K</sub>≈−41 mV). RCH is therefore not associated with altered sensitivity to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> disturbance but instead is correlated to a faster recovery of haemolymph [K<sup>+</sup>].</p>

Asymmetric nucleophilic fluorination under hydrogen bonding phase-transfer catalysis
<p>Common an<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ic nucleophiles such as those derived from inorganic salts have not been used for enantioselective catalysis because of their insolubility. Here, we report that merging hydrogen bonding and phase-transfer catalysis provides an effective mode of activat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> for nucleophiles that are insoluble in organic solvents. This catalytic manifold relies on hydrogen bonding complexat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to render nucleophiles soluble and reactive, while simultaneously inducing asymmetry in the ensuing transformat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>.

Phosphoric acid as a precursor to chemicals traditionally synthesized from white phosphorus
<p>White phosphorus, generated in the legacy thermal process for phosphate rock upgrading, has long been the key industrial intermediate for the synthesis of phosphorus-containing chemicals, including herbicides, flame-retardants, catalyst ligands, battery electrolytes, pharmaceuticals, and detergents. In contrast, phosphate fertilizers are made on a much larger scale from phosphoric acid, obtained by treating phosphate rock with sulfuric acid. Dehydrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of phosphoric acid using sodium chloride gives trimetaphosphate, and here we report that trichlorosilane, primarily used for the product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of high-purity silicon, reduces trimetaphosphate to the previously unknown bis(trichlorosilyl)phosphide an<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>.

A peptide hormone required for Casparian strip diffusion barrier formation in <i>Arabidopsis</i> roots
<p>Plants achieve mineral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis by means of a hydrophobic barrier on endodermal cells called the Casparian strip, which restricts lateral diffus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s between the root vascular bundles and the soil. We identified a family of sulfated peptides required for contiguous Casparian strip format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in <i>Arabidopsis</i> roots. These peptide hormones, which we named Casparian strip integrity factor 1 (CIF1) and CIF2, are expressed in the root stele and specifically bind the endodermis-expressed leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase GASSHO1 (GSO1)/SCHENGEN3 and its homolog, GSO2. A mutant devoid of CIF peptides is defective in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis in the xylem. <i>CIF</i> genes are environmentally responsive. Casparian strip regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is not merely a passive process driven by root developmental cues; it also serves as an active strategy to cope with adverse soil condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s.</p>

Identification of LRRC8 Heteromers as an Essential Component of the Volume-Regulated Anion Channel VRAC

Identificat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of VRAC components is an essential step forward in the understanding of swelling-activated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels and provides opportunities for understanding both the mechanism of the channel and its role in physiology.</p></sec>

Guard Cell Salicylic Acid Signaling Is Integrated into Abscisic Acid Signaling via the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CPK-Dependent Pathway
<p>The phenolic hormone salicylic acid (SA) induces stomatal closure. It has been suggested that SA signaling is integrated with abscisic acid (ABA) signaling in guard cells, but the integrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> mechanism remains unclear. The Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent protein kinase Open Stomata1 (OST1) and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein kinases (CPKs) are key for ABA-induced activat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the slow-type an<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel SLAC1 and stomatal closure. Here, we show that SA-induced stomatal closure and SA activat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of slow-type an<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel are impaired in the CPK disrupt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> mutant <i>cpk3-2 cpk6-1</i> but not in the OST1 disrupt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> mutant <i>ost1-3</i>. We also found that the key phosphorylat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> sites of SLAC1 in ABA signaling, serine-59 and serine-120, also are important for SA signaling. Chemiluminescence-based detect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of superoxide an<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> revealed that SA did not require CPK3 and CPK6 for the induct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of reactive oxygen species product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Taken together, our results suggest that SA activates peroxidase-mediated reactive oxygen species signal that is integrated into Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CPK-dependent ABA signaling branch but not the OST1-dependent signaling branch in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) guard cells.</p>

A new potassium ion current induced by stimulation of M<sub>2</sub> cholinoreceptors in fish atrial myocytes
<p>A novel potassium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> current induced by muscarinic stimulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (<i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>) is characterized in atrial cardiomyocytes of teleost fishes (crucian carp, <i>Carassius carassius</i>; rainbow trout, <i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>) by means of the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. The current is elicited in atrial, but not ventricular, cells by applicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of carbamylcholine (CCh) in moderate to high concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s (10<sup>−7</sup>–10<sup>−4</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>). It can be distinguished from the classic <i>I</i><sub>KACh</sub>, activated by the βγ-subunit of the G<sub>i</sub>-protein, because of its low sensitivity to Ba<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and distinct current–voltage relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship with a very small inward current component. Ni<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s (5 mmol l<sup>−1</sup>) and KB-R7943 (10<sup>−5</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>), non-selective blockers of the sodium–calcium exchange current (<i>I</i><sub>NCX</sub>), strongly reduced and completely abolished, respectively, the <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>. Therefore, <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub> was initially regarded as a CCh-induced outward component of the <i>I</i><sub>NCX</sub>. However, the current is not affected by either exclus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> or extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, but is completely abolished by intracellular perfus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> with K<sup>+</sup>-free solut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Atropine (10<sup>−6</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>), a non-selective muscarinic blocker, completely eliminated the <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>. A selective antagonist of M<sub>2</sub> cholinoreceptors, AF-DX 116 (2×10<sup>−7</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>) and an M<sub>3</sub> antagonist, 4-DAMP (10<sup>−9</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>), decreased <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub> by 84.4% and 16.6%, respectively. Pertussis toxin, which irreversibly inhibits G<sub>i</sub>-protein coupled to M<sub>2</sub> receptors, reduced the current by 95%, when applied into the pipette solut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. It is concluded that <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>, induced by stimulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of M<sub>2</sub> cholinoceptors and subsequent G<sub>i</sub>-protein activat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, represents a new molecular target for the cardiac parasympathetic innervat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>.</p>

The channel-kinase TRPM7 regulates antigen gathering and internalization in B cells
<p>Members of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels are cellular sensors involved in numerous physiological and pathological processes. We identified the TRP subfamily M member 7 (TRPM7) channel-kinase as a previously uncharacterized regulator of B cell activat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. We showed that TRPM7 played a critical role in the early events of B cell activat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> through both its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel and kinase funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. DT40 B cells deficient in TRPM7 or expressing a kinase-deficient mutant of TRPM7 showed defective gathering of antigen and prolonged B cell receptor (BCR) signaling. We showed that lipid metabolism was altered in TRPM7-deficient cells and in cells expressing a kinase-deficient mutant of TRPM7 and suggest that PLC-γ2 may be a target of the kinase activity of TRPM7. Primary B cells that expressed less TRPM7 or were treated with a pharmacological inhibitor of TRPM7 also displayed defective antigen gathering and increased BCR signaling. Finally, we demonstrated that blocking TRPM7 funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> compromised antigen internalizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and presentat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to T cells. These data suggest that TRPM7 controls an essential process required for B cell affinity maturat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and the product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of high-affinity antibodies.</p>

mTORC1 controls lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release through the two-pore channel TPC2
<p>Two-pore segment channel 2 (TPC2) is a ubiquitously expressed, lysosomally targeted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel that aids in terminating autophagy and is inhibited upon its associat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> with mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). It is controversial whether TPC2 mediates lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release or selectively conducts Na<sup>+</sup> and whether the binding of nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) or phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate [PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>] is required for the activity of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel. We show that TPC2 is required for intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in response to NAADP or to mTOR inhibit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> by rapamycin. In pulmonary arterial myocytes, rapamycin and NAADP evoked global Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients that were blocked by deplet<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores. Preincubat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of cells with high concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of rapamycin resulted in desensitizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and blocked NAADP-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. Moreover, rapamycin and NAADP did not evoke discernable Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in myocytes derived from <i>Tpcn2</i> knockout mice, which showed normal responses to other Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mobilizing signals. In HEK293 cells stably overexpressing human TPC2, shRNA-mediated knockdown of mTOR blocked rapamycin- and NAADP-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. Confocal imaging of a genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator fused to TPC2 demonstrated that rapamycin-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals localized to lysosomes and were in close proximity to TPC2. Therefore, inactivat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of mTOR may activate TPC2 and consequently lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release.</p>

Temperature-activated ion channels in neural crest cells confer maternal fever–associated birth defects
<p>Birth defects of the heart and face are common, and most have no known genetic cause, suggesting a role for environmental factors. Maternal fever during the first trimester is an environmental risk factor linked to these defects. Neural crest cells are precursor populat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s essential to the development of both at-risk tissues. We report that two heat-activated transient receptor potential (TRP) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels, TRPV1 and TRPV4, were present in neural crest cells during critical windows of heart and face development. TRPV1 antagonists protected against the development of hyperthermia-induced defects in chick embryos. Treatment with chemical agonists of TRPV1 or TRPV4 replicated hyperthermia-induced birth defects in chick and zebrafish embryos. To test whether transient TRPV channel permeability in neural crest cells was sufficient to induce these defects, we engineered iron-binding modificat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s to TRPV1 and TRPV4 that enabled remote and noninvasive activat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of these channels in specific cellular locat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and at specific developmental times in chick embryos with radio-frequency electromagnetic fields. Transient stimulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of radio frequency–controlled TRP channels in neural crest cells replicated fever-associated defects in developing chick embryos. Our data provide a previously undescribed mechanism for congenital defects, whereby hyperthermia activates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels that negatively affect fetal development.</p>

Large-area graphene-nanomesh/carbon-nanotube hybrid membranes for ionic and molecular nanofiltration

We report a large-area graphene-nanomesh/single-walled carbon nanotube (GNM/SWNT) hybrid membrane with excellent mechanical strength while fully capturing the merit of atomically thin membranes.

The resulting GNM/SWNT membranes show high water permeance and a high reject<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> ratio for salt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s or organic molecules, and they retain stable separat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> performance in tubular modules.</p>

Deconstructing water’s diffuse OH stretching vibrational spectrum with cold clusters

Complete steric exclusion of ions and proton transport through confined monolayer water

Laser cooling of ions in a neutral plasma

Unusual transcription factor protects against heart failure
<p>The heart pumps blood to the rest of the body in a coordinated and steadfast manner. This pumping funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is achieved through synchronous contract<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of bill<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of cardiomyocytes (heart muscle cells), which is governed by phasic increases in intracellular calcium. As such, cardiomyocytes have evolved intricate cellular structures that tightly couple external electrical impulses to the triggering of calcium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> release from intracellular stores and subsequent activat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of force-producing proteins, a process termed excitat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>-contract<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (E-C) coupling. A key component of this molecular ultrastructure is the cardiac dyad, a microdomain that juxtaposes the plasma membrane L-type calcium channel with the calcium-sensitive ryanodine receptor (RyR) channel complex, the molecular gatekeeper for the release of calcium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s from sarcoplasmic reticulum stores in cardiomyocytes. The cardiac dyad is physically stabilized by a membrane-associated scaffold protein called junctophilin-2 (JP2), which facilitates physiologic calcium release during E-C coupling. Excessive stress or injury to cardiomyocytes results in defective E-C coupling, reduced pumping capacity, and the clinical syndrome of heart failure, a leading cause of death worldwide. On page 1375 of this issue, Guo <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) report the surprising discovery that during cardiac stress, a proteolytically cleaved fragment of JP2 can translocate to the cardiomyocyte nucleus and funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> as a transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> factor that can protect against heart failure pathogenesis. Thus, in addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to its “day job” as a structural protein, this suggest that JP2 can “moonlight” in the nucleus as part of a homeostatic feedback response to cardiac stress.</p>

Structural insight into precursor tRNA processing by yeast ribonuclease P
<p>Ribonuclease P (RNase P) is a universal ribozyme responsible for processing the 5′-leader of pre–transfer RNA (pre-tRNA). Here, we report the 3.5-angstrom cryo–electron microscopy structures of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> RNase P alone and in complex with pre-tRNA<sup>Phe</sup>. The protein components form a hook-shaped architecture that wraps around the RNA and stabilizes RNase P into a “measuring device” with two fixed anchors that recognize the L-shaped pre-tRNA. A universally conserved uridine nucleobase and phosphate backbone in the catalytic center together with the scissile phosphate and the O3′ leaving group of pre-tRNA jointly coordinate two catalytic magnesium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. Binding of pre-tRNA induces a conformat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al change in the catalytic center that is required for catalysis. Moreover, simulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> analysis suggests a two-metal-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> S<sub>N</sub>2 react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> pathway of pre-tRNA cleavage.

Glutamate triggers long-distance, calcium-based plant defense signaling
<p>Animals require rapid, long-range molecular signaling networks to integrate sensing and response throughout their bodies. The amino acid glutamate acts as an excitatory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate central nervous system, facilitating long-range informat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> exchange via activat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of glutamate receptor channels. Similarly, plants sense local signals, such as herbivore attack, and transmit this informat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> throughout the plant body to rapidly activate defense responses in undamaged parts. Here we show that glutamate is a wound signal in plants. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels of the <i>GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR–LIKE</i> family act as sensors that convert this signal into an increase in intracellular calcium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> that propagates to distant organs, where defense responses are then induced.</p>

We report that water permeability in 0.8-nanometer-diameter carbon nanotube porins (CNTPs), which confine water down to a single-file chain, exceeds that of biological water transporters and of wider CNT pores by an order of magnitude. Intermolecular hydrogen-bond rearrangement, required for entry into the nanotube, dominates the energy barrier and can be manipulated to enhance water transport rates. CNTPs block an<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> transport, even at salinities that exceed seawater levels, and their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> selectivity can be tuned to configure them into switchable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ic diodes. These properties make CNTPs a promising material for developing membrane separat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> technologies.</p>

Iodide management in formamidinium-lead-halide–based perovskite layers for efficient solar cells
<p>The format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of a dense and uniform thin layer on the substrates is crucial for the fabricat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of high-performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs) containing formamidinium with multiple cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and mixed halide an<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. The concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of defect states, which reduce a cell’s performance by decreasing the open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current density, needs to be as low as possible. We show that the introduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al iodide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s into the organic cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> solut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, which are used to form the perovskite layers through an intramolecular exchanging process, decreases the concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of deep-level defects. The defect-engineered thin perovskite layers enable the fabricat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of PSCs with a certified power convers<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> efficiency of 22.1% in small cells and 19.7% in 1-square-centimeter cells.</p>

Three-dimensional holey-graphene/niobia composite architectures for ultrahigh-rate energy storage
<p>Nanostructured materials have shown extraordinary promise for electrochemical energy storage but are usually limited to electrodes with rather low mass loading (~1 milligram per square centimeter) because of the increasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> diffus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> limitat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in thicker electrodes. We report the design of a three-dimens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al (3D) holey-graphene/niobia (Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) composite for ultrahigh-rate energy storage at practical levels of mass loading (>10 milligrams per square centimeter). The highly interconnected graphene network in the 3D architecture provides excellent electron transport properties, and its hierarchical porous structure facilitates rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> transport. By systematically tailoring the porosity in the holey graphene backbone, charge transport in the composite architecture is optimized to deliver high areal capacity and high-rate capability at high mass loading, which represents a critical step forward toward practical applicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s.</p>

Cryo-EM structures of the triheteromeric NMDA receptor and its allosteric modulation
<p><i>N</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are heterotetrameric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels assembled as diheteromeric or triheteromeric complexes. Here, we report structures of the triheteromeric GluN1/GluN2A/GluN2B receptor in the absence or presence of the GluN2B-specific allosteric modulator Ro 25-6981 (Ro), determined by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). In the absence of Ro, the GluN2A and GluN2B amino-terminal domains (ATDs) adopt “closed” and “open” clefts, respectively. Upon binding Ro, the GluN2B ATD clamshell transit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s from an open to a closed conformat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Consistent with a predominance of the GluN2A subunit in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel gating, the GluN2A subunit interacts more extensively with GluN1 subunits throughout the receptor, in comparison with the GluN2B subunit. Differences in the conformat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the pseudo-2-fold–related GluN1 subunits further reflect receptor asymmetry. The triheteromeric NMDAR structures provide the first view of the most common NMDA receptor assembly and show how incorporat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of two different GluN2 subunits modifies receptor symmetry and subunit interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, allowing each subunit to uniquely influence receptor structure and funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, thus increasing receptor complexity.</p>

Cation Specificity of Vacuolar NHX-Type Cation/H<sup>+</sup> Antiporters
<p>Cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>/H<sup>+</sup> (NHX-type) antiporters are important regulators of intracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis and are critical for cell expans<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and plant stress acclimat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), four distinct NHX isoforms, named AtNHX1 to AtNHX4, locate to the tonoplast. To determine the concerted roles of all tonoplast NHXs on vacuolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and pH homeostasis, we examined multiple knockout mutants lacking all but one of the four vacuolar isoforms and quadruple knockout plants lacking any vacuolar NHX activity. The <i>nhx</i> triple and quadruple knockouts displayed reduced growth phenotypes. Exposure to sodium chloride improved growth while potassium chloride was deleterious to some knockouts. Kinetic analysis of K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> transport indicated that AtNHX1 and AtNHX2 are the main contributors to both vacuolar pH and K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> uptake, while AtNHX3 and AtNHX4 differ in Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> selectivity. The lack of any vacuolar NHX activity resulted in no K<sup>+</sup> uptake, highly acidic vacuoles, and reduced but not abolished vacuolar Na<sup>+</sup> uptake. Addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al K<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange activity assays in the quadruple knockout indicated Na<sup>+</sup> uptake that was not H<sup>+</sup> coupled, suggesting the existence of an alternative, cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>/H<sup>+</sup>-independent, Na<sup>+</sup> conductive pathway in vacuoles. These results highlight the importance of NHX-type cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporters in the maintenance of cellular cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis and in growth and development.</p>

The Membrane Transport System of the Guard Cell and Its Integration for Stomatal Dynamics
<p>Stomatal guard cells are widely recognized as the premier plant cell model for membrane transport, signaling, and homeostasis. This recognit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is rooted in half a century of research into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> transport across the plasma and vacuolar membranes of guard cells that drive stomatal movements and the signaling mechanisms that regulate them. Stomatal guard cells surround pores in the epidermis of plant leaves, controlling the aperture of the pore to balance CO<sub>2</sub> entry into the leaf for photosynthesis with water loss via transpirat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. The posit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of guard cells in the epidermis is ideally suited for cellular and subcellular research, and their sensitivity to endogenous signals and environmental stimuli makes them a primary target for physiological studies. Stomata underpin the challenges of water availability and crop product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> that are expected to unfold over the next 20 to 30 years. A quantitative understanding of how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> transport is integrated and controlled is key to meeting these challenges and to engineering guard cells for improved water use efficiency and agricultural yields.</p>

Endocrine regulation of carbonate precipitate formation in marine fish intestine by stanniocalcin and PTHrP
<p>In marine fish, high epithelial bicarbonate secret<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> by the intestine generates luminal carbonate precipitates of divalent cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s that play a key role in water and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis. <i>In vitro</i> studies highlight the involvement of the calciotropic hormones PTHrP (parathyroid hormone-related protein) and stanniocalcin (STC) in the regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of epithelial bicarbonate transport. The present study tested the hypothesis that calciotropic hormones have a regulatory role in carbonate precipitate format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> <i>in vivo</i>. Sea bream (<i>Sparus aurata</i>) juveniles received single intraperitoneal inject<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of piscine PTHrP(1–34), the PTH/PTHrP receptor antagonist PTHrP(7–34) or purified sea bream STC, or were passively immunized with polyclonal rabbit antisera raised against sea bream STC (STC-Ab). Endocrine effects on the express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the basolateral sodium bicarbonate co-transporter (Slc4a4.A), the apical an<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> exchangers Slc26a6.A and Slc26a3.B, and the V-type proton pump β-subunit (Atp6v1b) in the anterior intestine were evaluated. In keeping with their calciotropic nature, the hypocalcaemic factors PTHrP(7–34) and STC up-regulated gene express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of all transporters. In contrast, the hypercalcaemic factor PTHrP(1–34) and STC antibodies down-regulated transporters involved in the bicarbonate secret<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> cascade. Changes in intestine luminal precipitate contents provoked by calcaemic endocrine factors validated these results: 24 h post-inject<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> either PTHrP(1–34) or immunizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> with STC-Ab reduced the carbonate precipitate content in the sea bream intestine. In contrast, the PTH/PTHrP receptor antagonist PTHrP(7–34) increased not only the precipitated fract<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> but also the concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> equivalents in the intestinal fluid. These results confirm the hypothesis that calciotropic hormones have a regulatory role in carbonate precipitate format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> <i>in vivo</i> in the intestine of marine fish. Furthermore, they illustrate for the first time in fish the counteracting effect of PTHrP and STC, and reveal an unexpected contribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of calcaemic factors to acid–base balance.</p>

Primary Myocardial Fibrosis as an Alternative Phenotype Pathway of Inherited Cardiac Structural Disorders
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Myocardial fibrosis is a common postmortem finding among young individuals with sudden cardiac death.

Altered Expression of a Malate-Permeable Anion Channel, OsALMT4, Disrupts Mineral Nutrition
<p>Aluminum-activated malate transporters (ALMTs) form a family of an<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels in plants, but little is known about most of its members. This study examined the funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <i>OsALMT4</i> from rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). We show that <i>OsALMT4</i> is expressed in roots and shoots and that the OsALMT4 protein localizes to the plasma membrane. Transgenic rice lines overexpressing (OX) <i>OsALMT4</i> released malate from the roots constitutively and had 2-fold higher malate concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in the xylem sap than nulls, indicating greater concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of malate in the apoplast. OX lines developed brown necrotic spots on the leaves that did not appear on nulls. These symptoms were not associated with altered concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of any mineral element in the leaves, although the OX lines had higher concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of Mn and B in their grain compared with nulls. While total leaf Mn concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s were not different between the OX and null lines, Mn concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in the apoplast were greater in the OX plants. The OX lines also displayed increased express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of Mn transporters and were more sensitive to Mn toxicity than null plants. We showed that the growth of wild-type rice was unaffected by 100 µ<sc>m</sc> Mn in hydroponics but, when combined with 1 m<sc>m</sc> malate, this concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> inhibited growth. We conclude that increasing <i>OsALMT4</i> express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> affected malate efflux and compartmentat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> within the tissues, which increased Mn concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in the apoplast of leaves and induced the toxicity symptoms. This study reveals new links between malate transport and mineral nutrit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>.</p>

Stearoyl-Acyl Carrier Protein Desaturase Mutations Uncover an Impact of Stearic Acid in Leaf and Nodule Structure
<p>Stearoyl-acyl carrier protein desaturase (SACPD-C) has been reported to control the accumulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of seed stearic acid; however, no study has previously reported its involvement in leaf stearic acid content and impact on leaf structure and morphology. A subset of an ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenized populat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) ‘Forrest’ was screened to identify mutants within the <i>GmSACPD-C</i> gene. Using a forward genetics approach, one nonsense and four missense <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutants were identified to have high levels of seed, nodule, and leaf stearic acid content. Homology modeling and in silico analysis of the GmSACPD-C enzyme revealed that most of these mutat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s were localized near or at conserved residues essential for diiron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> coordinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Soybeans carrying <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s at conserved residues showed the highest stearic acid content, and these mutat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s were found to have deleterious effects on nodule development and funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Interestingly, mutat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s at nonconserved residues show an increase in stearic acid content yet retain healthy nodules. Thus, random mutagenesis and mutat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al analysis allows for the achievement of high seed stearic acid content with no associated negative agronomic characteristics. Addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ally, express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> analysis demonstrates that nodule leghemoglobin transcripts were significantly more abundant in soybeans with deleterious mutat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s at conserved residues of GmSACPD-C. Finally, we report that <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s cause an increase in leaf stearic acid content and an alterat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of leaf structure and morphology in addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to differences in nitrogen-fixing nodule structure.</p>

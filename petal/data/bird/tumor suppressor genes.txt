Risk of Cerebrovascular Events in 178 962 Five-Year Survivors of Cancer Diagnosed at 15 to 39 Years of Age
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Survivors of teenage and young adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> are at risk of cerebrovascular events, but the magnitude of and extent to which this risk varies by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> type, decade of diagnosis, age at diagnosis, and attained age remains uncertain. This is the largest-ever cohort study to evaluate the risks of hospitalization for a cerebrovascular event among long-term survivors of teenage and young adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The population-based TYACSS (Teenage and Young Adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> Survivor Study) (N=178,962) was linked to Hospital Episode Statistics data for England to investigate the risks of hospitalization for a cerebrovascular event among 5-year survivors of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> diagnosed when 15 to 39 years of age. Observed numbers of first hospitalizations for cerebrovascular events were compared with that expected from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>ral population using standardized hospitalization ratios (SHRs) and absolute excess risks per 10 000 person-years. Cumulative incidence was calculated with death considered a competing risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, 2782 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> survivors were hospitalized for a cerebrovascular event—40% higher than expected (SHR=1.4, 95% confidence interval, 1.3–1.4). Survivors of central nervous system (CNS) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s (SHR=4.6, 95% confidence interval, 4.3–5.0), head and neck <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s (SHR=2.6, 95% confidence interval, 2.2–3.1), and leukemia (SHR=2.5, 95% confidence interval, 1.9–3.1) were at greatest risk. Males had significantly higher absolute excess risks than females (absolute excess risks =7 versus 3), especially among head and neck <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> survivors (absolute excess risks =30 versus 11). By 60 years of age, 9%, 6%, and 5% of CNS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>, head and neck <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>, and leukemia survivors, respectively, had been hospitalized for a cerebrovascular event. Beyond 60 years of age, every year, 0.4% of CNS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> survivors were hospitalized for a cerebral infarction (versus 0.1% expected), whereas at any age, every year, 0.2% of head and neck <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> survivors were hospitalized for a cerebral infarction (versus 0.06% expected).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Survivors of a CNS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>, head and neck <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>, and leukemia are particularly at risk of hospitalization for a cerebrovascular event. The excess risk of cerebral infarction among CNS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> survivors increases with attained age. For head and neck <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> survivors, this excess risk remains high across all ages. These groups of survivors, particularly males, should be considered for surveillance of cerebrovascular risk factors and potential pharmacological interventions for cerebral infarction prevention.</p></sec>

Truncation- and motif-based pan-cancer analysis reveals tumor-suppressing kinases
<p>A major challenge in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> genomics is identifying “driver” mutations from the many neutral “passenger” mutations within a given <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>. To identify driver mutations that would otherwise be lost within mutational noise, we filtered genomic data by motifs that are critical for kinase activity. In the first step of our screen, we used data from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> Cell Line Encyclopedia and The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> Genome Atlas to identify kinases with truncation mutations occurring within or before the kinase domain. The top 30 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-suppressing kinases were aligned, and hotspots for loss-of-function (LOF) mutations were identified on the basis of amino acid conservation and mutational frequency. The functional consequences of new LOF mutations were biochemically validated, and the top 15 hotspot LOF residues were used in a pan-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> analysis to define the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-suppressing kinome. A ranked list revealed MAP2K7, an essential mediator of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, as a candidate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> suppressor in gastric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>, despite its mutational frequency falling within the mutational noise for this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> type. The majority of mutations in MAP2K7 abolished its catalytic activity, and reactivation of the JNK pathway in gastric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells harboring LOF mutations in MAP2K7 or the downstream kinase JNK suppressed clonogenicity and growth in soft agar, demonstrating the functional relevance of inactivating the JNK pathway in gastric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>. Together, our data highlight a broadly applicable strategy to identify functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> driver mutations and define the JNK pathway as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-suppressive in gastric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>.</p>

Breast tumors educate the proteome of stromal tissue in an individualized but coordinated manner
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> forms specialized microenvironmental niches that promote local invasion and colonization. Engrafted patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) locally invade and colonize naive stroma in mice while enabling unambiguous molecular discrimination of human proteins in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> from mouse proteins in the microenvironment. To characterize how patient breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s form a niche and educate naive stroma, subcutaneous breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> PDXs were globally profiled by species-specific quantitative proteomics. Regulation of PDX stromal proteins by breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s was extensive, with 35% of the stromal proteome altered by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s consistently across different animals and passages. Differentially regulated proteins in the stroma clustered into six signatures, which included both known and previously unappreciated contributors to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> invasion and colonization. Stromal proteomes were coordinately regulated; however, the sets of proteins altered by each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> were highly distinct. Integrated analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> and stromal proteins, a comparison made possible in these xenograft models, indicated that the known hallmarks of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> contribute pleiotropically to establishing and maintaining the microenvironmental niche of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>. Education of the stroma by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> is therefore an intrinsic property of breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s that is highly individualized, yet proceeds by consistent, nonrandom, and defined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-promoting molecular alterations.</p>

CTDGFinder: A Novel Homology-Based Algorithm for Identifying Closely Spaced Clusters of Tandemly Duplicated Genes
<p>Closely spaced clusters of tandemly duplicated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s (CTDGs) contribute to the diversity of many phenotypes, including chemosensation, snake venom, and animal body plans. CTDGs have traditionally been identified subjectively as genomic neighborhoods containing several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> duplicates in close proximity; however, CTDGs are often highly variable with respect to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> number, intergenic distance, and synteny. This lack of formal definition hampers the study of CTDG evolutionary dynamics and the discovery of novel CTDGs in the exponentially growing body of genomic data. To address this gap, we developed a novel homology-based algorithm, CTDGFinder, which formalizes and automates the identification of CTDGs by examining the physical distribution of individual members of families of duplicated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s across chromosomes. Application of CTDGFinder accurately identified CTDGs for many well-known <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters (e.g., Hox and beta-globin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters) in the human, mouse and 20 other mammalian genomes. Differences between previously annotated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters and our inferred CTDGs were due to the exclusion of nonhomologs that have historically been considered parts of specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters, the inclusion or absence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s between the CTDGs and their corresponding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters, and the splitting of certain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters into distinct CTDGs. Examination of human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s showing tissue-specific enhancement of their expression by CTDGFinder identified members of several well-known <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters (e.g., cytochrome P450s and olfactory receptors) and revealed that they were unequally distributed across tissues. By formalizing and automating CTDG identification, CTDGFinder will facilitate understanding of CTDG evolutionary dynamics, their functional implications, and how they are associated with phenotypic diversity.</p>

Pericarditis as a Marker of Occult Cancer and a Prognostic Factor for Cancer Mortality
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Pericarditis may be a serious complication of malignancy. Its significance as a first symptom of occult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> and as a prognostic factor for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> survival is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using Danish medical databases, we conducted a nationwide cohort study of all patients with a first-time diagnosis of pericarditis during 1994 to 2013. We excluded patients with previous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> and followed up the remaining patients for subsequent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> diagnosis until November 30, 2013.

The overall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> standardized incidence ratio was 1.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4–1.5), driven predominantly by increased rates of lung, kidney, and bladder <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>, lymphoma, leukemia, and unspecified metastatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>. The <3-month <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> risk among patients with pericarditis was 2.7%, and the standardized incidence ratio was 12.4 (95% CI, 11.2–13.7).

The receptor tyrosine kinase EphA2 promotes glutamine metabolism in tumors by activating the transcriptional coactivators YAP and TAZ
<p>Malignant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s reprogram cellular metabolism to support <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cell proliferation and survival. Although most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s depend on a high rate of aerobic glycolysis, many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells also display addiction to glutamine. Glutamine transporters and glutaminase activity are critical for glutamine metabolism in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells. We found that the receptor tyrosine kinase EphA2 activated the TEAD family transcriptional coactivators YAP and TAZ (YAP/TAZ), likely in a ligand-independent manner, to promote glutamine metabolism in cells and mouse models of HER2-positive breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>. Overexpression of EphA2 induced the nuclear accumulation of YAP and TAZ and increased the expression of YAP/TAZ target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. Inhibition of the GTPase Rho or the kinase ROCK abolished EphA2-dependent YAP/TAZ nuclear localization. Silencing <i>YAP</i> or <i>TAZ</i> substantially reduced the amount of intracellular glutamate through decreased expression of <i>SLC1A5</i> and <i>GLS</i>, respectively, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s that encode proteins that promote glutamine uptake and metabolism. The regulatory DNA elements of both <i>SLC1A5</i> and <i>GLS</i> contain TEAD binding sites and were bound by TEAD4 in an EphA2-dependent manner. In patient breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> tissues, <i>EphA2</i> expression positively correlated with that of <i>YAP</i> and <i>TAZ</i>, as well as that of <i>GLS</i> and <i>SLC1A5</i>. Although high expression of <i>EphA2</i> predicted enhanced metastatic potential and poor patient survival, it also rendered HER2-positive breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells more sensitive to glutaminase inhibition. The findings define a previously unknown mechanism of EphA2-mediated glutaminolysis through YAP/TAZ activation in HER2-positive breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> and identify potential therapeutic targets in patients.</p>

Intercellular transmission of the unfolded protein response promotes survival and drug resistance in cancer cells
<p>Increased protein translation in cells and various factors in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> microenvironment can induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which initiates the unfolded protein response (UPR). We have previously reported that factors released from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells mounting a UPR induce a de novo UPR in bone marrow–derived myeloid cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells that facilitates pro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>igenic characteristics in culture and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> growth in vivo. We investigated whether this intercellular signaling, which we have termed transmissible ER stress (TERS), also operates between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells and what its functional consequences were within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>. We found that TERS signaling induced a UPR in recipient human prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells that included the cell surface expression of the chaperone GRP78. TERS also activated Wnt signaling in recipient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells and enhanced resistance to nutrient starvation and common chemotherapies such as the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib and the microtubule inhibitor paclitaxel. TERS-induced activation of Wnt signaling required the UPR kinase and endonuclease IRE1. However, TERS-induced enhancement of cell survival was predominantly mediated by the UPR kinase PERK and a reduction in the abundance of the transcription factor ATF4, which prevented the activation of the transcription factor CHOP and, consequently, the induction of apoptosis. When implanted in mice, TERS-primed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells gave rise to faster growing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s than did vehicle-primed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells. Collectively, our data demonstrate that TERS is a mechanism of intercellular communication through which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells can adapt to stressful environments.</p>

Potassium shapes antitumor immunity
<p>T cells protect us from infections and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s. Nonetheless, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s grow, persist, and metastasize, even in the presence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), which include T cells with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cell–killing capabilities. This lack of immune control stems from the functional exhaustion, or hyporesponsiveness, of TILs as a consequence of chronic antigen exposure, poor expression of rejection antigens by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells, hypoxia, lack of nutrients or substrates, and/or other suppressive mechanisms in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> microenvironment (TME). Despite these challenges, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> antigen–specific TILs with stem cell–like behavior can mediate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> destruction after successful immunotherapy, such as immune checkpoint blockade (<i>1</i>). Finding mechanisms that maintain the stemness of TILs may lead to improved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> immunotherapies. On page 1417 of this issue, Vodnala <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) identify the concentration of extracellular potassium in the TME as a determinant of the dysfunction and stemness of CD8<sup>+</sup> TILs. This helps explain how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s progress in the presence of T cells that could clear them and suggests new approaches to boost T cell stemness in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> immunotherapy.</p>

Bone voyage—Osteoblasts remotely control tumors
<p>Cancer is a systemic disease. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> growth and malignant progression rely not only on the intrinsic aberrant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic and epi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic makeup of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells but also on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-induced systemic factors that affect cells in the primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> as well as distant microenvironments (<i>1</i>). Notably, bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) have been shown to contribute to primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> progression by promoting hallmark processes such as inflammation, immunosuppression, vasculo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>sis, and extracellular matrix remodeling.

We designed the Gcorn plant database for the retrieval of information on homology and evolution of a plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> of interest. Amino acid sequences of 73 species (62 land plants and 11 green algae), containing 2,682,261 sequences, were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Reference Sequence database. Based on NCBI BLAST searches between these sequences, homologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s were grouped at various thresholds of homology indices devised by the authors. To show functional and evolutionary traits of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> of interest, a phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic tree, connecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s with high homology indices, and line charts of the numbers of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s with various homology indices, are depicted. In addition, such indices are projected on a network graph in which species studied are connected based on the ratios of homologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, and on a phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic tree for species based on NCBI Taxonomy. Gcorn plant provides information on homologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s at various virtual time points along with speciation in plants.</p>

Roles of miR319 and TCP Transcription Factors in Leaf Development
<p>Sophisticated regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> expression, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and their target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, is required for leaf differentiation, growth, and senescence. The impact of miR319 and its target <i>TEOSINTE BRANCHED1</i>, <i>CYCLOIDEA</i>, and <i>PROLIFERATING CELL NUCLEAR ANTIGEN BINDING FACTOR</i> (<i>TCP</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s on leaf development has been extensively investigated, but the redundancies of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families often interfere with the evaluation of their function and regulation in the developmental context. Here, we present the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic evidence of the involvement of the <i>MIR319</i> and <i>TCP</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaf development. Single mutations in <i>MIR319A</i> and <i>MIR319B</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s moderately inhibited the formation of leaf serrations, whereas double mutations increased the extent of this inhibition and resulted in the formation of smooth leaves. Mutations in <i>MIR319</i> and gain-of-function mutations in the <i>TCP4</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> conferred resistance against miR319 and impaired the cotyledon boundary and leaf serration formation. These mutations functionally associated with <i>CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, which regulate the cotyledon boundary and leaf serration formation. In contrast, loss-of-function mutations in miR319-targeted and nontargeted <i>TCP</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s cooperatively induced the formation of serrated leaves in addition to changes in the levels of their downstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> transcript. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the <i>MIR319</i> and <i>TCP</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families underlie robust and multilayer control of leaf development. This study also provides a framework toward future researches on redundant miRNAs and transcription factors in Arabidopsis and crop plants.</p>

Stability of Single-Parent Gene Expression Complementation in Maize Hybrids upon Water Deficit Stress
<p>Heterosis is the superior performance of F1 hybrids compared with their homozygous, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tically distinct parents. In this study, we monitored the transcriptomic divergence of the maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) inbred lines B73 and Mo17 and their reciprocal F1 hybrid progeny in primary roots under control and water deficit conditions simulated by polyethylene glycol treatment. Single-parent expression (SPE) of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s is an extreme instance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> expression complementation, in which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s are active in only one of two parents but are expressed in both reciprocal hybrids. In this study, 1,997 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s only expressed in B73 and 2,024 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s only expressed in Mo17 displayed SPE complementation under control and water deficit conditions. As a consequence, the number of active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in hybrids exceeded the number of active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in the parental inbred lines significantly independent of treatment. SPE patterns were substantially more stable to expression changes by water deficit treatment than other genotype-specific expression profiles. While, on average, 75% of all SPE patterns were not altered in response to polyethylene glycol treatment, only 17% of the remaining genotype-specific expression patterns were not changed by water deficit. Nonsyntenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s that lack syntenic orthologs in other grass species, and thus evolved late in the grass lineage, were significantly overrepresented among SPE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. Hence, the significant overrepresentation of nonsyntenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s among SPE patterns and their stability under water limitation might suggest a function of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s during the early developmental manifestation of heterosis under fluctuating environmental conditions in hybrid progeny of the inbred lines B73 and Mo17.</p>

The Evolution of Innate Immune Genes: Purifying and Balancing Selection on β-Defensins in Waterfowl
<p>In disease dynamics, high immune <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> diversity can confer a selective advantage to hosts in the face of a rapidly evolving and diverse pathogen fauna. This is supported empirically for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s involved in pathogen recognition and signalling. In contrast, effector <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s involved in pathogen clearance may be more constrained. β-Defensins are innate immune effector <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s; their main mode of action is via disruption of microbial membranes. Here, five β-defensin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s were characterized in mallards (<i>Anas platyrhynchos</i>) and other waterfowl; key reservoir species for many zoonotic diseases. All five <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s showed remarkably low diversity at the individual-, population-, and species-level. Furthermore, there was widespread sharing of identical alleles across species divides. Thus, specific β-defensin alleles were maintained not only spatially but also over long temporal scales, with many amino acid residues being fixed across all species investigated. Purifying selection to maintain individual, highly efficacious alleles was the primary evolutionary driver of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in waterfowl. However, we also found evidence for balancing selection acting on the most recently duplicated β-defensin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> (<i>AvBD3b</i>). For this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>, we found that amino acid replacements were more likely to be radical changes, suggesting that duplication of β-defensin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s allows exploration of wider functional space. Structural conservation to maintain function appears to be crucial for avian β-defensin effector molecules, resulting in low tolerance for new allelic variants. This contrasts with other types of innate immune <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, such as receptor and signalling molecules, where balancing selection to maintain allelic diversity has been shown to be a strong evolutionary force.</p>

Old but Not (So) Degenerated—Slow Evolution of Largely Homomorphic Sex Chromosomes in Ratites
<p>De<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>ration of the nonrecombining chromosome is a common feature of sex chromosome evolution, readily evident by the presence of a pair of largely heteromorphic chromosomes, like in eutherian mammals and birds. However, in ratites (order Palaeognathae, including, e.g., ostrich), the Z and W chromosomes are similar in size and largely undifferentiated, despite avian sex chromosome evolution was initiated > 130 Ma. To better understand what may limit sex chromosome evolution, we performed ostrich transcriptome sequencing and studied <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s from the nonrecombining region of the W chromosome. Fourteen gametologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> pairs present on the W chromosome and Z chromosome were identified, with synonymous sequence divergence of 0.027–0.177. The location of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s on the Z chromosome was consistent with a sequential increase in divergence, starting 110–157 and ending 24–30 Ma. On the basis of the occurrence of Z-linked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s hemizygous in females, we estimate that about one-third of the Z chromosome does not recombine with the W chromosome in female meiosis. Pairwise <i>d</i><sub>N</sub><i>/d</i><sub>S</sub> between gametologs decreased with age, suggesting strong evolutionary constraint in old gametologs. Lineage-specific <i>d</i><sub>N</sub><i>/d</i><sub>S</sub> was consistently higher in W-linked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, in accordance with the lower efficacy of selection expected in nonrecombining chromosomes. A higher ratio of GC > AT:AT > GC substitutions in W-linked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s supports a role for GC-biased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> conversion in differentially driving base composition on the two sex chromosomes. A male-to-female (M:F) expression ratio of close to one for recombining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s and close to two for Z-linked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s lacking a W copy show that dosage compensation is essentially absent. Some gametologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s have retained active expression of the W copy in females (giving a M:F ratio of 1 for the gametologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> pair), whereas for others W expression has become severely reduced resulting in a M:F ratio of close to 2. These observations resemble the patterns of sex chromosome evolution seen in other avian and mammalian lineages, suggesting similar underlying evolutionary processes, although the rate of sex chromosome differentiation has been atypically low. Lack of dosage compensation may be a factor hindering sex chromosome evolution in this lineage.</p>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
RUNX2 correlates with subtype-specific breast cancer in a human tissue microarray, and ectopic expression of <i>Runx2</i> perturbs differentiation in the mouse mammary gland
<p>RUNX2, a master regulator of osteo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>sis, is oncogenic in the lymphoid lineage; however, little is known about its role in epithelial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s. Upregulation of <i>RUNX2</i> in cell lines correlates with increased invasiveness and the capacity to form osteolytic disease in models of breast and prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>. However, most studies have analysed the effects of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> in a limited number of cell lines and its role in primary breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> has not been resolved. Using a human tumour tissue microarray, we show that high RUNX2 expression is significantly associated with oestrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor (PR)/HER2-negative breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s and that patients with high RUNX2 expression have a poorer survival rate than those with negative or low expression. We confirm <i>RUNX2</i> as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> that has a potentially important functional role in triple-negative breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>. To investigate the role of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> in breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>, we made a transgenic model in which <i>Runx2</i> is specifically expressed in murine mammary epithelium under the control of the mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV) promoter. We show that ectopic <i>Runx2</i> perturbs normal development in pubertal and lactating animals, delaying ductal elongation and inhibiting lobular alveolar differentiation. We also show that the <i>Runx2</i> trans<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> elicits age-related, pre-neoplastic changes in the mammary epithelium of older transgenic animals, suggesting that elevated RUNX2 expression renders such tissue more susceptible to oncogenic changes and providing further evidence that this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> might have an important, context-dependent role in breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>.</p>

Blockade of TNFR2 signaling enhances the immunotherapeutic effect of CpG ODN in a mouse model of colon cancer
<p>Through the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> necrosis factor (TNF) receptor type II (TNFR2), TNF preferentially activates, expands, and promotes the phenotypic stability of CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T (T<sub>reg</sub>) cells. Those T<sub>reg</sub> cells that have a high abundance of TNFR2 have the maximal immunosuppressive capacity. We investigated whether targeting TNFR2 could effectively suppress the activity of T<sub>reg</sub> cells and consequently enhance the efficacy of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> immunotherapy. We found that, relative to a suboptimal dose of the immunostimulatory Toll-like receptor 9 ligand CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN), the combination of the suboptimal dose of CpG ODN with the TNFR2-blocking antibody M861 more markedly inhibited the growth of subcutaneously grafted mouse CT26 colon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells. This resulted in markedly fewer TNFR2<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells and more interferon-γ–positive (IFN-γ<sup>+</sup>) CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T lymphocytes infiltrating the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> and improved long-term <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-free survival in the mouse cohort. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-free mice were resistant to rechallenge by the same but not unrelated (4T1 breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>) cells. Treatment with the combination of TNFR2-blocking antibody and a CD25-targeted antibody also resulted in enhanced inhibition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> growth in a syn<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>ic 4T1 mouse model of breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>. Thus, the combination of a TNFR2 inhibitor and an immunotherapeutic stimulant may represent a more effective treatment strategy for various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s.</p>

Androgen receptor inhibitor–induced “BRCAness” and PARP inhibition are synthetically lethal for castration-resistant prostate cancer
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s with loss-of-function mutations in <i>BRCA1</i> or <i>BRCA2</i> are deficient in the DNA damage repair pathway called homologous recombination (HR), rendering these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s exquisitely vulnerable to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. This functional state and therapeutic sensitivity is referred to as “BRCAness” and is most commonly associated with some breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> types. Pharmaceutical induction of BRCAness could expand the use of PARP inhibitors to other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> types. For example, <i>BRCA</i> mutations are present in only ~20% of prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> patients. We found that castration-resistant prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> (CRPC) cells showed increased expression of a set of HR-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, including <i>BRCA1</i>, <i>RAD54L</i>, and <i>RMI2</i>. Although androgen-targeted therapy is typically not effective in CRPC patients, the androgen receptor inhibitor enzalutamide suppressed the expression of those HR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in CRPC cells, thus creating HR deficiency and BRCAness. A “lead-in” treatment strategy, in which enzalutamide was followed by the PARP inhibitor olaparib, promoted DNA damage–induced cell death and inhibited clonal proliferation of prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells in culture and suppressed the growth of prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> xenografts in mice. Thus, antiandrogen and PARP inhibitor combination therapy may be effective for CRPC patients and suggests that pharmaceutically inducing BRCAness may expand the clinical use of PARP inhibitors.</p>

Targeting TNFR2 with antagonistic antibodies inhibits proliferation of ovarian cancer cells and tumor-associated T<sub>regs</sub>
<p>Major barriers to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> therapy include the lack of selective inhibitors of regulatory T cells (T<sub>regs</sub>) and the lack of broadly applicable ways to directly target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s through frequently expressed surface onco<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2) is an attractive target protein because of its restricted abundance to highly immunosuppressive T<sub>regs</sub> and oncogenic presence on human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s. We characterized the effect of TNFR2 inhibition using antagonistic antibodies. In culture-based assays, we found that two TNFR2 antagonists inhibited T<sub>reg</sub> proliferation, reduced soluble TNFR2 secretion from normal cells, and enabled T effector cell expansion. The antagonistic activity occurred in the presence of added TNF, a natural TNFR2 agonist. These TNFR2 antibodies killed T<sub>regs</sub> isolated from ovarian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> ascites more potently than it killed T<sub>regs</sub> from healthy donor samples, suggesting that these antibodies may have specificity for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> microenvironment. The TNFR2 antagonists also killed OVCAR3 ovarian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells, which have abundant surface TNFR2. The antibodies stabilized antiparallel dimers in cell surface TNFR2 that rendered the receptor unable to activate the nuclear factor κB pathway and trigger cell proliferation. Our data suggest that, by targeting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells and immunosuppressive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-associated T<sub>regs</sub>, antagonistic TNFR2 antibodies may be an effective treatment for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s positive for TNFR2.</p>

The paradox of mutations and cancer
<p>The past decade has witnessed the cataloging of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic mutations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> genomes, providing new insights into how and in what ways <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> can develop and spread (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). The focus has been on defining specific “driver” mutations, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic errors in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells that reveal basic biological processes gone awry that are required for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> initiation and progression. These drivers are the target of new therapies—this concept is central to precision oncology efforts to treat patients according to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic changes that are present in their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s (<i>3</i>). Along the way, it has also become apparent that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> genomes harbor many additional “passenger” mutations (<i>4</i>). Patterns of driver and passenger DNA mutations derived from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> genomes have provided clues about the different ways that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> can manifest as a disease of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic mutations (<i>5</i>, <i>6</i>). In some circumstances, they can be linked to strong environmental carcinogens (for example, mutation patterns caused by tobacco smoke, ultraviolet radiation, or the fungal toxin aflatoxin) (<i>7</i>). Moreover, these forensic mutational patterns can be used to estimate how long it has taken for a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> to develop (<i>5</i>). On page 911 of this issue, Martincorena <i>et al.</i> (<i>8</i>) turned their attention toward the detection of mutations in normal tissue, addressing a long-standing paradox that mutations arise in normal tissues but do not necessarily lead to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>.</p>

Osteoblasts remotely supply lung tumors with cancer-promoting SiglecF<sup>high</sup> neutrophils
<p>Bone marrow–derived myeloid cells can accumulate within <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s and foster <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> outgrowth.

Animal studies reveal that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>-induced bone phenotype involves bone-resident osteocalcin-expressing (Ocn<sup>+</sup>) osteoblastic cells.

Use of CRISPR-modified human stem cell organoids to study the origin of mutational signatures in cancer

We used CRISPR-Cas9 technology to delete key DNA repair <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in human colon organoids, followed by delayed subcloning and whole-genome sequencing.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Unique Physiological and Transcriptional Shifts under Combinations of Salinity, Drought, and Heat
<p>Climate-change-driven stresses such as extreme temperatures, water deficit, and ion imbalance are projected to exacerbate and jeopardize global food security. Under field conditions, these stresses usually occur simultaneously and cause damages that exceed single stresses. Here, we investigated the transcriptional patterns and morpho-physiological acclimations of <i>Brachypodium dystachion</i> to single salinity, drought, and heat stresses, as well as their double and triple stress combinations. Hierarchical clustering analysis of morpho-physiological acclimations showed that several traits exhibited a gradually aggravating effect as plants were exposed to combined stresses. On the other hand, other morphological traits were dominated by salinity, while some physiological traits were shaped by heat stress. Response patterns of differentially expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, under single and combined stresses (i.e. common stress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s), were maintained only among 37% of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, indicating a limited expression consistency among partially overlapping stresses. A comparison between common stress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s that were uniquely expressed only under combined stresses (i.e. combination unique <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s) revealed a significant shift from increased intensity to antagonistic responses, respectively. The different transcriptional signatures imply an alteration in the mode of action under combined stresses and limited ability to predict plant responses as different stresses are combined. Coexpression analysis coupled with enrichment analysis revealed that each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> subset was enriched with different biological processes. Common stress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s were enriched with known stress response pathways, while combination unique-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s were enriched with unique processes and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s with unknown functions that hold the potential to improve stress tolerance and enhance cereal productivity under suboptimal field conditions.</p>

Molecular Characterization and Evolution of a Gene Family Encoding Both Female- and Male-Specific Reproductive Proteins in <i>Drosophila</i>
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> duplication is an important mechanism for the evolution of new reproductive proteins. However, in most cases, each resulting paralog continues to function within the same sex. To investigate the possibility that seminal fluid proteins arise through duplicates of female reproductive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s that become “co-opted” by males, we screened female reproductive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> for cases of duplication in which one of the resulting paralogs produces a protein in males that is transferred to females during mating. We identified a set of three tandemly duplicated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s that encode secreted serine-type endopeptidase homologs, two of which are expressed primarily in the female reproductive tract (RT), whereas the third is expressed specifically in the male RT and encodes a seminal fluid protein. Evolutionary and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> expression analyses across <i>Drosophila</i> species suggest that this family arose from a single-copy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> that was female-specific; after duplication, one paralog evolved male-specific expression. Functional tests of knockdowns of each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> in <i>D. melanogaster</i> show that one female-expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> is essential for full fecundity, and both female-expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s contribute singly or in combination to a female’s propensity to remate. In contrast, knockdown of the male-expressed paralog had no significant effect on female fecundity or remating. These data are consistent with a model in which members of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> family exert effects on females by acting on a common, female-expressed target. After duplication and male co-option of one paralog, the evolution of the interacting proteins could have resulted in differential strengths or effects of each paralog.</p>

Evidence for Selection on Gene Expression in Cultivated Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>)
<p>Artificial selection has been used throughout plant domestication and breeding to develop crops that are adapted to diverse environments. Here, we investigate whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> regulatory changes have been widespread targets of lineage-specific selection in cultivated lines Minghui 63 and Zhenshan 97 of rice, <i>Oryza sativa</i>. A line experiencing positive selection for either an increase or a decrease in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s' transcript abundances is expected to have an overabundance of expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) alleles that increase or decrease those <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s' expression, respectively. Results indicate that several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s that share <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> Ontology terms or are members of the same coexpression module have eQTL alleles from one parent that consistently increase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> expression relative to the second parent. A second line of evidence for lineage-specific selection is an overabundance of <i>cis–trans</i> pairs of eQTL alleles that affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> expression in the same direction (are reinforcing). Across all <i>cis–trans</i> pairs of eQTL, including pairs that both weakly and strongly affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> expression, there is no evidence for selection. However, the frequency of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s with reinforcing eQTL increases with eQTL strength. Therefore, there is evidence that eQTL with strong effects were positively selected during rice cultivation. Among 41 <i>cis–trans</i> pairs with strong <i>trans</i> eQTL, 31 have reinforcing eQTL. Several of the candidate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s under positive selection accurately predict phenotypic differences between Minghui 63 and Zhenshan 97. Overall, our results suggest that positive selection for regulatory alleles may be a key factor in plant improvement.</p>

Systematic Biology
Lateral Gene Transfer from the Dead
<p>In phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic studies, the evolution of molecular sequences is assumed to have taken place along the phylogeny traced by the ancestors of extant species. In the presence of lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> transfer, however, this may not be the case, because the species lineage from which a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> was transferred may have gone extinct or not have been sampled. Because it is not feasible to specify or reconstruct the complete phylogeny of all species, we must describe the evolution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s outside the represented phylogeny by modeling the speciation dynamics that gave rise to the complete phylogeny. We demonstrate that if the number of sampled species is small compared with the total number of existing species, the overwhelming majority of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> transfers involve speciation to and evolution along extinct or unsampled lineages. We show that the evolution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s along extinct or unsampled lineages can to good approximation be treated as those of independently evolving lineages described by a few global parameters. Using this result, we derive an algorithm to calculate the probability of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> tree and recover the maximum-likelihood reconciliation given the phylogeny of the sampled species. Examining 473 near-universal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families from 36 cyanobacteria, we find that nearly a third of transfer events (28%) appear to have topological signatures of evolution along extinct species, but only approximately 6% of transfers trace their ancestry to before the common ancestor of the sampled cyanobacteria.

VEGF–neuropilin-2 signaling promotes stem-like traits in breast cancer cells by TAZ-mediated repression of the Rac GAP β2-chimaerin
<p>The role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> is not only well known in the context of angio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>sis but also important in the functional regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells. Autocrine VEGF signaling mediated by its co-receptors called neuropilins (NRPs) appears to be essential for sustaining the proliferation and survival of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> stem cells (CSCs), which are implicated in mediating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> growth, progression, and drug resistance. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms involved in VEGF-mediated support of CSCs is critical to successfully treating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> patients. The expression of the Hippo effector TAZ is associated with breast CSCs and confers stem cell–like properties. We found that VEGF-NRP2 signaling contributed to the activation of TAZ in various breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells, which mediated a positive feedback loop that promoted mammosphere formation. VEGF-NRP2 signaling activated the GTPase Rac1, which inhibited the Hippo kinase LATS, thus leading to TAZ activity. In a complex with the transcription factor TEAD, TAZ then bound and repressed the promoter of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> encoding the Rac GTPase-activating protein (Rac GAP) β2-chimaerin. By activating GTP hydrolysis, Rac GAPs effectively turn off Rac signaling; hence, the TAZ-mediated repression of β2-chimaerin resulted in sustained Rac1 activity in CSCs. Depletion of β2-chimaerin in non-CSCs increased Rac1 activity, TAZ abundance, and mammosphere formation. Analysis of a breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> patient database revealed an inverse correlation between β2-chimaerin and TAZ expression in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s. Our findings highlight an unexpected role for β2-chimaerin in a feed-forward loop of TAZ activation and the acquisition of CSC properties.</p>

Blockade of surface-bound TGF-β on regulatory T cells abrogates suppression of effector T cell function in the tumor microenvironment
<p>Regulatory T cells (T<sub>regs</sub>) suppress anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> immunity by inhibiting the killing of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells by antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. To better understand the mechanisms involved, we used ex vivo three-dimensional collagen-fibrin gel cultures of dissociated B16 melanoma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s. This system recapitulated the in vivo suppression of antimelanoma immunity, rendering the dissociated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells resistant to killing by cocultured activated, antigen-specific T cells. Immunosuppression was not observed when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s excised from T<sub>reg</sub>-depleted mice were cultured in this system. Experiments with neutralizing antibodies showed that blocking transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) also prevented immunosuppression. Immunosuppression depended on cell-cell contact or cellular proximity because soluble factors from the collagen-fibrin gel cultures did not inhibit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cell killing by T cells. Moreover, intravital, two-photon microscopy showed that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-specific Pmel-1 effector T cells physically interacted with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-resident T<sub>regs</sub> in mice. T<sub>regs</sub> isolated from B16 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s alone were sufficient to suppress CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell–mediated killing, which depended on surface-bound TGF-β on the T<sub>regs</sub>. Immunosuppression of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells correlated with a decrease in the abundance of the cytolytic protein granzyme B and an increase in the cell surface amount of the immune checkpoint receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1). These findings suggest that contact between T<sub>regs</sub> and anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> T cells in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> microenvironment inhibits antimelanoma immunity in a TGF-β–dependent manner and highlight potential ways to inhibit intra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>al T<sub>regs</sub> therapeutically.</p>

Loss of SPDEF and gain of TGFBI activity after androgen deprivation therapy promote EMT and bone metastasis of prostate cancer
<p>Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) targeting the androgen receptor (AR) is a standard therapeutic regimen for treating prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>. However, most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s progress to metastatic castration-resistant prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> after ADT. We identified the type 1, 2, and 4 collagen–binding protein transforming growth factor–β (TGFβ)–induced protein (TGFBI) as an important factor in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and malignant progression of prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>. In prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cell lines, AR signaling stimulated the activity of the transcription factor SPDEF, which repressed the expression of <i>TGFBI</i>. ADT, AR antagonism, or overexpression of TGFBI inhibited the activity of SPDEF and enhanced the proliferation rates of prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells. Knockdown of TGFBI suppressed migration and proliferation in cultured cells and reduced prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> growth and brain and bone metastasis in xenograft models, extending the survival of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-bearing mice. Analysis of prostate tissue samples collected before and after ADT from the same patients showed that ADT reduced the nuclear abundance of SPDEF and increased the production of TGFBI. Our findings suggest that induction of TGFBI promotes prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> growth and metastasis and can be caused by dysregulation or therapeutic inhibition of AR signaling.</p>

The transcription factor MAFK induces EMT and malignant progression of triple-negative breast cancer cells through its target GPNMB
<p>Triple-negative breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> (TNBC) is particularly aggressive and difficult to treat. For example, the transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) pathway is implicated in TNBC progression and metastasis, but its opposing role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> suppression in healthy tissues and early-stage lesions makes it a challenging target. Therefore, additional molecular characterization of TNBC may lead to improved patient prognosis by informing the development and optimum use of targeted therapies. We found that musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma (MAF) onco<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> family protein K (MAFK), a member of the small MAF family of transcription factors that are induced by the TGF-β pathway, was abundant in human TNBC and aggressive mouse mammary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cell lines. MAFK promoted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>igenic growth and metastasis by 4T1 cells when implanted subcutaneously in mice. Overexpression of MAFK in mouse breast epithelial NMuMG cells induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotypes and promoted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> formation and invasion in mice. MAFK induced the expression of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> encoding the transmembrane glycoprotein nmb (GPNMB). Similar to MAFK, GPNMB overexpression in NMuMG cells induced EMT, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> formation, and invasion, in mice, whereas knockdown of MAFK in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells before implantation suppressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> growth and progression. <i>MAFK</i> and <i>GPNMB</i> expression correlated with poor prognosis in TNBC patients. These findings suggest that MAFK and its target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> <i>GPNMB</i> play important roles in the malignant progression of TNBC cells, offering potentially new therapeutic targets for TNBC patients.</p>

Reduced abundance of the E3 ubiquitin ligase E6AP contributes to decreased expression of the <i>INK4/ARF</i> locus in non–small cell lung cancer
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> suppressor p16<sup>INK4a</sup>, one protein encoded by the <i>INK4/ARF</i> locus, is frequently absent in multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s, including non–small cell lung <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> (NSCLC). Whereas increased methylation of the encoding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> (<i>CDKN2A</i>) accounts for its loss in a third of patients, no molecular explanation exists for the remainder. We unraveled an alternative mechanism for the silencing of the <i>INK4/ARF</i> locus involving the E3 ubiquitin ligase and transcriptional cofactor E6AP (also known as UBE3A). We found that the expression of three <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> suppressor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s encoded in the <i>INK4/ARF</i> locus (<i>p15</i><sup><i>INK4b</i></sup>, <i>p16</i><sup><i>INK4a</i></sup>, and <i>p19</i><sup><i>ARF</i></sup>) was decreased in <i>E6AP</i><sup><i>−/−</i></sup> mouse embryo fibroblasts. E6AP induced the expression of the <i>INK4/ARF</i> locus at the transcriptional level by inhibiting <i>CDC6</i> transcription, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> encoding a key repressor of the locus. Luciferase assays revealed that E6AP inhibited <i>CDC6</i> expression by reducing its E2F1-dependent transcription. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that E6AP reduced the amount of E2F1 at the <i>CDC6</i> promoter. In a subset of NSCLC samples, an E6AP-low/CDC6-high/p16<sup>INK4a</sup>-low protein abundance profile correlated with low methylation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> encoding p16<sup>INK4a</sup> (<i>CDKN2A</i>) and poor patient prognosis. These findings define a previously unrecognized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-suppressive role for E6AP in NSCLC, reveal an alternative silencing mechanism of the <i>INK4/ARF</i> locus, and reveal E6AP as a potential prognostic marker in NSCLC.</p>

Tissue-specificity in cancer: The rule, not the exception
<p>We are in the midst of a renaissance in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tics. Over the past several decades, candidate-based targeted sequencing efforts provided a steady stream of information on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic drivers for certain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> types. However, with recent technological advances in DNA sequencing, this stream has become a torrent of unbiased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic information revealing the frequencies and patterns of point mutations and copy number variations (CNVs) across the entire spectrum of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s. One of the most important observations from this work is that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic alterations in bona fide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> drivers (those <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s that, when mutated, promote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>i<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>sis) show a remarkable spectrum of tissue specificity: Alterations in certain driver <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s appear only in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s derived from one or a few tissue types (<i>1</i>). Only a handful of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> drivers [such as telomerase reverse transcriptase (<i>TERT</i>), <i>TP53</i>, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (<i>CDKN2A</i>) locus, and <i>MYC</i>] show broad tissue spectrums.

Tumor metastasis to lymph nodes requires YAP-dependent metabolic adaptation
<p>In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> patients, metastasis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s to sentinel lymph nodes (LNs) predicts disease progression and often guides treatment decisions. The mechanisms underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> LN metastasis are poorly understood. By using comparative transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses of primary and LN-metastatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s in mice, we found that LN metastasis requires that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells undergo a metabolic shift toward fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Transcriptional coactivator yes-associated protein (YAP) is selectively activated in LN-metastatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s, leading to the up-regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in the FAO signaling pathway. Pharmacological inhibition of FAO or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic ablation of YAP suppressed LN metastasis in mice. Several bioactive bile acids accumulated to high levels in the metastatic LNs, and these bile acids activated YAP in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells, likely through the nuclear vitamin D receptor. Inhibition of FAO or YAP may merit exploration as a potential therapeutic strategy for mitigating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> metastasis to LNs.</p>

Analysis of <i>Fusobacterium</i> persistence and antibiotic response in colorectal cancer

Genetics of Variable Disease Expression Conferred by Inverse Gene-For-Gene Interactions in the Wheat-<i>Parastagonospora nodorum</i> Pathosystem
<p>The wheat-<i>Parastagonospora nodorum</i> pathosystem involves the recognition of pathogen-secreted necrotrophic effectors (NEs) by corresponding wheat NE sensitivity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. This inverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>-for-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> recognition leads to necrotrophic effector-triggered susceptibility and ultimately septoria nodorum blotch disease. Here, we used multiple pathogen isolates to individually evaluate the effects of the host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>-NE interactions <i>Tan spot necrosis1</i>-Stagonospora nodorum ToxinA (<i>Tsn1</i>-SnToxA), <i>Stagonospora nodorum necrosis1</i>-Stagonospora nodorum Toxin1 (<i>Snn1</i>-SnTox1), and <i>Stagonospora nodorum necrosis3-B genome homeolog1</i>-Stagonospora nodorum Toxin3 (<i>Snn3-B1</i>-SnTox3), alone and in various combinations, to determine the relative importance of these interactions in causing disease. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic analysis of a recombinant inbred wheat population inoculated separately with three <i>P. nodorum</i> isolates, all of which produce all three NEs, indicated that the <i>Tsn1</i>-SnToxA and <i>Snn3-B1</i>-SnTox3 interactions contributed to disease caused by all four isolates, but their effects varied and ranged from epistatic to additive. The <i>Snn1</i>-SnTox1 interaction was associated with increased disease for one isolate, but for other isolates, there was evidence that this interaction inhibited the expression of other host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>-NE interactions. RNA sequencing analysis in planta showed that <i>SnTox1</i> was differentially expressed between these three isolates after infection. Further analysis of NE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>-knockout isolates showed that the effect of some interactions could be masked or inhibited by other compatible interactions, and the regulation of this occurs at the level of NE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> transcription. Collectively, these results show that the inverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>-for-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> interactions leading to necrotrophic effector-triggered susceptibility in the wheat-<i>P. nodorum</i> pathosystem vary in their effects depending on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic backgrounds of the pathogen and host, and interplay among the interactions is complex and intricately regulated.</p>

Out of Water: The Origin and Early Diversification of Plant <i>R</i>-Genes

However, GWA relies exclusively on statistical association, so functional validation is necessary to make strong claims about <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> function. We used a combination of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>-disruption platforms (Tnt1 retrotransposons, hairpin RNA-interference constructs, and CRISPR/Cas9 nucleases) together with randomized, well-replicated experiments to evaluate the function of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s that an earlier GWA study in <i>Medicago truncatula</i> had identified as candidates contributing to variation in the symbiosis between legumes and rhizobia. We evaluated ten candidate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s found in six clusters of strongly associated single nucleotide polymorphisms, selected on the basis of their strength of statistical association, proximity to annotated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> models, and root or nodule expression. We found statistically significant effects on nodule production for three candidate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, each validated in two independent mutants.

The canonical PP2A holoenzyme regulates multiple eukaryotic signaling pathways by dephosphorylating target proteins and contains a catalytic (C) subunit, a structural/scaffolding (A) subunit, and a regulatory (B) subunit. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s encoding PP2A subunits have expanded into multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families in both flowering plants and mammals, and the extent to which different isoform functions may overlap is not clearly understood. To gain insight into the diversification of PP2A subunits, we used phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic analyses to reconstruct the evolutionary histories of PP2A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s encoding PP2A subunits in mammals represent ancient lineages that expanded early in vertebrate evolution, while flowering plant PP2A subunit lineages evolved much more recently. Despite this temporal difference, our data indicate that the expansion of PP2A subunit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families in both flowering plants and animals was driven by whole-genome duplications followed by nonrandom <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> loss. Selection analysis suggests that the expansion of one B subunit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> family (B56/PPP2R5) was driven by functional diversification rather than by the maintenance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> dosage. We also observed reduced expansion rates in three distinct B subunit subclades. One of these subclades plays a highly conserved role in cell division, while the distribution of a second subclade suggests a specialized function in supporting beneficial microbial associations. Thus, while whole-genome duplications have driven the expansion and diversification of most PP2A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families, members of functionally specialized subclades quickly revert to singleton status after duplication events.</p>

Histone Modifications Define Expression Bias of Homoeologous Genomes in Allotetraploid Cotton
<p>Histone modifications regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> expression in eukaryotes, but their roles in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> expression changes in interspecific hybrids or allotetraploids are poorly understood. Histone modifications can be mapped by immunostaining of metaphase chromosomes at the single cell level and/or by chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) for analyzing individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. Here, we comparatively analyzed immunostained metaphase chromosomes and ChIP-seq of individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, which revealed a chromatin basis for biased homoeologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> expression in polyploids. We examined H3K4me3 density and transcriptome maps in root-tip cells of allotetraploid cotton (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>). The overall H3K4me3 levels were relatively equal between A and D chromosomes, which were consistent with equal numbers of expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s between the two subgenomes. However, intensities per chromosomal area were nearly twice as high in the D homeologs as in the A homeologs. Consistent with the cytological observation, ChIP-seq analysis showed that more D homeologs with biased H3K4me3 levels than A homeologs with biased modifications correlated with the greater number of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s with D-biased expression than that with A-biased expression in most homeologous chromosome pairs. Two chromosomes displayed different expression levels compared with other chromosomes, which correlate with known translocations and may affect the local chromatin structure and expression levels for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s involved. This example of genome-wide histone modifications that determine expression bias of homeologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in allopolyploids provides a molecular basis for the evolution and domestication of polyploid species, including many important crops.</p>

The Roles of Mutation, Selection, and Expression in Determining Relative Rates of Evolution in Mitochondrial versus Nuclear Genomes
<p>Eukaryotes rely on proteins encoded by the nuclear and mitochondrial (mt) genomes, which interact within multisubunit complexes such as oxidative-phosphorylation enzymes. Although selection is thought to be less efficient on the asexual mt genome, in bilaterian animals the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions (<i>ω</i>) is lower in mt- compared with nuclear-encoded OXPHOS subunits, suggesting <i>stronger</i> effects of purifying selection in the mt genome. Because high levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> expression constrain protein sequence evolution, one proposed resolution to this paradox is that mt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s are expressed more highly than nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. To test this hypothesis, we investigated expression and sequence evolution of mt and nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s from 84 diverse eukaryotes that vary in mt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> content and mutation rate. We found that the relationship between mt and nuclear <i>ω</i> values varied dramatically across eukaryotes. In contrast, transcript abundance is consistently higher for mt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s than nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, regardless of which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s happen to be in the mt genome. Consequently, expression levels cannot be responsible for the differences in <i>ω</i>. Rather, 84% of the variance in the ratio of <i>ω</i> values between mt and nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s could be explained by differences in mutation rate between the two genomes. We relate these findings to the hypothesis that high rates of mt mutation select for compensatory changes in the nuclear genome. We also propose an explanation for why mt transcripts consistently outnumber their nuclear counterparts, with implications for mitonuclear protein imbalance and aging.</p>

The Genotype–Phenotype Map of Yeast Complex Traits: Basic Parameters and the Role of Natural Selection
<p>Most phenotypic traits are controlled by many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, but a global picture of the genotype–phenotype map (GPM) is lacking. For example, in no species do we know <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>rally how many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s affect a trait and how large these effects are. It is also unclear to what extent GPMs are shaped by natural selection. Here we address these fundamental questions using the reverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic data of 220 morphological traits in 4,718 budding yeast strains, each of which lacks a nonessential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>. We show that 1) the proportion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s affecting a trait varies from <1% to >30%, averaging 6%, 2) most traits are impacted by many more small-effect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s than large-effect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, and 3) the mean effect of all nonessential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s on a trait decreases precipitously as the estimated importance of the trait to fitness increases. An analysis of 3,116 yeast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> expression traits in 754 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>-deletion strains reveals a similar pattern. These findings illustrate the power of genome-wide reverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tics in genotype–phenotype mapping, uncover an enormous range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic complexity of phenotypic traits, and suggest that the GPM of cellular organisms has been shaped by natural selection for mutational robustness.</p>

The tissue-specific transcriptomic landscape of the mid-gestational mouse embryo
<p>Differential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> expression is a prerequisite for the formation of multiple cell types from the fertilized egg during embryo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>sis. Understanding the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> regulatory networks controlling cellular differentiation requires the identification of crucial differentially expressed control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s and, ideally, the determination of the complete transcriptomes of each individual cell type. Here, we have analyzed the transcriptomes of six major tissues dissected from mid-gestational (TS12) mouse embryos. Approximately one billion reads derived by RNA-seq analysis provided extended transcript lengths, novel first exons and alternative transcripts of known <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. We have identified 1375 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s showing tissue-specific expression, providing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> signatures for each of the six tissues. In addition, we have identified 1403 novel putative long noncoding RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> loci, 439 of which show differential expression. Our analysis provides the first complete transcriptome data for the mouse embryo. It offers a rich data source for the analysis of individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> regulatory networks controlling mid-gestational development.</p>

Minimal functional driver gene heterogeneity among untreated metastases
<p>Metastases are responsible for the majority of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>-related deaths. Although genomic hetero<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>ity within primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s is associated with relapse, hetero<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>ity among treatment-naive metastases has not been comprehensively assessed. We analyzed sequencing data for 76 untreated metastases from 20 patients and inferred <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> phylogenies for breast, colorectal, endometrial, gastric, lung, melanoma, pancreatic, and prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s. We found that within individual patients, a large majority of driver <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> mutations are common to all metastases. Further analysis revealed that the driver <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> mutations that were not shared by all metastases are unlikely to have functional consequences. A mathematical model of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> evolution and metastasis formation provides an explanation for the observed driver <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> homo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>ity. Thus, single biopsies capture most of the functionally important mutations in metastases and therefore provide essential information for therapeutic decision-making.</p>

Fusion oncogenes—genetic musical chairs
<p>The cyto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic definitions of many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s predate the genome sequencing era. Indeed, some classes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s (largely subtypes of sarcomas, lymphomas, and leukemias) have long been defined by simple and distinct patterns of chromosomal changes, or karyotypes, that, in many cases, feature a single pathognomonic somatic translocation of two genomic regions that creates a fusion onco<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> (for example, the Philadelphia chromosome translocation in chronic myelogenous leukemia results in the <i>BCR-ABL1</i> fusion onco<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>) (<i>1</i>). Whereas many common <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s display genomic complexity consistent with multistep onco<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>sis, such as carcinomas of breast and lung, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s that are defined by translocations typically display simple karyotypes, suggesting that they were shaped by a single translocation. However, the cyto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic simplicity of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s may mask more complex genomic events. On page 891 of this issue, Anderson <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) report whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of 50 Ewing sarcomas (EWSs), an aggressive sarcoma that is defined by fusion between the EWS RNA binding protein 1 (<i>EWSR1</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> on chromosome 22 and an E26 transformation-specific (ETS) family transcription factor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>, either <i>FLI1</i> at 11q24 or <i>ERG</i> at 21q11 (<i>3</i>). Anderson <i>et al.</i> show that ∼40% of <i>EWSR1-FLI1</i> fusions and all <i>EWSR1-ERG</i> fusions arise via a complex rearrangement pattern called chromoplexy, which was first identified in prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> (<i>4</i>). They suggest that chromoplexy “bursts” may be early initiating events in Ewing sarcoma<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>sis and mark a more aggressive form of the disease.</p>

If two deletions don't stop growth, try three
<p>How many and which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s does an organism need at a minimum to sustain growth? With the identification of essential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in a variety of organisms such as yeast (<i>1</i>), worms (<i>2</i>), and human cultured cells (<i>3</i>–<i>5</i>), the answer may seem obvious: Remove all nonessential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, and the organism should be able to continue to survive and grow. In the yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, the workhorse of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic interaction mapping, ∼1000 of the ∼6000 (∼17%) protein-coding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s are essential for viability (<i>1</i>). So theoretically, one might think that one could remove the other ∼5000 nonessential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s and still have a growing yeast. The reason this does not work is that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s interact with each other to drive different traits, including viability and growth. On page 283 of this issue, Kuzmin <i>et al.</i> (<i>6</i>) provide the first systematic analysis of trigenic interactions in yeast in which three <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> deletions are combined in individual strains in order to ascertain the importance of multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> interactions for growth. This study shows that higher-order <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic interactions are abundant, which has implications for the interpretation of human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> variants that may interact to affect health and disease.</p>

A pathology atlas of the human cancer transcriptome
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> is one of the leading causes of death, and there is great interest in understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in the patho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>sis and progression of individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s. We used systems-level approaches to analyze the genome-wide transcriptome of the protein-coding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s of 17 major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> types with respect to clinical outcome. A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>ral pattern emerged: Shorter patient survival was associated with up-regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s involved in cell growth and with down-regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s involved in cellular differentiation. Using genome-scale metabolic models, we show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> patients have widespread metabolic hetero<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>ity, highlighting the need for precise and personalized medicine for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> treatment. All data are presented in an interactive open-access database (<ext-link>www.proteinatlas.org/pathology</ext-link>) to allow genome-wide exploration of the impact of individual proteins on clinical outcomes.</p>

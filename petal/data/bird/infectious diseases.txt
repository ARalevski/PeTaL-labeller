Mouse models of acute and chronic hepacivirus infection
<p>An estimated 71 million people worldwide are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ed with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hepat</span></strong>itis C virus (HCV). The lack of small-animal models has impeded studies of antiviral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e mechanisms. Here we show that an HCV-related hepacivirus discovered in Norway rats can establish high-titer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hepat</span></strong>otropic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ions in laboratory mice with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ological features resembling those seen in human viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hepat</span></strong>itis. Whereas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e-compromised mice developed persistent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e-competent mice cleared the virus within 3 to 5 weeks. Acute clearance was T cell dependent and associated with liver injury. Transient depletion of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells before <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion resulted in chronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion, characterized by high levels of intra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hepat</span></strong>ic regulatory T cells and expression of inhibitory molecules on intra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hepat</span></strong>ic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Natural killer cells controlled early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion but were not essential for viral clearance. This model may provide mechanistic insights into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hepat</span></strong>ic antiviral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity, a prerequisite for the development of HCV vaccines.</p>

<i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> Induces the Expression of a MicroRNA to Suppress the Immune Response in Rice
<p>MicroRNAs play crucial roles in plant responses to pathogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ions. The rice blast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e, caused by the fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>, is the most important <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). To explore the microRNA species that participate in rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity against the rice blast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e, we compared the expression of small RNAs between mock- and <i>M. oryzae</i>-treated rice. We found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion by <i>M. oryzae</i> strain Guy11 specifically induced the expression of rice miR319 and, consequently, suppressed its target gene <i>TEOSINTE BRANCHED/CYCLOIDEA/PROLIFERATING CELL FACTOR1</i> (<i>OsTCP21</i>), which encodes a transcription factor. Using transgenic rice that overexpresses miR319b (OE) or expresses <i>OsTCP21</i>-Res (which is resistant to miR319-mediated silencing), we found that <i>OsTCP21</i> is a positive regulator of the rice defense response against the blast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e. When wild-type and miR319b-OE rice were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ed by Guy11, multiple jasmonic acid (JA) synthetic and signaling components were suppressed, indicating that Guy11 suppresses JA signaling through inducing miR319. In particular, we found that <i>LIPOXYGENASE2</i> (<i>LOX2</i>) and <i>LOX5</i> were specifically suppressed by miR319 overexpression or by Guy11 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion. LOXs are the key enzymes of JA synthesis, which catalyze the conversion of α-linoleic acid to hydroperoxy-octadecadienoic acid. The application of α-linoleic acid rescued <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e symptoms on the <i>OsTCP21</i>-Res rice but not wild-type rice, supporting our hypothesis that <i>OsLOX2</i> and <i>OsLOX5</i> are the key JA synthesis genes hijacked by Guy11 to subvert host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity and facilitate pathogenicity. We propose that induced expression of <i>OsLOX2/5</i> may improve resistance to the rice blast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e.</p>

A viral aphrodisiac in the cricket <i>Gryllus texensis</i>
<p>We identified the insect iridovirus IIV-6/CrIV as a pathogen of the cricket <i>Gryllus texensis</i> using electron microscopy (EM) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. EM showed that the virus attacks the fat body, an organ important for protein production, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e function and lipid storage. During <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion the fat body hypertrophied, but egg production withered, leaving the lateral oviducts empty of eggs; the females were effectively sterile. EM of the testis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ed males suggests that the testis was not invaded by the virus, although sperm taken from the spermatophores of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ed males showed little or no motility. Nevertheless, males and females continued to mate when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ed. In fact, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ed males were quicker to court females than un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ed controls. The virus benefits from the continued sexual behaviour of its host; transmission studies show that the virus can be spread through sexual contact. Sickness behaviour, the adaptive reduction of feeding and sexual behaviour that is induced by an activated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e system, was absent in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ed crickets. Total haemolymph protein was reduced, as was phenoloxidase activity, suggesting a reduction in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e protein production by the fat body. The evidence suggests that during IIV-6/CrIV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e signal(s) that induces sickness behaviour is absent. Curtailment of a host's sickness behaviour may be necessary for any pathogen that is spread by host sexual behaviour.</p>

Functional outcome of debridement, antibiotics and implant retention in periprosthetic joint infection involving the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Advocates of debridement, antibiotics and implant retention (DAIR)   in hip periprosthetic joint <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion (PJI) argue that a procedure   not disturbing a sound prosthesis-bone interface is likely to lead   to better survival and functional outcome compared with revision.   This case-control study aims were to compare outcome of DAIRs for   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ed primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) with outcomes following   primary THA and two-stage revision of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ed primary THAs.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We retrospectively reviewed all DAIRs, performed for confirmed   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ed primary hip arthropasty (n = 82) at out institution, between   1997 and 2013. Data recorded included full patient information and   type of surgery. Outcome measures included complications, mortality,   implant survivorship and functional outcome. Outcome was compared with   two control groups matched for gender and age; a cohort of primary   THAs (n = 120) and a cohort of two-stage revisions for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion   (n = 66).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Mean age at DAIR was 69 years (33 to 87) and mean follow-up was   eight years (2 to 17; standard deviation (<sc>sd)</sc> 5). A total   of 52 (63%) of DAIRs were for early PJI (less than six weeks). Greater   success in the eradication of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion with DAIR was identified   with early PJI, comprising an interval less than a week between   onset of symptoms and exchange of modular components with the DAIR   procedure. Eradication of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion, complications and re-operation   rates were similar in the DAIR and two-stage revision groups. For   hips with successful eradication of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion with DAIR, the five-year   survival (98%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 94 to 100) was similar   to the primary THA group (98%; 95% CI 95 to 100) (n = 43; p = 0.3).   The DAIR group had inferior mean Oxford Hip Scores (OHS) (38; 12   to 48) compared with the primary THA group (42; 15 to 48) (p = 0.02)   but a significantly better mean OHS compared with the two-stage   revision group (31; 0 to 48) (p = 0.008). Patients who required   only one DAIR for eradication of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion had a similar mean OHS   (41; 20 to 48) to the primary THA group (p = 0.2).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The DAIR procedure is associated with a similar complication   rate and ability to eradicate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion as two-stage revision. This   study emphasises the need for exchange of modular components for   improved chances of eradication of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion.

Disease Models & Mechanisms
Functional analysis of a zebrafish <i>myd88</i> mutant identifies key transcriptional components of the innate immune system
<p>Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are an important class of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that recognize microbial and danger signals. Their downstream signaling upon ligand binding is vital for initiation of the innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e response. In human and mammalian models, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MYD88) is known for its central role as an adaptor molecule in interleukin 1 receptor (IL-1R) and TLR signaling. The zebrafish is increasingly used as a complementary model system for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e research and drug screening. Here, we describe a zebrafish line with a truncated version of MyD88 as the first zebrafish mutant for a TLR signaling component. We show that this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e-compromised mutant has a lower survival rate under standard rearing conditions and is more susceptible to challenge with the acute bacterial pathogens <i>Edwardsiella tarda</i> and <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i>. Microarray and quantitative PCR analysis revealed that expression of genes for transcription factors central to innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity (including NF-ĸB and AP-1) and the pro-inflammatory cytokine Il1b, is dependent on MyD88 signaling during these bacterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ions. Nevertheless, expression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e genes independent of MyD88 in the <i>myd88</i> mutant line was sufficient to limit growth of an attenuated <i>S. typhimurium</i> strain. In the case of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion with the chronic bacterial pathogen <i>Mycobacterium marinum</i>, we show that MyD88 signaling has an important protective role during early pathogenesis. During mycobacterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion, the <i>myd88</i> mutant shows accelerated formation of granuloma-like aggregates and increased bacterial burden, with associated lower induction of genes central to innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity. This zebrafish <i>myd88</i> mutant will be a valuable tool for further study of the role of IL1R and TLR signaling in the innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity processes underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es, inflammatory disorders and cancer.</p>

B cells, CMV, and stem cell transplant
<p>Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a potentially curative therapy for various malignant and nonmalignant conditions but can be complicated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ions such as reactivation of cytomegalovirus (CMV). CMV is a ubiquitous DNA herpes virus comprising various distinct strains (<i>1</i>). Around 60 to 90% of healthy adults are seropositive, indicating past exposure to the virus, although <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ions in healthy people are often mild or asymptomatic. After initial acute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion, CMV enters a latent phase, similar to other herpes viruses. It has been suggested that CMV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion may confer an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ological benefit, perhaps explaining its prevalence, because comparison of seropositive and seronegative individuals has shown that CMV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion results in greater responses to the flu vaccine (<i>2</i>). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e system is essential to control the initial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion and to prevent later CMV reactivation, as demonstrated by the high incidence of CMV reactivation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>osuppressed patients such as HSCT recipients. Whereas the incidence and severity of CMV transcriptional reactivation and cell-to-cell dissemination after HSCT has substantially diminished since the adoption of prophylactic or preemptive antiviral therapies (<i>3</i>), CMV remains the most important viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion after HSCT, especially in high-risk patients (such as seropositive recipients of seronegative donors), and can lead to life-threatening CMV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e in ∼10% of HSCT recipients (<i>4</i>). On page 288 of this issue, Martins <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) make the unexpected observation, in mice undergoing bone marrow transplantation (BMT) as a model of HSCT, that strain-specific CMV antibodies made by host B cells play a crucial role in preventing CMV dissemination after BMT. They propose that passive transfer of antibodies that are matched to the latent CMV strain in HSCT recipients might constitute a powerful and easy therapeutic approach to prevent CMV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e.</p>

Reovirus infection triggers inflammatory responses to dietary antigens and development of celiac disease
<p>Viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ions have been proposed to elicit pathological processes leading to the initiation of T helper 1 (T<sub>H</sub>1) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity against dietary gluten and celiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e (CeD). To test this hypothesis and gain insights into mechanisms underlying virus-induced loss of tolerance to dietary antigens, we developed a viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion model that makes use of two reovirus strains that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong> the intestine but differ in their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>opathological outcomes. Reovirus is an avirulent pathogen that elicits protective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity, but we discovered that it can nonetheless disrupt intestinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e homeostasis at inductive and effector sites of oral tolerance by suppressing peripheral regulatory T cell (pT<sub>reg</sub>) conversion and promoting T<sub>H</sub>1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity to dietary antigen. Initiation of T<sub>H</sub>1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity to dietary antigen was dependent on interferon regulatory factor 1 and dissociated from suppression of pT<sub>reg</sub> conversion, which was mediated by type-1 interferon. Last, our study in humans supports a role for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion with reovirus, a seemingly innocuous virus, in triggering the development of CeD.</p>

Factors affecting the rate of surgical site infection in patients after hemiarthroplasty of the hip following a fracture of the neck of the femur
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Surgical site <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion can be a devastating complication of   hemiarthroplasty of the hip, when performed in elderly patients   with a displaced fracture of the femoral neck. It results in a prolonged   stay in hospital, a poor outcome and increased costs. Many studies   have identified risk and prognostic factors for deep <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion.   However, most have combined the rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion following total   hip arthroplasty and internal fixation as well as hemiarthroplasty, despite   the fact that they are different entities.

Phenotypic Consequences of a Genetic Predisposition to Enhanced Nitric Oxide Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Nitric oxide signaling plays a key role in the regulation of vascular tone and platelet activation. Here, we seek to understand the impact of a genetic predisposition to enhanced nitric oxide signaling on risk for cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es, thus informing the potential utility of pharmacological stimulation of the nitric oxide pathway as a therapeutic strategy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We analyzed the association of common and rare genetic variants in 2 genes that mediate nitric oxide signaling (Nitric Oxide Synthase 3 [<i>NOS3</i>] and Guanylate Cyclase 1, Soluble, Alpha 3 [<i>GUCY1A3</i>]) with a range of human phenotypes.

MAVS-dependent host species range and pathogenicity of human hepatitis A virus
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hepat</span></strong>otropic viruses are important causes of human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e, but the intra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hepat</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hepat</span></strong>itis viruses is poorly understood because of a lack of tractable small- animal models. We describe a murine model of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hepat</span></strong>itis A virus (HAV) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion that recapitulates critical features of type A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hepat</span></strong>itis in humans. We demonstrate that the capacity of HAV to evade MAVS-mediated type I interferon responses defines its host species range. HAV-induced liver injury was associated with interferon-independent intrinsic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hepat</span></strong>ocellular apoptosis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hepat</span></strong>ic inflammation that unexpectedly resulted from MAVS and IRF3/7 signaling. This murine model thus reveals a previously undefined link between innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e responses to virus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion and acute liver injury, providing a new paradigm for viral pathogenesis in the liver.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Aphid-borne Viral Spread Is Enhanced by Virus-induced Accumulation of Plant Reactive Oxygen Species
<p>Most known plant viruses are spread from plant to plant by insect vectors. There is strong evidence that nonpersistently transmitted viruses manipulate the release of plant volatiles to attract insect vectors, thereby promoting virus spread. The mechanisms whereby aphid settling and feeding is altered on plants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ed with these viruses, however, are unclear. Here we employed loss-of-function mutations in cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) and one of its host plants, tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>), to elucidate such mechanisms. We show that, relative to a CMVΔ2b strain with a deletion of the viral suppressor of RNAi 2b protein in CMV, plants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ed with wild-type CMV produce higher concentrations of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in plant tissues. Aphids on wild-type CMV-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ed plants engage in shorter probes, less phloem feeding, and exhibit other changes, as detected by electrical penetration graphing technology, relative to CMVΔ2b-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ed plants. Therefore, the frequency of virus acquisition and the virus load per aphid were greater on CMV-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ed plants than on CMVΔ2b-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ed plants. Aphids also moved away from initial feeding sites more frequently on wild-type CMV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ed versus CMVΔ2b-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ed plants. The role of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in eliciting these effects on aphids was corroborated using healthy plants infused with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Finally, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels were not elevated, and aphid behavior was unchanged, on CMV-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ed RbohD-silenced tobacco plants, which are deficient in the induction of ROS production. These results suggest that CMV uses its viral suppressor of RNAi protein to increase plant ROS levels, thereby enhancing its acquisition and transmission by vector insects.</p>

Genetic and phenotypically flexible components of seasonal variation in immune function
<p>Animals cope with seasonal variation in environmental factors by adjustments of physiology and life history. When seasonal variation is partly predictable, such adjustments can be based on a genetic component or be phenotypically flexible. Animals have to allocate limited resources over different demands, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e function. Accordingly, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e traits could change seasonally, and such changes could have a genetic component that differs between environments. We tested this hypothesis in genotypically distinct groups of a widespread songbird, the stonechat (<i>Saxicola torquata</i>). We compared variation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity during 1 year in long-distance migrants, short-distance migrants, tropical residents and hybrids in a common garden environment. Additionally, we investigated phenotypically flexible responses to temperature by applying different temperature regimes to one group. We assessed constitutive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity by measuring hemagglutination, hemolysis, haptoglobin and bactericidal ability against <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. Genotypic groups differed in patterns of variation of all measured <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e indices except haptoglobin. Hybrids differed from, but were rarely intermediate to, parental subspecies. Temperature treatment only influenced patterns of hemolysis and bactericidal ability against <i>E. coli.</i> We conclude that seasonal variation in constitutive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity has a genetic component, that heredity does not follow simple Mendelian rules, and that some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e measures are relatively rigid while others are more flexible. Furthermore, our results support the idea that seasonal variability in constitutive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity is associated with variability in environment and annual-cycle demands. This study stresses the importance of considering seasonal variation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e function in relation to the ecology and life history of the organism of interest.</p>

A case–control study of surgical site infection following operative fixation of fractures of the ankle in a large UK trauma unit
<p>Most of the literature on surgical site <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ions   following the surgical treatment of fractures of the ankle is based   on small series of patients, focusing on diabetics or the elderly.   None have described post-operative functional scores in those patients   who develop an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion. We performed an age- and gender-matched   case–control study to identify patient- and surgery-related risk   factors for surgical site <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion following open reduction and   internal fixation of a fracture of the ankle. Logistic regression   analysis was used to identify significant risk factors for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion   and to calculate odds ratios (OR). Function was assessed using the   Olerud and Molander Ankle Score. The incidence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion was   4% (29/717) and 1.1% (8/717) were deep <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ions. The median ankle   score was significantly lower in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion group compared with   the control group (60 <i>vs</i> 90, Mann–Whitney test   p < 0.0001). Multivariate regression analysis showed that diabetes   (OR = 15, p = 0.031), nursing home residence (OR = 12, p = 0.018)   and Weber C fractures (OR = 4, p = 0.048) were significant risk   factors for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion.</p><p>A low incidence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion following open reduction and internal   fixation of fractures of the ankle was observed.

Immunity as a continuum of archetypes
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e system has long been recognized for its importance in eliminating pathogens. Recently, it has become appreciated for additional distinct roles in normal tissue biology, contributing to tissue development and maintenance. Further, it is being revealed as a major force in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es as diverse as fibrosis, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer's <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e, as well as cancer. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e system is exquisitely selective; more than a billion different adaptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e lymphocytes (T cells and B cells) survey the body. These can individually be sensitized to antigens—for example, by vaccination—leading to their expansion and to a rapid and protective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e response that destroys antigen-bearing cells upon reexposure. Alternatively, the system can become “tolerant” when antigen-specific T cells and/or B cells are deleted or inactivated. Historically, activation versus inaction (tolerance) have dominated views of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e system. These, however, should be considered the extremes of a continuum of “archetypal” response states that collections of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e cells can take, many of which serve to accommodate dynamic tissue function.</p>

Bacteriophage trigger antiviral immunity and prevent clearance of bacterial infection
<p>Bacteriophage are abundant at sites of bacterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion, but their effects on mammalian hosts are unclear. We have identified pathogenic roles for filamentous Pf bacteriophage produced by <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> (<i>Pa</i>) in suppression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity against bacterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion. Pf promote <i>Pa</i> wound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion in mice and are associated with chronic human <i>Pa</i> wound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ions. Murine and human leukocytes endocytose Pf, and internalization of this single-stranded DNA virus results in phage RNA production. This triggers Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)– and TIR domain–containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF)–dependent type I interferon production, inhibition of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and the suppression of phagocytosis. Conversely, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ization of mice against Pf prevents <i>Pa</i> wound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion. Thus, Pf triggers maladaptive innate viral pattern-recognition responses, which impair bacterial clearance. Vaccination against phage virions represents a potential strategy to prevent bacterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion.</p>

Choline acetyltransferase–expressing T cells are required to control chronic viral infection
<p>Although widely studied as a neurotransmitter, T cell–derived acetylcholine (ACh) has recently been reported to play an important role in regulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity. However, the role of lymphocyte-derived ACh in viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion is unknown. Here, we show that the enzyme choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), which catalyzes the rate-limiting step of ACh production, is robustly induced in both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells during lymphocytic chorio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mening</span></strong>itis virus (LCMV) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion in an IL-21–dependent manner. Deletion of <i>Chat</i> within the T cell compartment in mice ablated vasodilation in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion, impaired the migration of antiviral T cells into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ed tissues, and ultimately compromised the control of chronic LCMV clone 13 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion.

Slowing blood flow to fight viral infection
<p>Cytotoxic T lymphocytes are the assassins of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e system, delivering cell death through direct interactions with virally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ed or cancerous cells. To successfully execute their mission, these CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells must navigate a number of key steps, including sensing and entering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ed tissues, locating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ed cells in the vast tissue space, and supplying the precise mediators or interactions needed to elicit target cell death. Failure, or viral interference, at any of these steps can have devastating consequences for the host, including the establishment of viral persistence. Although some of the pathways and mechanisms involved in T cell purging of viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion are well understood, the rate of local blood flow in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ed tissue has not been carefully explored as a factor mediating viral clearance. On page 639 of this issue, Cox <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) demonstrate that T cells express the prototypical neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh), which dilates blood vessels, slowing blood flow enough to enhance T cell entry into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ed tissues and ultimately allowing clearance of chronic viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion.</p>

Understanding Lassa fever
<p>Lassa fever is a viral hemorrhagic fever prevalent in West Africa that has been gaining international attention as an emerging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e with the potential to cause epidemics (<i>1</i>). Confirmed and suspected cases of Lassa fever have been steadily rising in Nigeria over the past 3 years. Laboratory-confirmed cases have increased from 106 in 2016 to 143 in 2017 and had already reached 562 by November 2018 (<i>2</i>). Part of defining the scope of the problem is trying to assess whether this is a true increase in the number of people afflicted by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion, due to either changes in the virus itself or the geographical spread of the vector (rodents of the <i>Mastomys</i> spp.), or a reflection of higher rates of detection and diagnosis secondary to the increased attention and interest of clinicians and laboratorians (<i>1</i>). Lassa fever outbreaks illustrate the issues associated with the response and management of emerging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es: How do you plan the public health, clinical, and community responses to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e while you are still learning about the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">epidemiolog</span></strong>y, pathophysiology, and the ecological factors contributing to the spread of the pathogen? On page 74 of this issue, Kafetzopoulou <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) present the results of a rapid genomic study of Lassa virus (LASV) from the cases of 2018, which have improved understanding of how the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e has been spreading in Nigeria and have led to informed and targeted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e-control strategies. The study also further describes the use of a new and compact genomic sequencing device, which may start playing a larger role in defining other emerging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e outbreaks in real time.</p>

Tropism for tuft cells determines immune promotion of norovirus pathogenesis
<p>Complex interactions between host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity and the microbiome regulate norovirus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion. However, the mechanism of host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e promotion of enteric virus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion remains obscure. The cellular tropism of noroviruses is also unknown. Recently, we identified CD300lf as a murine norovirus (MNoV) receptor. In this study, we have shown that tuft cells, a rare type of intestinal epithelial cell, express CD300lf and are the target cell for MNoV in the mouse intestine. We found that type 2 cytokines, which induce tuft cell proliferation, promote MNoV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion in vivo. These cytokines can replace the effect of commensal microbiota in promoting virus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion. Our work thus provides insight into how the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e system and microbes can coordinately promote enteric viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion.</p>

Dengue may bring out the worst in Zika
<p>Mice infused against either dengue or West Nile virus became far more susceptible to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e and death from Zika virus, a new study published online in <i>Science</i> shows. The mice, engineered to cripple an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e gene that normally helps suppress Zika virus, of course may not represent what happens in humans. But antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is a well-known phenomenon with dengue, which has four “serotypes” that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong> humans. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion with one dengue serotype typically causes little harm, but the antibodies produced against it can set a people up for severe and even deadly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e if they subsequently become <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ed by a different serotype. Dengue, West Nile, and Zika are all from the flavivirus family and the researchers warn that a vaccine against one could put a person at risk for ADE from a relative. Dengue is closet to Zika, and indeed the mouse experiment showed that dengue antibodies led to the most severe Zika <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e. ADE also led to high levels of virus in mouse testes and spinal cords, which may help explain sexual transmission of Zika in humans and central nervous system <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es like microcephaly in babies and Guillain-Barré Syndrome in adults.</p>

Modulation of Plant Salicylic Acid-Associated Immune Responses via Glycosylation of Dihydroxybenzoic Acids
<p>Salicylic acid (SA) plays a crucial role in plant innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity. The deployment of SA-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e responses is primarily affected by SA concentration, which is determined by a balance between SA biosynthesis and catabolism. However, the mechanisms regulating SA homeostasis are poorly understood. In this study, we characterized a unique UDP-glycosyltransferase, UGT76D1, which plays an important role in SA homeostasis and associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e responses in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Expression of <i>UGT76D1</i> was induced by treatment with both the pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv. <i>tomato</i> (<i>Pst</i>) DC3000 and SA. Overexpression of <i>UGT76D1</i> resulted in high SA accumulation, significant up-regulation of pathogen-related genes, and a hypersensitive response (HR)-like lesion mimic phenotype. This HR-like phenotype was not observed following <i>UGT76D1</i> overexpression in SA-deficient <i>NahG</i> transgenic or <i>sid2</i> plants, suggesting that the phenotype is SA dependent. Biochemical assays showed that UGT76D1 glycosylated 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,3-DHBA) and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,5-DHBA), the major catabolic forms of SA, to their Glc and Xyl conjugates in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, in a mutant background blocked in the formation of 2,3-DHBA and 2,5-DHBA, <i>UGT76D1</i> overexpression did not cause a HR-like lesion mimic phenotype. Following <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion with <i>Pst</i> DC3000, <i>UGT76D1</i> knockout mutants displayed a delayed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e response, with reduced levels of DHBA glycosides and SA, and down-regulated SA synthase expression. By contrast, <i>UGT76D1</i> overexpression lines showed an enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e response and increased SA biosynthesis before and after pathogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion. Thus, we propose that UGT76D1 plays an important role in SA homeostasis and plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e responses by facilitating glycosylation of dihydroxybenzoic acids.</p>

Analysis of the ZAR1 Immune Complex Reveals Determinants for Immunity and Molecular Interactions<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plants depend on innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity to prevent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e. Plant pathogenic bacteria, like <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> and <i>Xanthomonas campestris</i>, use the type III secretion system as a molecular syringe to inject type III secreted effector (T3SE) proteins in plants. The primary function of most T3SEs is to suppress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity; however, the plant can evolve nucleotide-binding domain-leucine-rich repeat domain-containing proteins to recognize specific T3SEs. The AtZAR1 NLR induces strong defense responses against <i>P. syringae</i> and <i>X. campestris</i>. The <i>P. syringae</i> T3SE HopZ1a is an acetyltransferase that acetylates the pseudokinase AtZED1 and triggers recognition by AtZAR1. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that lead to AtZAR1-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity in response to HopZ1a. We established a transient expression system in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> to study detailed interactions among HopZ1a, AtZED1, and AtZAR1. We show that the AtZAR1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e pathway is conserved in <i>N. benthamiana</i> and identify AtZAR1 domains, and residues in AtZAR1 and AtZED1, that are important for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity and protein-protein interactions in planta and in yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>). We show that the coiled-coil domain of AtZAR1 oligomerizes, and this domain acts as a signal to induce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity. This detailed analysis of the AtZAR1-AtZED1 protein complex provides a better understanding of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e signaling hub controlled by AtZAR1.</p>

Three Pectin Methylesterase Inhibitors Protect Cell Wall Integrity for Arabidopsis Immunity to <i>Botrytis</i>
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion by necrotrophs is a complex process that starts with the breakdown of the cell wall (CW) matrix initiated by CW-degrading enzymes and results in an extensive tissue maceration. Plants exploit induced defense mechanisms based on biochemical modification of the CW components to protect themselves from enzymatic degradation. The pectin matrix is the main CW target of <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>, and pectin methylesterification status is strongly altered in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion. The methylesterification of pectin is controlled mainly by pectin methylesterases (PMEs), whose activity is posttranscriptionally regulated by endogenous protein inhibitors (PMEIs). Here, AtPMEI10, AtPMEI11, and AtPMEI12 are identified as functional PMEIs induced in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) during <i>B. cinerea</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion. AtPMEI expression is strictly regulated by jasmonic acid and ethylene signaling, while only AtPMEI11 expression is controlled by PME-related damage-associated molecular patterns, such as oligogalacturonides and methanol. The decrease of pectin methylesterification during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion is higher and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity to <i>B. cinerea</i> is compromised in <i>pmei10</i>, <i>pmei11</i>, and <i>pmei12</i> mutants with respect to the control plants. A higher stimulation of the fungal oxalic acid biosynthetic pathway also can contribute to the higher susceptibility of <i>pmei</i> mutants. The lack of <i>PMEI</i> expression does not affect hemicellulose strengthening, callose deposition, and the synthesis of structural defense proteins, proposed as CW-remodeling mechanisms exploited by Arabidopsis to resist CW degradation upon <i>B. cinerea</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion. We show that PME activity and pectin methylesterification are dynamically modulated by PMEIs during <i>B. cinerea</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion. Our findings point to AtPMEI10, AtPMEI11, and AtPMEI12 as mediators of CW integrity maintenance in plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity.</p>

A Subset of Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes Is Essential for Plant Immunity
<p>Of the three classes of enzymes involved in ubiquitination, ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2) have been often incorrectly considered to play merely an auxiliary role in the process, and few E2 enzymes have been investigated in plants. To reveal the role of E2 in plant innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity, we identified and cloned 40 tomato genes encoding ubiquitin E2 proteins. Thioester assays indicated that the majority of the genes encode enzymatically active E2. Phylogenetic analysis classified the 40 tomato E2 enzymes into 13 groups, of which members of group III were found to interact and act specifically with AvrPtoB, a <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>tomato</i> effector that uses its ubiquitin ligase (E3) activity to suppress host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity. Knocking down the expression of group III E2 genes in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> diminished the AvrPtoB-promoted degradation of the Fen kinase and the AvrPtoB suppression of host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity-associated programmed cell death. Importantly, silencing group III E2 genes also resulted in reduced pattern-triggered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity (PTI). By contrast, programmed cell death induced by several effector-triggered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity elicitors was not affected on group III-silenced plants. Functional characterization suggested redundancy among group III members for their role in the suppression of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity by AvrPtoB and in PTI and identified UBIQUITIN-CONJUGATING11 (UBC11), UBC28, UBC29, UBC39, and UBC40 as playing a more significant role in PTI than other group III members. Our work builds a foundation for the further characterization of E2s in plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity and reveals that AvrPtoB has evolved a strategy for suppressing host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity that is difficult for the plant to thwart.</p>

MEG3-4 is a miRNA decoy that regulates IL-1β abundance to initiate and then limit inflammation to prevent sepsis during lung infection
<p>Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate gene expression. We investigated the role of lncRNAs in the inflammatory response to bacterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion in the lungs. We identified the lncRNA MEG3 as a tissue-specific modulator of inflammatory responses during bacterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion. Among the 10 transcript isoforms of MEG3, transcript 4 (referred to as MEG3-4) encodes the isoform with the lowest abundance in mouse lungs. Nonetheless, we found that MEG3-4 bound to the microRNA miR-138 in a competitive manner with mRNA encoding the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β), thereby increasing IL-1β abundance and intensifying inflammatory responses to bacterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion in alveolar macrophages and lung epithelial cells in culture and in lung tissue in mice. MEG3-4–mediated sponging of miR-138 in the cytoplasm increased the autocrine activity of IL-1β that subsequently induced a negative feedback mechanism mediated by nuclear factor κB that decreased MEG3-4 abundance and inflammatory cytokine production. This timely reduction in MEG3-4 abundance tempered proinflammatory responses in mice with pulmonary bacterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion, preventing the progression to sepsis. Together, these findings reveal that MEG3-4 dynamically modulates pulmonary inflammatory responses through transcriptional regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e response genes, extending the decoy and sponge mechanism associated with lncRNAs to antibacterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity, which affects both response and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e progression.</p>

Now, a second <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ed person, who received a similar intervention to Brown, also appears to have cleared his <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion. Both Brown and a man dubbed "the London patient" had blood cancers that required stem cell transplants. At the advice of their doctors, they received transplants from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ologically matched donors who also happened to have mutations in CCR5, a receptor on white blood cells that HIV uses to establish <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ions. The transplants may have also helped rid their bodies of HIV because they required "conditioning" regimens of toxic chemicals—and in the case of Brown, whole body irradiation, too—to kill off their tumor cells. What's more, they both had graft-versus-host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e in which the donor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e cells attack the recipient's tissues as foreign, which further could have killed residual HIV. As the London patient's doctor explained at an AIDS conference in Seattle, Washington, this week and in a description of the case in <i>Nature</i>, the man (who wants to remain anonymous) has been off anti-HIV drugs for 18 months and has no detectable virus in his blood on the most sensitive assays. The researchers studying him are being cautious and saying he is in long-term remission, not cured—and indeed the virus has rebounded in others who looked cured but many months later had HIV resurface. The intensive intervention also will only make sense for HIV-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ed people with blood cancers, a tiny fraction of the 37 million people living with the virus today. But there's hope that if both men indeed are cured it will spur simpler interventions that genetically modify CCR5, some of which are being studied today.</p>

Steep drop in Zika cases undermines vaccine trial
<p>When Zika raced through the Americas in 2016, it caused widespread alarm because the usually mild <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion led to brain damage in babies. An intense effort began to develop a Zika vaccine, and in March 2017, the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es launched a $110 million trial of its most promising candidate. The trial, now taking place in nine countries in North and South America, has hit a wall: There are too few cases of Zika in the region—largely because vast swaths of populations were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ed and now are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e—to assess whether the vaccine works. As a result, researchers are now planning to vaccinate people and then intentionally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong> them with the Zika virus. This human challenge model, used for decades with other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es, was dismissed as too risky by an ethics committee just last year, mainly because <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ed people can sexually transmit the virus to people who are not in the study. But given the drop in transmission, a better understanding about the duration of sexual transmission, and decreasing interest from industry in Zika vaccine R&D, the human challenge model now looks like the best way to move the field forward.</p>

A single transcription factor promotes both yield and immunity in rice
<p>Plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity often penalizes growth and yield. The transcription factor Ideal Plant Architecture 1 (IPA1) reduces unproductive tillers and increases grains per panicle, which results in improved rice yield. Here we report that higher IPA1 levels enhance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity. Mechanistically, phosphorylation of IPA1 at amino acid Ser<sup>163</sup> within its DNA binding domain occurs in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion by the fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> and alters the DNA binding specificity of IPA1. Phosphorylated IPA1 binds to the promoter of the pathogen defense gene <i>WRKY45</i> and activates its expression, leading to enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e resistance. IPA1 returns to a nonphosphorylated state within 48 hours after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion, resuming support of the growth needed for high yield. Thus, IPA1 promotes both yield and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e resistance by sustaining a balance between growth and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity.</p>

Connecting immune deficiency and inflammation
<p>Advances in genomic technologies have revealed the genetic basis of an increasing list of human primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e deficiencies (PID) as well as autoinflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es. The identification of a subset of patients suffering from recurrent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ions combined with inflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es revealed a previously unappreciated connection between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>odeficiency and autoinflammation. The paradoxical combination of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e deficiency and increased inflammation was reported in patients who have mutations that perturb signaling to the inflammatory transcription factor, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), including mutations in inhibitor of NF-κB (IκBα), NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO), and in components of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex [LUBAC, heme-oxidized IRP2 ubiquitin ligase 1 (HOIL-1) and HOIL-1-interacting protein (HOIP)] (<i>1</i>–<i>3</i>). On page 810 of this issue, Cuchet-Lourenco <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) describe four pediatric patients with PID and inflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e that harbor loss-of-function mutations in the receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (<i>RIPK1</i>) gene. RIPK1 is involved in signal transduction to NF-κB and is also a critical regulator of cell death, providing further evidence linking NF-κB signaling with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e deficiency, cell death, and inflammation.</p>

CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> mononuclear phagocytes control immunity to intestinal fungi
<p>Intestinal fungi are an important component of the microbiota, and recent studies have unveiled their potential in modulating host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e homeostasis and inflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e. Nonetheless, the mechanisms governing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity to gut fungal communities (mycobiota) remain unknown. We identified CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) as being essential for the initiation of innate and adaptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e responses to intestinal fungi. CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> MNPs express antifungal receptors and activate antifungal responses in a Syk-dependent manner. Genetic ablation of CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> MNPs in mice led to changes in gut fungal communities and to severe colitis that was rescued by antifungal treatment. In Crohn’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e patients, a missense mutation in the gene encoding CX3CR1 was identified and found to be associated with impaired antifungal responses. These results unravel a role of CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> MNPs in mediating interactions between intestinal mycobiota and host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity at steady state and during inflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e.</p>

Safety concerns derail dengue vaccination program
<p>Efforts to control dengue suffered a major setback in late November when Sanofi Pasteur announced that its vaccine, the only one on the market, should only be given to those who have already had one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion with the mosquito-borne <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e that affects millions of people in the tropics each year. The dengue virus comes in four serotypes. A first <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion is usually mild, but a second <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion with a different serotype puts the patient at risk of a serious, occasionally life-threatening illness. A retrospective analysis of those who participated in phase III trials in 2011 found that those who had never had a dengue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion at the time of vaccination were in rare cases at risk of enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e, although the Dengvaxia vaccine did reduce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ions and cases of serious illness in those who had previously suffered from dengue. The news caused an uproar in the Philippines, where a mass vaccination campaign was halted. And the incident is likely to lead health officials to carefully scrutinize other vaccines now in development.</p>

Can immunotherapy treat neurodegeneration?
<p>Alzheimer's <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e (AD) is a devastating age-related neurodegenerative disorder and the most frequent cause of senile dementia. The appearance of cognitive decline in this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e is associated with synaptic and neuronal loss, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, the accumulation of intracellular and extracellular plaques of misfolded amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide, and local neuroinflammation. The major focus in AD therapeutics has been to directly target specific factors in the brain that are believed to be associated with pathogenesis—primarily Ab and tau proteins—by using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ological or pharmacological tools. However, in the clinic, these therapies have not shown efficacy in restoring cognitive function nor in arresting the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e course. In addition, treating brain inflammation, which often accompanies neurodegenerative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es, with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has shown limited or no effect on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e progression (<i>1</i>). Collectively, these results have led investigators to revisit the identification of the factors participating in AD and in particular the role of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e system, including the resident brain myeloid cells (microglia) and the innate and adaptive arms of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e system.</p>

First flu is forever
<p>Influenza is a threat that has been with humans throughout history, fueled by a constant race between host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity and viral evolution. Control strategies rely on annual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>izations and require frequent updates of the vaccine, an expensive, cumbersome, and not always foolproof process. Efforts are therefore under way to develop vaccines that confer broadly cross-protective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity to diverse influenza strains. Cross-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity is pervasive in nature; in multistrain viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es such as influenza or dengue, response to a primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion can profoundly influence response to the next strain encountered. Even unrelated viruses can be recognized by the same cross-reactive T cells. On page 722 of this issue (<i>1</i>), Gostic <i>et al.</i> show that severe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion with a bird flu virus depends on the individual's first encounter with influenza in childhood.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
NIN Acts as a Network Hub Controlling a Growth Module Required for Rhizobial Infection
<p>The symbiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion of root cells by nitrogen-fixing rhizobia during nodulation requires the transcription factor Nodule Inception (NIN). Our root hair transcriptomic study extends NIN’s regulon to include <i>Rhizobium Polar Growth</i> and genes involved in cell wall modification, gibberellin biosynthesis, and a comprehensive group of nutrient (N, P, and S) uptake and assimilation genes, suggesting that NIN’s recruitment to nodulation was based on its role as a growth module, a role shared with other NIN-Like Proteins. The expression of jasmonic acid genes in <i>nin</i> suggests the involvement of NIN in the resolution of growth versus defense outcomes. We find that the regulation of the growth module component Nodulation Pectate Lyase by NIN, and its function in rhizobial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion, are conserved in hologalegina legumes, highlighting its recruitment as a major event in the evolution of nodulation. We find that Nodulation Pectate Lyase is secreted to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion chamber and the lumen of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion thread. Gene network analysis using the transcription factor mutants for <i>ERF Required for Nodulation1</i> and <i>Nuclear Factor-Y Subunit A1</i> confirms hierarchical control of NIN over <i>Nuclear Factor-Y Subunit A1</i> and shows that ERF Required for Nodulation1 acts independently to control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion. We conclude that while NIN shares functions with other NIN-Like Proteins, the conscription of key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion genes to NIN’s control has made it a central regulatory hub for rhizobial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion.</p>

Roles of Receptor-Like Cytoplasmic Kinase VII Members in Pattern-Triggered Immune Signaling
<p>Pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), which consist of receptor kinases (RKs) and receptor-like proteins, sense microbe- and host-derived molecular patterns associated with pathogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion to trigger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e responses in plants. Several kinases of the 46-member Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase (RLCK) subfamily VII play important roles in pattern-triggered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity, but it is unclear whether different RLCK VII members act specifically or redundantly in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e signaling. Here, we constructed nine higher order mutants of this subfamily (named <i>rlck vii-1</i> to <i>rlck vii-9</i>) and systematically characterized their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e phenotypes. The mutants <i>rlck vii-5</i>, -<i>7</i>, and -<i>8</i> had compromised reactive oxygen species production in response to all patterns tested, indicating that the corresponding members are broadly required for the signaling of multiple PRRs. However, <i>rlck vii-4</i> was defective specifically in chitin-induced reactive oxygen species production, suggesting that RCLK VII-4 members mediate the signaling of specific PRRs. Furthermore, RLCK VII-4 members were required for the chitin-triggered activation of MAPK, demonstrating that these kinases link a PRR to MAPK activation. Moreover, we found that RLCK VII-6 and -8 also were required for RK-mediated root growth. Together, these results show that numerous RLCK VII members are involved in pattern-triggered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e signaling and uncover both common and specific roles of these kinases in plant development and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity mediated by various RKs.</p>

Immunogene and viral transcript dynamics during parasitic <i>Varroa destructor</i> mite infection of developing honey bee (<i>Apis mellifera</i>) pupae
<p>The ectoparasitic <i>Varroa destructor</i> mite is a major contributor to the ongoing honey bee health crisis. <i>Varroa</i> interacts with honey bee viruses, exacerbating their pathogenicity. In addition to vectoring viruses, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>osuppression of the developing honey bee hosts by <i>Varroa</i> has been proposed to explain the synergy between viruses and mites. However, the evidence for honey bee <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e suppression by <i>V. destructor</i> is contentious. We systematically studied the quantitative effects of experimentally introduced <i>V. destructor</i> mites on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e gene expression at five specific time points during the development of the honey bee hosts. Mites reproduced normally and were associated with increased titers of deformed wing virus in the developing bees. Our data on different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e genes show little evidence for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>osuppression of honey bees by <i>V. destructor</i>. Experimental wounding of developing bees increases relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e gene expression and deformed wing virus titers. Combined, these results suggest that mite feeding activity itself and not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>osuppression may contribute to the synergy between viruses and mites. However, our results also suggest that increased expression of honey bee <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e genes decreases mite reproductive success, which may be explored to enhance mite control strategies. Finally, our expression data for multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e genes across developmental time and different experimental treatments indicates co-regulation of several of these genes and thus improves our understanding of the understudied honey bee <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e system.</p>

Antibody-dependent enhancement of severe dengue disease in humans
<p>For dengue viruses 1 to 4 (DENV1-4), a specific range of antibody titer has been shown to enhance viral replication in vitro and severe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e in animal models. Although suspected, such antibody-dependent enhancement of severe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e has not been shown to occur in humans. Using multiple statistical approaches to study a long-term pediatric cohort in Nicaragua, we show that risk of severe dengue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e is highest within a narrow range of preexisting anti-DENV antibody titers. By contrast, we observe protection from all symptomatic dengue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e at high antibody titers. Thus, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e correlates of severe dengue must be evaluated separately from correlates of protection against symptomatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e. These results have implications for studies of dengue pathogenesis and for vaccine development, because enhancement, not just lack of protection, is of concern.</p>

IgG antibodies to dengue enhanced for FcγRIIIA binding determine disease severity
<p>Dengue virus (DENV) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion in the presence of reactive, non-neutralizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>oglobulin G (IgG) (RNNIg) is the greatest risk factor for dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Progression to DHF/DSS is attributed to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE); however, because only a fraction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ions occurring in the presence of RNNIg advance to DHF/DSS, the presence of RNNIg alone cannot account for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e severity. We discovered that DHF/DSS patients respond to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion by producing IgGs with enhanced affinity for the activating Fc receptor FcγRIIIA due to afucosylated Fc glycans and IgG1 subclass. RNNIg enriched for afucosylated IgG1 triggered platelet reduction in vivo and was a significant risk factor for thrombocytopenia. Thus, therapeutics and vaccines restricting production of afucosylated, IgG1 RNNIg during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infect</span></strong>ion may prevent ADE of DENV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e.</p>

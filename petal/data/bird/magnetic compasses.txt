The COMPASS-Like Complex Promotes Flowering and Panicle Branching in Rice
<p>Flowering time (heading date) and panicle branch number are important agronomic traits that determine yield in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). The activation of flowering requires histone methylation, but the roles of trimethylation of Lys 4 of histone 3 (H3K4me3) in modulating heading date and panicle development are unclear. Here, we showed that the COMPASS-like complex promotes flowering and panicle branching. The rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) WD40 protein OsWDR5a interacts with the TRITHORAX-like protein OsTrx1/SET domain group protein 723 (SDG723) to form the core components of the COMPASS-like complex. Plants in which <i>OsWDR5a</i> or <i>OsTrx1</i> expression was decreased by RNA interference produced fewer secondary branches and less grain and exhibited a delayed heading date under long-day and short-day conditions, whereas loss of <i>OsWDR5a</i> function resulted in embryo lethality. OsWDR5a binds to <i>Early heading date 1</i> to regulate its H3K4me3 and expression levels. Together, our results show that the COMPASS-like complex promotes flowering and panicle development and suggest that modulation of H3K4me3 levels by the COMPASS-like complex is critical for rice development.</p>

Zebra finches have a light-dependent magnetic compass similar to migratory birds
<p><bold>Highlighted Article:</bold> The magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compass</span></strong> of zebra finches depends on the wavelength and intensity of light, as for the magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compass</span></strong> of migratory birds, suggesting common properties for all birds.</p>

Pre-settlement coral-reef fish larvae respond to magnetic field changes during the day
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> The individual orientation behaviour of coral-reef fish larvae during the pre-settlement phase is influenced by magnetic-field shifts, which indicates sensitivity to the geomagnetic field and the use of a magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compass</span></strong> during dispersal and settlement.</p>

Behavioral evidence for a magnetic sense in the oriental armyworm, <i>Mythimna separata</i>
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> Responses to changes in the intensity and direction of magnetic fields in the armyworm moth (<i>Mythimna separata</i>) indicate a reliance on a magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compass</span></strong> for flight orientation.</p>

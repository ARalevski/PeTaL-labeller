Endothelial Microparticles From Acute Coronary Syndrome Patients Induce Premature Coronary Artery Endothelial Cell Aging and Thrombogenicity
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Microparticles (MPs) have emerged as a surrogate marker of endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular risk. This study examined the potential of MPs from senescent endothelial cells (ECs) or from patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) to promote premature EC aging and thrombogenicity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Primary porcine coronary ECs were isolated from the left circumflex coronary artery. MPs were prepared from ECs and venous blood from patients with ACS (n=30) and from healthy volunteers (n=4) by sequential centrifugation. The level of endothelial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">senescence</span></strong> was assessed as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">senescence</span></strong>-associated β-galactosidase activity using flow cytometry, oxidative stress using the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">redox</span></strong>-sensitive probe dihydroethidium, tissue factor activity using an enzymatic Tenase assay, the level of target protein expression by Western blot analysis, platelet aggregation using an aggregometer, and shear stress using a cone-and-plate viscometer.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">senescence</span></strong>, as assessed by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">senescence</span></strong>-associated β-galactosidase activity, was induced by the passaging of porcine coronary artery ECs from passage P1 to P4, and was associated with a progressive shedding of procoagulant MPs. Exposure of P1 ECs to MPs shed from senescent P3 cells or circulating MPs from ACS patients induced increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">senescence</span></strong>-associated β-galactosidase activity, oxidative stress, early phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and Akt, and upregulation of p53, p21, and p16. Ex vivo, the prosenescent effect of circulating MPs from ACS patients was evidenced only <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">under</span></strong> conditions of low shear stress. Depletion of endothelial-derived MPs from ACS patients reduced the induction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">senescence</span></strong>. Prosenescent MPs promoted EC thrombogenicity through tissue factor upregulation, shedding of procoagulant MPs, endothelial nitric oxide synthase downregulation, and reduced nitric oxide–mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation. These MPs exhibited angiotensin-converting enzyme activity and upregulated AT1 receptors and angiotensin-converting enzyme in P1 ECs. Losartan, an AT1 receptor antagonist, and inhibitors of either mitogen-activated protein kinases or phosphoinositide 3-kinase prevented the MP-induced endothelial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">senescence</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These findings indicate that endothelial-derived MPs from ACS patients induce premature endothelial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">senescence</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">under</span></strong> atheroprone low shear stress and thrombogenicity through angiotensin II–induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">redox</span></strong>-sensitive activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt. They further suggest that targeting endothelial-derived MP shedding and their bioactivity may be a promising therapeutic strategy to limit the development of an endothelial dysfunction post-ACS.</p></sec>

Reproduction-related variation in carbon allocation to woody tissues in <i>Fagus crenata</i> using a natural <sup>13</sup>C approach
<p>The contribution of new photo-assimilates and stored carbon (C) to plant growth remains poorly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">under</span></strong>stood, especially during reproduction. In order to elucidate how mast seeding affects C allocation to both reproductive and vegetative tissues, we measured biomass increase in each tissue, branch starch concentration and stable C isotope composition (δ<sup>13</sup>C) in bulk leaves, current-year shoots, 3-year branches and tree rings in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruiting</span></strong> and non-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruiting</span></strong> trees for 2 years, as well as in fruits. We isolated the effect of reproduction on C allocation to vegetative growth by comparing <sup>13</sup>C enrichment in woody tissues in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruiting</span></strong> and non-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruiting</span></strong> specimens. Compared with 2‰ <sup>13</sup>C enrichment in shoots relative to leaves from non-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruiting</span></strong> trees, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruiting</span></strong> reduced the enrichment to 1‰ and this reduction disappeared in the following year with no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruiting</span></strong>, indicating that new photo-assimilates are preferentially used for woody tissues even with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruiting</span></strong> burden. In contrast, fruits had up to 2.5‰ <sup>13</sup>C enrichment at mid-summer, which dropped thereafter, indicating that fruit production relies on C storage early in the growing season then shifts to current photo-assimilates. At this tipping point, growth of shoots and cupules had almost finished and nuts had a second rapid growth period thereafter. Together with shorter shoots but higher biomass increment per length in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruiting</span></strong> trees than non-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruiting</span></strong> trees, these results indicate that the C limitation due to fruit burden is minimized by fine-tuning of allocation of old C stores and new photo-assimilates, along with the growth pattern in various tissues. Furthermore, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruiting</span></strong> had no significant effect on starch concentration in 3-year-old branches, which became fully depleted during leaf and flower flushing but were quickly replenished. These results indicate that reproduction affects C allocation to branches but not its source or storage. These reproduction-related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variation</span></strong>s in the fate of C have implications for evaluating forest ecosystem C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycle</span></strong>s during climate change.</p>

Adaption of Roots to Nitrogen Deficiency Revealed by 3D Quantification and Proteomic Analysis
<p>Rapeseed (<i>Brassica napus</i>) is an important oil crop worldwide. However, severe inhibition of rapeseed production often occurs in the field due to nitrogen (N) deficiency. The root system is the main organ to acquire N for plant growth, but little is known about the mechanisms <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">under</span></strong>lying rapeseed root adaptions to N deficiency. Here, dynamic changes in root architectural traits of N-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deficient</span></strong> rapeseed plants were evaluated by 3D in situ quantification. Root proteome responses to N deficiency were analyzed by the tandem mass tag-based proteomics method, and related proteins were characterized further. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">under</span></strong> N deficiency, rapeseed roots become longer, with denser cells in the meristematic zone and larger cells in the elongation zone of root tips, and also become softer with reduced solidity. A total of 171 and 755 differentially expressed proteins were identified in short- and long-term N-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deficient</span></strong> roots, respectively. The abundance of proteins involved in cell wall organization or biogenesis was highly enhanced, but most identified peroxidases were reduced in the N-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deficient</span></strong> roots. Notably, peroxidase activities also were decreased, which might promote root elongation while lowering the solidity of N-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deficient</span></strong> roots. These results were consistent with the cell wall components measured in the N-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deficient</span></strong> roots. Further functional analysis using transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants demonstrated that the two root-related differentially expressed proteins contribute to the enhanced root growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">under</span></strong> N deficiency conditions. These results provide insights into the global changes of rapeseed root responses to N deficiency and may facilitate the development of rapeseed cultivars with high N use efficiency through root-based genetic improvements.</p>

Heterochronic Meiotic Misexpression in an Interspecific Yeast Hybrid
<p>Regulatory changes rapidly accumulate between species, and interspecific hybrids often misexpress genes. Hybrid misexpression, expression levels outside the range of both parental species, can result from <i>cis-</i> and <i>trans</i>-acting regulatory changes that interact abnormally in hybrids. Thus, misexpressed genes may contribute to hybrid sterility. However, in the context of a whole organism, misexpression may not result directly from <i>cis–trans</i> interactions but rather indirectly from differences between hybrid and parental abundance of cell types. Here we eliminate the confounding effects of cell types by examining gene expression in a sterile interspecific yeast hybrid during meiosis. We investigated gene expression of the yeasts <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, <i>S. paradoxus</i>, and their hybrid at multiple meiotic stages. Although the hybrid and parents exhibit similar changes in expression levels across meiosis, the hybrid meiotic program occurs earlier than either parent. The timing change produces a heterochronic pattern of misexpression during midmeiosis. Coincident with the timing of misexpression, we find a transition from predominantly <i>trans</i>-acting to <i>cis-</i>acting expression divergence and an increase in the number of opposing <i>cis–trans</i> changes. However, we find no direct relationship between opposing <i>cis–trans</i> changes and misexpression. Contrary to the notion that <i>cis–trans</i> interactions cause misexpression, a heterochronic shift in the normal meiotic gene expression program produces patterns of misexpression in an yeast hybrid. Our results imply that temporal dynamics of single cell types is important to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">under</span></strong>standing hybrid misexpression and its relationship to <i>cis–trans</i> interactions.</p>

The matricellular protein TSP1 promotes human and mouse endothelial cell senescence through CD47 and Nox1
<p>Senescent cells withdraw from the cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycle</span></strong> and do not proliferate. The prevalence of senescent compared to normally functioning parenchymal cells increases with age, impairing tissue and organ homeostasis. A contentious principle governing this process has been the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">redox</span></strong> theory of aging. We linked matricellular protein thrombospondin 1 (TSP1) and its receptor CD47 to the activation of NADPH oxidase 1 (Nox1), but not of the other closely related Nox isoforms, and associated oxidative stress, and to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">senescence</span></strong> in human cells and aged tissue. In human endothelial cells, TSP1 promoted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">senescence</span></strong> and attenuated cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycle</span></strong> progression and proliferation. At the molecular level, TSP1 increased Nox1-dependent generation of re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">active</span></strong> oxygen species (ROS), leading to the increased abundance of the transcription factor p53. p53 mediated a DNA damage response that led to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">senescence</span></strong> through Rb and p21<sup>cip</sup>, both of which inhibit cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycle</span></strong> progression. Nox1 inhibition blocked the ability of TSP1 to increase p53 nuclear localization and p21<sup>cip</sup> abundance and its ability to promote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">senescence</span></strong>. Mice lacking TSP1 showed decreases in ROS production, p21<sup>cip</sup> expression, p53 activity, and aging-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">senescence</span></strong>. Conversely, lung tissue from aging humans displayed increases in the abundance of vascular TSP1, Nox1, p53, and p21<sup>cip</sup>. Finally, genetic ablation or pharmacological blockade of Nox1 in human endothelial cells attenuated TSP1-mediated ROS generation, restored cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycle</span></strong> progression, and protected against <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">senescence</span></strong>. Together, our results provide insights into the functional interplay between TSP1 and Nox1 in the regulation of endothelial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">senescence</span></strong> and suggest potential targets for controlling the aging process at the molecular level.</p>

In silico modeling identifies CD45 as a regulator of IL-2 synergy in the NKG2D-mediated activation of immature human NK cells
<p>Natural killer (NK) cells perform immunosurveillance of virally infected and transformed cells, and their activation depends on the balance between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing by inhibitory and activating receptors. Cytokine receptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing can synergize with activating receptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing to induce NK cell activation. We investigated the interplay between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathways stimulated by the cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2) and the activating receptor NKG2D in immature (CD56<sup>bright</sup>) and mature (CD56<sup>dim</sup>) subsets of human primary NK cells using mass cytometry experiments and in silico modeling. Our analysis revealed that IL-2 changed the abundances of several key proteins, including NKG2D and the phosphatase CD45. Furthermore, we found differences in correlations between protein abundances, which were associated with the maturation state of the NK cells. The mass cytometry measurements also revealed that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing kinetics of key protein abundances induced by NKG2D stimulation depended on the maturation state and the pretreatment condition of the NK cells. Our in silico model, which described the multidimensional data with coupled first-order <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong>s, predicted that the increase in CD45 abundance was a major enhancer of NKG2D-mediated activation in IL-2–treated CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells but not in IL-2–treated CD56<sup>dim</sup> NK cells. This dependence on CD45 was verified by measurement of CD107a mobilization to the NK cell surface (a marker of activation). Our mathematical framework can be used to glean mechanisms <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">under</span></strong>lying synergistic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathways in other activated immune cells.</p>

The NAC Transcription Factor SlNAP2 Regulates Leaf Senescence and Fruit Yield in Tomato
<p>Leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">senescence</span></strong> is an essential physiological process in plants that supports the recycling of nitrogen and other nutrients to support the growth of developing organs, including young leaves, seeds, and fruits. Thus, the regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">senescence</span></strong> is crucial for evolutionary success in wild populations and for increasing yield in crops. Here, we describe the influence of a NAC transcription factor, SlNAP2 (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i> NAC-like, activated by Apetala3/Pistillata), that controls both leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">senescence</span></strong> and fruit yield in tomato (<i>S. lycopersicum</i>). <i>SlNAP2</i> expression increases during age-dependent and dark-induced leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">senescence</span></strong>. We demonstrate that SlNAP2 activates <i>SlSAG113</i> (<i>S. lycopersicum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">senescence</span></strong>-ASSOCIATED GENE113</i>), a homolog of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>SAG113</i>, chlorophyll degradation genes such as <i>SlSGR1</i> (<i>S. lycopersicum</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">senescence</span></strong>-inducible chloroplast stay-green protein 1) and <i>SlPAO</i> (<i>S. lycopersicum</i> pheide <i>a</i> oxygenase), and other downstream targets by directly binding to their promoters, thereby promoting leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">senescence</span></strong>. Furthermore, SlNAP2 directly controls the expression of genes important for abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis, <i>S. lycopersicum</i> 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase 1 (<i>SlNCED1</i>); transport, <i>S. lycopersicum</i> ABC transporter G family member 40 (<i>SlABCG40</i>); and degradation, <i>S. lycopersicum</i> ABA 8′-hydroxylase (<i>SlCYP707A2</i>), indicating that SlNAP2 has a complex role in establishing ABA homeostasis during leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">senescence</span></strong>. Inhibiting <i>SlNAP2</i> expression in transgenic tomato plants impedes leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">senescence</span></strong> but enhances fruit yield and sugar content likely due to prolonged leaf photosynthesis in aging tomato plants. Our data indicate that SlNAP2 has a central role in controlling leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">senescence</span></strong> and fruit yield in tomato.</p>

Analysis of Posttranslational Activation of Alternative Oxidase Isoforms
<p>Mitochondrial alternative oxidase (AOX) in plants is a non-proton-motive ubiquinol oxidase that is activated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">redox</span></strong> mechanisms and 2-oxo acids. A comparative analysis of the AOX isoenzymes AOX1A, AOX1C, and AOX1D from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) revealed that cysteine residues, CysI and CysII, are both involved in 2-oxo acid activation, with AOX1A activity being more increased by 2-oxo acids than that of AOX1C and AOX1D. Substitution of cysteine in AOX1A by glutamate mimicked its activation by pyruvate or glyoxylate, but not in AOX1C and AOX1D. CysIII, only present in AOX1A, is not involved in activation by reduction or metabolites, but substitutions at this position affected activity. AOX1A carrying a serine residue at position CysI was activated by succinate, while correspondingly substituted variants of AOX1C and AOX1D were insensitive. Activation by glutamate at CysI and CysII is consistent with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">formation</span></strong> of the thiohemiacetal, while succinate activation after changing CysI to serine suggests hemiacetal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">formation</span></strong>. Surprisingly, in AOX1A, replacement of CysI by alanine, which cannot form a (thio)hemiacetal, led to even higher activities, pointing to an alternative mechanism of activation. Taken together, our results demonstrate that AOX isoforms are differentially activated and that activation at CysI and CysII is additive.</p>

Exercise-Induced Changes in Glucose Metabolism Promote Physiological Cardiac Growth
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Exercise promotes metabolic remodeling in the heart, which is associated with physiological cardiac growth; however, it is not known whether or how physical activity–induced changes in cardiac metabolism cause myocardial remodeling. In this study, we tested whether exercise-mediated changes in cardiomyocyte glucose metabolism are important for physiological cardiac growth.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used radiometric, immunologic, metabolomic, and biochemical assays to measure changes in myocardial glucose metabolism in mice subjected to acute and chronic treadmill exercise. To assess the relevance of changes in glycolytic activity, we determined how cardiac-specific expression of mutant forms of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase affect cardiac structure, function, metabolism, and gene programs relevant to cardiac remodeling. Metabolomic and transcriptomic screenings were used to identify metabolic pathways and gene sets regulated by glycolytic activity in the heart.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Exercise acutely decreased glucose utilization via glycolysis by modulating circulating substrates and reducing phosphofructokinase activity; however, in the recovered state following exercise adaptation, there was an increase in myocardial phosphofructokinase activity and glycolysis. In mice, cardiac-specific expression of a kinase-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deficient</span></strong> 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase transgene (Glyco<sup>Lo</sup> mice) lowered glycolytic rate and regulated the expression of genes known to promote cardiac growth.

Expression of phosphatase-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deficient</span></strong> 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase in the heart (Glyco<sup>Hi</sup> mice) increased glucose utilization and promoted a more pathological form of hypertrophy devoid of transcriptional activation of the physiological cardiac growth program. Modulation of phosphofructokinase activity was sufficient to regulate the glucose–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fatty</span></strong> acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycle</span></strong> in the heart; however, metabolic inflexibility caused by invariantly low or high phosphofructokinase activity caused modest mitochondrial damage.

Converging Light, Energy and Hormonal Signaling Control Meristem Activity, Leaf Initiation, and Growth<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>The development of leaf primordia is subject to light control of meristematic activity. Light regulates the expression of thousands of genes with roles in cell proliferation, organ development, and differentiation of photosynthetic cells. Previous work has highlighted roles for hormone homeostasis and the energy-dependent Target of Rapamycin (TOR) kinase in meristematic activity, yet a picture of how these two regulatory mechanisms depend on light perception and interact with each other has yet to emerge. Their relevance beyond leaf initiation also is unclear. Here, we report the discovery that the dark-arrested meristematic region of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) experiences a local energy deprivation state and confirm previous findings that the PIN1 auxin transporter is diffusely localized in the dark. Light triggers a rapid removal of the starvation state and the establishment of PIN1 polar membrane localization consistent with auxin export, both preceding the induction of cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycle</span></strong>- and cytoplasmic growth-associated genes. We demonstrate that shoot meristematic activity can occur in the dark through the manipulation of auxin and cytokinin activity as well as through the activation of energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing, both targets of photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">morph</span></strong>ogenesis action, but the organ developmental outcomes differ: while TOR-dependent energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>s alone stimulate cell proliferation, the development of a normal leaf lamina requires photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">morph</span></strong>ogenesis-like hormonal responses. We further show that energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing adjusts the extent of cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycle</span></strong> activity and growth of young leaves non-cellautonomously to available photosynthates and leads to organs constituted of a greater number of cells developing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">under</span></strong> higher irradiance. This makes energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing perhaps the most important biomass growth determinant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">under</span></strong> natural, unstressed conditions.</p>

In <i>Drosophila</i>, RhoGEF2 cooperates with activated Ras in tumorigenesis through a pathway involving Rho1–Rok–Myosin-II and JNK signalling
<p>The <i>Ras</i> oncogene contributes to ∼30% of human cancers, but alone is not sufficient for tumorigenesis. In a <i>Drosophila</i> screen for oncogenes that cooperate with an activated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">allele</span></strong> of <i>Ras</i> (<i>Ras<sup>ACT</sup></i>) to promote tissue overgrowth and invasion, we identified the GTP exchange factor <i>RhoGEF2</i>, an activator of Rho-family <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ling. Here, we show that RhoGEF2 also cooperates with an activated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">allele</span></strong> of a downstream effector of Ras, <i>Raf</i> (<i>Raf<sup>GOF</sup></i>). We dissect the downstream pathways through which RhoGEF2 cooperates with Ras<sup>ACT</sup> (and Raf<sup>GOF</sup>), and show that RhoGEF2 requires Rho1, but not Rac, for tumorigenesis. Furthermore, of the Rho1 effectors, we show that RhoGEF2 + Ras (Raf)-mediated tumorigenesis requires the Rho kinase (Rok)–Myosin-II pathway, but not Diaphanous, Lim kinase or protein kinase N. The Rho1–Rok–Myosin-II pathway leads to the activation of Jun kinase (JNK), in cooperation with Ras<sup>ACT</sup>. Moreover, we show that activation of Rok or Myosin II, using constitutively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">active</span></strong> transgenes, is sufficient for cooperative tumorigenesis with Ras<sup>ACT</sup>, and together with Ras<sup>ACT</sup> leads to strong activation of JNK. Our results show that Rok–Myosin-II activity is necessary and sufficient for Ras-mediated tumorigenesis. Our observation that activation of Myosin II, which regulates Filamentous actin (F-actin) contractility without affecting F-actin levels, cooperates with Ras<sup>ACT</sup> to promote JNK activation and tumorigenesis, suggests that increased cell contractility is a key factor in tumorigenesis. Furthermore, we show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ling via the Tumour necrosis factor (TNF; also known as Egr)-ligand–JNK pathway is most likely the predominant pathway that activates JNK upon Rok activation. Overall, our analysis highlights the need for further analysis of the Rok–Myosin-II pathway in cooperation with Ras in human cancers.</p>

VEGF–neuropilin-2 signaling promotes stem-like traits in breast cancer cells by TAZ-mediated repression of the Rac GAP β2-chimaerin
<p>The role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing in cancer is not only well known in the context of angiogenesis but also important in the functional regulation of tumor cells. Autocrine VEGF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing mediated by its co-receptors called neuropilins (NRPs) appears to be essential for sustaining the proliferation and survival of cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are implicated in mediating tumor growth, progression, and drug resistance. Therefore, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">under</span></strong>standing the mechanisms involved in VEGF-mediated support of CSCs is critical to successfully treating cancer patients. The expression of the Hippo effector TAZ is associated with breast CSCs and confers stem cell–like properties. We found that VEGF-NRP2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing contributed to the activation of TAZ in various breast cancer cells, which mediated a positive feedback loop that promoted mammosphere <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">formation</span></strong>. VEGF-NRP2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing activated the GTPase Rac1, which inhibited the Hippo kinase LATS, thus leading to TAZ activity. In a complex with the transcription factor TEAD, TAZ then bound and repressed the promoter of the gene encoding the Rac GTPase-activating protein (Rac GAP) β2-chimaerin. By activating GTP hydrolysis, Rac GAPs effectively turn off Rac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing; hence, the TAZ-mediated repression of β2-chimaerin resulted in sustained Rac1 activity in CSCs. Depletion of β2-chimaerin in non-CSCs increased Rac1 activity, TAZ abundance, and mammosphere <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">formation</span></strong>. Analysis of a breast cancer patient database revealed an inverse correlation between β2-chimaerin and TAZ expression in tumors. Our findings highlight an unexpected role for β2-chimaerin in a feed-forward loop of TAZ activation and the acquisition of CSC properties.</p>

Wounding Triggers Callus Formation via Dynamic Hormonal and Transcriptional Changes
<p>Wounding is a primary trigger of organ regeneration, but how wound stress reactivates cell proliferation and promotes cellular reprogramming remains elusive. In this study, we combined transcriptome analysis with quantitative hormonal analysis to investigate how wounding induces callus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">formation</span></strong> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Our time course RNA-seq analysis revealed that wounding induces dynamic transcriptional changes, starting from rapid stress responses followed by the activation of metabolic processes and protein synthesis and subsequent activation of cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycle</span></strong> regulators. Gene ontology analyses further uncovered that wounding modifies the expression of hormone biosynthesis and response genes, and quantitative analysis of endogenous plant hormones revealed accumulation of cytokinin prior to callus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">formation</span></strong>. Mutants defective in cytokinin synthesis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing display reduced efficiency in callus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">formation</span></strong>, indicating that de novo synthesis of cytokinin is critical for wound-induced callus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">formation</span></strong>. We further demonstrate that type-B ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR-mediated cytokinin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing regulates the expression of <i>CYCLIN D3;1</i> (<i>CYCD3;1</i>) and that mutations in <i>CYCD3;1</i> and its homologs <i>CYCD3;2</i> and <i>3</i> cause defects in callus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">formation</span></strong>. In addition to these hormone-mediated changes, our transcriptome data uncovered that wounding activates multiple developmental regulators, and we found novel roles of ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR 115 and PLETHORA3 (PLT3), PLT5, and PLT7 in callus generation. All together, these results provide novel mechanistic insights into how wounding reactivates cell proliferation during callus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">formation</span></strong>.</p>

Effect of source/sink ratios on yield components, growth dynamics and structural characteristics of oil palm (<i>Elaeis guineensis</i>) bunches
<p>Source/sink ratios are known to be one of the main determinants of oil palm growth and development. A long-term experiment (9 years) was conducted in Indonesia on mature oil palms subjected to continuous bunch ablation and partial defoliation treatments to artificially modify source/sink ratios. During the experiment, all harvested bunches were dissected and phenological measurements were carried out to analyse the effect of source/sink ratios on yield components explaining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variation</span></strong>s in bunch number, the number of fruits per bunch and oil dry weight per fruit. An integrative variable (supply/demand ratio) describing the ratio between the assimilate supply from sources and the growing organ demand for carbohydrate was computed for each plant on a daily basis from observations of the number of developing organs and their sink strength, and of climate variables. Defoliation and bunch ablation affected the bunch number and the fruit number per bunch. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variation</span></strong>s in bunch number per month were mainly due to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variation</span></strong>s in the fraction of aborted inflorescence and in the ratio between female and male inflorescences. Under fluctuating trophic conditions, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variation</span></strong>s in fruit number per bunch resulted both from changes in fruit-set and in the number of branches (rachillae) per inflorescence. For defoliated plants, the decrease in the number of developing reproductive sinks appeared to be sufficient to maintain fruit weight and oil concentration at the control level, without any major decrease in the concentration of non-structural carbohydrate reserves. Computation of the supply/demand ratio revealed that each yield component had a specific phase of sensitivity to supply/demand ratios during inflorescence development. Establishing quantitative relationships between supply/demand ratios, competition and yield components is the first step towards a functional model for oil palm.</p>

Phosphoproteomic analysis of chimeric antigen receptor signaling reveals kinetic and quantitative differences that affect cell function
<p>Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) link an antigen recognition domain to intracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing domains to redirect T cell specificity and function. T cells expressing CARs with CD28/CD3ζ or 4-1BB/CD3ζ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing domains are effective at treating refractory B cell malignancies but exhibit differences in effector function, clinical efficacy, and toxicity that are assumed to result from the activation of divergent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing cascades. We analyzed stimulation-induced phosphorylation events in primary human CD8<sup>+</sup> CD28/CD3ζ and 4-1BB/CD3ζ CAR T cells by mass spectrometry and found that both CAR constructs activated similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing intermediates. Stimulation of CD28/CD3ζ CARs activated faster and larger-magnitude changes in protein phosphorylation, which correlated with an effector T cell–like phenotype and function. In contrast, 4-1BB/CD3ζ CAR T cells preferentially expressed T cell memory–associated genes and exhibited sustained antitumor activity against established tumors in vivo. Mutagenesis of the CAR CD28 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing domain demonstrated that the increased CD28/CD3ζ CAR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong> intensity was partly related to constitutive association of Lck with this domain in CAR complexes. Our data show that CAR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathways cannot be predicted solely by the domains used to construct the receptor and that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong> strength is a key determinant of T cell fate.

Hypermorphic <i>SERK1</i> Mutations Function via a <i>SOBIR1</i> Pathway to Activate Floral Abscission Signaling
<p>In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the abscission of floral organs is regulated by two related receptor-like protein kinases, HAESA (HAE) and HAESA-LIKE2 (HSL2). In complex with members of the SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE (SERK) family of coreceptor protein kinases, HAE and HSL2 are activated when bound by INFLORESCENCE DEFICIENT IN ABSICSSION, a proteolytically processed peptide ligand, activating the expression of genes encoding secreted cell wall remodeling and hydrolase enzymes. <i>hae hsl2</i> mutants fail to induce expression of these genes and retain floral organs indefinitely. Here, we report identification of an allelic series of <i>hae hsl2</i> suppressor mutations in the <i>SERK1</i> coreceptor protein kinase gene. Genetic and transcriptomic evidence indicates that these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">allele</span></strong>s represent a novel class of gain-of-function mutations that activate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing independently of HAE/HSL2. We show that, surprisingly, the suppression effect does not rely on the protein kinase activity of SERK1 and that activation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing relies on the receptor-like kinase gene <i>SUPPRESSOR OF BIR1</i> (<i>SOBIR1</i>). The effect of these mutations can be mimicked by loss of function of <i>BAK1-INTERACTING RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE1</i> (<i>BIR1</i>), a known negative regulator of <i>SERK</i>-<i>SOBIR1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing. These results suggest that <i>BIR1</i> negatively regulates <i>SERK-SOBIR1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing during abscission and that the identified <i>SERK1</i> mutations likely interfere with this negative regulation.</p>

Basal aurora kinase B activity is sufficient for histone H3 phosphorylation in prophase
<p>Histone H3 phosphorylation is the hallmark of mitosis deposited by aurora kinase B. Benzo[e]pyridoindoles are a family of potent, broad, ATP-competitive aurora kinase inhibitors. However, benzo[e]pyridoindole C4 only inhibits histone H3 phosphorylation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prophase</span></strong> but not in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metaphase</span></strong>. Under the C4 treatment, the cells enter into mitosis with dephosphorylated histone H3, assemble chromosomes normally and progress to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metaphase</span></strong>, and then to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anaphase</span></strong>. C4 also induces lagging chromosome in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anaphase</span></strong> but we demonstrated that these chromosome compaction defects are not related to the absence of H3 phosphorylation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prophase</span></strong>. As a result of C4 action, mitosis lasts longer and the cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycle</span></strong> is slowed down.</p><p>We reproduced the mitotic defects with reduced concentrations of potent pan aurora kinase as well as with a specific aurora B ATP-competitive inhibitor; we therefore propose that histone H3 phosphorylation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anaphase</span></strong> chromosome compaction involve the basal activity of aurora kinase B. Our data suggest that aurora kinase B is progressively activated at mitosis entry and at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anaphase</span></strong> onset. The full activation of aurora kinase B by its partners, in pro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metaphase</span></strong>, induces a shift in the catalytic domain of aurora B that modifies its affinity for ATP. These waves of activation/deactivation of aurora B correspond to different con<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">formation</span></strong>s of the chromosomal complex revealed by FRAP.</p><p>The presence of lagging chromosomes may have deleterious consequences on the daughter cells and, unfortunately, the situation may be encountered in patients receiving treatment with aurora kinase inhibitors.</p>

Sexually different physiological responses of <i>Populus cathayana</i> to nitrogen and phosphorus deficiencies

The results showed that N and P deficiencies significantly decreased plant growth, foliar N and P contents, chlorophyll content, photosynthesis, and instantaneous photosynthetic N- and P-use efficiencies (PNUE and PPUE) in both sexes. Males had higher photosynthesis, higher PNUE and PPUE rates, and a lower accumulation of plastoglobules in chloroplasts than did females when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exposed</span></strong> to N- and P-deficiency conditions.

The inositol phosphatase SHIP2 enables sustained ERK activation downstream of FGF receptors by recruiting Src kinases
<p>Sustained activation of extracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>–regulated kinase (ERK) drives pathologies caused by mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs). We previously identified the inositol phosphatase SHIP2 (also known as INPPL1) as an FGFR-interacting protein and a target of the tyrosine kinase activities of FGFR1, FGFR3, and FGFR4. We report that loss of SHIP2 converted FGF-mediated sustained ERK activation into a transient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong> and res<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cue</span></strong>d cell phenotypes triggered by pathologic FGFR-ERK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing. Mutant forms of SHIP2 lacking phosphoinositide phosphatase activity still associated with FGFRs and did not prevent FGF-induced sustained ERK activation, demonstrating that the adaptor rather than the catalytic activity of SHIP2 was required. SHIP2 recruited Src family kinases to the FGFRs, which promoted FGFR-mediated phosphorylation and assembly of protein complexes that relayed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing to ERK. SHIP2 interacted with FGFRs, was phosphorylated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">active</span></strong> FGFRs, and promoted FGFR-ERK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing at the level of phosphorylation of the adaptor FRS2 and recruitment of the tyrosine phosphatase PTPN11. Thus, SHIP2 is an essential component of canonical FGF-FGFR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong> transduction and a potential therapeutic target in FGFR-related disorders.</p>

Mitochondrial redox sensing by the kinase ATM maintains cellular antioxidant capacity
<p>Mitochondria are integral to cellular energy metabolism and ATP production and are involved in regulating many cellular processes. Mitochondria produce re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">active</span></strong> oxygen species (ROS), which not only can damage cellular components but also participate in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong> transduction. The kinase ATM, which is mutated in the neurodegenerative, autosomal recessive disease ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), is a key player in the nuclear DNA damage response. However, ATM also performs a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">redox</span></strong>-sensing function mediated through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">formation</span></strong> of ROS-dependent disulfide-linked dimers. We found that mitochondria-derived hydrogen peroxide promoted ATM dimerization. In HeLa cells, ATM dimers were localized to the nucleus and inhibited by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">redox</span></strong> regulatory protein thio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">redox</span></strong>in 1 (TRX1), suggesting the existence of a ROS-mediated, stress-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing relay from mitochondria to the nucleus. ATM dimer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">formation</span></strong> did not affect its association with chromatin in the absence or presence of nuclear DNA damage, consistent with the separation of its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">redox</span></strong> and DNA damage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing functions. Comparative analysis of U2OS cells expressing either wild-type ATM or the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">redox</span></strong> sensing–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deficient</span></strong> C2991L mutant revealed that one function of ATM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">redox</span></strong> sensing is to promote glucose flux through the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) by increasing the abundance and activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), thereby increasing cellular antioxidant capacity. The PPP produces the coenzyme NADPH needed for a robust antioxidant response, including the regeneration of TRX1, indicating the existence of a regulatory feedback loop involving ATM and TRX1. We propose that loss of the mitochondrial ROS-sensing function of ATM may cause cellular ROS accumulation and oxidative stress in A-T.</p>

Evolution of human, chicken, alligator, frog, and zebrafish mineralocorticoid receptors: Allosteric influence on steroid specificity
<p>Although multiple steroid ligands of the glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid, and progestin families bind to and regulate the activity of mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs), the responses to these ligands differ across species. To <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">under</span></strong>stand how the different domains of MRs contribute to the ligand-induced activation or inhibition of MR activity, we studied the response to eight steroids (aldosterone, 11-deoxycorticosterone, 11-deoxycortisol, cortisol, corticosterone, progesterone, 19-norprogesterone, and spironolactone) of human, chicken, alligator, frog, and zebrafish full-length MRs and truncated MRs, which lacked the N-terminal domain (NTD) and DNA binding domain (DBD). Compared to full-length MRs, some truncated MRs were not activated by the steroids, and others required higher steroid concentrations for activation. Progesterone, 19-norprogesterone, and spironolactone did not activate full-length or truncated human, alligator, or frog MRs. However, at 10 nM, these steroids activated full-length chicken and zebrafish MRs, whereas at 100 nM, these steroids had little activity for truncated chicken MRs, but they retained activity for truncated zebrafish MRs. This suggests that regulation of the activation of the chicken MR by progestin resides in the NTD-DBD and that of the zebrafish MR resides in the hinge-LBD. Zebrafish and chicken MRs contain a serine corresponding to Ser<sup>810</sup> in human MR, which is required for the antagonist activity of progesterone for human MR, suggesting a previously uncharacterized mechanism of regulation of progestin activation of chicken and zebrafish MRs. These findings suggest that progesterone may be a physiological activator of chicken and zebrafish MRs.</p>

The SUMO Conjugation Complex Self-Assembles into Nuclear Bodies Independent of SIZ1 and COP1
<p>Attachment of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) to substrate proteins modulates their turnover, activity, or interaction partners.

COP1 activity results in degradation of transcription factors, which primes the transcriptional response that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">under</span></strong>lies elongation growth induced by darkness and high ambient temperatures (skoto- and thermo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">morph</span></strong>ogenesis, respectively). SUMO <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conjugation</span></strong> activity alone was sufficient to target the SUMO machinery into NBs. Colocalization of these bodies with COP1 required, in addition to SUMO <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conjugation</span></strong> activity, a SUMO acceptor site in COP1 and the SUMO E3 ligase SAP and Miz 1 (SIZ1). We found that SIZ1 docks in the substrate-binding pocket of COP1 via two valine-proline peptide motifs, which represent a known interaction motif of COP1 substrates. The data reveal that SIZ1 physically connects COP1 and SUMO <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conjugation</span></strong> activity in the same NBs that can also contain the blue-light receptors CRYPTOCHROME 1 and CRYPTOCHROME 2. Our findings thus suggest that sumoylation stimulates COP1 activity within NBs. Moreover, the presence of SIZ1 and SUMO in these NBs explains how both the timing and amplitude of the high-temperature growth response is controlled. The strong colocalization of COP1 and SUMO in these NBs might also explain why many COP1 substrates are sumoylated.</p>

The <i>RIN-MC</i> Fusion of MADS-Box Transcription Factors Has Transcriptional Activity and Modulates Expression of Many Ripening Genes
<p>Fruit development and ripening is regulated by genetic and environmental factors and is of critical importance for seed dispersal, reproduction, and fruit quality. Tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) <i>ripening inhibitor</i> (<i>rin</i>) mutant fruit have a classic ripening-inhibited phenotype, which is attributed to a genomic DNA deletion resulting in the fusion of two truncated transcription factors, <i>RIN</i> and <i>MC</i>. In wild-type fruit, RIN, a MADS-box transcription factor, is a key regulator of the ripening gene expression network, with hundreds of gene targets controlling changes in color, flavor, texture, and taste during tomato fruit ripening; <i>MC</i>, on the other hand, has low expression in fruit, and the potential functions of the <i>RIN-MC</i> fusion gene in ripening remain unclear. Here, overexpression of <i>RIN-MC</i> in transgenic wild-type cv Ailsa Craig tomato fruits impaired several ripening processes, and down-regulating <i>RIN-MC</i> expression in the <i>rin</i> mutant was found to stimulate the normal yellow mutant fruit to produce a weak red color, suggesting a distinct negative role for <i>RIN-MC</i> in tomato fruit ripening. By comparative transcriptome analysis of <i>rin</i> and <i>rin 35S</i>::<i>RIN-MC</i> RNA interference fruits, a total of 1,168 and 1,234 genes were identified as potential targets of RIN-MC activation and inhibition. Furthermore, the <i>RIN-MC</i> fusion gene was shown to be translated into a chimeric transcription factor that was localized to the nucleus and was capable of protein interactions with other MADS-box factors. These results indicated that tomato RIN-MC fusion plays a negative role in ripening and encodes a chimeric transcription factor that modulates the expression of many ripening genes, thereby contributing to the <i>rin</i> mutant phenotype.</p>

Manipulation of a Senescence-Associated Gene Improves Fleshy Fruit Yield
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">senescence</span></strong> is the process that marks the end of a leaf’s lifespan. As it progresses, the massive macromolecular catabolism dismantles the chloroplasts and, consequently, decreases the photosynthetic capacity of these organs. Thus, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">senescence</span></strong> manipulation is a strategy to improve plant yield by extending the leaf’s photosynthetically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">active</span></strong> window of time. However, it remains to be addressed if this approach can improve fleshy fruit production and nutritional quality. One way to delay <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">senescence</span></strong> initiation is by regulating key transcription factors (TFs) involved in triggering this process, such as the NAC TF ORESARA1 (ORE1). Here, three <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">senescence</span></strong>-related NAC TFs from tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) were identified, namely SlORE1S02, SlORE1S03, and SlORE1S06. All three genes were shown to be responsive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">senescence</span></strong>-inducing stimuli and posttranscriptionally regulated by the microRNA <i>miR164</i>. Moreover, the encoded proteins interacted physically with the chloroplast maintenance-related TF SlGLKs. This characterization led to the selection of a putative tomato <i>ORE1</i> as target gene for RNA interference knockdown. Transgenic lines showed delayed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">senescence</span></strong> and enhanced carbon assimilation that, ultimately, increased the number of fruits and their total soluble solid content. Additionally, the fruit nutraceutical composition was enhanced. In conclusion, these data provide robust evidence that the manipulation of leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">senescence</span></strong> is an effective strategy for yield improvement in fleshy fruit-bearing species.</p>

Ligand-dependent Notch signaling strength orchestrates lateral induction and lateral inhibition in the developing inner ear
<p>During inner ear development, Notch exhibits two modes of operation: <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lateral</span></strong> induction, which is associated with prosensory specification, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lateral</span></strong> inhibition, which is involved in hair cell determination. These mechanisms depend respectively on two different ligands, jagged 1 (Jag1) and delta 1 (Dl1), that rely on a common <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing cascade initiated after Notch activation. In the chicken otocyst, expression of Jag1 and the Notch target Hey1 correlates well with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lateral</span></strong> induction, whereas both Jag1 and Dl1 are expressed during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lateral</span></strong> inhibition, as are Notch targets Hey1 and Hes5. Here, we show that Jag1 drives lower levels of Notch activity than Dl1, which results in the differential expression of Hey1 and Hes5. In addition, Jag1 interferes with the ability of Dl1 to elicit high levels of Notch activity. Modeling the sensory epithelium when the two ligands are expressed together shows that ligand regulation, differential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing strength and ligand competition are crucial to allow the two modes of operation and for establishing the alternate pattern of hair cells and supporting cells. Jag1, while driving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lateral</span></strong> induction on its own, facilitates patterning by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lateral</span></strong> inhibition in the presence of Dl1. This novel behavior emerges from Jag1 acting as a competitive inhibitor of Dl1 for Notch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing. Both modeling and experiments show that hair cell patterning is very robust. The model suggests that autoactivation of proneural factor Atoh1, upstream of Dl1, is a fundamental component for robustness. The results stress the importance of the levels of Notch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing and ligand competition for Notch function.</p>

Fibroblast-Specific Genetic Manipulation of p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase In Vivo Reveals Its Central Regulatory Role in Fibrosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In the heart, acute injury induces a fibrotic healing response that generates collagen-rich scarring that is at first protective but if inappropriately sustained can worsen heart disease. The fibrotic process is initiated by cytokines, neuroendocrine effectors, and mechanical strain that promote resident fibroblast differentiation into contractile and extracellular matrix–producing myofibroblasts. The mitogen-activated protein kinase p38α (<i>Mapk14</i> gene) is known to influence the cardiac injury response, but its direct role in orchestrating programmed fibroblast differentiation and fibrosis in vivo is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A conditional <i>Mapk14</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">allele</span></strong> was used to delete the p38α encoding gene specifically in cardiac fibroblasts or myofibroblasts with 2 different tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase–expressing gene–targeted mouse lines. Mice were subjected to ischemic injury or chronic neurohumoral stimulation and monitored for survival, cardiac function, and fibrotic remodeling. Antithetically, mice with fibroblast-specific transgenic overexpression of activated mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 6, a direct inducer of p38, were generated to investigate whether this pathway can directly drive myofibroblast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">formation</span></strong> and the cardiac fibrotic response.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In mice, loss of <i>Mapk14</i> blocked cardiac fibroblast differentiation into myofibroblasts and ensuing fibrosis in response to ischemic injury or chronic neurohumoral stimulation.

Transgenic mice with fibroblast-specific activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 6–p38 developed interstitial and perivascular fibrosis in the heart, lung, and kidney as a result of enhanced myofibroblast numbers.

Neuronal activity drives FMRP- and HSPG-dependent matrix metalloproteinase function required for rapid synaptogenesis
<p>Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) functions modulate synapse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">formation</span></strong> and activity-dependent plasticity. Aberrant MMP activity is implicated in fragile X syndrome (FXS), a disease caused by the loss of the RNA-binding protein FMRP and characterized by neurological dysfunction and intellectual disability. Gene expression studies in <i>Drosophila</i> suggest that Mmps cooperate with the heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) glypican co-receptor Dally-like protein (Dlp) to restrict trans-synaptic Wnt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing and that synaptogenic defects in the fly model of FXS are alleviated by either inhibition of Mmp or genetic reduction of Dlp. We used the <i>Drosophila</i> neuromuscular junction (NMJ) glutamatergic synapse to test activity-dependent Dlp and Mmp intersections in the context of FXS. We found that rapid, activity-dependent synaptic bouton <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">formation</span></strong> depended on secreted Mmp1. Acute neuronal stimulation reduced the abundance of Mmp2 but increased that of both Mmp1 and Dlp, as well as enhanced the colocalization of Dlp and Mmp1 at the synapse. Dlp function promoted Mmp1 abundance, localization, and proteolytic activity around synapses. Dlp glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains mediated this functional interaction with Mmp1. In the FXS fly model, activity-dependent increases in Mmp1 abundance and activity were lost but were restored by reducing the amount of synaptic Dlp. The data suggest that neuronal activity-induced, HSPG-dependent Mmp regulation drives activity-dependent synaptogenesis and that this is impaired in FXS. Thus, exploring this mechanism further may reveal therapeutic targets that have the potential to restore synaptogenesis in FXS patients.</p>

TGF-β promotes PI3K-AKT signaling and prostate cancer cell migration through the TRAF6-mediated ubiquitylation of p85α
<p>Transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) is a pluripotent cytokine that regulates cell fate and plasticity in normal tissues and tumors. The multifunctional cellular responses evoked by TGF-β are mediated by the canonical SMAD pathway and by noncanonical pathways, including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways and the phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3K)–protein kinase B (AKT) pathway. We found that TGF-β activated PI3K in a manner dependent on the activity of the E3 ubiquitin ligase tumor necrosis factor receptor–associated factor 6 (TRAF6). TRAF6 polyubiquitylated the PI3K regulatory subunit p85α and promoted the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">formation</span></strong> of a complex between the TGF-β type I receptor (TβRI) and p85α, which led to the activation of PI3K and AKT. Lys<sup>63</sup>-linked polyubiquitylation of p85α on Lys<sup>513</sup> and Lys<sup>519</sup> in the iSH2 (inter–Src homology 2) domain was required for TGF-β–induced activation of PI3K-AKT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing and cell motility in prostate cancer cells and activated macrophages. Unlike the activation of SMAD pathways, the TRAF6-mediated activation of PI3K and AKT was not dependent on the kinase activity of TβRI. In situ proximity ligation assays revealed that polyubiquitylation of p85α was evident in aggressive prostate cancer tissues. Thus, our data reveal a molecular mechanism by which TGF-β activates the PI3K-AKT pathway to drive cell migration.</p>

Prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub>–EP2–NF-κB signaling in macrophages as a potential therapeutic target for intracranial aneurysms
<p>Intracranial aneurysms are common but are generally untreated, and their rupture can lead to subarachnoid hemorrhage. Because of the poor prognosis associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage, preventing the progression of intracranial aneurysms is critically important. Intracranial aneurysms are caused by chronic inflammation of the arterial wall due to macrophage infiltration triggered by monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), macrophage activation mediated by the transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), and inflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing involving prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>) and prostaglandin E receptor subtype 2 (EP2). We correlated EP2 and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) with macrophage infiltration in human intracranial aneurysm lesions. Monitoring the spatiotemporal pattern of NF-κB activation during intracranial aneurysm development in mice showed that NF-κB was first activated in macrophages in the adventitia and in endothelial cells and, subsequently, in the entire arterial wall. Mice with a macrophage-specific deletion of <i>Ptger2</i> (which encodes EP2) or macrophage-specific expression of an IκBα mutant that restricts NF-κB activation had fewer intracranial aneurysms with reduced macrophage infiltration and NF-κB activation. In cultured cells, EP2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing cooperated with tumor necrosis factor–α (TNF-α) to activate NF-κB and synergistically induce the expression of proinflammatory genes, including <i>Ptgs2</i> (encoding COX-2). EP2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing also stabilized <i>Ccl2</i> (encoding MCP-1) by activating the RNA-stabilizing protein HuR. Rats administered an EP2 antagonist had reduced macrophage infiltration and intracranial aneurysm <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">formation</span></strong> and progression. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathway in macrophages thus facilitates intracranial aneurysm development by amplifying inflammation in intracranial arteries. These results indicate that EP2 antagonists may therefore be a therapeutic alternative to surgery.</p>

Embryonic neural activity wires the brain
<p>The development of many sensory systems commonly involves patterned spontaneous activity of neurons, in which nearby neurons fire synchronously, forming waves of activity that propagate throughout a neural circuit.

The initial establishment of sensory maps is thought to be driven by molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cue</span></strong>s and later refined by neural activity, initially through patterned spontaneous activity and later by sensory-evoked activity.

Senescence and Defense Pathways Contribute to Heterosis

Recent evidence has suggested that a decrease in basal defense response gene expression regulated by reduced levels of salicylic acid (SA) may be important for vigor in certain hybrid combinations. Decreasing levels of SA in the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) accession C24 through the introduction of the SA catabolic enzyme salicylate1 hydroxylase (NahG) increases plant size, phenocopying the large-sized C24/Landsberg <i>erecta</i> (L<i>er</i>) F1 hybrids.

Extracellular ATP Shapes a Defense-Related Transcriptome Both Independently and along with Other Defense Signaling Pathways
<p>ATP is not only an essential metabolite of cellular biochemistry but also acts as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong> in the extracellular milieu. In plants, extracellular ATP is monitored by the purinergic receptor P2K1. Recent studies have revealed that extracellular ATP acts as a damage-associated molecular pattern in plants, and its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing through P2K1 is important for mounting an effective defense response against various pathogenic microorganisms. Biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens attack plants using different strategies, to which plants respond accordingly with salicylate-based or jasmonate/ethylene-based defensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing, respectively. Inte<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resting</span></strong>ly, defense mediated by P2K1 is effective against pathogens of both lifestyles, raising the question of the level of interplay between extracellular ATP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing and that of jasmonate, ethylene, and salicylate. To address this issue, we analyzed ATP-induced transcriptomes in wild-type Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings and mutant seedlings defective in essential components in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathways of jasmonate, ethylene, and salicylate (classic defense hormones) as well as a mutant and an overexpression line of the P2K1 receptor. We found that P2K1 function is crucial for faithful ATP-induced transcriptional changes and that a subset of genes is more responsive in the P2K1 overexpression line. We also found that more than half of the ATP-responsive genes required <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing by one or more of the pathways for the classical defense hormones, with the jasmonate-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing being more critical than others. By contrast, the other ATP-responsive genes were unaffected by deficiencies in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing for any of the classical defense hormones. These ATP-responsive genes were highly enriched for defense-related Gene Ontology terms. We further tested the ATP-induced genes in knockout mutants of transcription factors, demonstrating that MYCs acting downstream of the jasmonate receptor complex and calmodulin-binding transcription activators are nuclear transducers of P2K1-mediated extracellular ATP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing.</p>

BZR1 Mediates Brassinosteroid-Induced Autophagy and Nitrogen Starvation in Tomato
<p>Autophagy, an innate cellular destructive mechanism, plays crucial roles in plant development and responses to stress. Autophagy is known to be stimulated or suppressed by multiple molecular processes, but the role of phytohormone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing in autophagy is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the transcripts of autophagy-related genes (<i>ATGs</i>) and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">formation</span></strong> of autophagosomes are triggered by enhanced levels of brassinosteroid (BR). Furthermore, the BR-activated transcription factor brassinazole-resistant1 (BZR1), a positive regulator of the BR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathway, is involved in BR-induced autophagy. Treatment with BR enhanced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">formation</span></strong> of autophagosomes and the transcripts of <i>ATGs</i> in <i>BZR1</i>-overexpressing plants, while the effects of BR were compromised in <i>BZR1</i>-silenced plants. Yeast one-hybrid analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with quantitative polymerase chain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong> revealed that BZR1 bound to the promoters of <i>ATG2</i> and <i>ATG6</i>. The BR-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">formation</span></strong> of autophagosomes decreased in <i>ATG2</i>- and <i>ATG6</i>-silenced plants. Moreover, exogenous application of BR enhanced chlorophyll content and autophagosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">formation</span></strong> and decreased the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">under</span></strong> nitrogen starvation. Leaf chlorosis and chlorophyll degradation were exacerbated in <i>BZR1</i>-silenced plants and the BR biosynthetic mutant <i>d<sup>^im</sup></i> but were alleviated in <i>BZR1</i>- and <i>BZR1-1D</i>-overexpressing plants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">under</span></strong> nitrogen starvation.

The ARF7 and ARF19 Transcription Factors Positively Regulate <i>PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE1</i> in Arabidopsis Roots
<p>PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE1 (PHR1) is a key regulatory component of the response to phosphate (Pi) starvation. However, the regulation of <i>PHR1</i> in this response remains poorly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">under</span></strong>stood. Here, we report that <i>PHR1</i> is a target of the transcription factors AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR7 (ARF7) and ARF19 and is positively regulated by auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) roots. <i>PHR1</i> expression was induced by exogenous auxin and suppressed by auxin transport inhibitors in Arabidopsis roots. In the <i>PHR1</i> promoter, three auxin-response elements, which are bound directly by ARF7 and ARF19, were shown to be essential for <i>PHR1</i> expression. The <i>arf7</i>, <i>arf19</i>, and <i>arf7 arf19</i> mutants showed down-regulated expression of <i>PHR1</i> and downstream Pi starvation-induced genes in roots; they also exhibited defective Pi uptake in roots and overaccumulation of anthocyanin in shoots. The induction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lateral</span></strong> root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">formation</span></strong> in response to low Pi and to exogenous auxin was decreased in the <i>phr1</i> mutant, whereas the expression of <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lateral</span></strong> ORGAN BOUNDARIES-DOMAIN16</i> (<i>LBD16</i>) and <i>LBD29</i> was not changed significantly. PHR1 acted independently of LBD16 and LBD29 in the regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lateral</span></strong> root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">formation</span></strong> in response to low Pi. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">under</span></strong> low-Pi conditions, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lateral</span></strong> root impairment in the <i>arf7 arf19</i> mutant was partially res<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cue</span></strong>d by constitutive expression of <i>PHR1</i>, demonstrating that reduced <i>PHR1</i> expression contributed to the <i>arf7 arf19</i> phenotype.

We show that germinating seeds of a hydroxy-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fatty</span></strong> acid-accumulating Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) line produce chlorotic cotyledons and suffer reduced photosynthetic capacity. These seedlings retain hydroxy-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fatty</span></strong> acids in polar lipids, including chloroplast lipids, and exhibit decreased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fatty</span></strong> acid synthesis. Triacylglycerol mobilization in seedling development also is reduced, especially for lipids that include hydroxy-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fatty</span></strong> acid moieties. These developmental defects are ameliorated by increased flux of hydroxy-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fatty</span></strong> acids into seed triacylglycerol created through the expression of either castor (<i>Ricinus communis</i>) acyltransferase enzyme ACYL-COA:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE2 or PHOSPHOLIPID:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1A. Such expression increases both the level of total stored triacylglycerol and the rate at which it is mobilized, fueling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fatty</span></strong> acid synthesis and restoring photosynthetic capacity. Our results suggest that further improvements in seedling development may require the specific mobilization of triacylglycerol-containing hydroxy-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fatty</span></strong> acids. Understanding the defects in early development caused by the accumulation of modified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fatty</span></strong> acids and providing mechanisms to circumvent these defects are vital steps in the development of tailored oil crops.</p>

Transcriptional Roadmap to Seasonal Variation in Wood Formation of Norway Spruce
<p>Seasonal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cue</span></strong>s influence several aspects of the secondary growth of tree stems, including cambial activity, wood chemistry, and transition to latewood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">formation</span></strong>. We investigated seasonal changes in cambial activity, secondary cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">formation</span></strong>, and tracheid cell death in woody tissues of Norway spruce (<i>Picea abies</i>) throughout one seasonal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycle</span></strong>. RNA sequencing was performed simultaneously in both the xylem and cambium/phloem tissues of the stem. Principal component analysis revealed gradual shifts in the transcriptomes that followed a chronological order throughout the season. A notable remodeling of the transcriptome was observed in the winter, with many genes having maximal expression during the coldest months of the year. A highly coexpressed set of monolignol biosynthesis genes showed high expression during the period of secondary cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">formation</span></strong> as well as a second peak in midwinter. This midwinter peak in expression did not trigger lignin deposition, as determined by pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Coexpression consensus network analyses suggested the involvement of transcription factors belonging to the ASYMMETRIC LEAVES2/LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES and MYELOBLASTOSIS-HOMEOBOX families in the seasonal control of secondary cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">formation</span></strong> of tracheids. Inte<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resting</span></strong>ly, the lifetime of the latewood tracheids stretched beyond the winter dormancy period, correlating with a lack of cell death-related gene expression. Our transcriptomic analyses combined with phylogenetic and microscopic analyses also identified the cellulose and lignin biosynthetic genes and putative regulators for latewood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">formation</span></strong> and tracheid cell death in Norway spruce, providing a toolbox for further physiological and functional assays of these important phase transitions.</p>

Regulation of Hormonal Control, Cell Reprogramming, and Patterning during De Novo Root Organogenesis
<p>Body regeneration through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">formation</span></strong> of new organs is a major question in developmental biology. We investigated de novo root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">formation</span></strong> using whole leaves of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Our results show that local cytokinin biosynthesis and auxin biosynthesis in the leaf blade followed by auxin long-distance transport to the petiole leads to proliferation of J0121-marked xylem-associated tissues and others through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing of INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID INDUCIBLE28 (IAA28), CRANE (IAA18), WOODEN LEG, and ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATORS1 (ARR1), ARR10, and ARR12. Vasculature proliferation also involves the cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycle</span></strong> regulator KIP-RELATED PROTEIN2 and ABERRANT LATERAL ROOT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">formation</span></strong>4, resulting in a mass of cells with rooting competence that resembles callus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">formation</span></strong>. Endogenous callus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">formation</span></strong> precedes specification of postembryonic root fo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">under</span></strong> cells, from which roots are initiated through the activity of SHORT-ROOT, PLETHORA1 (PLT1), and PLT2. Primordia initiation is blocked in <i>shr plt1 plt2</i> mutant. Stem cell regulators SCHIZORIZA, JACKDAW, BLUEJAY, and SCARECROW also participate in root initiation and are required to pattern the new organ, as mutants show dis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organized</span></strong> and reduced number of layers and tissue initials resulting in reduced rooting. Our work provides an organ regeneration model through de novo root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">formation</span></strong>, stating key stages and the primary pathways involved.</p>

Determining the Site of Action of Strigolactones during Nodulation
<p>Strigolactones (SLs) influence the ability of legumes to associate with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. In this study, we determine the precise stage at which SLs influence nodulation. We show that SLs promote infection thread <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">formation</span></strong>, as a null SL-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deficient</span></strong> pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) mutant forms significantly fewer infection threads than wild-type plants, and this reduction can be overcome by the application of the synthetic SL GR24. We found no evidence that SLs influence physical events in the plant before or after infection thread <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">formation</span></strong>, since SL-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deficient</span></strong> plants displayed a similar ability to induce root hair curling in response to rhizobia or Nod lipochitooligosaccharides (LCOs) and SL-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deficient</span></strong> nodules appear to fix nitrogen at a similar rate to those of wild-type plants. In contrast, an SL receptor mutant displayed no decrease in infection thread <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">formation</span></strong> or nodule number, suggesting that SL deficiency may influence the bacterial partner. We found that this influence of SL deficiency was not due to altered flavonoid exudation or the ability of root exudates to stimulate bacterial growth. The influence of SL deficiency on infection thread <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">formation</span></strong> was accompanied by reduced expression of some early nodulation genes. Importantly, SL synthesis is down-regulated by mutations in genes of the Nod LCO <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathway, and this requires the downstream transcription factor <i>NSP2</i> but not <i>NIN</i>. This, together with the fact that the expression of certain SL biosynthesis genes can be elevated in response to rhizobia/Nod LCOs, suggests that Nod LCOs may induce SL biosynthesis. SLs appear to influence nodulation independently of ethylene action, as SL-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deficient</span></strong> and ethylene-insensitive double mutant plants display essentially additive phenotypes, and we found no evidence that SLs influence ethylene synthesis or vice versa.</p>

OsHAD1, a Haloacid Dehalogenase-Like APase, Enhances Phosphate Accumulation
<p>Phosphorus (P) deficiency limits plant growth and yield. Since plants can absorb only the inorganic form of P (Pi), a large portion of soil P (organic and inorganic P complexes) remains unused. Here, we identified and characterized a PHR2-regulated, novel low-Pi-responsive haloacid dehalogenase (HAD)-like hydrolase, <i>OsHAD1</i>. While OsHAD1 is a functional HAD protein having both acid phosphatase and phytase activities, it showed little homology with other known low-Pi-responsive HAD superfamily members. Recombinant OsHAD1 is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">active</span></strong> at acidic pH and dephosphorylates a broad range of organic and inorganic P-containing substrates, including phosphorylated serine and sodium phytate. Exogenous application of recombinant OsHAD1 protein in growth medium supplemented with phytate led to marked increases in growth and total P content of Pi-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deficient</span></strong> wild-type rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) seedlings. Furthermore, overexpression of <i>OsHAD1</i> in rice resulted in enhanced phosphatase activity, biomass, and total and soluble P contents in Pi-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deficient</span></strong> transgenic seedlings treated with phytate as a restricted Pi source. Gene expression and metabolite profiling revealed enhanced Pi starvation responses, such as up-regulation of multiple genes involved in Pi uptake and solubilization, accumulation of organic acids, enhanced secretory phosphatase activity, and depletion of ATP in overexpression lines as compared with the wild type. To elucidate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">under</span></strong>lying regulatory mechanisms of OsHAD1, we performed in vitro pull-down assays, which revealed the association of OsHAD1 with protein kinases such as OsNDPKs. We conclude that, besides dephosphorylation of cellular organic P, OsHAD1 in coordination with kinases may regulate the phosphorylation status of downstream targets to accomplish Pi homeostasis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">under</span></strong> limited Pi supply.</p>

Cuticle Biosynthesis in Tomato Leaves Is Developmentally Regulated by Abscisic Acid
<p>The expansion of aerial organs in plants is coupled with the synthesis and deposition of a hydrophobic cuticle, composed of cutin and waxes, which is critically important in limiting water loss. While the abiotic stress-related hormone abscisic acid (ABA) is known to up-regulate wax accumulation in response to drought, the hormonal regulation of cuticle biosynthesis during organ ontogeny is poorly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">under</span></strong>stood. To address the hypothesis that ABA also mediates cuticle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">formation</span></strong> during organ development, we assessed the effect of ABA deficiency on cuticle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">formation</span></strong> in three ABA biosynthesis-impaired tomato mutants. The mutant leaf cuticles were thinner, had structural abnormalities, and had a substantial reduction in levels of cutin. ABA deficiency also consistently resulted in differences in the composition of leaf cutin and cuticular waxes. Exogenous application of ABA partially res<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cue</span></strong>d these phenotypes, confirming that they were a consequence of reduced ABA levels. The ABA mutants also showed reduced expression of genes involved in cutin or wax <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">formation</span></strong>. This difference was again countered by exogenous ABA, further indicating regulation of cuticle biosynthesis by ABA. The fruit cuticles were affected differently by the ABA-associated mutations, but in general were thicker. However, no structural abnormalities were observed, and the cutin and wax compositions were less affected than in leaf cuticles, suggesting that ABA action influences cuticle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">formation</span></strong> in an organ-dependent manner. These results suggest dual roles for ABA in regulating leaf cuticle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">formation</span></strong>: one that is fundamentally associated with leaf expansion, independent of abiotic stress, and another that is drought induced.</p>

Heavy Metals Induce Iron Deficiency Responses at Different Hierarchic and Regulatory Levels
<p>In plants, the excess of several heavy metals mimics iron (Fe) deficiency-induced chlorosis, indicating a disturbance in Fe homeostasis. To examine the level at which heavy metals interfere with Fe deficiency responses, we carried out an in-depth characterization of Fe-related physiological, regulatory, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">morph</span></strong>ological responses in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exposed</span></strong> to heavy metals. Enhanced zinc (Zn) uptake closely mimicked Fe deficiency by leading to low chlorophyll but high ferric-chelate reductase activity and coumarin release. These responses were not caused by Zn-inhibited Fe uptake via IRON-REGULATED TRANSPORTER (IRT1). Instead, Zn simulated the transcriptional response of typical Fe-regulated genes, indicating that Zn affects Fe homeostasis at the level of Fe sensing. Excess supplies of cobalt and nickel altered root traits in a different way from Fe deficiency, inducing only transient Fe deficiency responses, which were characterized by a lack of induction of the ethylene pathway. Cadmium showed a rather inconsistent influence on Fe deficiency responses at multiple levels. By contrast, manganese evoked weak Fe deficiency responses in wild-type plants but strongly exacerbated chlorosis in <i>irt1</i> plants, indicating that manganese antagonized Fe mainly at the level of transport. These results show that the investigated heavy metals modulate Fe deficiency responses at different hierarchic and regulatory levels and that the interaction of metals with physiological and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">morph</span></strong>ological Fe deficiency responses is uncoupled. Thus, this study not only emphasizes the importance of assessing heavy metal toxicities at multiple levels but also provides a new perspective on how Fe deficiency contributes to the toxic action of individual heavy metals.</p>

Light Controls Cytokinin Signaling via Transcriptional Regulation of Constitutively Active Sensor Histidine Kinase CKI1
<p>In plants, the multistep phosphorelay (MSP) pathway mediates a range of regulatory processes, including those activated by cytokinins. The cross talk between cytokinin response and light has been known for a long time. However, the molecular mechanism <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">under</span></strong>lying the interaction between light and cytokinin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing remains elusive. In the screen for upstream regulators we identified a <i>LONG PALE HYPOCOTYL</i> (<i>LPH</i>) gene whose activity is indispensable for spatiotemporally correct expression of <i>CYTOKININ INDEPENDENT1</i> (<i>CKI1</i>), encoding the constitutively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">active</span></strong> sensor His kinase that activates MSP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing. <i>lph</i> is a new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">allele</span></strong> of <i>HEME OXYGENASE1</i> (<i>HY1</i>) that encodes the key protein in the biosynthesis of phytochromobilin, a cofactor of photoconvertible phytochromes. Our analysis confirmed the light-dependent regulation of the <i>CKI1</i> expression pattern. We show that <i>CKI1</i> expression is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">under</span></strong> the control of phytochrome A (phyA), functioning as a dual (both positive and negative) regulator of <i>CKI1</i> expression, presumably via the phyA-regulated transcription factors (TF) PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR3 and CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Change</span></strong>s in <i>CKI1</i> expression observed in <i>lph</i>/<i>hy1</i>-<i>7</i> and <i>phy</i> mutants correlate with misregulation of MSP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Change</span></strong>d cytokinin sensitivity, and developmental aberrations that were previously shown to be associated with cytokinin and/or CKI1 action. Besides that, we demonstrate a novel role of phyA-dependent <i>CKI1</i> expression in the hypocotyl elongation and hook development during skoto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">morph</span></strong>ogenesis. Based on these results, we propose that the light-dependent regulation of <i>CKI1</i> provides a plausible mechanistic link <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">under</span></strong>lying the well-known interaction between light- and cytokinin-controlled plant development.</p>

The Arabidopsis Mitochondrial Protease FtSH4 Is Involved in Leaf Senescence via Regulation of WRKY-Dependent Salicylic Acid Accumulation and Signaling
<p>Mitochondria and autophagy play important roles in the networks that regulate plant leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">senescence</span></strong> and cell death. However, the molecular mechanisms <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">under</span></strong>lying the interactions between mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing and autophagy are currently not well <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">under</span></strong>stood. This study characterized the function of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mitochondrial AAA-protease gene <i>FtSH4</i> in regulating autophagy and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">senescence</span></strong>, finding that FtSH4 mediates WRKY-dependent salicylic acid (SA) accumulation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing. Knockout of <i>FtSH4</i> in the <i>ftsh4-4</i> mutant resulted in severe leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">senescence</span></strong>, cell death, and high autophagy levels. The level of SA increased dramatically in the <i>ftsh4-4</i> mutant. Expression of <i>nahG</i> in the <i>ftsh4-4</i> mutant led to decreased SA levels and suppressed the leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">senescence</span></strong> and cell death phenotypes. The transcript levels of several SA synthesis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing genes, including <i>SALICYLIC ACID</i> <i>INDUCTION DEFICIENT2</i> (<i>SID2</i>), <i>NON-RACE-SPECIFIC DISEASE RESISTANCE1</i> (<i>NDR1</i>), and <i>NONEXPRESSOR OF PATHOGENESIS-RELATED PROTEINS1</i> (<i>NPR1</i>), increased significantly in the <i>ftsh4-4</i> mutants compared with the wild type. Loss of function of <i>SID2</i>, <i>NDR1</i>, or <i>NPR1</i> in the <i>ftsh4-4</i> mutant reversed the <i>ftsh4-4</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">senescence</span></strong> and autophagy phenotypes. Furthermore, <i>ftsh4-4</i> mutants had elevated levels of transcripts of several <i>WRKY</i> genes, including <i>WRKY40</i>, <i>WRKY46</i>, <i>WRKY51</i>, <i>WRKY60</i>, <i>WRKY63</i>, and <i>WRKY75</i>; all of these WRKY proteins can bind to the promoter of <i>SID2</i>. Loss of function of <i>WRKY75</i> in the <i>ftsh4-4</i> mutants decreased the levels of SA and reversed the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">senescence</span></strong> phenotype. Taken together, these results suggest that the mitochondrial ATP-dependent protease FtSH4 may regulate the expression of <i>WRKY</i> genes by modifying the level of re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">active</span></strong> oxygen species and the WRKY transcription factors that control SA synthesis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing in autophagy and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">senescence</span></strong>.</p>

Genetic and phenotypically flexible components of seasonal variation in immune function
<p>Animals cope with seasonal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variation</span></strong> in environmental factors by adjustments of physiology and life history. When seasonal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variation</span></strong> is partly predictable, such adjustments can be based on a genetic component or be phenotypically flexible. Animals have to allocate limited resources over different demands, including immune function. Accordingly, immune traits could change seasonally, and such changes could have a genetic component that differs between environments. We tested this hypothesis in genotypically distinct groups of a widespread songbird, the stonechat (<i>Saxicola torquata</i>). We compared <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variation</span></strong> in immunity during 1 year in long-distance migrants, short-distance migrants, tropical residents and hybrids in a common garden environment. Additionally, we investigated phenotypically flexible responses to temperature by applying different temperature regimes to one group. We assessed constitutive immunity by measuring hemagglutination, hemolysis, haptoglobin and bactericidal ability against <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. Genotypic groups differed in patterns of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variation</span></strong> of all measured immune indices except haptoglobin. Hybrids differed from, but were rarely intermediate to, parental subspecies. Temperature treatment only influenced patterns of hemolysis and bactericidal ability against <i>E. coli.</i> We conclude that seasonal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variation</span></strong> in constitutive immunity has a genetic component, that heredity does not follow simple Mendelian rules, and that some immune measures are relatively rigid while others are more flexible. Furthermore, our results support the idea that seasonal variability in constitutive immunity is associated with variability in environment and annual-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycle</span></strong> demands. This study stresses the importance of considering seasonal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variation</span></strong> in immune function in relation to the ecology and life history of the organism of interest.</p>

Satellite cell activation and populations on single muscle-fiber cultures from adult zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>)
<p>Satellite cells (SCs), stem cells in skeletal muscle, are mitotically quiescent in adult mammals until activated for growth or regeneration. In mouse muscle, SCs are activated by nitric oxide (NO), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and the mechanically induced NO–HGF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing cascade. Here, the SC population on fibers from the adult, ectothermic zebrafish and SC responsiveness to activating stimuli were assessed using the model system of isolated fibers cultured at 27 and 21°C. SCs were identified by immunostaining for the HGF receptor, c-met, and activation was determined using bromodeoxyuridine uptake in culture or <i>in vivo</i>. In dose–response studies, SC activation was increased by treatment with the NO-donor drug isosorbide dinitrate (1 mmol l<sup>−1</sup>) or HGF (10 ng ml<sup>−1</sup>) to maximum activation at lower concentrations of both than in previous studies of mouse fibers. HGF-induced activation was blocked by anti-c-met antibody, and reduced by culture at 21°C. The effect of cyclical stretch (3 h at 4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycle</span></strong>s per minute) increased activation and was blocked by nitric oxide synthase inhibition and reduced by culture at 21°C. The number of c-met+ SCs per fiber increased rapidly (by 3 h) after stretching. The character of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing in SC activation on zebrafish fibers, in particular temperature-dependent responses to HGF and stretch, gives new insights into the influence of ectothermy on regulation of muscle growth in teleosts and suggests the use of the single-fiber model system to explore the basis of fiber hyperplasia and the conservation of regulatory pathways between species.</p>

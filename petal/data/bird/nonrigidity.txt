Epitaxial lift-off of electrodeposited single-crystal gold foils for flexible electronics
<p>We introduce a simple and inexpensive procedure for epitaxial lift-off of wafer-size <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flexibl</span></strong>e and transparent foils of single-crystal gold using silicon as a template. Lateral electrochemical undergrowth of a sacrificial SiO<i><sub>x</sub></i> layer was achieved by photoelectrochemically oxidizing silicon under light irradiation. A 28-nanometer-thick gold foil with a sheet resistance of 7 ohms per square showed only a 4% increase in resistance after 4000 bending cycles. A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flexibl</span></strong>e organic light-emitting diode based on tris(bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) that was spin-coated on a foil exploited the transmittance and flexibility of the gold foil. Cuprous oxide as an inorganic semiconductor that was epitaxially electrodeposited onto the gold foils exhibited a diode quality factor <i>n</i> of 1.6 (where <i>n</i> = 1.0 for an ideal diode), compared with a value of 3.1 for a polycrystalline deposit. Zinc oxide nanowires electrodeposited epitaxially on a gold foil also showed flexibility, with the nanowires intact up to 500 bending cycles.</p>

Biomimetic shark skin: design, fabrication and hydrodynamic function
<p>Although the functional properties of shark skin have been of considerable interest to both biologists and engineers because of the complex hydrodynamic effects of surface roughness, no study to date has successfully fabricated a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flexibl</span></strong>e biomimetic shark skin that allows detailed study of hydrodynamic function. We present the first study of the design, fabrication and hydrodynamic testing of a synthetic, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flexibl</span></strong>e, shark skin membrane. A three-dimensional (3D) model of shark skin denticles was constructed using micro-CT imaging of the skin of the shortfin mako (<i>Isurus oxyrinchus</i>). Using 3D printing, thousands of rigid synthetic shark denticles were placed on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flexibl</span></strong>e membranes in a controlled, linear-arrayed pattern. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flexibl</span></strong>e 3D printed shark skin model was then tested in water using a robotic flapping device that allowed us to either hold the models in a stationary position or move them dynamically at their self-propelled swimming speed. Compared with a smooth control model without denticles, the 3D printed shark skin showed increased swimming speed with reduced energy consumption under certain motion programs. For example, at a heave frequency of 1.5 Hz and an amplitude of ±1 cm, swimming speed increased by 6.6% and the energy cost-of-transport was reduced by 5.9%. In addition, a leading-edge vortex with greater vorticity than the smooth control was generated by the 3D printed shark skin, which may explain the increased swimming speeds. The ability to fabricate synthetic biomimetic shark skin opens up a wide array of possible manipulations of surface roughness parameters, and the ability to examine the hydrodynamic consequences of diverse skin denticle shapes present in different shark species.</p>

Genetic and phenotypically flexible components of seasonal variation in immune function
<p>Animals cope with seasonal variation in environmental factors by adjustments of physiology and life history. When seasonal variation is partly predictable, such adjustments can be based on a genetic component or be phenotypically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flexibl</span></strong>e. Animals have to allocate limited resources over different demands, including immune function. Accordingly, immune traits could change seasonally, and such changes could have a genetic component that differs between environments. We tested this hypothesis in genotypically distinct groups of a widespread songbird, the stonechat (<i>Saxicola torquata</i>). We compared variation in immunity during 1 year in long-distance migrants, short-distance migrants, tropical residents and hybrids in a common garden environment. Additionally, we investigated phenotypically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flexibl</span></strong>e responses to temperature by applying different temperature regimes to one group. We assessed constitutive immunity by measuring hemagglutination, hemolysis, haptoglobin and bactericidal ability against <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. Genotypic groups differed in patterns of variation of all measured immune indices except haptoglobin. Hybrids differed from, but were rarely intermediate to, parental subspecies. Temperature treatment only influenced patterns of hemolysis and bactericidal ability against <i>E. coli.</i> We conclude that seasonal variation in constitutive immunity has a genetic component, that heredity does not follow simple Mendelian rules, and that some immune measures are relatively rigid while others are more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flexibl</span></strong>e. Furthermore, our results support the idea that seasonal variability in constitutive immunity is associated with variability in environment and annual-cycle demands. This study stresses the importance of considering seasonal variation in immune function in relation to the ecology and life history of the organism of interest.</p>

Metal-free three-dimensional perovskite ferroelectrics
<p>Inorganic perovskite ferroelectrics are widely used in nonvolatile memory elements, capacitors, and sensors because of their excellent ferroelectric and other properties. Organic ferroelectrics are desirable for their mechanical flexibility, low weight, environmentally friendly processing, and low processing temperatures. Although almost a century has passed since the first ferroelectric, Rochelle salt, was discovered, examples of highly desirable organic perovskite ferroelectrics are lacking. We found a family of metal-free organic perovskite ferroelectrics with the characteristic three-dimensional structure, among which MDABCO (<i>N</i>-methyl-<i>N'</i>-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octonium)–ammonium triiodide has a spontaneous polarization of 22 microcoulombs per square centimeter [close to that of barium titanate (BTO)], a high phase transition temperature of 448 kelvins (above that of BTO), and eight possible polarization directions. These attributes make it attractive for use in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flexibl</span></strong>e devices, soft robotics, biomedical devices, and other applications.</p>

Control of zeolite framework flexibility and pore topology for separation of ethane and ethylene
<p>The discovery of new materials for separating ethylene from ethane by adsorption, instead of using cryogenic distillation, is a key milestone for molecular separations because of the multiple and widely extended uses of these molecules in industry. This technique has the potential to provide tremendous energy savings when compared with the currently used cryogenic distillation process for ethylene produced through steam cracking. Here we describe the synthesis and structural determination of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flexibl</span></strong>e pure silica zeolite (ITQ-55). This material can kinetically separate ethylene from ethane with an unprecedented selectivity of ~100, owing to its distinctive pore topology with large heart-shaped cages and framework flexibility. Control of such properties extends the boundaries for applicability of zeolites to challenging separations.</p>

Bumblebees show cognitive flexibility by improving on an observed complex behavior
<p>We explored bees’ behavioral flexibility in a task that required transporting a small ball to a defined location to gain a reward. Bees were pretrained to know the correct location of the ball. Subsequently, to obtain a reward, bees had to move a displaced ball to the defined location. Bees that observed demonstration of the technique from a live or model demonstrator learned the task more efficiently than did bees observing a “ghost” demonstration (ball moved via magnet) or without demonstration. Instead of copying demonstrators moving balls over long distances, observers solved the task more efficiently, using the ball positioned closest to the target, even if it was of a different color than the one previously observed. Such unprecedented cognitive flexibility hints that entirely novel behaviors could emerge relatively swiftly in species whose lifestyle demands advanced learning abilities, should relevant ecological pressures arise.</p>

MoChlo: A Versatile, Modular Cloning Toolbox for Chloroplast Biotechnology
<p>Plant synthetic biology is a rapidly evolving field with new tools constantly emerging to drive innovation. Of particular interest is the application of synthetic biology to chloroplast biotechnology to generate plants capable of producing new metabolites, vaccines, biofuels, and high-value chemicals. Progress made in the assembly of large DNA molecules, composing multiple transcriptional units, has significantly aided in the ability to rapidly construct novel vectors for genetic engineering. In particular, Golden Gate assembly has provided a facile molecular tool for standardized assembly of synthetic genetic elements into larger DNA constructs. In this work, a complete modular chloroplast cloning system, MoChlo, was developed and validated for fast and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flexibl</span></strong>e chloroplast engineering in plants. A library of 128 standardized chloroplast-specific parts (47 promoters, 38 5′ untranslated regions [5′UTRs], nine promoter:5′UTR fusions, 10 3′UTRs, 14 genes of interest, and 10 chloroplast-specific destination vectors) were mined from the literature and modified for use in MoChlo assembly, along with chloroplast-specific destination vectors. The strategy was validated by assembling synthetic operons of various sizes and determining the efficiency of assembly. This method was successfully used to generate chloroplast transformation vectors containing up to seven transcriptional units in a single vector (∼10.6-kb synthetic operon). To enable researchers with limited resources to engage in chloroplast biotechnology, and to accelerate progress in the field, the entire kit, as described, is available through Addgene at minimal cost. Thus, the MoChlo kit represents a valuable tool for fast and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flexibl</span></strong>e design of heterologous metabolic pathways for plastid metabolic engineering.</p>

A Comprehensive Toolkit for Inducible, Cell Type-Specific Gene Expression in Arabidopsis
<p>Understanding the context-specific role of gene function is a key objective of modern biology. To this end, we generated a resource for inducible cell type-specific transactivation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) based on the well-established combination of the chimeric GR-LhG4 transcription factor and the synthetic <i>pOp</i> promoter. Harnessing the flexibility of the GreenGate cloning system, we produced a comprehensive set of transgenic lines termed GR-LhG4 driver lines targeting most tissues in the Arabidopsis shoot and root with a strong focus on the indeterminate meristems. When we combined these transgenic lines with effectors under the control of the <i>pOp</i> promoter, we observed tight temporal and spatial control of gene expression. In particular, inducible expression in F1 plants obtained from crosses of driver and effector lines allows for rapid assessment of the cell type-specific impact of an effector with high temporal resolution. Thus, our comprehensive and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flexibl</span></strong>e method is suitable for overcoming the limitations of ubiquitous genetic approaches, the outputs of which often are difficult to interpret due to the widespread existence of compensatory mechanisms and the integration of diverging effects in different cell types.</p>

Multiplexed Gene Editing and Protein Overexpression Using a <i>Tobacco mosaic virus</i> Viral Vector
<p>Development of CRISPR/Cas9 transient gene editing screening tools in plant biology has been hindered by difficulty of delivering high quantities of biologically active single guide RNAs (sgRNAs). Furthermore, it has been largely accepted that in vivo generated sgRNAs need to be devoid of extraneous nucleotides, which has limited sgRNA expression by delivery vectors. Here, we increased cellular concentrations of sgRNA by transiently delivering sgRNAs using a <i>Tobacco mosaic virus</i>-derived vector (TRBO) designed with 5′ and 3′ sgRNA proximal nucleotide-processing capabilities. To demonstrate proof-of-principle, we used the TRBO-sgRNA delivery platform to target GFP in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> (16c) plants, and gene editing was accompanied by loss of GFP expression. Surprisingly, indel (insertions and deletions) percentages averaged nearly 70% within 7 d postinoculation using the TRBO-sgRNA constructs, which retained 5′ nucleotide overhangs. In contrast, and in accordance with current models, in vitro Cas9 cleavage assays only edited DNA when 5′ sgRNA nucleotide overhangs were removed, suggesting a novel processing mechanism is occurring in planta. Since the Cas9/TRBO-sgRNA platform demonstrated sgRNA flexibility, we targeted the <i>N. benthamiana NbAGO1</i> paralogs with one sgRNA and also multiplexed two sgRNAs using a single TRBO construct, resulting in indels in three genes. TRBO-mediated expression of an RNA transcript consisting of an sgRNA adjoining a GFP protein coding region produced indels and viral-based GFP overexpression. In conclusion, multiplexed delivery of sgRNAs using the TRBO system offers flexibility for gene expression and editing and uncovered novel aspects of CRISPR/Cas9 biology.</p>

Hydrocarbons Are Essential for Optimal Cell Size, Division, and Growth of Cyanobacteria
<p>Cyanobacteria are intricately organized, incorporating an array of internal thylakoid membranes, the site of photosynthesis, into cells no larger than other bacteria. They also synthesize C15-C19 alkanes and alkenes, which results in substantial production of hydrocarbons in the environment. All sequenced cyanobacteria encode hydrocarbon biosynthesis pathways, suggesting an important, undefined physiological role for these compounds. Here, we demonstrate that hydrocarbon-deficient mutants of <i>Synechococcus</i> sp. PCC 7002 and <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 exhibit significant phenotypic differences from wild type, including enlarged cell size, reduced growth, and increased division defects. Photosynthetic rates were similar between strains, although a minor reduction in energy transfer between the soluble light harvesting phycobilisome complex and membrane-bound photosystems was observed. Hydrocarbons were shown to accumulate in thylakoid and cytoplasmic membranes. Modeling of membranes suggests these compounds aggregate in the center of the lipid bilayer, potentially promoting membrane flexibility and facilitating curvature. In vivo measurements confirmed that <i>Synechococcus</i> sp. PCC 7002 mutants lacking hydrocarbons exhibit reduced thylakoid membrane curvature compared to wild type. We propose that hydrocarbons may have a role in inducing the flexibility in membranes required for optimal cell division, size, and growth, and efficient association of soluble and membrane bound proteins. The recent identification of C15-C17 alkanes and alkenes in microalgal species suggests hydrocarbons may serve a similar function in a broad range of photosynthetic organisms.</p>

Comparative Analysis of Light-Harvesting Antennae and State Transition in <i>chlorina</i> and cpSRP Mutants
<p>State transitions in photosynthesis provide for the dynamic allocation of a mobile fraction of light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) to photosystem II (PSII) in state I and to photosystem I (PSI) in state II. In the state I-to-state II transition, LHCII is phosphorylated by STN7 and associates with PSI to favor absorption cross-section of PSI. Here, we used Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants with defects in chlorophyll (Chl) b biosynthesis or in the chloroplast signal recognition particle (cpSRP) machinery to study the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flexibl</span></strong>e formation of PS-LHC supercomplexes. Intriguingly, we found that impaired Chl b biosynthesis in <i>chlorina1-2</i> (<i>ch1-2</i>) led to preferentially stabilized LHCI rather than LHCII, while the contents of both LHCI and LHCII were equally depressed in the cpSRP43-deficient mutant (<i>chaos</i>). In view of recent findings on the modified state transitions in LHCI-deficient mutants (Benson et al., 2015), the <i>ch1-2</i> and <i>chaos</i> mutants were used to assess the influence of varying LHCI/LHCII antenna size on state transitions. Under state II conditions, LHCII-PSI supercomplexes were not formed in both <i>ch1-2</i> and <i>chaos</i> plants. LHCII phosphorylation was drastically reduced in <i>ch1-2</i>, and the inactivation of STN7 correlates with the lack of state transitions. In contrast, phosphorylated LHCII in <i>chaos</i> was observed to be exclusively associated with PSII complexes, indicating a lack of mobile LHCII in <i>chaos</i>. Thus, the comparative analysis of <i>ch1-2</i> and <i>chaos</i> mutants provides new evidence for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flexibl</span></strong>e organization of LHCs and enhances our understanding of the reversible allocation of LHCII to the two photosystems.</p>

Engineering Artificial MicroRNAs for Multiplex Gene Silencing and Simplified Transgenic Screen
<p>Artificial microRNA (amiRNA) technology offers reversible and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flexibl</span></strong>e gene inactivation and complements genome-editing technologies. However, obtaining transgenic plants with maximal gene silencing remains a major technical challenge in current amiRNA applications. Here, we incorporated an empirically determined feature of effective amiRNAs to the amiRNA design and in silico generated a database containing 533,429 gene-specific amiRNAs for silencing 27,136 genes in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), with a genome coverage of 98.87%. In both single-gene and multiple-gene silencing, we observed an overall improvement in performance by amiRNAs designed using our strategy in Arabidopsis protoplasts and transgenic plants. In addition, the endogenous tRNA-processing system was used to generate multiple amiRNAs from tRNA-pre-amiRNA tandem repeats for multiplex gene silencing. An intronic amiRNA-producing fluorescent reporter was explored as a visual screening strategy for transgenic Arabidopsis and rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) plants with maximal whole-plant or cell type-specific gene silencing. These improvements enable the amiRNA technology to be a functional gene knockout tool for basic and applied plant research.</p>

Flavodiiron-Mediated O<sub>2</sub> Photoreduction Links H<sub>2</sub> Production with CO<sub>2</sub> Fixation during the Anaerobic Induction of Photosynthesis
<p>Some microalgae, such as <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, harbor a highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flexibl</span></strong>e photosynthetic apparatus capable of using different electron acceptors, including carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), protons, or oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>), allowing survival in diverse habitats. During anaerobic induction of photosynthesis, molecular O<sub>2</sub> is produced at photosystem II, while at the photosystem I acceptor side, the reduction of protons into hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) by the plastidial [FeFe]-hydrogenases primes CO<sub>2</sub> fixation. Although the interaction between H<sub>2</sub> production and CO<sub>2</sub> fixation has been studied extensively, their interplay with O<sub>2</sub> produced by photosynthesis has not been considered. By simultaneously measuring gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence, we identified an O<sub>2</sub> photoreduction mechanism that functions during anaerobic dark-to-light transitions and demonstrate that flavodiiron proteins (Flvs) are the major players involved in light-dependent O<sub>2</sub> uptake. We further show that Flv-mediated O<sub>2</sub> uptake is critical for the rapid induction of CO<sub>2</sub> fixation but is not involved in the creation of the micro-oxic niches proposed previously to protect the [FeFe]-hydrogenase from O<sub>2</sub>. By studying a mutant lacking both hydrogenases (HYDA1 and HYDA2) and both Flvs (FLVA and FLVB), we show that the induction of photosynthesis is strongly delayed in the absence of both sets of proteins. Based on these data, we propose that Flvs are involved in an important intracellular O<sub>2</sub> recycling process, which acts as a relay between H<sub>2</sub> production and CO<sub>2</sub> fixation.</p>

The Persistent Homology Mathematical Framework Provides Enhanced Genotype-to-Phenotype Associations for Plant Morphology
<p>Efforts to understand the genetic and environmental conditioning of plant morphology are hindered by the lack of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flexibl</span></strong>e and effective tools for quantifying morphology. Here, we demonstrate that persistent-homology-based topological methods can improve measurement of variation in leaf shape, serrations, and root architecture. We apply these methods to 2D images of leaves and root systems in field-grown plants of a domesticated introgression line population of tomato (<i>Solanum pennellii</i>). We find that compared with some commonly used conventional traits, (1) persistent-homology-based methods can more comprehensively capture morphological variation; (2) these techniques discriminate between genotypes with a larger normalized effect size and detect a greater number of unique quantitative trait loci (QTLs); (3) multivariate traits, whether statistically derived from univariate or persistent-homology-based traits, improve our ability to understand the genetic basis of phenotype; and (4) persistent-homology-based techniques detect unique QTLs compared to conventional traits or their multivariate derivatives, indicating that previously unmeasured aspects of morphology are now detectable. The QTL results further imply that genetic contributions to morphology can affect both the shoot and root, revealing a pleiotropic basis to natural variation in tomato. Persistent homology is a versatile framework to quantify plant morphology and developmental processes that complements and extends existing methods.</p>

A Specific Glycogen Mobilization Strategy Enables Rapid Awakening of Dormant Cyanobacteria from Chlorosis
<p>Many organisms survive stressful conditions via entry into a dormant state that can be rapidly exited when the stressor disappears; this ability provides a strong selective advantage. In the cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803, the exit from nitrogen chlorosis takes less than 48 h and is enabled by the impressive metabolic flexibility of these cyanobacteria, which pass through heterotrophic and mixotrophic phases before reentering photoautotrophic growth. Switching between these states requires delicate coordination of carbohydrate oxidation, CO<sub>2</sub> fixation, and photosynthesis. Here, we investigated the contribution of the different carbon catabolic routes by assessing mutants of these pathways during nitrogen chlorosis and resuscitation. The addition of nitrate to nitrogen-starved cells rapidly starts the awakening program. Metabolism switches from maintenance metabolism, characterized by residual photosynthesis and low cellular ATP levels, to an initial heterotrophic phase, characterized by respiration and an immediate increase in ATP levels. This respiration relies on glycogen breakdown catalyzed by the glycogen phosphorylase GlgP2. In the following transient mixotrophic phase, photosynthesis and CO<sub>2</sub> fixation restart and glycogen is consumed. During the mixotrophic phase, parallel operation of the oxidative pentose phosphate cycle and the Entner-Doudoroff pathway is required for resuscitation to proceed; the glycolytic route via the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway has minor importance. Our data suggest that, during resuscitation, only the Entner-Doudoroff and oxidative pentose phosphate pathways supply the metabolic intermediates necessary for the anabolic reactions required to reconstitute a vegetative cell. Intriguingly, the key enzymes for glycogen catabolism are already expressed during the preceding chlorotic phase, in apparent preparation for rapid resuscitation.</p>

Biochemical and Structural Analysis of Substrate Specificity of a Phenylalanine Ammonia-Lyase
<p>Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) is the first enzyme of the general phenylpropanoid pathway catalyzing the nonoxidative elimination of ammonia from <sc>l</sc>-phenylalanine to give <i>trans</i>-cinnamate. In monocots, PAL also displays tyrosine ammonia lyase (TAL) activity, leading to the formation of <i>p</i>-coumaric acid. The catalytic mechanism and substrate specificity of a major PAL from sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>; SbPAL1), a strategic plant for bioenergy production, were deduced from crystal structures, molecular docking, site-directed mutagenesis, and kinetic and thermodynamic analyses. This first crystal structure of a monocotyledonous PAL displayed a unique conformation in its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flexibl</span></strong>e inner loop of the 4-methylidene-imidazole-5-one (MIO) domain compared with that of dicotyledonous plants. The side chain of histidine-123 in the MIO domain dictated the distance between the catalytic MIO prosthetic group created from <sup>189</sup>Ala-Ser-Gly<sup>191</sup> residues and the bound <sc>l</sc>-phenylalanine and <sc>l</sc>-tyrosine, conferring the deamination reaction through either the Friedel-Crafts or E<sub>2</sub> reaction mechanism. Several recombinant mutant SbPAL1 enzymes were generated via structure-guided mutagenesis, one of which, H123F-SbPAL1, has 6.2 times greater PAL activity without significant TAL activity. Additional PAL isozymes of sorghum were characterized and categorized into three groups. Taken together, this approach identified critical residues and explained substrate preferences among PAL isozymes in sorghum and other monocots, which can serve as the basis for the engineering of plants with enhanced biomass conversion properties, disease resistance, or nutritional quality.</p>

Regular Motifs in Xylan Modulate Molecular Flexibility and Interactions with Cellulose Surfaces
<p>Xylan is tightly associated with cellulose and lignin in secondary plant cell walls, contributing to its rigidity and structural integrity in vascular plants. However, the molecular features and the nanoscale forces that control the interactions among cellulose microfibrils, hemicelluloses, and lignin are still not well understood. Here, we combine comprehensive mass spectrometric glycan sequencing and molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the substitution pattern in softwood xylans and to investigate the effect of distinct intramolecular motifs on xylan conformation and on the interaction with cellulose surfaces in Norway spruce (<i>Picea abies</i>). We confirm the presence of motifs with evenly spaced glycosyl decorations on the xylan backbone, together with minor motifs with consecutive glucuronation. These domains are differently enriched in xylan fractions extracted by alkali and subcritical water, which indicates their preferential positioning in the secondary plant cell wall ultrastructure. The flexibility of the 3-fold screw conformation of xylan in solution is enhanced by the presence of arabinofuranosyl decorations. Additionally, molecular dynamic simulations suggest that the glycosyl substitutions in xylan are not only sterically tolerated by the cellulose surfaces but that they increase the affinity for cellulose and favor the stabilization of the 2-fold screw conformation. This effect is more significant for the hydrophobic surface compared with the hydrophilic ones, which demonstrates the importance of nonpolar driving forces on the structural integrity of secondary plant cell walls. These novel molecular insights contribute to an improved understanding of the supramolecular architecture of plant secondary cell walls and have fundamental implications for overcoming lignocellulose recalcitrance and for the design of advanced wood-based materials.</p>

Sequence Exchange between Homologous NB-LRR Genes Converts Virus Resistance into Nematode Resistance, and Vice Versa
<p>Plants have evolved a limited repertoire of NB-LRR disease resistance (<i>R</i>) genes to protect themselves against myriad pathogens. This limitation is thought to be counterbalanced by the rapid evolution of NB-LRR proteins, as only a few sequence changes have been shown to be sufficient to alter resistance specificities toward novel strains of a pathogen. However, little is known about the flexibility of NB-LRR <i>R</i> genes to switch resistance specificities between phylogenetically unrelated pathogens. To investigate this, we created domain swaps between the close homologs <i>Gpa2</i> and <i>Rx1</i>, which confer resistance in potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>) to the cyst nematode <i>Globodera pallida</i> and <i>Potato virus X</i>, respectively. The genetic fusion of the CC-NB-ARC of Gpa2 with the LRR of Rx1 (Gpa2<sub>CN</sub>/Rx1<sub>L</sub>) results in autoactivity, but lowering the protein levels restored its specific activation response, including extreme resistance to <i>Potato virus X</i> in potato shoots. The reciprocal chimera (Rx1<sub>CN</sub>/Gpa2<sub>L</sub>) shows a loss-of-function phenotype, but exchange of the first three LRRs of Gpa2 by the corresponding region of Rx1 was sufficient to regain a wild-type resistance response to <i>G. pallida</i> in the roots. These data demonstrate that exchanging the recognition moiety in the LRR is sufficient to convert extreme virus resistance in the leaves into mild nematode resistance in the roots, and vice versa. In addition, we show that the CC-NB-ARC can operate independently of the recognition specificities defined by the LRR domain, either aboveground or belowground. These data show the versatility of NB-LRR genes to generate resistance to unrelated pathogens with completely different lifestyles and routes of invasion.</p>

In Vitro Characterization of Thermostable CAM Rubisco Activase Reveals a Rubisco Interacting Surface Loop
<p>To maintain metabolic flux through the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle in higher plants, dead-end inhibited complexes of Rubisco must constantly be engaged and remodeled by the molecular chaperone Rubisco activase (Rca). In C3 plants, the thermolability of Rca is responsible for the deactivation of Rubisco and reduction of photosynthesis at moderately elevated temperatures. We reasoned that crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) plants must possess thermostable Rca to support Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle flux during the day when stomata are closed. A comparative biochemical characterization of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) and <i>Agave tequilana</i> Rca isoforms demonstrated that the CAM Rca isoforms are approximately10°C more thermostable than the C3 isoforms. Agave Rca also possessed a much higher in vitro biochemical activity, even at low assay temperatures. Mixtures of rice and agave Rca form functional hetero-oligomers in vitro, but only the rice isoforms denature at nonpermissive temperatures. The high thermostability and activity of agave Rca mapped to the N-terminal 244 residues. A Glu-217-Gln amino acid substitution was found to confer high Rca activity to rice Rca. Further mutational analysis suggested that Glu-217 restricts the flexibility of the α4-β4 surface loop that interacts with Rubisco via Lys-216. CAM plants thus promise to be a source of highly functional, thermostable Rca candidates for thermal fortification of crop photosynthesis. Careful characterization of their properties will likely reveal further protein-protein interaction motifs to enrich our mechanistic model of Rca function.</p>

PECTIN METHYLESTERASE34 Contributes to Heat Tolerance through Its Role in Promoting Stomatal Movement
<p>Pectin, a major component of the primary cell wall, is synthesized in the Golgi apparatus and exported to the cell wall in a highly methylesterified form, then is partially demethylesterified by pectin methylesterases (PMEs; EC 3.1.1.11). PME activity on the status of pectin methylesterification profoundly affects the properties of pectin and, thereby, is critical for plant development and the plant defense response, although the roles of PMEs under heat stress (HS) are poorly understood. Functional genome annotation predicts that at least 66 potential <i>PME</i> genes are contained in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Thermotolerance assays of <i>PME</i> gene T-DNA insertion lines revealed two null mutant alleles of <i>PME34</i> (At3g49220) that both consistently showed reduced thermotolerance. Nevertheless, their impairment was independently associated with the expression of HS-responsive genes. It was also observed that <i>PME34</i> transcription was induced by abscisic acid and highly expressed in guard cells. We showed that the <i>PME34</i> mutation has a defect in the control of stomatal movement and greatly altered PME and polygalacturonase (EC 3.2.1.15) activity, resulting in a heat-sensitive phenotype. <i>PME34</i> has a role in the regulation of transpiration through the control of the stomatal aperture due to its cell wall-modifying enzyme activity during the HS response. Hence, PME34 is required for regulating guard cell wall flexibility to mediate the heat response in Arabidopsis.</p>

Formation of the Stomatal Outer Cuticular Ledge Requires a Guard Cell Wall Proline-Rich Protein<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[CC-BY]</sup></xref>
<p>Stomata are formed by a pair of guard cells which have thickened, elastic cell walls to withstand the large increases in turgor pressure that have to be generated to open the pore that they surround. We have characterized FOCL1, a guard cell-expressed, secreted protein with homology to Hyp-rich cell wall proteins. FOCL1-GFP localizes to the guard cell outer cuticular ledge and plants lacking FOCL1 produce stomata without a cuticular ledge. Instead the majority of stomatal pores are entirely covered over by a continuous fusion of the cuticle, and consequently plants have decreased levels of transpiration and display drought tolerance. The <i>focl1</i> guard cells are larger and less able to reduce the aperture of their stomatal pore in response to closure signals suggesting that the flexibility of guard cell walls is impaired. <i>FOCL1</i> is also expressed in lateral root initials where it aids lateral root emergence. We propose that FOCL1 acts in these highly specialized cells of the stomata and root to impart cell wall strength at high turgor and/or to facilitate interactions between the cell wall and the cuticle.</p>

Natural Variation of Molecular and Morphological Gibberellin Responses
<p>Although phytohormones such as gibberellins are essential for many conserved aspects of plant physiology and development, plants vary greatly in their responses to these regulatory compounds. Here, we use genetic perturbation of endogenous gibberellin levels to probe the extent of intraspecific variation in gibberellin responses in natural accessions of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We find that these accessions vary greatly in their ability to buffer the effects of overexpression of <i>GA20ox1</i>, encoding a rate-limiting enzyme for gibberellin biosynthesis, with substantial differences in bioactive gibberellin concentrations as well as transcriptomes and growth trajectories. These findings demonstrate a surprising level of flexibility in the wiring of regulatory networks underlying hormone metabolism and signaling.</p>

SLiM 2: Flexible, Interactive Forward Genetic Simulations
<p>Modern population genomic datasets hold immense promise for revealing the evolutionary processes operating in natural populations, but a crucial prerequisite for this goal is the ability to model realistic evolutionary scenarios and predict their expected patterns in genomic data. To that end, we present SLiM 2: an evolutionary simulation framework that combines a powerful, fast engine for forward population genetic simulations with the capability of modeling a wide variety of complex evolutionary scenarios. SLiM achieves this flexibility through scriptability, which provides control over most aspects of the simulated evolutionary scenarios with a simple R-like scripting language called Eidos. An example SLiM simulation is presented to illustrate the power of this approach. SLiM 2 also includes a graphical user interface for simulation construction, interactive runtime control, and dynamic visualization of simulation output, facilitating easy and fast model development with quick prototyping and visual debugging. We conclude with a performance comparison between SLiM and two other popular forward genetic simulation packages.</p>

Building Phylogenetic Trees from Molecular Data with MEGA
<p>Phylogenetic analysis is sometimes regarded as being an intimidating, complex process that requires expertise and years of experience. In fact, it is a fairly straightforward process that can be learned quickly and applied effectively. This Protocol describes the several steps required to produce a phylogenetic tree from molecular data for novices. In the example illustrated here, the program MEGA is used to implement all those steps, thereby eliminating the need to learn several programs, and to deal with multiple file formats from one step to another (Tamura K, Peterson D, Peterson N, Stecher G, Nei M, Kumar S. 2011. MEGA5: molecular evolutionary genetics analysis using maximum likelihood, evolutionary distance, and maximum parsimony methods. <i>Mol Biol Evol</i>. 28:2731–2739). The first step, identification of a set of homologous sequences and downloading those sequences, is implemented by MEGA's own browser built on top of the Google Chrome toolkit. For the second step, alignment of those sequences, MEGA offers two different algorithms: ClustalW and MUSCLE. For the third step, construction of a phylogenetic tree from the aligned sequences, MEGA offers many different methods. Here we illustrate the maximum likelihood method, beginning with MEGA's Models feature, which permits selecting the most suitable substitution model. Finally, MEGA provides a powerful and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flexibl</span></strong>e interface for the final step, actually drawing the tree for publication. Here a step-by-step protocol is presented in sufficient detail to allow a novice to start with a sequence of interest and to build a publication-quality tree illustrating the evolution of an appropriate set of homologs of that sequence. MEGA is available for use on PCs and Macs from <ext-link>www.megasoftware.net</ext-link>.</p>

Simultaneous high-resolution pH and spectrophotometric recordings of oxygen binding in blood microvolumes
<p>Oxygen equilibrium curves have been widely used to understand oxygen transport in numerous organisms. A major challenge has been to monitor oxygen binding characteristics and concomitant pH changes as they occur <i>in vivo</i>, in limited sample volumes. Here we report a technique allowing highly resolved and simultaneous monitoring of pH and blood pigment saturation in minute blood volumes. We equipped a gas diffusion chamber with a broad-range fibre-optic spectrophotometer and a micro-pH optode and recorded changes of pigment oxygenation along oxygen partial pressure (<i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>) and pH gradients to test the setup. Oxygen binding parameters derived from measurements in only 15 μl of haemolymph from the cephalopod <i>Octopus vulgaris</i> showed low instrumental error (0.93%) and good agreement with published data. Broad-range spectra, each resolving 2048 data points, provided detailed insight into the complex absorbance characteristics of diverse blood types. After consideration of photobleaching and intrinsic fluorescence, pH optodes yielded accurate recordings and resolved a sigmoidal shift of 0.03 pH units in response to changing <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> from 0 to 21 kPa. Highly resolved continuous recordings along pH gradients conformed to stepwise measurements at low rates of pH changes. In this study we showed that a diffusion chamber upgraded with a broad-range spectrophotometer and an optical pH sensor accurately characterizes oxygen binding with minimal sample consumption and manipulation. We conclude that the modified diffusion chamber is highly suitable for experimental biologists who demand high flexibility, detailed insight into oxygen binding as well as experimental and biological accuracy combined in a single setup.</p>

Aging and its modulation in a long-lived worker caste of the honey bee
<p>Highly social animals provide alternative aging models in which vastly different lifespan patterns are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flexibl</span></strong>e, and linked to social caste. Research in these species aims to reveal how environment, including social cues, can shape the transition between short-lived and extremely long-lived phenotypes with negligible senescence. Among honey bee workers, short to intermediate lifespans are typical for summer castes, while the winter caste can live up to 10 times longer. For summer castes, experimental interventions could predictably accelerate, slow or revert functional senescence. In contrast, little is known about the partic ular conditions under which periods of negligible senescence in winter castes can be disrupted or sustained. We asked how manipulation of social environment in colonies with long-lived winter bees might alter the pace of functional senescence, measured as learning performance, as well as of cellular senescence, measured as lipofuscin accumulation. We show that behavioral senescence becomes rapidly detectable when the winter state is disrupted, and changes in social task behaviors and social environment (brood) are induced. Likewise, we found that cellular senescence was induced by such social intervention. However, cellular senescence showed marked regional differences, suggesting that particular brain regions age slower than others. Finally, by preventing post-winter colonies from brood rearing, behavioral senescence became undetectable, even after transition to the usually short-lived phenotypes had occurred. We envision that social regulation of negligible functional senescence and highly dynamic accumulation of a universal symptom of cellular aging (lipofuscin) offers rewarding perspectives to target proximate mechanisms of slowed aging.</p>

Dislocation of a primary total hip arthroplasty is more common in patients with a lumbar spinal fusion
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Lumbar fusion is known to reduce the variation in pelvic tilt   between standing and sitting. A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flexibl</span></strong>e lumbo-pelvic unit increases   the stability of total hip arthroplasty (THA) when seated by increasing   anterior clearance and acetabular anteversion, thereby preventing   impingement of the prosthesis. Lumbar fusion may eliminate this protective   pelvic movement. The effect of lumbar fusion on the stability of   total hip arthroplasty has not previously been investigated.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The Medicare database was searched for patients who had undergone   THA and spinal fusion between 2005 and 2012.

The   rate of dislocation in each group was established using ICD-9-CM codes.   Patients who underwent THA without spinal fusion were used as a   control group.

Role of insulin signaling impairment, adiponectin and dyslipidemia in peripheral and central neuropathy in mice
<p>One of the tissues or organs affected by diabetes is the nervous system, predominantly the peripheral system (peripheral polyneuropathy and/or painful peripheral neuropathy) but also the central system with impaired learning, memory and mental flexibility. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the pre-diabetic or diabetic condition caused by a high-fat diet (HFD) can damage both the peripheral and central nervous systems. Groups of C57BL6 and Swiss Webster mice were fed a diet containing 60% fat for 8 months and compared to control and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic groups that were fed a standard diet containing 10% fat. Aspects of peripheral nerve function (conduction velocity, thermal sensitivity) and central nervous system function (learning ability, memory) were measured at assorted times during the study. Both strains of mice on HFD developed impaired glucose tolerance, indicative of insulin resistance, but only the C57BL6 mice showed statistically significant hyperglycemia. STZ-diabetic C57BL6 mice developed learning deficits in the Barnes maze after 8 weeks of diabetes, whereas neither C57BL6 nor Swiss Webster mice fed a HFD showed signs of defects at that time point. By 6 months on HFD, Swiss Webster mice developed learning and memory deficits in the Barnes maze test, whereas their peripheral nervous system remained normal. In contrast, C57BL6 mice fed the HFD developed peripheral nerve dysfunction, as indicated by nerve conduction slowing and thermal hyperalgesia, but showed normal learning and memory functions. Our data indicate that STZ-induced diabetes or a HFD can damage both peripheral and central nervous systems, but learning deficits develop more rapidly in insulin-deficient than in insulin-resistant conditions and only in Swiss Webster mice. In addition to insulin impairment, dyslipidemia or adiponectinemia might determine the neuropathy phenotype.</p>

Mid-term results of the BIOLOX delta ceramic-on-ceramic total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We conducted a prospective study of a delta <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ic total hip   arthroplasty (THA) to determine the rate of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ic fracture, to   characterise post-operative noise, and to evaluate the mid-term   results and survivorship.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between March 2009 and March 2011, 274 patients (310 hips) underwent   cementless THA using a delta <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ic femoral head and liner. At   each follow-up, clinical and radiological outcomes were recorded.   A Kaplan-Meier analysis was undertaken to estimate survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Four patients (four hips) died and 18 patients (20 hips) were   lost to follow-up within five years. The remaining 252 patients   (286 hips) were followed for a mean of 66.5 months (60 to 84). There   were 144 men (166 hips) and 108 women (120 hips) with a mean age   of 49.7 years (16 to 83) at surgery. The mean pre-operative Harris   Hip Score of 47.1 points improved to 93.8 points at final follow-up.   Six patients reported squeaking in seven hips; however, none were   audible. Radiolucent lines involving Gruen zones one and/or seven   were seen in 52 hips (18.2%). No hip had detectable wear, focal   osteolysis or signs of loosening. One hip was revised because of   fracture of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ic liner, which occurred due to an undetected   malseating of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ic liner at the time of surgery. One hip   was revised for a periprosthetic fracture of the femur, and one   hip was treated for periprosthetic joint infection.

A molecular perovskite solid solution with piezoelectricity stronger than lead zirconate titanate
<p>Piezoelectric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als produce electricity when strained, making them ideal for different types of sensing applications. The most effective piezoelectric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ic solid solutions in which the piezoelectric effect is optimized at what are termed morphotropic phase boundaries (MPBs). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ics are not ideal for a variety of applications owing to some of their mechanical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es. We synthesized piezoelectric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als from a molecular perovskite (TMFM)<i><sub>x</sub></i>(TMCM)<sub>1–</sub><i><sub>x</sub></i>CdCl<sub>3</sub> solid solution (TMFM, trimethylfluoromethyl ammonium; TMCM, trimethylchloromethyl ammonium, 0 ≤ <i>x</i> ≤ 1), in which the MPB exists between monoclinic and hexagonal phases. We found a composition for which the piezoelectric coefficient <i>d</i><sub>33</sub> is ~1540 picocoulombs per newton, comparable to high-performance piezoelectric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ics. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al has potential applications for wearable piezoelectric devices.</p>

Plastic waste associated with disease on coral reefs
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong> waste can promote microbial colonization by pathogens implicated in outbreaks of disease in the ocean. We assessed the influence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong> waste on disease risk in 124,000 reef-building corals from 159 reefs in the Asia-Pacific region. The likelihood of disease increases from 4% to 89% when corals are in contact with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>. Structurally complex corals are eight times more likely to be affected by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>, suggesting that microhabitats for reef-associated organisms and valuable fisheries will be disproportionately affected. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong> levels on coral reefs correspond to estimates of terrestrial mismanaged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong> waste entering the ocean. We estimate that 11.1 billion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong> items are entangled on coral reefs across the Asia-Pacific and project this number to increase 40% by 2025. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong> waste management is critical for reducing diseases that threaten ecosystem health and human livelihoods.</p>

Disparities in science literacy
<p>Much is known about how adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e literacy varies internationally and over time, and about its association with attitudes and beliefs. However, less is known about disparities in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e literacy across racial and ethnic groups (<i>1</i>). This is particularly surprising in light of substantial research on racial and ethnic disparities in related areas such as educational achievement, math and reading ability (<i>2</i>), representation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) occupations (<i>3</i>), and health literacy (<i>4</i>). Given the importance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e literacy to securing and sustaining many jobs, to understanding key health concepts to enhance quality of life, and to increasing public engagement in societal decision-making (<i>5</i>), it is concerning if the distribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e literacy is unequally stratified, particularly if this stratification reflects broader patterns of disadvantage and cultural dominance as experienced by minorities and educationally underserved populations. We describe here such disparities in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e literacy in the United States and attempt to explain underlying drivers, concluding that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e literacy disadvantage among black and Hispanic adults relative to whites is only partially explained by measures of broader, foundational literacies and socioeconomic status (SES).</p>

Spin coating epitaxial films
<p>Spin-coated films, such as photoresists for lithography or perovskite films for solar cells, are either amorphous or polycrystalline. We show that epitaxial films of inorganic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als such as cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr<sub>3</sub>), lead(II) iodide (PbI<sub>2</sub>), zinc oxide (ZnO), and sodium chloride (NaCl) can be deposited onto a variety of single-crystal and single-crystal–like substrates by simply spin coating either solutions of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al or precursors to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al. The out-of-plane and in-plane orientations of the spin-coated films are determined by the substrate. The thin stagnant layer of supersaturated solution produced during spin coating promotes heterogeneous nucleation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al onto the single-crystal substrate over homogeneous nucleation in the bulk solution, and ordered anion adlayers may lower the activation energy for nucleation on the surface. The method can be used to produce functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als such as inorganic semiconductors or to deposit water-soluble <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als such as NaCl that can serve as growth templates.</p>

Magnetic resonance spectroscopy of an atomically thin material using a single-spin qubit
<p>Two-dimensional (2D) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als offer a promising platform for exploring condensed matter phenomena and developing technological applications. However, the reduction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al dimensions to the atomic scale poses a challenge for traditional measurement and interfacing techniques that typically couple to macroscopic observables. We demonstrate a method for probing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es of 2D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als via nanometer-scale nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) spectroscopy using individual atomlike impurities in diamond. Coherent manipulation of shallow nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers enables the probing of nanoscale ensembles down to approximately 30 nuclear spins in atomically thin hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). The characterization of low-dimensional nanoscale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als could enable the development of new quantum hybrid systems, combining atomlike systems coherently coupled with individual atoms in 2D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als.</p>

Direct optical lithography of functional inorganic nanomaterials
<p>Photolithography is an important manufacturing process that relies on using photoresists, typically polymer formulations, that change solubility when illuminated with ultraviolet light. Here, we introduce a general chemical approach for photoresist-free, direct optical lithography of functional inorganic nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als. The patterned <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als can be metals, semiconductors, oxides, magnetic, or rare earth compositions. No organic impurities are present in the patterned layers, which helps achieve good electronic and optical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es. The conductivity, carrier mobility, dielectric, and luminescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es of optically patterned layers are on par with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es of state-of-the-art solution-processed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als. The ability to directly pattern all-inorganic layers by using a light exposure dose comparable with that of organic photoresists provides an alternate route for thin-film device manufacturing.</p>

Does tantalum exhibit any intrinsic antimicrobial or antibiofilm properties?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Tantalum (Ta) trabecular metal components are increasingly used   to reconstruct major bone defects in revision arthroplasty surgery.   It is known that some metals such as silver have antibacterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es.   Recent reports have raised the question regarding whether Ta components   are protective against infection in revision surgery.

Ceramic-on-ceramic bearing fractures in total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ic-on-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ic (CoC) bearings in total hip arthroplasty (THA)   are commonly used, but concerns exist regarding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ic fracture.   This study aims to report the risk of revision for fracture of modern   CoC bearings and identify factors that might influence this risk,   using data from the National Joint Registry (NJR) for England, Wales, Northern   Ireland and the Isle of Man.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We analysed data on 223 362 bearings from 111 681 primary CoC   THAs and 182 linked revisions for bearing fracture recorded in the   NJR. We used implant codes to identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ic bearing composition   and generated Kaplan-Meier estimates for implant survivorship. Logistic   regression analyses were performed for implant size and patient specific   variables to determine any associated risks for revision.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 222 852 bearings (99.8%) were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>Tec Biolox products.

Mechanoresponsive self-growing hydrogels inspired by muscle training
<p>Living tissues, such as muscle, autonomously grow and remodel themselves to adapt to their surrounding mechanical environment through metabolic processes. By contrast, typical synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als cannot grow and reconstruct their structures once formed. We propose a strategy for developing “self-growing” polymeric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als that respond to repetitive mechanical stress through an effective mechanochemical transduction. Robust double-network hydrogels provided with a sustained monomer supply undergo self-growth, and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als are substantially strengthened under repetitive loading through a structural destruction-reconstruction process. This strategy also endows the hydrogels with tailored functions at desired positions by mechanical stamping. This work may pave the way for the development of self-growing gel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als for applications such as soft robots and intelligent devices.</p>

Multicomponent intermetallic nanoparticles and superb mechanical behaviors of complex alloys
<p>Alloy design based on single–principal-element systems has approached its limit for performance enhancements. A substantial increase in strength up to gigapascal levels typically causes the premature failure of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als with reduced ductility. Here, we report a strategy to break this trade-off by controllably introducing high-density ductile multicomponent intermetallic nanoparticles (MCINPs) in complex alloy systems. Distinct from the intermetallic-induced embrittlement under conventional wisdom, such MCINP-strengthened alloys exhibit superior strengths of 1.5 gigapascals and ductility as high as 50% in tension at ambient temperature. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong> instability, a major concern for high-strength <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als, can be completely eliminated by generating a distinctive multistage work-hardening behavior, resulting from pronounced dislocation activities and deformation-induced microbands. This MCINP strategy offers a paradigm to develop next-generation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als for structural applications.</p>

Controlled crack propagation for atomic precision handling of wafer-scale two-dimensional materials
<p>Although flakes of two-dimensional (2D) heterostructures at the micrometer scale can be formed with adhesive-tape exfoliation methods, isolation of 2D flakes into monolayers is extremely time consuming because it is a trial-and-error process. Controlling the number of 2D layers through direct growth also presents difficulty because of the high nucleation barrier on 2D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als. We demonstrate a layer-resolved 2D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al splitting technique that permits high-throughput production of multiple monolayers of wafer-scale (5-centimeter diameter) 2D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als by splitting single stacks of thick 2D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als grown on a single wafer.

Twistable electronics with dynamically rotatable heterostructures
<p>In heterostructures of two-dimensional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als, electronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es can vary dramatically with relative interlayer angle. This effect makes it theoretically possible to realize a new class of twistable electronics in which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es can be manipulated on demand by means of rotation. We demonstrate a device architecture in which a layered heterostructure can be dynamically twisted in situ. We study graphene encapsulated by boron nitride, where, at small rotation angles, the device characteristics are dominated by coupling to a long-wavelength moirééé superlattice. The ability to investigate arbitrary rotation angle in a single device reveals features of the optical, mechanical, and electronic response in this system not captured in static rotation studies.

Locally coordinated synaptic plasticity of visual cortex neurons in vivo

We found that spike timing–induced receptive field <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity of visual cortex neurons in mice is anchored by increases in the synaptic strength of identified spines. This is accompanied by a decrease in the strength of adjacent spines on a slower time scale. The locally coordinated potentiation and depression of spines involves prominent AMPA receptor redistribution via targeted expression of the immediate early gene product Arc. Hebbian strengthening of activated synapses and heterosynaptic weakening of adjacent synapses thus cooperatively orchestrate cell-wide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity of functional neuronal responses.</p>

3D charge and 2D phonon transports leading to high out-of-plane <i>ZT</i> in n-type SnSe crystals
<p>Thermoelectric technology enables the harvest of waste heat and its direct conversion into electricity. The conversion efficiency is determined by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als figure of merit <i>ZT</i>. Here we show a maximum <i>ZT</i> of ~2.8 ± 0.5 at 773 kelvin in n-type tin selenide (SnSe) crystals out of plane. The thermal conductivity in layered SnSe crystals is the lowest in the out-of-plane direction [two-dimensional (2D) phonon transport]. We doped SnSe with bromine to make n-type SnSe crystals with the overlapping interlayer charge density (3D charge transport). A continuous phase transition increases the symmetry and diverges two converged conduction bands. These two factors improve carrier mobility, while preserving a large Seebeck coefficient. Our findings can be applied in 2D layered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als and provide a new strategy to enhance out-of-plane electrical transport <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es without degrading thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es.</p>

The application of a current density of merely 1 ampere per centimeter squared induces diamagnetism stronger than that in other nonsuperconducting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als.

Biological fabrication of cellulose fibers with tailored properties
<p>Cotton is a promising basis for wearable smart textiles. Current approaches that rely on fiber coatings suffer from function loss during wear. We present an approach that allows biological incorporation of exogenous molecules into cotton fibers to tailor the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al’s functionality. In vitro model cultures of upland cotton (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>) are incubated with 6-carboxyfluorescein–glucose and dysprosium–1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid–glucose, where the glucose moiety acts as a carrier capable of traveling from the vascular connection to the outermost cell layer of the ovule epidermis, becoming incorporated into the cellulose fibers. This yields fibers with unnatural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es such as fluorescence or magnetism. Combining biological systems with the appropriate molecular design offers numerous possibilities to grow functional composite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als and implements a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al-farming concept.</p>

Restoring auditory cortex plasticity in adult mice by restricting thalamic adenosine signaling
<p>Circuits in the auditory cortex are highly susceptible to acoustic influences during an early postnatal critical period. The auditory cortex selectively expands neural representations of enriched acoustic stimuli, a process important for human language acquisition. Adults lack this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity. Here we show in the murine auditory cortex that juvenile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity can be reestablished in adulthood if acoustic stimuli are paired with disruption of ecto-5′-nucleotidase–dependent adenosine production or A<sub>1</sub>–adenosine receptor signaling in the auditory thalamus. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity occurs at the level of cortical maps and individual neurons in the auditory cortex of awake adult mice and is associated with long-term improvement of tone-discrimination abilities. We conclude that, in adult mice, disrupting adenosine signaling in the thalamus rejuvenates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity in the auditory cortex and improves auditory perception.</p>

Bragg coherent diffractive imaging of single-grain defect dynamics in polycrystalline films

Here we report a technique capable of revealing grain heterogeneity, including strain fields and individual dislocations, that can be used under operando conditions in reactive environments: grain Bragg coherent diffractive imaging (gBCDI). Using a polycrystalline gold thin film subjected to heating, we show how gBCDI resolves grain boundary and dislocation dynamics in individual grains in three-dimensional detail with 10-nanometer spatial and subangstrom displacement field resolution.

<i>Rb1</i> and <i>Trp53</i> cooperate to suppress prostate cancer lineage plasticity, metastasis, and antiandrogen resistance

The mechanisms underlying prostate cancer lineage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity are incompletely understood.

Genetic Control of Plasticity in Root Morphology and Anatomy of Rice in Response to Water Deficit
<p>Elucidating the genetic control of rooting behavior under water-deficit stress is essential to breed climate-robust rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) cultivars. Using a diverse panel of 274 <i>indica</i> genotypes grown under control and water-deficit conditions during vegetative growth, we phenotyped 35 traits, mostly related to root morphology and anatomy, involving 45,000 root-scanning images and nearly 25,000 cross sections from the root-shoot junction. The phenotypic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity of these traits was quantified as the relative change in trait value under water-deficit compared with control conditions. We then carried out a genome-wide association analysis on these traits and their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity, using 45,608 high-quality single-nucleotide polymorphisms. One hundred four significant loci were detected for these traits under control conditions, 106 were detected under water-deficit stress, and 76 were detected for trait <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity. We predicted 296 (control), 284 (water-deficit stress), and 233 (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity) a priori candidate genes within linkage disequilibrium blocks for these loci. We identified key a priori candidate genes regulating root growth and development and relevant alleles that, upon validation, can help improve rice adaptation to water-deficit stress.</p>

Mechanically robust, readily repairable polymers via tailored noncovalent cross-linking
<p>Expanding the range of healable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als is an important challenge for sustainable societies. Noncrystalline, high-molecular-weight polymers generally form mechanically robust <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als, which, however, are difficult to repair once they are fractured. This is because their polymer chains are heavily entangled and diffuse too sluggishly to unite fractured surfaces within reasonable time scales. Here we report that low-molecular-weight polymers, when cross-linked by dense hydrogen bonds, yield mechanically robust yet readily repairable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als, despite their extremely slow diffusion dynamics. A key was to use thiourea, which anomalously forms a zigzag hydrogen-bonded array that does not induce unfavorable crystallization. Another key was to incorporate a structural element for activating the exchange of hydrogen-bonded pairs, which enables the fractured portions to rejoin readily upon compression.</p>

Imaging resonant dissipation from individual atomic defects in graphene

The inferred electron-phonon “cooling power spectrum” exhibits sharp peaks when the Fermi level comes into resonance with electronic quasi-bound states at such defects. Rare in the bulk but abundant at graphene’s edges, switchable atomic-scale phonon emitters provide the dominant dissipation mechanism.

Selective increase in CO<sub>2</sub> electroreduction activity at grain-boundary surface terminations
<p>Altering a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al’s catalytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es requires identifying structural features that give rise to active surfaces. Grain boundaries create strained regions in polycrystalline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als by stabilizing dislocations and may provide a way to create high-energy surfaces for catalysis that are kinetically trapped. Although grain-boundary density has previously been correlated with catalytic activity for some reactions, direct evidence that grain boundaries create surfaces with enhanced activity is lacking. We used a combination of bulk electrochemical measurements and scanning electrochemical cell microscopy with submicrometer resolution to show that grain-boundary surface terminations in gold electrodes are more active than grain surfaces for electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) reduction to carbon monoxide (CO) but not for the competing hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) evolution reaction. The catalytic footprint of the grain boundary is commensurate with its dislocation-induced strain field, providing a strategy for broader exploitation of grain-boundary effects in heterogeneous catalysis.</p>

This deformed and partitioned (D and P) process produced dislocation hardening but retained high ductility, both through the glide of intensive mobile dislocations and by allowing us to control martensitic transformation.

Grain boundary stability governs hardening and softening in extremely fine nanograined metals
<p>Conventional metals become harder with decreasing grain sizes, following the classical Hall-Petch relationship.

In this study, we discovered that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong> deformation mechanism of extremely fine nanograined metals and their hardness are adjustable through tailoring grain boundary (GB) stability. The electrodeposited nanograined nickel-molybdenum (Ni–Mo) samples become softened for grain sizes below 10 nanometers because of GB-mediated processes. With GB stabilization through relaxation and Mo segregation, ultrahigh hardness is achieved in the nanograined samples with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong> deformation mechanism dominated by generation of extended partial dislocations. Grain boundary stability provides an alternative dimension, in addition to grain size, for producing novel nanograined metals with extraordinary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es.</p>

<p>Some cancers evade targeted therapies through a mechanism known as lineage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity, whereby tumor cells acquire phenotypic characteristics of a cell lineage whose survival no longer depends on the drug target. We use in vitro and in vivo human prostate cancer models to show that these tumors can develop resistance to the antiandrogen drug enzalutamide by a phenotypic shift from androgen receptor (AR)–dependent luminal epithelial cells to AR-independent basal-like cells. This lineage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity is enabled by the loss of TP53 and RB1 function, is mediated by increased expression of the reprogramming transcription factor <i>SOX2</i>, and can be reversed by restoring TP53 and RB1 function or by inhibiting <i>SOX2</i> expression. Thus, mutations in tumor suppressor genes can create a state of increased cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity that, when challenged with antiandrogen therapy, promotes resistance through lineage switching.</p>

Perovskite-perovskite tandem photovoltaics with optimized band gaps
<p>We demonstrate four- and two-terminal perovskite-perovskite tandem solar cells with ideally matched band gaps. We develop an infrared-absorbing 1.2–electron volt band-gap perovskite, FA<sub>0.75</sub>Cs<sub>0.25</sub>Sn<sub>0.5</sub>Pb<sub>0.5</sub>I<sub>3</sub>, that can deliver 14.8% efficiency. By combining this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al with a wider–band gap FA<sub>0.83</sub>Cs<sub>0.17</sub>Pb(I<sub>0.5</sub>Br<sub>0.5</sub>)<sub>3</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al, we achieve monolithic two-terminal tandem efficiencies of 17.0% with >1.65-volt open-circuit voltage. We also make mechanically stacked four-terminal tandem cells and obtain 20.3% efficiency. Notably, we find  that our infrared-absorbing perovskite cells exhibit excellent thermal and atmospheric stability, not previously achieved for Sn-based perovskites. This device architecture and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als set will enable “all-perovskite” thin-film solar cells to reach the highest efficiencies in the long term at the lowest costs.</p>

Incorporation of rubidium cations into perovskite solar cells improves photovoltaic performance
<p>All of the cations currently used in perovskite solar cells abide by the tolerance factor for incorporation into the lattice. We show that the small and oxidation-stable rubidium cation (Rb<sup>+</sup>) can be embedded into a “cation cascade” to create perovskite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als with excellent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es. We achieved stabilized efficiencies of up to 21.6% (average value, 20.2%) on small areas (and a stabilized 19.0% on a cell 0.5 square centimeters in area) as well as an electroluminescence of 3.8%. The open-circuit voltage of 1.24 volts at a band gap of 1.63 electron volts leads to a loss in potential of 0.39 volts, versus 0.4 volts for commercial silicon cells. Polymer-coated cells maintained 95% of their initial performance at 85°C for 500 hours under full illumination and maximum power point tracking.</p>

High-quality graphene via microwave reduction of solution-exfoliated graphene oxide
<p>Efficient exfoliation of graphite in solutions to obtain high-quality graphene flakes is desirable for printable electronics, catalysis, energy storage, and composites. Graphite oxide with large lateral dimensions has an exfoliation yield of ~100%, but it has not been possible to completely remove the oxygen functional groups so that the reduced form of graphene oxide (GO; reduced form: rGO) remains a highly disordered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al. Here we report a simple, rapid method to reduce GO into pristine graphene using 1- to 2-second pulses of microwaves. The desirable structural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es are translated into mobility values of >1000 square centimeters per volt per second in field-effect transistors with microwave-reduced GO (MW-rGO) as the channel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al and into particularly high activity for MW-rGO catalyst support toward oxygen evolution reactions.</p>

Melting of subducted basalt at the core-mantle boundary
<p>The geological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als in Earth's lowermost mantle control the characteristics and interpretation of seismic ultra–low velocity zones at the base of the core-mantle boundary. Partial melting of the bulk lower mantle is often advocated as the cause, but this does not explain the nonubiquitous character of these regional seismic features. We explored the melting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es of mid-oceanic ridge basalt (MORB), which can reach the lowermost mantle after subduction of oceanic crust. At a pressure representative of the core-mantle boundary (135 gigapascals), the onset of melting occurs at ~3800 kelvin, which is ~350 kelvin below the mantle solidus. The SiO<sub>2</sub>-rich liquid generated either remains trapped in the MORB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al or solidifies after reacting with the surrounding MgO-rich mantle, remixing subducted MORB with the lowermost mantle.</p>

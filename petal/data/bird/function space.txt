Mars’ atmospheric history derived from upper-atmosphere measurements of <sup>38</sup>Ar/<sup>36</sup>Ar
<p>The history of Mars’ atmosphere is important for understanding the geological evolution and potential habitability of the planet. We determine the amount of gas lost to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">space</span></strong> through time using measurements of the upper-atmospheric structure made by the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">space</span></strong>craft. We derive the structure of <sup>38</sup>Ar/<sup>36</sup>Ar between the homopause and exobase altitudes. Fractionation of argon occurs as a result of loss of gas to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">space</span></strong> by pickup-ion sputtering, which preferentially removes the lighter atom. The measurements require that 66% of the atmospheric argon has been lost to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">space</span></strong>. Thus, a large fraction of Mars’ atmospheric gas has been lost to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">space</span></strong>, contributing to the transition in climate from an early, warm, wet environment to today’s cold, dry atmosphere.</p>

Universal space-time scaling symmetry in the dynamics of bosons across a quantum phase transition
<p>The dynamics of many-body systems spanning condensed matter, cosmology, and beyond are hypothesized to be universal when the systems cross continuous phase transitions. The universal dynamics are expected to satisfy a scaling symmetry of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">space</span></strong> and time with the crossing rate, inspired by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. We test this symmetry based on Bose condensates in a shaken optical lattice. Shaking the lattice drives condensates across an effectively ferromagnetic quantum phase transition. After crossing the critical point, the condensates manifest delayed growth of spin fluctuations and develop antiferromagnetic spatial correlations resulting from the sub-Poisson distribution of the spacing between topological defects. The fluctuations and correlations are invariant in scaled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">space</span></strong>-time coordinates, in support of the scaling symmetry of quantum critical dynamics.</p>

The entorhinal cognitive map is attracted to goals
<p>Grid cells with their rigid hexagonal firing fields are thought to provide an invariant metric to the hippocampal cognitive map, yet environmental geometrical features have recently been shown to distort the grid structure. Given that the hippocampal role goes beyond <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">space</span></strong>, we tested the influence of nonspatial information on the grid organization. We trained rats to daily learn three new reward locations on a cheeseboard maze while recording from the medial entorhinal cortex and the hippocampal CA1 region. Many grid fields moved toward goal location, leading to long-lasting deformations of the entorhinal map. Therefore, distortions in the grid structure contribute to goal representation during both learning and recall, which demonstrates that grid cells participate in mnemonic coding and do not merely provide a simple metric of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">space</span></strong>.</p>

Comprehensive computational design of ordered peptide macrocycles
<p>Mixed-chirality peptide macrocycles such as cyclosporine are among the most potent therapeutics identified to date, but there is currently no way to systematically search the structural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">space</span></strong> spanned by such compounds. Natural proteins do not provide a useful guide: Peptide macrocycles lack regular secondary structures and hydrophobic cores, and can contain local structures not accessible with <sc>l</sc>-amino acids. Here, we enumerate the stable structures that can be adopted by macrocyclic peptides composed of <sc>l</sc>- and <sc>d</sc>-amino acids by near-exhaustive backbone sampling followed by sequence design and energy landscape calculations. We identify more than 200 designs predicted to fold into single stable structures, many times more than the number of currently available unbound peptide macrocycle structures. Nuclear magnetic resonance structures of 9 of 12 designed 7- to 10-residue macrocycles, and three 11- to 14-residue bicyclic designs, are close to the computational models. Our results provide a nearly complete coverage of the rich <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">space</span></strong> of structures possible for short peptide macrocycles and vastly increase the available starting scaffolds for both rational drug design and library selection methods.</p>

Disorder-induced optical transition from spin Hall to random Rashba effect
<p>Disordered structures give rise to intriguing phenomena owing to the complex nature of their interaction with light. We report on photonic spin-symmetry breaking and unexpected spin-optical transport phenomena arising from subwavelength-scale disordered geometric phase structure. Weak disorder induces a photonic spin Hall effect, observed via quantum weak measurements, whereas strong disorder leads to spin-split modes in momentum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">space</span></strong>, a random optical Rashba effect. Study of the momentum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">space</span></strong> entropy reveals an optical transition upon reaching a critical point where the structure’s anisotropy axis vanishes. Incorporation of singular topology into the disordered structure demonstrates repulsive vortex interaction depending on the disorder strength. The photonic disordered geometric phase can serve as a platform for the study of different phenomena emerging from complex media involving spin-orbit coupling.</p>

Scalable-manufactured randomized glass-polymer hybrid metamaterial for daytime radiative cooling
<p>Passive radiative cooling draws heat from surfaces and radiates it into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">space</span></strong> as infrared radiation to which the atmosphere is transparent. However, the energy density mismatch between solar irradiance and the low infrared radiation flux from a near-ambient-temperature surface requires materials that strongly emit thermal energy and barely absorb sunlight. We embedded resonant polar dielectric microspheres randomly in a polymeric matrix, resulting in a metamaterial that is fully transparent to the solar spectrum while having an infrared emissivity greater than 0.93 across the atmospheric window. When backed with a silver coating, the metamaterial shows a noontime radiative cooling power of 93 watts per square meter under direct sunshine. More critically, we demonstrated high-throughput, economical roll-to-roll manufacturing of the metamaterial, which is vital for promoting radiative cooling as a viable energy technology.</p>

Radical-polar crossover reactions of vinylboron ate complexes
<p>Vinyl boronic esters are valuable substrates for Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions. However, boron-substituted alkenes have drawn little attention as radical acceptors, and the radical chemistry of vinylboron ate complexes is underexplored. We show here that carbon radicals add efficiently to vinylboron ate complexes and that their adduct radical anions undergo radical-polar crossover: A 1,2-alkyl/aryl shift from boron to the α-carbon sp<sup>2</sup> center provides secondary or tertiary alkyl boronic esters. In contrast to the Suzuki-Miyaura coupling, a transition metal is not required, and two carbon-carbon bonds are formed. The valuable boronic ester moiety remains in the product and can be used in follow-up chemistry, enlarging the chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">space</span></strong> of the method. The cascade uses commercial starting materials and provides access to perfluoroalkylated alcohols, γ-lactones, γ-hydroxy alkylnitriles, and compounds bearing quaternary carbon centers.</p>

A paralogous decoy protects <i>Phytophthora sojae</i> apoplastic effector PsXEG1 from a host inhibitor
<p>The extracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">space</span></strong> (apoplast) of plant tissue represents a critical battleground between plants and attacking microbes. Here we show that a pathogen-secreted apoplastic xyloglucan-specific endoglucanase, PsXEG1, is a focus of this struggle in the <i>Phytophthora sojae</i>–soybean interaction. We show that soybean produces an apoplastic glucanase inhibitor protein, GmGIP1, that binds to PsXEG1 to block its contribution to virulence. <i>P. sojae</i>, however, secretes a paralogous PsXEG1-like protein, PsXLP1, that has lost enzyme activity but binds to GmGIP1 more tightly than does PsXEG1, thus freeing PsXEG1 to support <i>P. sojae</i> infection. The gene pair encoding PsXEG1 and PsXLP1 is conserved in many <i>Phytophthora</i> species, and the <i>P. parasitica</i> orthologs PpXEG1 and PpXLP1 have similar functions. Thus, this apoplastic decoy strategy may be widely used in <i>Phytophthora</i> pathosystems.</p>

Activity-dependent spatially localized miRNA maturation in neuronal dendrites
<p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression by binding to target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and preventing their translation. In general, the number of potential mRNA targets in a cell is much greater than the miRNA copy number, complicating high-fidelity miRNA-target interactions. We developed an inducible fluorescent probe to explore whether the maturation of a miRNA could be regulated in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">space</span></strong> and time in neurons. A precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) probe exhibited an activity-dependent increase in fluorescence, suggesting the stimulation of miRNA maturation. Single-synapse stimulation resulted in a local maturation of miRNA that was associated with a spatially restricted reduction in the protein synthesis of a target mRNA. Thus, the spatially and temporally regulated maturation of pre-miRNAs can be used to increase the precision and robustness of miRNA-mediated translational repression.</p>

Nanometer resolution imaging and tracking of fluorescent molecules with minimal photon fluxes
<p>We introduce MINFLUX, a concept for localizing photon emitters in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">space</span></strong>. By probing the emitter with a local intensity minimum of excitation light, MINFLUX minimizes the fluorescence photons needed for high localization precision. In our experiments, 22 times fewer fluorescence photons are required as compared to popular centroid localization. In superresolution microscopy, MINFLUX attained ~1-nm precision, resolving molecules only 6 nanometers apart. MINFLUX tracking of single fluorescent proteins increased the temporal resolution and the number of localizations per trace by a factor of 100, as demonstrated with diffusing 30<i>S</i> ribosomal subunits in living <i>Escherichia coli</i>. As conceptual limits have not been reached, we expect this localization modality to break new ground for observing the dynamics, distribution, and structure of macromolecules in living cells and beyond.</p>

Imaging rotational dynamics of nanoparticles in liquid by 4D electron microscopy
<p>In real time and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">space</span></strong>, four-dimensional electron microscopy (4D EM) has enabled observation of transient structures and morphologies of inorganic and organic materials. We have extended 4D EM to include liquid cells without the time resolution being limited by the response of the detector. Our approach permits the imaging of the motion and morphological dynamics of a single, same particle on nanometer and ultrashort time scales. As a first application, we studied the rotational dynamics of gold nanoparticles in aqueous solution. A full transition from the conventional diffusive rotation to superdiffusive rotation and further to a ballistic rotation was observed with increasing asymmetry of the nanoparticle morphology. We explored the underlying physics both experimentally and theoretically according to the morphological asymmetry of the nanoparticles.</p>

Structure of a yeast step II catalytically activated spliceosome
<p>Each cycle of precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) splicing comprises two sequential reactions, first freeing the 5′ exon and generating an intron lariat–3′ exon and then ligating the two exons and releasing the intron lariat. The second reaction is executed by the step II catalytically activated spliceosome (known as the C* complex). Here, we present the cryo–electron microscopy structure of a C* complex from <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> at an average resolution of 4.0 angstroms. Compared with the preceding spliceosomal complex (C complex), the lariat junction has been translocated by 15 to 20 angstroms to vacate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">space</span></strong> for the incoming 3′-exon sequences. The step I splicing factors Cwc25 and Yju2 have been dissociated from the active site. Two catalytic motifs from Prp8 (the 1585 loop and the β finger of the ribonuclease H–like domain), along with the step II splicing factors Prp17 and Prp18 and other surrounding proteins, are poised to assist the second transesterification. These structural features, together with those reported for other spliceosomal complexes, yield a near-complete mechanistic picture on the splicing cycle.</p>

Fault activation by hydraulic fracturing in western Canada
<p>Hydraulic fracturing has been inferred to trigger the majority of injection-induced earthquakes in western Canada, in contrast to the Midwestern United States, where massive saltwater disposal is the dominant triggering mechanism. A template-based earthquake catalog from a seismically active Canadian shale play, combined with comprehensive injection data during a 4-month interval, shows that earthquakes are tightly clustered in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">space</span></strong> and time near hydraulic fracturing sites. The largest event [moment magnitude (<i>M</i><sub>W</sub>) 3.9] occurred several weeks after injection along a fault that appears to extend from the injection zone into crystalline basement. Patterns of seismicity indicate that stress changes during operations can activate fault slip to an offset distance of >1 km, whereas pressurization by hydraulic fracturing into a fault yields episodic seismicity that can persist for months.</p>

Directed evolution of cytochrome c for carbon–silicon bond formation: Bringing silicon to life

Such enzymes would expand the catalytic repertoire of biology, enabling living systems to access chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">space</span></strong> previously only open to synthetic chemistry. We have discovered that heme proteins catalyze the formation of organosilicon compounds under physiological conditions via carbene insertion into silicon–hydrogen bonds. The reaction proceeds both in vitro and in vivo, accommodating a broad range of substrates with high chemo- and enantioselectivity. Using directed evolution, we enhanced the catalytic function of cytochrome c from <i>Rhodothermus marinus</i> to achieve more than 15-fold higher turnover than state-of-the-art synthetic catalysts. This carbon–silicon bond-forming biocatalyst offers an environmentally friendly and highly efficient route to producing enantiopure organosilicon molecules.</p>

Senescent intimal foam cells are deleterious at all stages of atherosclerosis
<p>Advanced atherosclerotic lesions contain senescent cells, but the role of these cells in atherogenesis remains unclear. Using transgenic and pharmacological approaches to eliminate senescent cells in atherosclerosis-prone low-density lipoprotein receptor–deficient (<i>Ldlr</i><sup>–/–</sup>) mice, we show that these cells are detrimental throughout disease pathogenesis. We find that foamy macrophages with senescence markers accumulate in the subendothelial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">space</span></strong> at the onset of atherosclerosis, where they drive pathology by increasing expression of key atherogenic and inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. In advanced lesions, senescent cells promote features of plaque instability, including elastic fiber degradation and fibrous cap thinning, by heightening metalloprotease production. Together, these results demonstrate that senescent cells are key drivers of atheroma formation and maturation and suggest that selective clearance of these cells by senolytic agents holds promise for the treatment of atherosclerosis.</p>

Super-dry reforming of methane intensifies CO<sub>2</sub> utilization via Le Chatelier’s principle
<p>Efficient CO<sub>2</sub> transformation from a waste product to a carbon source for chemicals and fuels will require reaction conditions that effect its reduction. We developed a “super-dry” CH<sub>4</sub> reforming reaction for enhanced CO production from CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>. We used Ni/MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> as a CH<sub>4</sub>-reforming catalyst, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> as a solid oxygen carrier, and CaO/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> as a CO<sub>2</sub> sorbent. The isothermal coupling of these three different processes resulted in higher CO production as compared with that of conventional dry reforming, by avoiding back reactions with water. The reduction of iron oxide was intensified through CH<sub>4</sub> conversion to syngas over Ni and CO<sub>2</sub> extraction and storage as CaCO<sub>3</sub>. CO<sub>2</sub> is then used for iron reoxidation and CO production, exploiting equilibrium shifts effected with inert gas sweeping (Le Chatelier’s principle). Super-dry reforming uses up to three CO<sub>2</sub> molecules per CH<sub>4</sub> and offers a high CO <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">space</span></strong>-time yield of 7.5 millimole CO per second per kilogram of iron at 1023 kelvin.</p>

Going with the Flow: Multiscale Insights into the Composite Nature of Water Transport in Roots
<p>As water often limits crop production, a more complete understanding of plant water capture and transport is necessary. Here, we developed MECHA, a mathematical model that computes the flow of water across the root at the scale of walls, membranes, and plasmodesmata of individual cells, and used it to test hypotheses related to root water transport in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). The model uses detailed root anatomical descriptions and a minimal set of experimental cell properties, including the conductivity of plasma membranes, cell walls, and plasmodesmata, which yield quantitative and scale-consistent estimations of water pathways and root radial hydraulic conductivity (<i>k</i><sub>r</sub>). MECHA revealed that the mainstream hydraulic theories derived independently at the cell and root segment scales are compatible only if osmotic potentials within the apoplastic domains are uniform. The results suggested that the convection-diffusion of apoplastic solutes explained most of the offset between estimated <i>k</i><sub>r</sub> in pressure clamp and osmotic experiments, while the contribution of water-filled intercellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">space</span></strong>s was limited. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses quantified the relative impact of cortex and endodermis cell conductivity of plasma membranes on root <i>k</i><sub>r</sub> and suggested that only the latter contributed substantially to <i>k</i><sub>r</sub> due to the composite nature of water flow across roots. The explicit root hydraulic anatomy framework brings insights into contradictory interpretations of experiments from the literature and suggests experiments to efficiently address questions pertaining to root water relations. Its scale consistency opens avenues for cross-scale communication in the world of root hydraulics.</p>

Micro Imaging Displays the Sucrose Landscape within and along Its Allocation Pathways
<p>Sucrose (Suc) is the major transport sugar in plants and plays a primary role as an energy source and signal in adaptive and stress responses. An ability to quantify Suc over time and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">space</span></strong> would serve to advance our understanding of these important processes. Current technologies used for Suc mapping are unable to quantitatively visualize its distribution within tissues. Here, we present an infrared-based microspectroscopic method that allows for the quantitative visualization of Suc at a microscopic level of resolution (∼12 µm). This method can successfully model the sugar concentration in individual vascular bundles and within a complex organ such as the stem, leaf, or seed. The sensitivity of the assay ranges from 20 to 1,000 m<sc>m</sc>. We applied this method to the cereal crop barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) and the model plant Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) to highlight the potential of the procedure for resolving the spatial distribution of metabolites. We also discuss the relevance of the method for studies on carbon allocation and storage in the context of crop improvement.</p>

Functional Diversity of Diterpene Synthases in the Biofuel Crop Switchgrass
<p>Diterpenoids constitute a diverse class of metabolites with critical functions in plant development, defense, and ecological adaptation. Major monocot crops, such as maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) and rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), deploy diverse blends of specialized diterpenoids as core components of biotic and abiotic stress resilience. Here, we describe the genome-wide identification and functional characterization of stress-related diterpene synthases (diTPSs) in the dedicated bioenergy crop switchgrass (<i>Panicum virgatum</i>). Mining of the allotetraploid switchgrass genome identified an expansive diTPS family of 31 members, and biochemical analysis of 11 diTPSs revealed a modular metabolic network producing a diverse array of diterpenoid metabolites. In addition to <i>ent</i>-copalyl diphosphate (CPP) and <i>ent</i>-kaurene synthases predictably involved in gibberellin biosynthesis, we identified <i>syn</i>-CPP and <i>ent</i>-labda-13-en-8-ol diphosphate (LPP) synthases as well as two diTPSs forming (+)-labda-8,13<i>E</i>-dienyl diphosphate (8,13-CPP) and <i>ent-neo-</i>cis-trans-clerodienyl diphosphate (CT-CLPP) scaffolds not observed previously in plants. Structure-guided mutagenesis of the (+)-8,13-CPP and <i>ent-neo-</i>CT-CLPP synthases revealed residue substitutions in the active sites that altered product outcome, representing potential neofunctionalization events that occurred during diversification of the switchgrass diTPS family. The conversion of <i>ent</i>-CPP, <i>ent</i>-LPP, <i>syn</i>-CPP, and <i>ent-neo</i>-CT-CLPP by promiscuous diTPSs further yielded distinct labdane-type diterpene olefins and alcohols. Of these metabolites, the formation of 9β-hydroxy-<i>syn</i>-pimar-15-ene and the expression of the corresponding genes were induced in roots and leaves in response to oxidative stress and ultraviolet irradiation, indicating their possible roles in abiotic stress adaptation. Together, these findings expand the known chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">space</span></strong> of diterpenoid metabolism in monocot crops toward systematically investigating and ultimately improving stress resilience traits in crop species.</p>

Discovery, Biosynthesis and Stress-Related Accumulation of Dolabradiene-Derived Defenses in Maize<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Terpenoids are a major component of maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) chemical defenses that mediate responses to herbivores, pathogens, and other environmental challenges. Here, we describe the biosynthesis and elicited production of a class of maize diterpenoids, named dolabralexins. Dolabralexin biosynthesis involves the sequential activity of two diterpene synthases, <i>ENT</i>-COPALYL DIPHOSPHATE SYNTHASE (ZmAN2) and KAURENE SYNTHASE-LIKE4 (ZmKSL4). Together, ZmAN2 and ZmKSL4 form the diterpene hydrocarbon dolabradiene. In addition, we biochemically characterized a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, ZmCYP71Z16, which catalyzes the oxygenation of dolabradiene to yield the epoxides 15,16-epoxydolabrene (epoxydolabrene) and 3β-hydroxy-15,16-epoxydolabrene (epoxydolabranol). The absence of dolabradiene and epoxydolabranol in <i>Zman2</i> mutants under elicited conditions confirmed the in vivo biosynthetic requirement of ZmAN2. Combined mass spectrometry and NMR experiments demonstrated that much of the epoxydolabranol is further converted into 3β,15,16-trihydroxydolabrene (trihydroxydolabrene). Metabolite profiling of field-grown maize root tissues indicated that dolabralexin biosynthesis is widespread across common maize cultivars, with trihydroxydolabrene as the predominant diterpenoid. Oxidative stress induced dolabralexin accumulation and transcript expression of <i>ZmAN2</i> and <i>ZmKSL4</i> in root tissues, and metabolite and transcript accumulation were up-regulated in response to elicitation with the fungal pathogens <i>Fusarium verticillioides</i> and <i>Fusarium graminearum</i>. Consistently, epoxydolabranol significantly inhibited the growth of both pathogens in vitro at 10 µg mL<sup>−1</sup>, while trihydroxydolabrene-mediated inhibition was specific to <i>F</i>. <i>verticillioides</i>. These findings suggest that dolabralexins have defense-related roles in maize stress interactions and expand the known chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">space</span></strong> of diterpenoid defenses as genetic targets for understanding and ultimately improving maize resilience.</p>

An Iron-Activated Citrate Transporter, MtMATE67, Is Required for Symbiotic Nitrogen Fixation<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Iron (Fe) is an essential micronutrient for symbiotic nitrogen fixation in legume nodules, where it is required for the activity of bacterial nitrogenase, plant leghemoglobin, respiratory oxidases, and other Fe proteins in both organisms. Fe solubility and transport within and between plant tissues is facilitated by organic chelators, such as nicotianamine and citrate. We have characterized a nodule-specific citrate transporter of the multidrug and toxic compound extrusion family, MtMATE67 of <i>Medicago truncatula</i>. The MtMATE67 gene was induced early during nodule development and expressed primarily in the invasion zone of mature nodules. The MtMATE67 protein was localized to the plasma membrane of nodule cells and also the symbiosome membrane surrounding bacteroids in infected cells. In oocytes, MtMATE67 transported citrate out of cells in an Fe-activated manner. Loss of <i>MtMATE67</i> gene function resulted in accumulation of Fe in the apoplasm of nodule cells and a substantial decrease in symbiotic nitrogen fixation and plant growth. Taken together, the results point to a primary role of MtMATE67 in citrate efflux from nodule cells in response to an Fe signal. This efflux is necessary to ensure Fe(III) solubility and mobility in the apoplasm and uptake into nodule cells. Likewise, MtMATE67-mediated citrate transport into the symbiosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">space</span></strong> would increase the solubility and availability of Fe(III) for rhizobial bacteroids.</p>

Gradually Decreasing Starch Branching Enzyme Expression Is Responsible for the Formation of Heterogeneous Starch Granules
<p>Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) endosperm is mainly occupied by homogeneous polygonal starch from inside to outside. However, morphologically different (heterogeneous) starches have been identified in some rice mutants. How these heterogeneous starches form remains unknown. A high-amylose rice line (TRS) generated through the antisense inhibition of <i>starch branching synthase I</i> (<i>SBEI</i>) and <i>SBEIIb</i> contains four heterogeneous starches: polygonal, aggregate, elongated, and hollow starch; these starches are regionally distributed in the endosperm from inside to outside. Here, we investigated the relationship between SBE dosage and the morphological architecture of heterogeneous starches in TRS endosperm from the view of the molecular structure of starch. The results indicated that their molecular structures underwent regular changes, including gradually increasing true amylose content but decreasing amylopectin content and gradually increasing the ratio of amylopectin long chain but decreasing the ratio of amylopectin short chain. Granule-bound starch synthase I (GBSSI) amounts in the four heterogeneous starches were not significantly different from each other, but SBEI, SBEIIa, and SBEIIb showed a gradually decreasing trend. Further immunostaining analysis revealed that the gradually decreasing SBEs acting on the formation of the four heterogeneous granules were mainly due to the spatial distribution of the three SBEs in the endosperm. It was suggested that the decreased amylopectin in starch might remove steric hindrance and provide extra <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">space</span></strong> for abundant amylose accumulation when the GBSSI amount was not elevated. Furthermore, extra amylose coupled with altered amylopectin structure possibly led to morphological changes in heterogeneous granules.</p>

Regular Motifs in Xylan Modulate Molecular Flexibility and Interactions with Cellulose Surfaces
<p>Xylan is tightly associated with cellulose and lignin in secondary plant cell walls, contributing to its rigidity and structural integrity in vascular plants. However, the molecular features and the nanoscale forces that control the interactions among cellulose microfibrils, hemicelluloses, and lignin are still not well understood. Here, we combine comprehensive mass spectrometric glycan sequencing and molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the substitution pattern in softwood xylans and to investigate the effect of distinct intramolecular motifs on xylan conformation and on the interaction with cellulose surfaces in Norway spruce (<i>Picea abies</i>). We confirm the presence of motifs with evenly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">space</span></strong>d glycosyl decorations on the xylan backbone, together with minor motifs with consecutive glucuronation. These domains are differently enriched in xylan fractions extracted by alkali and subcritical water, which indicates their preferential positioning in the secondary plant cell wall ultrastructure. The flexibility of the 3-fold screw conformation of xylan in solution is enhanced by the presence of arabinofuranosyl decorations. Additionally, molecular dynamic simulations suggest that the glycosyl substitutions in xylan are not only sterically tolerated by the cellulose surfaces but that they increase the affinity for cellulose and favor the stabilization of the 2-fold screw conformation. This effect is more significant for the hydrophobic surface compared with the hydrophilic ones, which demonstrates the importance of nonpolar driving forces on the structural integrity of secondary plant cell walls. These novel molecular insights contribute to an improved understanding of the supramolecular architecture of plant secondary cell walls and have fundamental implications for overcoming lignocellulose recalcitrance and for the design of advanced wood-based materials.</p>

Seasonal Regulation of Petal Number
<p>Four petals characterize the flowers of most species in the Brassicaceae family, and this phenotype is generally robust to genetic and environmental variation. A variable petal number distinguishes the flowers of <i>Cardamine hirsuta</i> from those of its close relative Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), and allelic variation at many loci contribute to this trait. However, it is less clear whether <i>C. hirsuta</i> petal number varies in response to seasonal changes in environment. To address this question, we assessed whether petal number responds to a suite of environmental and endogenous cues that regulate flowering time in <i>C. hirsuta</i>. We found that petal number showed seasonal variation in <i>C. hirsuta</i>, such that spring flowering plants developed more petals than those flowering in summer. Conditions associated with spring flowering, including cool ambient temperature, short photoperiod, and vernalization, all increased petal number in <i>C. hirsuta</i>. Cool temperature caused the strongest increase in petal number and lengthened the time interval over which floral meristems matured. We performed live imaging of early flower development and showed that floral buds developed more slowly at 15°C versus 20°C. This extended phase of floral meristem formation, coupled with slower growth of sepals at 15°C, produced larger intersepal regions with more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">space</span></strong> available for petal initiation. In summary, the growth and maturation of floral buds is associated with variable petal number in <i>C. hirsuta</i> and responds to seasonal changes in ambient temperature.</p>

Identification and Characterization of Daurichromenic Acid Synthase Active in Anti-HIV Biosynthesis
<p>Daurichromenic acid (DCA) synthase catalyzes the oxidative cyclization of grifolic acid to produce DCA, an anti-HIV meroterpenoid isolated from <i>Rhododendron dauricum</i>. We identified a novel cDNA encoding DCA synthase by transcriptome-based screening from young leaves of <i>R. dauricum</i>. The gene coded for a 533-amino acid polypeptide with moderate homologies to flavin adenine dinucleotide oxidases from other plants. The primary structure contained an amino-terminal signal peptide and conserved amino acid residues to form bicovalent linkage to the flavin adenine dinucleotide isoalloxazine ring at histidine-112 and cysteine-175. In addition, the recombinant DCA synthase, purified from the culture supernatant of transgenic <i>Pichia pastoris</i>, exhibited structural and functional properties as a flavoprotein. The reaction mechanism of DCA synthase characterized herein partly shares a similarity with those of cannabinoid synthases from <i>Cannabis sativa</i>, whereas DCA synthase catalyzes a novel cyclization reaction of the farnesyl moiety of a meroterpenoid natural product of plant origin. Moreover, in this study, we present evidence that DCA is biosynthesized and accumulated specifically in the glandular scales, on the surface of <i>R. dauricum</i> plants, based on various analytical studies at the chemical, biochemical, and molecular levels. The extracellular localization of DCA also was confirmed by a confocal microscopic analysis of its autofluorescence. These data highlight the unique feature of DCA: the final step of biosynthesis is completed in apoplastic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">space</span></strong>, and it is highly accumulated outside the scale cells.</p>

Bacterial Biosensors for in Vivo Spatiotemporal Mapping of Root Secretion

Coupling transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses of the pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) rhizosphere, a suite of bioreporters has been developed in <i>Rhizobium leguminosarum</i> bv <i>viciae</i> strain 3841, and these detect metabolites secreted by roots in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">space</span></strong> and time. Fourteen bacterial <i>lux</i> fusion bioreporters, specific for sugars, polyols, amino acids, organic acids, or flavonoids, have been validated in vitro and in vivo. Using different bacterial mutants (<i>nodC</i> and <i>nifH</i>), the process of colonization and symbiosis has been analyzed, revealing compounds important in the different steps of the rhizobium-legume association. Dicarboxylates and sucrose are the main carbon sources within the nodules; in ineffective (<i>nifH</i>) nodules, particularly low levels of sucrose were observed, suggesting that plant sanctions affect carbon supply to nodules. In contrast, high <i>myo</i>-inositol levels were observed prior to nodule formation and also in <i>nifH</i> senescent nodules. Amino acid biosensors showed different patterns: a γ-aminobutyrate biosensor was active only inside nodules, whereas the phenylalanine bioreporter showed a high signal also in the rhizosphere. The bioreporters were further validated in vetch (<i>Vicia hirsuta</i>), producing similar results. In addition, vetch exhibited a local increase of <i>nod</i> gene-inducing flavonoids at sites where nodules developed subsequently. These bioreporters will be particularly helpful in understanding the dynamics of root exudation and the role of different molecules secreted into the rhizosphere.</p>

Origins and Evolution of Stomatal Development
<p>The fossil record suggests stomata-like pores were present on the surfaces of land plants over 400 million years ago. Whether stomata arose once or whether they arose independently across newly evolving land plant lineages has long been a matter of debate. In Arabidopsis, a genetic toolbox has been identified that tightly controls stomatal development and patterning. This includes the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors <i>SPEECHLESS</i> (<i>SPCH</i>), <i>MUTE</i>, <i>FAMA</i>, and <i>ICE/SCREAMs</i> (<i>SCRMs</i>), which promote stomatal formation. These factors are regulated via a signaling cascade, which includes mobile <i>EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR</i> (<i>EPF</i>) peptides to enforce stomatal spacing. Mosses and hornworts, the most ancient extant lineages to possess stomata, possess orthologs of these Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) stomatal toolbox genes, and manipulation in the model bryophyte <i>Physcomitrella patens</i> has shown that the bHLH and EPF components are also required for moss stomatal development and patterning. This supports an ancient and tightly conserved genetic origin of stomata. Here, we review recent discoveries and, by interrogating newly available plant genomes, we advance the story of stomatal development and patterning across land plant evolution. Furthermore, we identify potential orthologs of the key toolbox genes in a hornwort, further supporting a single ancient genetic origin of stomata in the ancestor to all stomatous land plants.</p>

Global Sensitivity Analysis of OnGuard Models Identifies Key Hubs for Transport Interaction in Stomatal Dynamics
<p>The physical requirement for charge to balance across biological membranes means that the transmembrane transport of each ionic species is interrelated, and manipulating solute flux through any one transporter will affect other transporters at the same membrane, often with unforeseen consequences. The OnGuard systems modeling platform has helped to resolve the mechanics of stomatal movements, uncovering previously unexpected behaviors of stomata. To date, however, the manual approach to exploring model parameter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">space</span></strong> has captured little formal information about the emergent connections between parameters that define the most interesting properties of the system as a whole. Here, we introduce global sensitivity analysis to identify interacting parameters affecting a number of outputs commonly accessed in experiments in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The analysis highlights synergies between transporters affecting the balance between Ca<sup>2+</sup> sequestration and Ca<sup>2+</sup> release pathways, notably those associated with internal Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores and their turnover. Other, unexpected synergies appear, including with the plasma membrane anion channels and H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase and with the tonoplast TPK K<sup>+</sup> channel. These emergent synergies, and the core hubs of interaction that they define, identify subsets of transporters associated with free cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration that represent key targets to enhance plant performance in the future. They also highlight the importance of interactions between the voltage regulation of the plasma membrane and tonoplast in coordinating transport between the different cellular compartments.</p>

Hornwort Stomata: Architecture and Fate Shared with 400-Million-Year-Old Fossil Plants without Leaves
<p>As one of the earliest plant groups to evolve stomata, hornworts are key to understanding the origin and function of stomata. Hornwort stomata are large and scattered on sporangia that grow from their bases and release spores at their tips. We present data from development and immunocytochemistry that identify a role for hornwort stomata that is correlated with sporangial and spore maturation. We measured guard cells across the genera with stomata to assess developmental changes in size and to analyze any correlation with genome size. Stomata form at the base of the sporophyte in the green region, where they develop differential wall thickenings, form a pore, and die. Guard cells collapse inwardly, increase in surface area, and remain perched over a substomatal cavity and network of intercellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">space</span></strong>s that is initially fluid filled. Following pore formation, the sporophyte dries from the outside inwardly and continues to do so after guard cells die and collapse. Spore tetrads develop in spore mother cell walls within a mucilaginous matrix, both of which progressively dry before sporophyte dehiscence. A lack of correlation between guard cell size and DNA content, lack of arabinans in cell walls, and perpetually open pores are consistent with the inactivity of hornwort stomata. Stomata are expendable in hornworts, as they have been lost twice in derived taxa. Guard cells and epidermal cells of hornworts show striking similarities with the earliest plant fossils. Our findings identify an architecture and fate of stomata in hornworts that is ancient and common to plants without sporophytic leaves.</p>

Activation of Mitochondrial Protein Phosphatase SLP2 by MIA40 Regulates Seed Germination
<p>Reversible protein phosphorylation catalyzed by protein kinases and phosphatases represents the most prolific and well-characterized posttranslational modification known.

Interaction with AtMIA40 is necessary for the phosphatase activity of AtSLP2 and is dependent on the formation of disulfide bridges on AtSLP2. Furthermore, by utilizing <i>atslp2</i> null mutant, AtSLP2 complemented and AtSLP2 overexpressing plants, we identify a function for the AtSLP2-AtMIA40 complex in negatively regulating gibberellic acid-related processes during seed germination. Results presented here characterize a mitochondrial IMS-localized protein phosphatase identified in photosynthetic eukaryotes as well as a protein phosphatase target of the highly conserved eukaryotic MIA40 IMS oxidoreductase.</p>

CNGC2 Is a Ca<sup>2+</sup> Influx Channel That Prevents Accumulation of Apoplastic Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the Leaf
<p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> is absorbed by roots and transported upward through the xylem to the apoplastic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">space</span></strong> of the leaf, after which it is deposited into the leaf cell. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the tonoplast-localized Ca<sup>2+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> transporters CATION EXCHANGER1 (CAX1) and CAX3 sequester Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the cytosol into the vacuole, but it is not known what transporter mediates the initial Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx from the apoplast to the cytosol. Here, we report that Arabidopsis <i>CYCLIC NUCLEOTIDE-GATED CHANNEL2</i> (<i>CNGC2</i>) encodes a protein with Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx channel activity and is expressed in the leaf areas surrounding the free endings of minor veins, which is the primary site for Ca<sup>2+</sup> unloading from the vasculature and influx into leaf cells. Under hydroponic growth conditions, with 0.1 m<sc>m</sc> Ca<sup>2+</sup>, both Arabidopsis <i>cngc2</i> and <i>cax1cax3</i> loss-of-function mutants grew normally. Increasing the Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration to 10 m<sc>m</sc> induced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation, cell death, and leaf senescence and partially suppressed the hypersensitive response to avirulent pathogens in the mutants but not in the wild type.

CTDGFinder: A Novel Homology-Based Algorithm for Identifying Closely Spaced Clusters of Tandemly Duplicated Genes
<p>Closely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">space</span></strong>d clusters of tandemly duplicated genes (CTDGs) contribute to the diversity of many phenotypes, including chemosensation, snake venom, and animal body plans. CTDGs have traditionally been identified subjectively as genomic neighborhoods containing several gene duplicates in close proximity; however, CTDGs are often highly variable with respect to gene number, intergenic distance, and synteny. This lack of formal definition hampers the study of CTDG evolutionary dynamics and the discovery of novel CTDGs in the exponentially growing body of genomic data. To address this gap, we developed a novel homology-based algorithm, CTDGFinder, which formalizes and automates the identification of CTDGs by examining the physical distribution of individual members of families of duplicated genes across chromosomes. Application of CTDGFinder accurately identified CTDGs for many well-known gene clusters (e.g., Hox and beta-globin gene clusters) in the human, mouse and 20 other mammalian genomes. Differences between previously annotated gene clusters and our inferred CTDGs were due to the exclusion of nonhomologs that have historically been considered parts of specific gene clusters, the inclusion or absence of genes between the CTDGs and their corresponding gene clusters, and the splitting of certain gene clusters into distinct CTDGs. Examination of human genes showing tissue-specific enhancement of their expression by CTDGFinder identified members of several well-known gene clusters (e.g., cytochrome P450s and olfactory receptors) and revealed that they were unequally distributed across tissues. By formalizing and automating CTDG identification, CTDGFinder will facilitate understanding of CTDG evolutionary dynamics, their functional implications, and how they are associated with phenotypic diversity.</p>

Insights from the Shell Proteome: Biomineralization to Adaptation
<p>Bivalves have evolved a range of complex shell forming mechanisms that are reflected by their incredible diversity in shell mineralogy and microstructures. A suite of proteins exported to the shell matrix <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">space</span></strong> plays a significant role in controlling these features, in addition to underpinning some of the physical properties of the shell itself. Although, there is a general consensus that a minimum basic protein tool kit is required for shell construction, to date, this remains undefined. In this study, the shell matrix proteins (SMPs) of four highly divergent bivalves (The Pacific oyster, <i>Crassostrea gigas</i>; the blue mussel, <i>Mytilus edulis</i>; the clam, <i>Mya truncata</i>, and the king scallop, <i>Pecten maximus</i>) were analyzed in an identical fashion using proteomics pipeline. This enabled us to identify the critical elements of a “basic tool kit” for calcification processes, which were conserved across the taxa irrespective of the shell morphology and arrangement of the crystal surfaces. In addition, protein domains controlling the crystal layers specific to aragonite and calcite were also identified. Intriguingly, a significant number of the identified SMPs contained domains related to immune functions. These were often are unique to each species implying their involvement not only in immunity, but also environmental adaptation. This suggests that the SMPs are selectively exported in a complex mix to endow the shell with both mechanical protection and biochemical defense.</p>

Connecting the Sequence-Space of Bacterial Signaling Proteins to Phenotypes Using Coevolutionary Landscapes
<p>Two-component signaling (TCS) is the primary means by which bacteria sense and respond to the environment. TCS involves two partner proteins working in tandem, which interact to perform cellular functions whereas limiting interactions with non-partners (i.e., cross-talk). We construct a Potts model for TCS that can quantitatively predict how mutating amino acid identities affect the interaction between TCS partners and non-partners. The parameters of this model are inferred directly from protein sequence data. This approach drastically reduces the computational complexity of exploring the sequence-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">space</span></strong> of TCS proteins. As a stringent test, we compare its predictions to a recent comprehensive mutational study, which characterized the functionality of 20<sup>4</sup> mutational variants of the PhoQ kinase in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. We find that our best predictions accurately reproduce the amino acid combinations found in experiment, which enable functional signaling with its partner PhoP. These predictions demonstrate the evolutionary pressure to preserve the interaction between TCS partners as well as prevent unwanted cross-talk. Further, we calculate the mutational change in the binding affinity between PhoQ and PhoP, providing an estimate to the amount of destabilization needed to disrupt TCS.</p>

The Evolution of Innate Immune Genes: Purifying and Balancing Selection on β-Defensins in Waterfowl
<p>In disease dynamics, high immune gene diversity can confer a selective advantage to hosts in the face of a rapidly evolving and diverse pathogen fauna. This is supported empirically for genes involved in pathogen recognition and signalling. In contrast, effector genes involved in pathogen clearance may be more constrained. β-Defensins are innate immune effector genes; their main mode of action is via disruption of microbial membranes. Here, five β-defensin genes were characterized in mallards (<i>Anas platyrhynchos</i>) and other waterfowl; key reservoir species for many zoonotic diseases. All five genes showed remarkably low diversity at the individual-, population-, and species-level. Furthermore, there was widespread sharing of identical alleles across species divides. Thus, specific β-defensin alleles were maintained not only spatially but also over long temporal scales, with many amino acid residues being fixed across all species investigated. Purifying selection to maintain individual, highly efficacious alleles was the primary evolutionary driver of these genes in waterfowl. However, we also found evidence for balancing selection acting on the most recently duplicated β-defensin gene (<i>AvBD3b</i>). For this gene, we found that amino acid replacements were more likely to be radical changes, suggesting that duplication of β-defensin genes allows exploration of wider functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">space</span></strong>. Structural conservation to maintain function appears to be crucial for avian β-defensin effector molecules, resulting in low tolerance for new allelic variants. This contrasts with other types of innate immune genes, such as receptor and signalling molecules, where balancing selection to maintain allelic diversity has been shown to be a strong evolutionary force.</p>

Factors affecting the potential for posterior bony impingement after total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Our aim was to evaluate the radiographic characteristics of patients   undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA) for the potential of posterior   bony impingement using CT simulations.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Virtual CT data from 112 patients who underwent THA were analysed.   There were 40 men and 72 women. Their mean age was 59.1 years (41   to 76). Associations between radiographic characteristics and posterior   bony impingement and the range of external rotation of the hip were   evaluated. In addition, we investigated the effects of pelvic tilt   and the neck/shaft angle and femoral offset on posterior bony impingement.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The range of external rotation and the ischiofemoral length were   significantly lower, while femoral anteversion, the ischial ratio,   and ischial angle were significantly higher in patients with posterior   bony impingement compared with those who had implant impingement   (p < 0.05). The range of external rotation positively correlated   with ischiofemoral length (r = 0.49, p < 0.05), and negatively   correlated with ischial length (r = -0.49, p < 0.05), ischial   ratio (r =- 0.49, p < 0.05) and ischial angle (r = -0.55, p <   0.05). The range of external rotation was lower in patients with posterior   pelvic tilt (p < 0.05) and in those with a high offset femoral   component (p < 0.05) due to posterior bony impingement.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Posterior bony impingement after THA is more likely in patients   with a wider ischium and a narrow ischiofemoral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">space</span></strong>. A high femoral   offset and posterior pelvic tilt are also risk factors for this   type of impingement.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1140–6.</p></sec>

Knee joint distraction compared with total knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Knee joint distraction (KJD) is a relatively new, knee-joint   preserving procedure with the goal of delaying total knee arthroplasty   (TKA) in young and middle-aged patients. We present a randomised   controlled trial comparing the two.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The 60 patients ≤ 65 years with end-stage knee osteoarthritis   were randomised to either KJD (n = 20) or TKA (n = 40). Outcomes   were assessed at baseline, three, six, nine, and 12 months. In the   KJD group, the joint <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">space</span></strong> width (JSW) was radiologically assessed,   representing a surrogate marker of cartilage thickness.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In total 56 patients completed their allocated treatment (TKA   = 36, KJD = 20). All patient reported outcome measures improved   significantly over one year (p < 0.02) in both groups. At one   year, the TKA group showed a greater improvement in only one of   the 16 patient-related outcome measures assessed (p = 0.034). Outcome Measures   in Rheumatology-Osteoarthritis Research Society International clinical   response was 83% after TKA and 80% after KJD. A total of 12 patients   (60%) in the KJD group sustained pin track infections. In the KJD   group both mean minimum (0.9 mm, standard deviation (<sc>sd</sc>)   1.1) and mean JSW (1.2 mm, <sc>sd</sc> 1.1) increased significantly   (p = 0.004 and p = 0.0003).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In relatively young patients with end-stage knee osteoarthritis,   KJD did not demonstrate inferiority of outcomes at one year when   compared with TKA. However, there is a high incidence of pin track   infection associated with KJD.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:51–8.</p></sec>

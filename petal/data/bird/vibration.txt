p53 dynamics in response to DNA damage vary across cell lines and are shaped by efficiency of DNA repair and activity of the kinase ATM
<p>Cellular systems show a wide range of signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics. Many of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics are highly stereotyped, such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lations at a fixed frequency. However, most studies looking at the role of signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics focus on one or a few cell lines, leaving the diversity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics across tissues or cell lines a largely unexplored question. We focused on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics of the tumor suppressor protein p53, which regulates cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to DNA damage. We established live-cell reporters for 12 cancer cell lines expressing wild-type p53 and quantified p53 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics in response to double-strand break–inducing DNA damage. In many of the tested cell lines, we found that p53 abundance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lated in response to ionizing radiation or the DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic neocarzinostatin and that the periodicity of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lations was fixed. In other cell lines, p53 abundance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ically changed in different ways, such as a single broad pulse or a continuous induction. By combining single-cell assays of p53 signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics, small-molecule screening in live cells, and mathematical modeling, we identified molecules that perturbed p53 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics and determined that cell-specific variation in the efficiency of DNA repair and the activity of the kinase ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) controlled the signaling landscape of p53 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics. Because the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics of wild-type p53 varied substantially between cell lines, our study highlights the limitation of using one line as a model system and emphasizes the importance of studying the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics of other signaling pathways across different cell lines and genetic backgrounds.</p>

Attosecond dynamics through a Fano resonance: Monitoring the birth of a photoelectron
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics of quantum systems are encoded in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplitud</span></strong>e and phase of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> packets. However, the rapidity of electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics on the attosecond scale has precluded the complete characterization of electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> packets in the time domain. Using spectrally resolved electron interferometry, we were able to measure the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplitud</span></strong>e and phase of a photoelectron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> packet created through a Fano autoionizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ance in helium. In our setup, replicas obtained by two-photon transitions interfere with reference <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> packets that are formed through smooth continua, allowing the full temporal reconstruction, purely from experimental data, of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> packet released in the continuum. In turn, this resolves the buildup of the autoionizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ance on an attosecond time scale. Our results, in excellent agreement with ab initio time-dependent calculations, raise prospects for detailed investigations of ultrafast photoemission <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics governed by electron correlation, as well as coherent control over structured electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> packets.</p>

Quantum oscillations of electrical resistivity in an insulator
<p>In metals, orbital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong>s of conduction electrons on the Fermi surface are quantized in magnetic fields, which is manifested by quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lations in electrical resistivity. This Landau quantization is generally absent in insulators. Here, we report a notable exception in an insulator—ytterbium dodecaboride (YbB<sub>12</sub>). The resistivity of YbB<sub>12</sub>, which is of a much larger magnitude than the resistivity in metals, exhibits distinct quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lations. These unconventional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lations arise from the insulating bulk, even though the temperature dependence of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplitud</span></strong>e follows the conventional Fermi liquid theory of metals with a large effective mass. Quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lations in the magnetic torque are also observed, albeit with a lighter effective mass.</p>

<i>CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1</i> (<i>CCA1</i>) and the Circadian Control of Stomatal Aperture
<p>The endogenous circadian (∼24 h) system allows plants to anticipate and adapt to daily environmental changes. Stomatal aperture is one of the many processes under circadian control; stomatal opening and closing occurs under constant conditions, even in the absence of environmental cues. To understand the significance of circadian-mediated anticipation in stomatal opening, we have generated <i>SGC</i> (specifically guard cell) Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants in which the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lator gene <i>CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1</i> (<i>CCA1</i>) was overexpressed under the control of the guard-cell-specific promoter, <i>GC1.</i> The <i>SGC</i> plants showed a loss of ability to open stomata in anticipation of daily dark-to-light changes and of circadian-mediated stomatal opening in constant light. We observed that under fully watered and mild drought conditions, <i>SGC</i> plants outperform wild type with larger leaf area and biomass. To investigate the molecular basis for circadian control of guard cell aperture, we used large-scale qRT-PCR to compare circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lator gene expression in guard cells compared with the “average” whole-leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lator and examined gene expression and stomatal aperture in several lines of plants with misexpressed <i>CCA1</i>. Our results show that the guard cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lator is different from the average plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lator. Moreover, the differences in guard cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lator function may be important for the correct regulation of photoperiod pathway genes that have previously been reported to control stomatal aperture. We conclude by showing that CONSTANS and FLOWERING LOCUS T, components of the photoperiod pathway that regulate flowering time, also control stomatal aperture in a daylength-dependent manner.</p>

BIG Regulates Dynamic Adjustment of Circadian Period in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>Circadian clocks drive rhythms with a period near 24 h, but the molecular basis of the regulation of the period of the circadian clockis poorly understood. We previously demonstrated that metabolites affect the free-running period of the circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lator of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), with endogenous sugars acting as an accelerator and exogenous nicotinamide acting as a brake. Changes in circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lator period are thought to adjust the timing of biological activities through the process of entrainment, in which the circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lator becomes synchronized to rhythmic signals such as light and dark cycles as well as changes in internal metabolism. To identify the molecular components associated with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic adjustment of circadian period, we performed a forward genetic screen. We identified Arabidopsis mutants that were either period insensitive to nicotinamide (<i>sin</i>) or period oversensitive to nicotinamide (<i>son</i>). We mapped <i>son1</i> to <i>BIG</i>, a gene of unknown molecular function that was shown previously to play a role in light signaling. We found that <i>son1</i> has an early entrained phase, suggesting that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic alteration of circadian period contributes to the correct timing of biological events. Our data provide insight into how the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic period adjustment of circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lators contributes to establishing a correct phase relationship with the environment and show that BIG is involved in this process.</p>

Spectacular Oscillations in Plant Isoprene Emission under Transient Conditions Explain the Enigmatic CO<sub>2</sub> Response<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plant isoprene emissions respond to light and temperature similarly to photosynthesis, but CO<sub>2</sub> dependencies of isoprene emission and photosynthesis are profoundly different, with photosynthesis increasing and isoprene emission decreasing with increasing CO<sub>2</sub> concentration due to reasons not yet understood. We studied isoprene emission, net assimilation rate, and chlorophyll fluorescence under different CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the strong isoprene emitter hybrid aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus tremuloides</i>), and used rapid changes in ambient CO<sub>2</sub> or O<sub>2</sub> concentrations or light level to induce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lations. As isoprene-emitting species support very high steady-state chloroplastic pool sizes of the primary isoprene substrate, dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMADP), which can mask the effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>latory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics on isoprene emission, the size of the DMADP pool was experimentally reduced by either partial inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis pathway by fosmidomycin-feeding or by changes in ambient gas concentrations leading to DMADP pool depletion in intact leaves. In feedback-limited conditions observed at low O<sub>2</sub> and/or high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration under which the rate of photosynthesis is governed by the limited rate of ATP and NADPH formation due to low chloroplastic phosphate levels, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lations in photosynthesis and isoprene emission were repeatedly induced by rapid environmental modifications in both partly fosmidomycin-inhibited leaves and in intact leaves with in vivo reduced DMADP pools. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lations in net assimilation rate and isoprene emission in feedback-inhibited leaves were in the same phase, and relative changes in the pools of photosynthetic metabolites and DMADP estimated by in vivo kinetic methods were directly proportional through all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lations induced by different environmental perturbations. We conclude that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lations in isoprene emission provide direct experimental evidence demonstrating that the response of isoprene emission to changes in ambient gas concentrations is controlled by the chloroplastic reductant supply.</p>

Spectral narrowing of x-ray pulses for precision spectroscopy with nuclear resonances
<p>Spectroscopy of nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ances offers a wide range of applications due to the remarkable energy resolution afforded by their narrow linewidths. However, progress toward higher resolution is inhibited at modern x-ray sources because they deliver only a tiny fraction of the photons on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ance, with the remainder contributing to an off-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ant background. We devised an experimental setup that uses the fast mechanical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ant target to manipulate the spectrum of a given x-ray pulse and to redistribute off-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ant spectral intensity onto the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ance. As a consequence, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ant pulse brilliance is increased while the off-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ant background is reduced. Because our method is compatible with existing and upcoming pulsed x-ray sources, we anticipate that this approach will find applications that require ultranarrow x-ray <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ances.</p>

Exotic states in a simple network of nanoelectromechanical oscillators
<p>Synchronization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lators, a phenomenon found in a wide variety of natural and engineered systems, is typically understood through a reduction to a first-order phase model with simplified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics. Here, by exploiting the precision and flexibility of nanoelectromechanical systems, we examined the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics of a ring of quasi-sinusoidal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lators at and beyond first order. Beyond first order, we found exotic states of synchronization with highly complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics, including weak chimeras, decoupled states, traveling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s, and inhomogeneous synchronized states. Through theory and experiment, we show that these exotic states rely on complex interactions emerging out of networks with simple linear nearest-neighbor coupling. This work provides insight into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ical richness of complex systems with weak nonlinearities and local interactions.</p>

Direct measurements of two-way wave-particle energy transfer in a collisionless space plasma
<p>Particle acceleration by plasma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s and spontaneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> generation are fundamental energy and momentum exchange processes in collisionless plasmas. Such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>-particle interactions occur ubiquitously in space. We present ultrafast measurements in Earth’s magnetosphere by the Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft that enabled quantitative evaluation of energy transfer in interactions associated with electromagnetic ion cyclotron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s. The observed ion distributions are not symmetric around the magnetic field direction but are in phase with the plasma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> fields. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>-ion phase relations demonstrate that a cyclotron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ance transferred energy from hot protons to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s, which in turn non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>antly accelerated cold He<sup>+</sup> to energies up to ~2 kilo–electron volts. These observations provide direct quantitative evidence for collisionless energy transfer in plasmas between distinct particle populations via <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>-particle interactions.</p>

A silicon Brillouin laser
<p>Brillouin laser <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lators offer powerful and flexible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics as the basis for mode-locked lasers, micro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lators, and optical gyroscopes in a variety of optical systems. However, Brillouin interactions are markedly weak in conventional silicon photonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>guides, stifling progress toward silicon-based Brillouin lasers. The recent advent of hybrid photonic-phononic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>guides has revealed Brillouin interactions to be one of the strongest and most tailorable nonlinearities in silicon. In this study, we have harnessed these engineered nonlinearities to demonstrate Brillouin lasing in silicon. Moreover, we show that this silicon-based Brillouin laser enters a regime of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics in which optical self-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lation produces phonon linewidth narrowing.

Enzyme-free nucleic acid dynamical systems

Tailored semiconductors for high-harmonic optoelectronics

Sucrose and Ethylene Signaling Interact to Modulate the Circadian Clock
<p>Circadian clocks drive rhythmic physiology and metabolism to optimize plant growth and performance under daily environmental fluctuations caused by the rotation of the planet. Photosynthesis is a key metabolic process that must be appropriately timed to the light-dark cycle. The circadian clock contributes to the regulation of photosynthesis, and in turn the daily accumulation of sugars from photosynthesis also feeds back to regulate the circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lator. We have previously shown that <i>GIGANTEA</i> (<i>GI</i>) is required to sustain Suc-dependent circadian rhythms in darkness. The mechanism by which Suc affects the circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lator in a <i>GI</i>-dependent manner was unknown. Here, we identify that Suc sustains rhythms in the dark by stabilizing GI protein, dependent on the F-box protein <i>ZEITLUPE</i>, and implicate <i>CONSTITUTIVE TRIPLE RESPONSE1</i> (<i>CTR1</i>), a negative regulator of ethylene signaling. Our identification of a role for CTR1 in the response to Suc prompted a reinvestigation of the effects of ethylene on the circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lator. We demonstrate that ethylene shortens the circadian period, conditional on the effects of Suc and requiring <i>GI</i>. These findings reveal that Suc affects the stability of circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lator proteins and can mask the effects of ethylene on the circadian system, identifying novel molecular pathways for input of sugar to the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) circadian network.</p>

Intertidal sea stars (<i>Pisaster ochraceus</i>) alter body shape in response to wave action
<p>Sea stars are some of the largest mobile animals able to live in the harsh flow environment of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>-exposed, rocky intertidal shores. In addition, some species, such as the northeastern Pacific <i>Pisaster ochraceus</i>, are ecologically significant predators in a broad range of environments, from sheltered lagoons to the most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>-exposed shorelines. How they function and survive under such an extreme range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> exposures remains a puzzle. Here we examine the ability of <i>P. ochraceus</i> to alter body form in response to variation in flow conditions. We found that sea stars in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>-exposed sites had narrower arms and were lighter per unit arm length than those from sheltered sites. Body form was tightly correlated with maximum velocity of breaking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s across four sites and also varied over time. In addition, field transplant experiments showed that these differences in shape were due primarily to phenotypic plasticity. Sea stars transplanted from a sheltered site to a more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>-exposed site became lighter per unit arm length, and developed narrower arms, after 3 months. The tight correlation between water flow and morphology suggests that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> force must be a significant selective factor acting on body shape. On exposed shores, narrower arms probably reduce both lift and drag in breaking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s. On protected shores, fatter arms may provide more thermal inertia to resist overheating, or more body volume for gametes. Such plastic changes in body shape represent a unique method by which sea stars adapt to spatial, seasonal and possibly short-term variation in flow conditions.</p>

Anti–parity-time symmetry in diffusive systems
<p>Various concepts related to parity-time symmetry, including anti–parity-time symmetry, have found broad applications in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> physics. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> systems are fundamentally described by Hermitian operators, whereas their unusual properties are introduced by incorporation of gain and loss. We propose that the related physics need not be restricted to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics, and we consider systems described by diffusive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics. We study the heat transfer in two countermoving media and show that this system exhibits anti–parity-time symmetry. The spontaneous symmetry breaking results in a phase transition from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong>less temperature profiles, despite the mechanical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> of the background, to moving temperature profiles.

Shear properties of Earth’s inner core constrained by a detection of <i>J</i> waves in global correlation wavefield
<p>Seismic <i>J</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s, shear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s that traverse Earth’s inner core, provide direct constraints on the inner core’s solidity and shear properties. However, these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s have been elusive in the direct seismic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>field because of their small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplitud</span></strong>es. We devised a new method to detect <i>J</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s in the earthquake coda correlation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>field. They manifest through the similarity with other compressional core-sensitive signals.

The values are 2.5% lower than the widely used Preliminary Earth Reference Model. This provides new constraints on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ical interpretation of Earth’s inner core.</p>

From oncogenic mutation to dynamic code
<p>Signal transduction pathways (STPs) convert biochemical reactions into precise and reproducible biological outcomes. These functions are performed reliably and reproducibly against a background of noise (variation) arising from the stochastic nature of biochemical reactions (<i>1</i>). Indeed, information theory analysis of STPs indicates that they have a limited capacity to discriminate information, including different ligands or different activation states of components (<i>2</i>). However, this discrimination is dramatically enhanced by adding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic information, such as signal rise time, signal duration, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplitud</span></strong>e, and decay rate (<i>3</i>). The observation that differential activation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway can determine whether rat pheochromocytoma cells proliferate or differentiate was reported more than 20 years ago (<i>4</i>), and evidence has since accumulated that STP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics control cell fate decisions. However, we are still struggling to understand how signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics is encoded and decoded and how pathological changes, such as the expression of mutant proteins, affect the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic STP code.

Hippocampal ripples down-regulate synapses
<p>The specific effects of sleep on synaptic plasticity remain unclear. We report that mouse hippocampal sharp-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> ripple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lations serve as intrinsic events that trigger long-lasting synaptic depression. Silencing of sharp-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> ripples during slow-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> states prevented the spontaneous down-regulation of net synaptic weights and impaired the learning of new memories. The synaptic down-regulation was dependent on the <i>N</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate receptor and selective for a specific input pathway. Thus, our findings are consistent with the role of slow-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> states in refining memory engrams by reducing recent memory-irrelevant neuronal activity and suggest a previously unrecognized function for sharp-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> ripples.</p>

Calibrated mitotic oscillator drives motile ciliogenesis
<p>Cell division and differentiation depend on massive and rapid organelle remodeling. The mitotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lator, centered on the cyclin-dependent kinase 1–anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (CDK1-APC/C) axis, spatiotemporally coordinates this reorganization in dividing cells. Here we discovered that nondividing cells could also implement this mitotic clocklike regulatory circuit to orchestrate subcellular reorganization associated with differentiation. We probed centriole amplification in differentiating mouse-brain multiciliated cells. These postmitotic progenitors fine-tuned mitotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lator activity to drive the orderly progression of centriole production, maturation, and motile ciliation while avoiding the mitosis commitment threshold. Insufficient CDK1 activity hindered differentiation, whereas excessive activity accelerated differentiation yet drove postmitotic progenitors into mitosis. Thus, postmitotic cells can redeploy and calibrate the mitotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lator to uncouple cytoplasmic from nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics for organelle remodeling associated with differentiation.</p>

High-temperature quantum oscillations caused by recurring Bloch states in graphene superlattices
<p>Cyclotron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> of charge carriers in metals and semiconductors leads to Landau quantization and magneto-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>latory behavior in their properties. Cryogenic temperatures are usually required to observe these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lations. We show that graphene superlattices support a different type of quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lation that does not rely on Landau quantization. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lations are extremely robust and persist well above room temperature in magnetic fields of only a few tesla. We attribute this phenomenon to repetitive changes in the electronic structure of superlattices such that charge carriers experience effectively no magnetic field at simple fractions of the flux quantum per superlattice unit cell. Our work hints at unexplored physics in Hofstadter butterfly systems at high temperatures.</p>

Genetics of Variable Disease Expression Conferred by Inverse Gene-For-Gene Interactions in the Wheat-<i>Parastagonospora nodorum</i> Pathosystem
<p>The wheat-<i>Parastagonospora nodorum</i> pathosystem involves the recognition of pathogen-secreted necrotrophic effectors (NEs) by corresponding wheat NE sensitivity genes. This inverse gene-for-gene recognition leads to necrotrophic effector-triggered susceptibility and ultimately septoria nodorum blotch disease. Here, we used multiple pathogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isol</span></strong>ates to individually evaluate the effects of the host gene-NE interactions <i>Tan spot necrosis1</i>-Stagonospora nodorum ToxinA (<i>Tsn1</i>-SnToxA), <i>Stagonospora nodorum necrosis1</i>-Stagonospora nodorum Toxin1 (<i>Snn1</i>-SnTox1), and <i>Stagonospora nodorum necrosis3-B genome homeolog1</i>-Stagonospora nodorum Toxin3 (<i>Snn3-B1</i>-SnTox3), alone and in various combinations, to determine the relative importance of these interactions in causing disease. Genetic analysis of a recombinant inbred wheat population inoculated separately with three <i>P. nodorum</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isol</span></strong>ates, all of which produce all three NEs, indicated that the <i>Tsn1</i>-SnToxA and <i>Snn3-B1</i>-SnTox3 interactions contributed to disease caused by all four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isol</span></strong>ates, but their effects varied and ranged from epistatic to additive. The <i>Snn1</i>-SnTox1 interaction was associated with increased disease for one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isol</span></strong>ate, but for other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isol</span></strong>ates, there was evidence that this interaction inhibited the expression of other host gene-NE interactions. RNA sequencing analysis in planta showed that <i>SnTox1</i> was differentially expressed between these three <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isol</span></strong>ates after infection. Further analysis of NE gene-knockout <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isol</span></strong>ates showed that the effect of some interactions could be masked or inhibited by other compatible interactions, and the regulation of this occurs at the level of NE gene transcription. Collectively, these results show that the inverse gene-for-gene interactions leading to necrotrophic effector-triggered susceptibility in the wheat-<i>P. nodorum</i> pathosystem vary in their effects depending on the genetic backgrounds of the pathogen and host, and interplay among the interactions is complex and intricately regulated.</p>

Anterior lateral line nerve encoding to tones and play-back vocalisations in free-swimming oyster toadfish, <i>Opsanus tau</i>
<p>In the underwater environment, sound propagates both as a pressure <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> and as particle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong>, with particle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> dominating close to the source. At the receptor level, the fish ear and the neuromast hair cells act as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">displac</span></strong>ement detectors, and both are potentially stimulated by the particle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> component of sound. The encoding of the anterior lateral line nerve to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acoust</span></strong>ic stimuli in freely behaving oyster toadfish, <i>Opsanus tau</i>, was examined. Nerve sensitivity and directional responses were determined using spike rate and vector strength analysis, a measure of phase-locking of spike times to the stimulus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>form. All units showed greatest sensitivity to 100 Hz stimulus. While sensitivity was independent of stimuli orientation, the neuron's ability to phase-lock was correlated with stimuli origin. Two different types of units were classified, type 1 (tonic), and type 2 (phasic). The type 1 fibres were further classified into two sub-types based on their frequency response (type 1–1 and type 1–2), which was hypothesised to be related to canal (type 1–1) and superficial (type 1–2) neuromast innervation. Lateral line units also exhibited sensitivity and phase locking to boatwhistle vocalisations, with greatest spike rates exhibited at the onset of the call. These results provide direct evidence that oyster toadfish can use their lateral line to detect behaviourally relevant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acoust</span></strong>ic stimuli, which could provide a sensory pathway to aid in sound source localisation.</p>

Magnetic field–induced pair density wave state in the cuprate vortex halo

Although routinely labeled a charge density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> (CDW), this DW state could actually be an electron-pair density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> (PDW).

Apoptosis propagates through the cytoplasm as trigger waves
<p>Apoptosis is an evolutionarily conserved form of programmed cell death critical for development and tissue homeostasis in animals. The apoptotic control network includes several positive feedback loops that may allow apoptosis to spread through the cytoplasm in self-regenerating trigger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s. We tested this possibility in cell-free <i>Xenopus laevis</i> egg extracts and observed apoptotic trigger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s with speeds of ~30 micrometers per minute. Fractionation and inhibitor studies implicated multiple feedback loops in generating the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s. Apoptotic oocytes and eggs exhibited surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s with speeds of ~30 micrometers per minute, which were tightly correlated with caspase activation. Thus, apoptosis spreads through trigger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s in both extracts and intact cells. Our findings show how apoptosis can spread over large distances within a cell and emphasize the general importance of trigger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s in cell signaling.</p>

Torsional instability in the single-chain limit of a transition metal trichalcogenide

Improving mechanical sensor performance through larger damping
<p>Mechanical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ances are used in a wide variety of devices, from smartphone accelerometers to computer clocks and from wireless filters to atomic force microscopes. Frequency stability, a critical performance metric, is generally assumed to be tantamount to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ance quality factor (the inverse of the linewidth and of the damping). We show that the frequency stability of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ant nanomechanical sensors can be improved by lowering the quality factor. At high bandwidths, quality-factor reduction is completely mitigated by increases in signal-to-noise ratio. At low bandwidths, notably, increased damping leads to better stability and sensor resolution, with improvement proportional to damping. We confirm the findings by demonstrating temperature resolution of 60 microkelvin at 300-hertz bandwidth. These results open the door to high-performance ultrasensitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ators in gaseous or liquid environments, single-cell nanocalorimetry, nanoscale gas chromatography, atmospheric-pressure nanoscale mass spectrometry, and new approaches in crystal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lator stability.</p>

Topological origin of equatorial waves

Quantum correlations from a room-temperature optomechanical cavity

Breaking Lorentz reciprocity to overcome the time-bandwidth limit in physics and engineering

This law severely limits the generic capabilities of all types of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ant and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>-guiding systems in photonics, cavity quantum electro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics and optomechanics, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acoust</span></strong>ics, continuum mechanics, and atomic and optical physics but is thought to be completely fundamental, arising from basic Fourier reciprocity. We propose that this “fundamental” limit can be overcome in systems where Lorentz reciprocity is broken. As a system becomes more asymmetric in its transport properties, the degree to which the limit can be surpassed becomes greater. By way of example, we theoretically demonstrate how, in an astutely designed magnetized semiconductor heterostructure, the above limit can be exceeded by orders of magnitude by using realistic material parameters. Our findings revise prevailing paradigms for linear, time-invariant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ant systems, challenging the doctrine that high-quality <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ances must invariably be narrowband and providing the possibility of developing devices with unprecedentedly high time-bandwidth performance.</p>

The Microtubule-Associated Protein IQ67 DOMAIN5 Modulates Microtubule Dynamics and Pavement Cell Shape
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic arrangement of cortical microtubules (MTs) plays a pivotal role in controlling cell growth and shape formation in plants, but the mechanisms by which cortical MTs are organized to regulate these processes are not well characterized. In particular, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic behavior of cortical MTs is critical for their spatial organization, yet the molecular mechanisms controlling MT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics remain poorly understood. In this study, we used the puzzle piece-shaped pavement cells of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves as a model system in which to study cortical MT organization. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isol</span></strong>ated an ethyl methanesulfonate mutant with reduced interdigitation of pavement cells in cotyledons. This line carried a mutation in <i>IQ67 DOMAIN5</i> (<i>IQD5</i>), which encodes a member of the plant-specific IQ motif protein family. Live-cell imaging and biochemical analyses demonstrated that IQD5 binds to MTs and promotes MT assembly. MT-depolymerizing drug treatment and in vivo MT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics assays suggested that IQD5 functions to stabilize MTs. Hence, our findings provide genetic, cell biological, and biochemical evidence that IQD5 regulates MT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics that affect MT organization and subsequent cell shape formation.</p>

Importance of Fluctuations in Light on Plant Photosynthetic Acclimation
<p>The acclimation of plants to light has been studied extensively, yet little is known about the effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic fluctuations in light on plant phenotype and acclimatory responses. We mimicked natural fluctuations in light over a diurnal period to examine the effect on the photosynthetic processes and growth of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). High and low light intensities, delivered via a realistic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic fluctuating or square <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> pattern, were used to grow and assess plants. Plants subjected to square <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> light had thicker leaves and greater photosynthetic capacity compared with fluctuating light-grown plants. This, together with elevated levels of proteins associated with electron transport, indicates greater investment in leaf structural components and photosynthetic processes. In contrast, plants grown under fluctuating light had thinner leaves, lower leaf light absorption, but maintained similar photosynthetic rates per unit leaf area to square <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>-grown plants. Despite high light use efficiency, plants grown under fluctuating light had a slow growth rate early in development, likely due to the fact that plants grown under fluctuating conditions were not able to fully utilize the light energy absorbed for carbon fixation. Diurnal leaf-level measurements revealed a negative feedback control of photosynthesis, resulting in a decrease in total diurnal carbon assimilated of at least 20%. These findings highlight that growing plants under square <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> growth conditions ultimately fails to predict plant performance under realistic light regimes and stress the importance of considering fluctuations in incident light in future experiments that aim to infer plant productivity under natural conditions in the field.</p>

NF-κB signaling dynamics is controlled by a dose-sensing autoregulatory loop
<p>Over the last decade, multiple studies have shown that signaling proteins activated in different temporal patterns, such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>latory, transient, and sustained, can result in distinct gene expression patterns or cell fates. However, the molecular events that ensure appropriate stimulus- and dose-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics are not often understood and are difficult to investigate. Here, we used single-cell analysis to dissect the mechanisms underlying the stimulus- and dose-encoding patterns in the innate immune signaling network. We found that Toll-like receptor (TLR) and interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics relied on a dose-dependent, autoinhibitory loop that rendered cells refractory to further stimulation. Using inducible gene expression and optogenetics to perturb the network at different levels, we identified IL-1R–associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) as the dose-sensing node responsible for limiting signal flow during the innate immune response. Although the kinase activity of IRAK1 was not required for signal propagation, it played a critical role in inhibiting the nucleocytoplasmic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lations of the transcription factor NF-κB. Thus, protein activities that may be “dispensable” from a topological perspective can nevertheless be essential in shaping the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic response to the external environment.</p>

However, the establishment and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics of closed regions of chromatin at protein-coding genes, in embryologic development, remain elusive. We developed an antibody-independent method to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isol</span></strong>ate and map <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong>ed heterochromatin from low–cell number samples. We discovered high levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong>ed heterochromatin, H3K9me3-decorated, at protein-coding genes in early, uncommitted cells at the germ-layer stage, undergoing profound rearrangements and reduction upon differentiation, concomitant with cell type–specific gene expression. Perturbation of the three H3K9me3-related methyltransferases revealed a pivotal role for H3K9me3 heterochromatin during lineage commitment at the onset of organogenesis and for lineage fidelity maintenance.</p>

Observation of magnetically tunable Feshbach resonances in ultracold <sup>23</sup>Na<sup>40</sup>K + <sup>40</sup>K collisions
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ances in ultracold collisions involving heavy molecules are difficult to simulate theoretically and have proven challenging to detect. Here we report the observation of magnetically tunable Feshbach <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ances in ultracold collisions between potassium-40 (<sup>40</sup>K) atoms and sodium-23–potassium-40 (<sup>23</sup>Na<sup>40</sup>K) molecules in the rovibrational ground state. We prepare the atoms and molecules in various hyperfine levels of their ground states and observe the loss of molecules as a function of the magnetic field. The atom-molecule Feshbach <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ances are identified by observing an enhancement of the loss. We have observed 11 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ances in the magnetic field range of 43 to 120 gauss. The observed atom-molecule Feshbach <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ances at ultralow temperatures probe the three-body potential energy surface with exceptional resolution and will help to improve understanding of ultracold collisions.</p>

Imaging CF<sub>3</sub>I conical intersection and photodissociation dynamics with ultrafast electron diffraction
<p>Conical intersections play a critical role in excited-state <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics of polyatomic molecules because they govern the reaction pathways of many nonadiabatic processes. However, ultrafast probes have lacked sufficient spatial resolution to image <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>-packet trajectories through these intersections directly. Here, we present the simultaneous experimental characterization of one-photon and two-photon excitation channels in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isol</span></strong>ated CF<sub>3</sub>I molecules using ultrafast gas-phase electron diffraction. In the two-photon channel, we have mapped out the real-space trajectories of a coherent nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> packet, which bifurcates onto two potential energy surfaces when passing through a conical intersection. In the one-photon channel, we have resolved excitation of both the umbrella and the breathing vibrational modes in the CF<sub>3</sub> fragment in multiple nuclear dimensions. These findings benchmark and validate ab initio nonadiabatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics calculations.</p>

Electromagnetic evidence that SSS17a is the result of a binary neutron star merger
<p>Eleven hours after the detection of gravitational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> source GW170817 by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> Observatory and Virgo Interferometers, an associated optical transient, SSS17a, was identified in the galaxy NGC 4993. Although the gravitational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> data indicate that GW170817 is consistent with the merger of two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong> objects, the electromagnetic observations provide independent constraints on the nature of that system. We synthesize the optical to near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy of SSS17a collected by the One-Meter Two-Hemisphere collaboration, finding that SSS17a is unlike other known transients. The source is best described by theoretical models of a kilonova consisting of radioactive elements produced by rapid neutron capture (the r-process). We conclude that SSS17a was the result of a binary neutron star merger, reinforcing the gravitational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> result.</p>

The intestinal microbiota regulates body composition through NFIL<bold>3</bold> and the circadian clock
<p>The intestinal microbiota has been identified as an environmental factor that markedly affects energy storage and body-fat accumulation in mammals, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we show that the microbiota regulates body composition through the circadian transcription factor NFIL3. <i>Nfil3</i> transcription <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lates diurnally in intestinal epithelial cells, and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplitud</span></strong>e of the circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lation is controlled by the microbiota through group 3 innate lymphoid cells, STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3), and the epithelial cell circadian clock. NFIL3 controls expression of a circadian lipid metabolic program and regulates lipid absorption and export in intestinal epithelial cells. These findings provide mechanistic insight into how the intestinal microbiota regulates body composition and establish NFIL3 as an essential molecular link among the microbiota, the circadian clock, and host metabolism.</p>

Optical imaging of surface chemistry and dynamics in confinement

The second <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harmon</span></strong>ic images reported on the orientational order of interfacial water, induced by charge-dipole interactions between water molecules and surface charges. The images were converted into surface potential maps. Spatially resolved surface acid dissociation constant (p<i>K</i><sub>a,s</sub>) values were determined for the silica deprotonation reaction by following pH-induced chemical changes on the curved and confined surfaces of a glass microcapillary immersed in aqueous solutions. These values ranged from 2.3 to 10.7 along the wall of a single capillary because of surface heterogeneities. Water molecules that rotate along an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lating external electric field were also imaged.</p>

Coherent imaging of an attosecond electron wave packet
<p>Electrons detached from atoms or molecules by photoionization carry information about the quantum state from which they originate, as well as the continuum states into which they are released. Generally, the photoelectron momentum distribution is composed of a coherent sum of angular momentum components, each with an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplitud</span></strong>e and phase. Here we show, by using photoionization of neon, that a train of attosecond pulses synchronized with an infrared laser field can be used to disentangle these angular momentum components. Two-color, two-photon ionization via a Stark-shifted intermediate state creates an almost pure f-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> with a magnetic quantum number of zero. Interference of the f-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> with a spherically symmetric s-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> provides a holographic reference that enables phase-resolved imaging of the f-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>.</p>

Locked synchronous rotor motion in a molecular motor
<p>Biological molecular motors translate their local directional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> into ordered movement of other parts of the system to empower controlled mechanical functions. The design of analogous geared systems that couple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> in a directional manner, which is pivotal for molecular machinery operating at the nanoscale, remains highly challenging. Here, we report a molecular rotary motor that translates light-driven unidirectional rotary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> to controlled movement of a connected biaryl rotor. Achieving coupled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> of the distinct parts of this multicomponent mechanical system required precise control of multiple kinetic barriers for isomerization and synchronous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong>, resulting in sliding and rotation during a full rotary cycle, with the motor always facing the same face of the rotor.</p>

Bloch oscillations in the absence of a lattice
<p>The interplay of strong quantum correlations and far-from-equilibrium conditions can give rise to striking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ical phenomena. We experimentally investigated the quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> of an impurity atom immersed in a strongly interacting one-dimensional Bose liquid and subject to an external force. We found that the momentum distribution of the impurity exhibits characteristic Bragg reflections at the edge of an emergent Brillouin zone. Although Bragg reflections are typically associated with lattice structures, in our strongly correlated quantum liquid they result from the interplay of short-range crystalline order and kinematic constraints on the many-body scattering processes in the one-dimensional system. As a consequence, the impurity exhibits periodic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics, reminiscent of Bloch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lations, although the quantum liquid is translationally invariant.

High-harmonic generation in graphene enhanced by elliptically polarized light excitation
<p>The electronic properties of graphene can give rise to a range of nonlinear optical responses. One of the most desirable nonlinear optical processes is high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harmon</span></strong>ic generation (HHG) originating from coherent electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> induced by an intense light field. Here, we report on the observation of up to ninth-order <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harmon</span></strong>ics in graphene excited by mid-infrared laser pulses at room temperature. The HHG in graphene is enhanced by an elliptically polarized laser excitation, and the resultant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harmon</span></strong>ic radiation has a particular polarization. The observed ellipticity dependence is reproduced by a fully quantum mechanical treatment of HHG in solids. The zero-gap nature causes the unique properties of HHG in graphene, and our findings open up the possibility of investigating strong-field and ultrafast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics and nonlinear behavior of massless Dirac fermions.</p>

Coupling between distant biofilms and emergence of nutrient time-sharing
<p>Bacteria within communities can interact to organize their behavior. It has been unclear whether such interactions can extend beyond a single community to coordinate the behavior of distant populations. We discovered that two <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> biofilm communities undergoing metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lations can become coupled through electrical signaling and synchronize their growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics. Coupling increases competition by also synchronizing demand for limited nutrients. As predicted by mathematical modeling, we confirm that biofilms resolve this conflict by switching from in-phase to antiphase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lations. This results in time-sharing behavior, where each community takes turns consuming nutrients. Time-sharing enables biofilms to counterintuitively increase growth under reduced nutrient supply. Distant biofilms can thus coordinate their behavior to resolve nutrient competition through time-sharing, a strategy used in engineered systems to allocate limited resources.</p>

Large Cardiac Muscle Patches Engineered From Human Induced-Pluripotent Stem Cell–Derived Cardiac Cells Improve Recovery From Myocardial Infarction in Swine
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Here, we generated human cardiac muscle patches (hCMPs) of clinically relevant dimensions (4 cm × 2 cm × 1.25 mm) by suspending cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells that had been differentiated from human induced-pluripotent stem cells in a fibrin scaffold and then culturing the construct on a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic (rocking) platform.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In vitro assessments of hCMPs suggest maturation in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic culture stimulation. In vivo assessments were conducted in a porcine model of myocardial infarction (MI). Animal groups included: MI hearts treated with 2 hCMPs (MI+hCMP, n=13), MI hearts treated with 2 cell-free open fibrin patches (n=14), or MI hearts with neither experimental patch (n=15); a fourth group of animals underwent sham surgery (Sham, n=8). Cardiac function and infarct size were evaluated by MRI, arrhythmia incidence by implanted loop recorders, and the engraftment rate by calculation of quantitative polymerase chain reaction measurements of expression of the human Y chromosome. Additional studies examined the myocardial protein expression profile changes and potential mechanisms of action that related to exosomes from the cell patch.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The hCMPs began to beat synchronously within 1 day of fabrication, and after 7 days of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic culture stimulation, in vitro assessments indicated the mechanisms related to the improvements in electronic mechanical coupling, calcium-handling, and force generation, suggesting a maturation process during the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic culture. The engraftment rate was 10.9±1.8% at 4 weeks after the transplantation. The hCMP transplantation was associated with significant improvements in left ventricular function, infarct size, myocardial wall stress, myocardial hypertrophy, and reduced apoptosis in the periscar boarder zone myocardium. hCMP transplantation also reversed some MI-associated changes in sarcomeric regulatory protein phosphorylation. The exosomes released from the hCMP appeared to have cytoprotective properties that improved cardiomyocyte survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We have fabricated a clinically relevant size of hCMP with trilineage cardiac cells derived from human induced-pluripotent stem cells. The hCMP matures in vitro during 7 days of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic culture. Transplantation of this type of hCMP results in significantly reduced infarct size and improvements in cardiac function that are associated with reduction in left ventricular wall stress. The hCMP treatment is not associated with significant changes in arrhythmogenicity.</p></sec>

Exercise Dynamics in Secondary Mitral Regurgitation
<p>Secondary mitral valve regurgitation (MR) remains a challenging problem in the diagnostic workup and treatment of patients with heart failure. Although secondary MR is characteristically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic in nature and sensitive to changes in ventricular geometry and loading, current therapy is mainly focused on resting conditions. An exercise-induced increase in secondary MR, however, is associated with impaired exercise capacity and increased mortality. In an era where a multitude of percutaneous solutions are emerging for the treatment of patients with heart failure, it becomes important to address the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic component of secondary MR during exercise as well.

Monitoring and manipulating Higgs and Goldstone modes in a supersolid quantum gas
<p>Higgs and Goldstone modes are collective excitations of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplitud</span></strong>e and phase of an order parameter that is related to the breaking of a continuous symmetry. We directly studied these modes in a supersolid quantum gas created by coupling a Bose-Einstein condensate to two optical cavities, whose field <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplitud</span></strong>es form the real and imaginary parts of a U(1)-symmetric order parameter. Monitoring the cavity fields in real time allowed us to observe the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics of the associated Higgs and Goldstone modes and revealed their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplitud</span></strong>e and phase nature. We used a spectroscopic method to measure their frequencies, and we gave a tunable mass to the Goldstone mode by exploring the crossover between continuous and discrete symmetry. Our experiments link spectroscopic measurements to the theoretical concept of Higgs and Goldstone modes.</p>

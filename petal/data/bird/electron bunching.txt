Effect of source/sink ratios on yield components, growth dynamics and structural characteristics of oil palm (<i>Elaeis guineensis</i>) bunches
<p>Source/sink ratios are known to be one of the main determinants of oil palm growth and development. A long-term experiment (9 years) was conducted in Indonesia on mature oil palms subjected to continuous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bunch</span></strong> ablation and partial defoliation treatments to artificially modify source/sink ratios. During the experiment, all harvested <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bunch</span></strong>es were dissected and phenological measurements were carried out to analyse the effect of source/sink ratios on yield components explaining variations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bunch</span></strong> number, the number of fruits per <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bunch</span></strong> and oil dry weight per fruit. An integrative variable (supply/demand ratio) describing the ratio between the assimilate supply from sources and the growing organ demand for carbohydrate was computed for each plant on a daily basis from observations of the number of developing organs and their sink strength, and of climate variables. Defoliation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bunch</span></strong> ablation affected the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bunch</span></strong> number and the fruit number per <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bunch</span></strong>. Variations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bunch</span></strong> number per month were mainly due to variations in the fraction of aborted inflorescence and in the ratio between female and male inflorescences. Under fluctuating trophic conditions, variations in fruit number per <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bunch</span></strong> resulted both from changes in fruit-set and in the number of branches (rachillae) per inflorescence. For defoliated plants, the decrease in the number of developing reproductive sinks appeared to be sufficient to maintain fruit weight and oil concentration at the control level, without any major decrease in the concentration of non-structural carbohydrate reserves. Computation of the supply/demand ratio revealed that each yield component had a specific phase of sensitivity to supply/demand ratios during inflorescence development. Establishing quantitative relationships between supply/demand ratios, competition and yield components is the first step towards a functional model for oil palm.</p>

Observation of three-photon bound states in a quantum nonlinear medium
<p>Bound states of massive particles, such as nuclei, atoms, or molecules, constitute the bulk of the visible world around us. By contrast, photons typically only interact weakly. We report the observation of traveling three-photon bound states in a quantum nonlinear medium where the interactions between photons are mediated by atomic Rydberg states. Photon correlation and conditional phase measurements reveal the distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bunch</span></strong>ing and phase features associated with three-photon and two-photon bound states. Such photonic trimers and dimers possess shape-preserving wave functions that depend on the constituent photon number. The observed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bunch</span></strong>ing and strongly nonlinear optical phase are described by an effective field theory of Rydberg-induced photon-photon interactions. These observations demonstrate the ability to realize and control strongly interacting quantum many-body states of light.</p>

Rogue protein's partners offer hope in Parkinson's disease
<p>It has been 8 years since an astonishing observation persuaded many scientists that the misfolded protein implicated in Parkinson's disease spreads from brain cell to brain cell, like an infection. Last week, findings presented at the huge annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience further buttressed the theory that spread of the rogue protein, called α-synuclein, is responsible for the progressive disease, which is marked by tremor, stiff movements, depression, and, ultimately, dementia. Scientists at the San Diego, California, conference also described their discovery that an obscure protein carried on the cell membranes of neurons and other brain cells blocks the uptake of the α-synuclein into cells. Little is known about TM9SF2, but it is part of a family of proteins that span the cell membrane and indications are that it may work to transport specific molecules from the outside to the inside of the cell. It is made in abundance in the brain, especially in regions where damage to dopamine-producing neurons is known to give rise to Parkinson's. If it emerges that it is indeed a "<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catcher</span></strong>'s mitt" for α-synuclein, it could provide a drug target for a disease whose 10 million sufferers are sorely in need of new medicines. The same goes for another cell membrane protein, LAG-3, which is present in neurons and which was recently described in <i>Science </i>as binding tightly to the rogue Parkinson's protein.</p>

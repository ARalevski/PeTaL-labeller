The levels of vancomycin in the blood and the wound after the local treatment of bone and soft-tissue infection with antibiotic-loaded calcium sulphate as carrier material
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Calcium sulphate (CaSO<sub>4</sub>) is a resorbable material   that can be used simultaneously as filler of a dead space and as   a carrier for the local application of antibiotics. Our aim was   to describe the systemic exposure and the wound fluid concentrations   of vancomycin in patients treated with vancomycin-loaded CaSO<sub>4</sub> as   an adjunct to the routine therapy of bone and joint infections.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 680 post-operative blood and 233 wound fluid samples   were available for analysis from 94 implantations performed in 87   patients for various infective indications. Up to 6 g of vancomycin   were used. Non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis was performed   on the data from 37 patients treated for an infection of the hip.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The overall systemic exposure remained within a safe range, even   in patients with post-operative renal failure, none requiring removal   of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pellet</span></strong>s. Local concentrations were approximately ten times   higher than with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) as a carrier, but   remained below reported cell toxicity thresholds. Decreasing concentrations   in wound fluid were observed over several weeks, but remained above   the common minimum inhibitory concentrations for <i>Staphylococcus</i> up   to three months post-operatively. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study provides the first pharmacokinetic description of   the local application of vancomycin with CaSO<sub>4</sub> as a carrier,   documenting slow release, systemic safety and a release profile   far more interesting than from PMMA. In particular, considering <i>in   vitro</i> data, concentrations of vancomycin active against <i>staphylococca</i>l   biofilm were seen for several weeks.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1537â€“44.</p></sec>

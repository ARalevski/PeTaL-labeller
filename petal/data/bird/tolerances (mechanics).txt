Synovasure ‘quick test’ is not as accurate as the laboratory-based α-defensin immunoassay
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>α-defensin is a biomarker which has been described as having   a high degree of accuracy in the diagnosis of periprosthetic joint   infection (PJI). Current meta-analyses are based on the α-defensin   laboratory-based immunoassay rather than the quick on-table lateral   flow test kit. This study is the first meta-analysis to compare the   accuracy of the α-defensin laboratory-based immunoassay and the   lateral flow test kit for the diagnosis of PJI.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A systematic review was performed according to the Preferred   Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.   Inclusion criteria were all clinical studies where the diagnosis   of PJI was uncertain. All studies selected used the Musculoskeletal   Infection Society (MSIS) or modified MSIS criteria. Two independent   reviewers reviewed the studies and extracted data. A meta-analysis   of results was carried out: pooled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity, positive   and negative likelihood ratio, heterogeneity and areas under curves   are reported.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Ten studies (759 patients) were included. Of these, seven studies   (640 patients) evaluated the laboratory-based α-defensin immunoassay   and three (119 patients) the lateral flow test. The pooled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity   and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity of the qualitative α-defensin laboratory immunoassay   was 0.953 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87 to 0.984) and 0.965 (95%   CI 0.943 to 0.979) respectively. The pooled positive likelihood   ratio (PLR) and negative likelihood ratio (NLR) were 34.86 (95%   CI 19.34 to 62.85) and 0.02 (95% CI 0.00 to 0.11). The pooled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity   and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity of the lateral flow test were 0.774 (95% CI 0.637   to 0.870) and 0.913 (95% CI 0.828 to 0.958), respectively. The pooled   PLR and NLR were 8.675 (95% CI 4.229 to 17.794) and 0.248 (95% CI   0.147 to 0.418), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The pooled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity of the lateral flow test   were lower than those of the   α-defensin laboratory-based immunoassay test.

Submillihertz magnetic spectroscopy performed with a nanoscale quantum sensor
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precis</span></strong>e timekeeping is critical to metrology, forming the basis by which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>s of time, length, and fundamental constants are determined. Stable clocks are particularly valuable in spectroscopy because they define the ultimate frequency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precis</span></strong>ion that can be reached. In quantum metrology, the qubit coherence time defines the clock <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity, from which the spectral linewidth and frequency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precis</span></strong>ion are determined. We demonstrate a quantum sensing protocol in which the spectral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precis</span></strong>ion goes beyond the sensor coherence time and is limited by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity of a classical clock. Using this technique, we observed a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precis</span></strong>ion in frequency estimation scaling in time <i>T</i> as <i>T</i><sup>–3/2</sup> for classical oscillating fields. The narrow linewidth magnetometer based on single spins in diamond is used to sense nanoscale magnetic fields with an intrinsic frequency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion of 607 microhertz, which is eight orders of magnitude narrower than the qubit coherence time.</p>

Randomized Comparisons of Double-Dose Clopidogrel or Adjunctive Cilostazol Versus Standard Dual Antiplatelet in Patients With High Posttreatment Platelet Reactivity
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention react differently to antiplatelet drugs. Those with low responsiveness to clopidogrel have a higher risk of cardiac ischemic events. The goal of this study is to conduct a head-to-head comparison of the safety and effectiveness of intensified antiplatelet therapies (either double-dose clopidogrel [DOUBLE] or adjunctive cilostazol [TRIPLE]) and conventional strategy (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>) in patients after percutaneous coronary intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In this single-center, randomized, controlled trial, we used thromboelastography, a platelet function test, to select 1078 patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention at high thrombotic risk and compared the intensified antiplatelet therapies with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> antiplatelet therapy. The primary outcome was the incidence of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events at 18 months after percutaneous coronary intervention, defined as a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularization, or stroke. Bleeding Academic Research Consortium defined bleeding complications (types 1, 2, 3, or 5) were the safety end points.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The primary end point occurred in 52 patients (14.4%) in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> group, 38 patients (10.6%) in the DOUBLE group, and 30 patients (8.5%) in the TRIPLE group (hazard ratio, 0.720; 95% confidence interval, 0.474–1.094, DOUBLE versus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>; hazard ratio, 0.550; 95% confidence interval, 0.349–0.866, TRIPLE versus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>). No significant difference in the rates of major bleeding (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium grade≥3) was found in the DOUBLE group (3.34% versus 1.93% in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>, <i>P</i>=0.133) and the TRIPLE group (2.53% versus 1.93% in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>, <i>P</i>=0.240). The rate of Bleeding Academic Research Consortium–defined minor bleeding increased in the DOUBLE group (27.4% versus 20.3% in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>, <i>P</i>=0.031), but not in the TRIPLE group (23.6% versus 20.3% in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>, <i>P</i>=0.146).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In patients with low responsiveness to clopidogrel, as measured by thromboelastography, the intensified antiplatelet strategies with adjunctive use of cilostazol significantly improved the clinical outcomes without increasing the risk of major bleeding.

Fasting Versus Nonfasting and Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Accuracy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Recent recommendations favoring nonfasting lipid assessment may affect low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) estimation. The novel method of LDL-C estimation (LDL-C<sub>N</sub>) uses a flexible approach to derive patient-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic ratios of triglycerides to very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. This adaptability may confer an accuracy advantage in nonfasting patients over the fixed approach of the classic Friedewald method (LDL-C<sub>F</sub>).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used a US cross-sectional sample of 1 545  634 patients (959 153 fasting ≥10–12 hours; 586 481 nonfasting) from the second harvest of the Very Large Database of Lipids study to assess for the first time the impact of fasting status on novel LDL-C accuracy. Rapid ultracentrifugation was used to directly measure LDL-C content (LDL-C<sub>D</sub>). Accuracy was defined as the percentage of LDL-C<sub>D</sub> falling within an estimated LDL-C (LDL-C<sub>N</sub> or LDL-C<sub>F</sub>) category by clinical cut points. For low estimated LDL-C (<70 mg/dL), we evaluated accuracy by triglyceride levels. The magnitude of absolute and percent differences between LDL-C<sub>D</sub> and estimated LDL-C (LDL-C<sub>N</sub> or LDL-C<sub>F</sub>) was stratified by LDL-C and triglyceride categories.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In both fasting and nonfasting samples, accuracy was higher with the novel method across all clinical LDL-C categories (range, 87%–94%) compared with the Friedewald estimation (range, 71%–93%; <i>P</i>≤0.001). With LDL-C <70 mg/dL, nonfasting LDL-C<sub>N</sub> accuracy (92%) was superior to LDL-C<sub>F</sub> accuracy (71%; <i>P</i><0.001). In this LDL-C range, 19% of fasting and 30% of nonfasting patients had differences ≥10 mg/dL between LDL-C<sub>F</sub> and LDL-C<sub>D</sub>, whereas only 2% and 3% of patients, respectively, had similar differences with novel estimation. Accuracy of LDL-C <70 mg/dL further decreased as triglycerides increased, particularly for Friedewald estimation (range, 37%–96%) versus the novel method (range, 82%–94%). With triglycerides of 200 to 399 mg/dL in nonfasting patients, LDL-C<sub>N</sub> <70 mg/dL accuracy (82%) was superior to LDL-C<sub>F</sub> (37%; <i>P</i><0.001). In this triglyceride range, 73% of fasting and 81% of nonfasting patients had ≥10 mg/dL differences between LDL-C<sub>F</sub> and LDL-C<sub>D</sub> compared with 25% and 20% of patients, respectively, with LDL-C<sub>N</sub>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Novel adaptable LDL-C estimation performs better in nonfasting samples than the fixed Friedewald estimation, with a particular accuracy advantage in settings of low LDL-C and high triglycerides.

Atomic-resolution transmission electron microscopy of electron beam–sensitive crystalline materials
<p>High-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion imaging of electron beam–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive materials is one of the most difficult applications of transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The challenges are manifold, including the acquisition of images with extremely low beam doses, the time-constrained search for crystal zone axes, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precis</span></strong>e image alignment, and the accurate determination of the defocus value. We develop a suite of methods to fulfill these requirements and acquire atomic-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion TEM images of several metal organic frameworks that are generally recognized as highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive to electron beams. The high image <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">allow</span></strong>s us to identify individual metal atomic columns, various types of surface termination, and benzene rings in the organic linkers.

LTR_retriever: A Highly Accurate and Sensitive Program for Identification of Long Terminal Repeat Retrotransposons
<p>Long terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTR-RTs) are prevalent in plant genomes. The identification of LTR-RTs is critical for achieving high-quality gene annotation. Based on the well-conserved structure, multiple programs were developed for the de novo identification of LTR-RTs; however, these programs are associated with low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity and high false discovery rates. Here, we report LTR_retriever, a multithreading-empowered Perl program that identifies LTR-RTs and generates high-quality LTR libraries from genomic sequences. LTR_retriever demonstrated significant improvements by achieving high levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity (91%), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity (97%), accuracy (96%), and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precis</span></strong>ion (90%) in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). LTR_retriever is also compatible with long sequencing reads. With 40k self-corrected PacBio reads equivalent to 4.5× genome coverage in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the constructed LTR library showed excellent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity. In addition to canonical LTR-RTs with 5′-TG…CA-3′ termini, LTR_retriever also identifies noncanonical LTR-RTs (non-TGCA), which have been largely ignored in genome-wide studies. We identified seven types of noncanonical LTRs from 42 out of 50 plant genomes. The majority of noncanonical LTRs are <i>Copia</i> elements, with which the LTR is four times shorter than that of other <i>Copia</i> elements, which may be a result of their target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity. Strikingly, non-TGCA <i>Copia</i> elements are often located in genic regions and preferentially insert nearby or within genes, indicating their impact on the evolution of genes and their potential as mutagenesis tools.</p>

Prevalence and Predictors of Cholesterol Screening, Awareness, and Statin Treatment Among US Adults With Familial Hypercholesterolemia or Other Forms of Severe Dyslipidemia (1999–2014)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and other extreme elevations in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol significantly increase the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; however, recent data suggest that prescription rates for statins remain low in these patients. National rates of screening, awareness, and treatment with statins among individuals with FH or severe dyslipidemia are unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data from the 1999 to 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were used to estimate prevalence rates of self-reported screening, awareness, and statin therapy among US adults (n=42 471 weighted to represent 212 million US adults) with FH (defined using the Dutch Lipid Clinic criteria) and with severe dyslipidemia (defined as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels ≥190 mg/dL). Logistic regression was used to identify sociodemographic and clinical correlates of hypercholesterolemia awareness and statin therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The estimated US prevalence of definite/probable FH was 0.47% (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>, 0.03%) and of severe dyslipidemia was 6.6% (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>, 0.2%). The frequency of cholesterol screening and awareness was high (>80%) among adults with definite/probable FH or severe dyslipidemia; however, statin use was uniformly low (52.3% [<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>, 8.2%] of adults with definite/probable FH and 37.6% [<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>, 1.2%] of adults with severe dyslipidemia). Only 30.3% of patients with definite/probable FH on statins were taking a high-intensity statin. The prevalence of statin use in adults with severe dyslipidemia increased over time (from 29.4% to 47.7%) but not faster than trends in the general population (from 5.7% to 17.6%). Older age, health insurance status, having a usual source of care, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and having a personal history of early atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease were associated with higher statin use.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Despite the high prevalence of cholesterol screening and awareness, only ≈50% of adults with FH are on statin therapy, with even fewer prescribed a high-intensity statin; young and uninsured patients are at the highest risk for lack of screening and for undertreatment. This study highlights an imperative to improve the frequency of cholesterol screening and statin prescription rates to better identify and treat this high-risk population. Additional studies are needed to better understand how to close these gaps in screening and treatment.</p></sec>

Survey of a Protocol to Increase Appropriate Implementation of Dispatcher-Assisted Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation for Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Dispatcher-assisted cardiopulmonary resuscitation (DA-CPR) attempts to improve the management of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest by laypersons who are unable to recognize cardiac arrest and are unfamiliar with CPR. Therefore, we investigated the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity of our new DA-CPR protocol for achieving implementation of bystander CPR in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest victims not already receiving bystander CPR.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Since 2007, we have applied a new DA-CPR protocol that uses supplementary key words. Fire departments prospectively collected baseline data on DA-CPR from January 2009 to December 2011. DA-CPR was attempted in 2747 patients; of these, 417 (15.2%) did not experience cardiac arrest. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity of the 2007 protocol versus estimated values of the previous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> protocol were 72.9% versus 50.3% and 99.6% versus 99.8%, respectively. We identified key words that may be useful for detecting out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the occurrence of cardiac arrest after an emergency call (odds ratio, 16.85) and placing an emergency call away from the scene of the arrest (odds ratio, 11.04) were potentially associated with failure to provide DA-CPR. Furthermore, at-home cardiac arrest (odds ratio, 1.61) and family members as bystanders (odds ratio, 1.55) were associated with bystander noncompliance with DA-CPR.

MerTK signaling in macrophages promotes the synthesis of inflammation resolution mediators by suppressing CaMKII activity
<p>Inflammation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion counterbalances excessive inflammation and restores tissue homeostasis after injury. Failure of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion contributes to the pathology of numerous chronic inflammatory diseases. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion is mediated by endogenous specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs), which are derived from long-chain fatty acids by lipoxygenase (LOX) enzymes. 5-LOX plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of two classes of SPMs: lipoxins and resolvins. Cytoplasmic localization of the nonphosphorylated form of 5-LOX is essential for SPM biosynthesis, whereas nuclear localization of phosphorylated 5-LOX promotes proinflammatory leukotriene production. We previously showed that MerTK, an efferocytosis receptor on macrophages, promotes SPM biosynthesis by increasing the abundance of nonphosphorylated, cytoplasmic 5-LOX. We now show that activation of MerTK in human macrophages led to ERK-mediated expression of the gene encoding sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2 (SERCA2), which decreased the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration and suppressed the activity of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). This, in turn, reduced the activities of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 and the kinase MK2, resulting in the increased abundance of the nonphosphorylated, cytoplasmic form of 5-LOX and enhanced SPM biosynthesis. In a zymosan-induced peritonitis model, an inflammatory setting in which macrophage MerTK activation promotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion, inhibition of ERK activation delayed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion, which was characterized by an increased number of neutrophils and decreased amounts of SPMs in tissue exudates. These findings contribute to our understanding of how MerTK signaling induces 5-LOX–derived SPM biosynthesis and suggest a therapeutic strategy to boost inflammation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion in settings where defective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion promotes disease progression.</p>

Fault-tolerant detection of a quantum error
<p>A critical component of any quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>–correcting scheme is detection of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>s by using an ancilla system. However, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>s occurring in the ancilla can propagate onto the logical qubit, irreversibly corrupting the encoded information. We demonstrate a fault-tolerant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>-detection scheme that suppresses spreading of ancilla <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>s by a factor of 5, while maintaining the assignment fidelity. The same method is used to prevent propagation of ancilla excitations, increasing the logical qubit dephasing time by an order of magnitude. Our approach is hardware-efficient, as it uses a single multilevel transmon ancilla and a cavity-encoded logical qubit, whose interaction is engineered in situ by using an off-resonant sideband drive. The results demonstrate that hardware-efficient approaches that exploit system-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong> models can yield advances toward fault-tolerant quantum computation.</p>

Quantum sensing with arbitrary frequency resolution
<p>Quantum sensing takes advantage of well-controlled quantum systems for performing measurements with high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precis</span></strong>ion. We have implemented a concept for quantum sensing with arbitrary frequency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion, independent of the qubit probe and limited only by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity of an external synchronization clock. Our concept makes use of quantum lock-in detection to continuously probe a signal of interest. Using the electronic spin of a single nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond, we demonstrate detection of oscillating magnetic fields with a frequency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion of 70 microhertz over a megahertz bandwidth. The continuous sampling further guarantees an enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity, reaching a signal-to-noise ratio in excess of 10<sup>4</sup> for a 170-nanotesla test signal measured during a 1-hour interval.

TCS: A New Multiple Sequence Alignment Reliability Measure to Estimate Alignment Accuracy and Improve Phylogenetic Tree Reconstruction
<p>Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is a key modeling procedure when analyzing biological sequences. Homology and evolutionary modeling are the most common applications of MSAs. Both are known to be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive to the underlying MSA accuracy. In this work, we show how this problem can be partly overcome using the transitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">consist</span></strong>ency score (TCS), an extended version of the T-Coffee scoring scheme. Using this local evaluation function, we show that one can identify the most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reliabl</span></strong>e portions of an MSA, as judged from BAliBASE and PREFAB structure-based reference alignments. We also show how this measure can be used to improve phylogenetic tree reconstruction using both an established simulated data set and a novel empirical yeast data set. For this purpose, we describe a novel lossless alternative to site filtering that involves overweighting the trustworthy columns. Our approach relies on the T-Coffee framework; it uses libraries of pairwise alignments to evaluate any third party MSA. Pairwise projections can be produced using fast or slow methods, thus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">allow</span></strong>ing a trade-off between speed and accuracy. We compared TCS with Heads-or-Tails, GUIDANCE, Gblocks, and trimAl and found it to lead to significantly better estimates of structural accuracy and more accurate phylogenetic trees.

The diagnostic performance of radiographic criteria to detect aseptic acetabular component loosening after revision total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>This study aimed to determine the diagnostic performance of radiographic   criteria to detect aseptic acetabular loosening after revision total   hip arthroplasty (THA). Secondary aims were to determine the predictive   values of different thresholds of migration and to determine the   predictive values of radiolucency criteria.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Acetabular component migration to re-revision was measured retrospectively   using Ein-Bild-Rontgen-Analyse (EBRA-Cup) and manual measurements   (Sutherland method) in two groups: Group A, 52 components (48 patients) found   not loose at re-revision and Group B, 42 components (36 patients)   found loose at re-revision between 1980 and 2015. The presence and   extent of radiolucent lines was also assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Using EBRA, both proximal translation and sagittal rotation were   excellent diagnostic tests for detecting aseptic loosening. The   area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves was   0.94 and 0.93, respectively. The thresholds of 2.5 mm proximal translation   or 2° sagittal rotation (EBRA) in combination with radiolucency   criteria had a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity of 93% and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity of 88% to detect   aseptic loosening. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity, positive predictive   value and negative predictive value (NPV) of radiolucency criteria   were 41%, 100%, 100% and 68% respectively. Manual measurements of   both proximal translation and sagittal rotation were very good diagnostic tests.   The area under the ROC curve was 0.86 and 0.92 respectively. However,   manual measurements had a decreased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity compared with EBRA.   Radiolucency criteria had a poor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity and NPV of 41% and   68% respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study shows that EBRA and manual migration measurements   can be used as accurate diagnostic tools to detect aseptic loosening   of cementless acetabular components used at revision THA.

Opposing Actions of Fibroblast and Cardiomyocyte Smad3 Signaling in the Infarcted Myocardium
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Transforming growth factor–βs regulate a wide range of cellular responses by activating Smad-dependent and Smad-independent cascades. In the infarcted heart, Smad3 signaling is activated in both cardiomyocytes and interstitial cells. We hypothesized that cell-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic actions of Smad3 regulate repair and remodeling in the infarcted myocardium.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To dissect cell-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic Smad3 actions in myocardial infarction, we generated mice with Smad3 loss in activated fibroblasts or cardiomyocytes. Cardiac function was assessed after reperfused or nonreperfused infarction using echocardiography. The effects of cell-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic Smad3 loss on the infarcted heart were studied using histological studies, assessment of protein, and gene expression levels. In vitro, we studied Smad-dependent and Smad-independent actions in isolated cardiac fibroblasts.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Mice with fibroblast-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic Smad3 loss had accentuated adverse remodeling after reperfused infarction and exhibited an increased incidence of late rupture after nonreperfused infarction. The consequences of fibroblast-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic Smad3 loss were not a result of effects on acute infarct size but were associated with unrestrained fibroblast proliferation, impaired scar remodeling, reduced fibroblast-derived collagen synthesis, and perturbed alignment of myofibroblast arrays in the infarct. Polarized light microscopy in Sirius red–stained sections demonstrated that the changes in fibroblast morphology were associated with perturbed organization of the collagenous matrix in the infarcted area. In contrast, α-smooth muscle actin expression by infarct myofibroblasts was not affected by Smad3 loss. Smad3 critically regulated fibroblast function, activating integrin-mediated nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase–2 (NOX-2) expression. Smad3 loss in cardiomyocytes attenuated remodeling and dysfunction after infarction. Cardiomyocyte-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic Smad3 loss did not affect acute infarct size but was associated with attenuated cardiomyocyte apoptosis in the remodeling myocardium, accompanied by decreased myocardial NOX-2 levels, reduced nitrosative stress, and lower matrix metalloproteinase–2 expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In healing myocardial infarction, myofibroblast- and cardiomyocyte-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic activation of Smad3 has contrasting functional outcomes that may involve activation of an integrin/reactive oxygen axis.</p></sec>

0/1-Hour Triage Algorithm for Myocardial Infarction in Patients With Renal Dysfunction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The European Society of Cardiology recommends a 0/1-hour algorithm for rapid rule-out and rule-in of non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction using high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) concentrations irrespective of renal function. Because patients with renal dysfunction (RD) frequently present with increased hs-cTn concentrations even in the absence of non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, concern has been raised regarding the performance of the 0/1-hour algorithm in RD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a prospective multicenter diagnostic study enrolling unselected patients presenting with suspected non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction to the emergency department, we assessed the diagnostic performance of the European Society of Cardiology 0/1-hour algorithm using hs-cTnT and hs-cTnI in patients with RD, defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, and compared it to patients with normal renal function. The final diagnosis was centrally adjudicated by 2 independent cardiologists using all available information, including cardiac imaging. Safety was quantified as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity in the rule-out zone, accuracy as the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity in the rule-in zone, and efficacy as the proportion of the overall cohort assigned to either rule-out or rule-in based on the 0- and 1-hour sample.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 3254 patients, RD was present in 487 patients (15%). The prevalence of non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction was substantially higher in patients with RD compared with patients with normal renal function (31% versus 13%, <i>P</i><0.001). Using hs-cTnT, patients with RD had comparable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity of rule-out (100.0% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 97.6–100.0] versus 99.2% [95% CI, 97.6–99.8]; <i>P</i>=0.559), lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity of rule-in (88.7% [95% CI, 84.8–91.9] versus 96.5% [95% CI, 95.7–97.2]; <i>P</i><0.001), and lower overall efficacy (51% versus 81%, <i>P</i><0.001), mainly driven by a much lower percentage of patients eligible for rule-out (18% versus 68%, <i>P</i><0.001) compared with patients with normal renal function. Using hs-cTnI, patients with RD had comparable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity of rule-out (98.6% [95% CI, 95.0–99.8] versus 98.5% [95% CI, 96.5–99.5]; <i>P</i>=1.0), lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity of rule-in (84.4% [95% CI, 79.9–88.3] versus 91.7% [95% CI, 90.5–92.9]; <i>P</i><0.001), and lower overall efficacy (54% versus 76%, <i>P</i><0.001; proportion ruled out, 18% versus 58%, <i>P</i><0.001) compared with patients with normal renal function.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In patients with RD, the safety of the European Society of Cardiology 0/1-hour algorithm is high, but <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity of rule-in and overall efficacy are decreased.

Modeling Major Adverse Outcomes of Pediatric and Adult Patients With Congenital Heart Disease Undergoing Cardiac Catheterization
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>ization for adverse events after congenital cardiac catheterization is needed to equitably compare patient outcomes among different hospitals as a foundation for quality improvement. The goal of this project was to develop a risk-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>ization methodology to adjust for patient characteristics when comparing major adverse outcomes in the NCDR’s (National Cardiovascular Data Registry) IMPACT Registry (Improving Pediatric and Adult Congenital Treatment).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Between January 2011 and March 2014, 39 725 consecutive patients within IMPACT undergoing cardiac catheterization were identified. Given the heterogeneity of interventional procedures for congenital heart disease, new procedure-type risk categories were derived with empirical data and expert opinion, as were markers of hemodynamic vulnerability. A multivariable hierarchical logistic regression model to identify patient and procedural characteristics predictive of a major adverse event or death after cardiac catheterization was derived in 70% of the cohort and validated in the remaining 30%.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The rate of major adverse event or death was 7.1% and 7.2% in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively. Six procedure-type risk categories and 6 independent indicators of hemodynamic vulnerability were identified.

Effect of Ferric Carboxymaltose on Exercise Capacity in Patients With Chronic Heart Failure and Iron Deficiency
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Iron deficiency is common in patients with heart failure (HF) and is associated with reduced exercise capacity and poor outcomes.

Postmortem Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Fetuses and Children
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Perinatal and pediatric autopsies have declined worldwide in the past decade.

A pediatric CMR imager reported the CMR images, masked to autopsy information. The pathologists were masked to the information from CMR images. The institutional research ethics committee approved the study, and parental consent was obtained. Assuming a diagnostic accuracy of 50%, 400 cases were required for a 5% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precis</span></strong>ion of estimate. Three cases were excluded from analysis, 2 with no conventional autopsy performed and 1 with insufficient CMR sequences performed. Thirty-eight CMR data sets were nondiagnostic (37 in fetuses ≤24 weeks; 1 in a fetus >24 weeks). In the remaining 359 cases, 44 cardiac abnormalities were noted at autopsy.

Design and evaluation of engineered protein biosensors for live-cell imaging of EGFR phosphorylation
<p>Live-cell fluorescence microscopy is broadly applied to study the dynamics of receptor-mediated cell signaling, but the availability of intracellular biosensors is limited. A biosensor based on the tandem SH2 domains from phospholipase C–γ1 (PLCγ1), tSH2-WT, has been used to measure phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Here, we found that tSH2-WT lacked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity for phosphorylated EGFR, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">consist</span></strong>ent with the known promiscuity of SH2 domains. Further, EGF-stimulated membrane recruitment of tSH2-WT differed qualitatively from the expected kinetics of EGFR phosphorylation. Analysis of a mathematical model suggested, and experiments confirmed, that the high avidity of tSH2-WT resulted in saturation of its target and interference with EGFR endocytosis. To overcome the apparent target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity and saturation issues, we implemented two protein engineering strategies. In the first approach, we screened a combinatorial library generated by random mutagenesis of the C-terminal SH2 domain (cSH2) of PLCγ1 and isolated a mutant form (mSH2) with enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity for phosphorylated Tyr<sup>992</sup> (pTyr<sup>992</sup>) of EGFR. A biosensor based on mSH2 closely reported the kinetics of EGFR phosphorylation but retained cross-reactivity similar to tSH2-WT. In the second approach, we isolated a pTyr<sup>992</sup>-binding protein (SPY992) from a combinatorial library generated by mutagenesis of the Sso7d protein scaffold. Compared to tSH2-WT and mSH2, SPY992 exhibited superior performance as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic, moderate-affinity biosensor. We extended this approach to isolate a biosensor for EGFR pTyr<sup>1148</sup> (SPY1148). This approach of integrating theoretical considerations with protein engineering strategies can be generalized to design and evaluate suitable biosensors for various phospho-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic targets.</p>

Improving mechanical sensor performance through larger damping
<p>Mechanical resonances are used in a wide variety of devices, from smartphone accelerometers to computer clocks and from wireless filters to atomic force microscopes. Frequency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity, a critical performance metric, is generally assumed to be tantamount to resonance quality factor (the inverse of the linewidth and of the damping). We show that the frequency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity of resonant nanomechanical sensors can be improved by lowering the quality factor. At high bandwidths, quality-factor reduction is completely mitigated by increases in signal-to-noise ratio. At low bandwidths, notably, increased damping leads to better <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity and sensor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion, with improvement proportional to damping. We confirm the findings by demonstrating temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion of 60 microkelvin at 300-hertz bandwidth. These results open the door to high-performance ultra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive resonators in gaseous or liquid environments, single-cell nanocalorimetry, nanoscale gas chromatography, atmospheric-pressure nanoscale mass spectrometry, and new approaches in crystal oscillator <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity.</p>

miR-183 cluster scales mechanical pain sensitivity by regulating basal and neuropathic pain genes
<p>Nociception is protective and prevents tissue damage but can also facilitate chronic pain. Whether a general principle governs these two types of pain is unknown. Here, we show that both basal mechanical and neuropathic pain are controlled by the microRNA-183 (miR-183) cluster in mice. This single cluster controls more than 80% of neuropathic pain–regulated genes and scales basal mechanical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity and mechanical allodynia by regulating auxiliary voltage-gated calcium channel subunits α2δ-1 and α2δ-2. Basal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity is controlled in nociceptors, and allodynia involves TrkB<sup>+</sup> light-touch mechanoreceptors. These light-touch–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive neurons, which normally do not elicit pain, produce pain during neuropathy that is reversed by gabapentin. Thus, a single microRNA cluster continuously scales acute noxious mechanical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity in nociceptive neurons and suppresses neuropathic pain transduction in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic, light-touch–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive neuronal type recruited during mechanical allodynia.</p>

Dopamine neurons encode performance error in singing birds
<p>Many behaviors are learned through trial and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong> by matching performance to internal goals. Yet neural mechanisms of performance evaluation remain poorly understood.

Dopamine activity was phasically suppressed after distorted syllables, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">consist</span></strong>ent with a worse-than-predicted outcome, and was phasically activated at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precis</span></strong>e moment of the song when a predicted distortion did not occur, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">consist</span></strong>ent with a better-than-predicted outcome. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong> response magnitude depended on distortion probability. Thus, dopaminergic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong> signals can evaluate behaviors that are not learned for reward and are instead learned by matching performance outcomes to internal goals.</p>

Low Water Potential and At14a-Like1 (AFL1) Effects on Endocytosis and Actin Filament Organization
<p>At14a-Like1 (AFL1) is a stress-induced protein of unknown function that promotes growth during low water potential stress and drought. Previous analysis indicated that AFL1 may have functions related to endocytosis and regulation of actin filament organization, processes for which the effects of low water potential are little known. We found that low water potential led to a decrease in endocytosis, as measured by uptake of the membrane-impermeable dye FM4-64. Ectopic expression of AFL1 reversed the decrease in FM4-64 uptake seen in wild type, while reduced AFL1 expression led to further inhibition of FM4-64 uptake. Increased AFL1 also made FM4-64 uptake less <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive to the actin filament disruptor Latrunculin B (LatB). LatB decreased AFL1-Clathrin Light Chain colocalization, further indicating that effects of AFL1 on endocytosis may be related to actin filament organization or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity. Consistent with this hypothesis, ectopic AFL1 expression made actin filaments less <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive to disruption by LatB or Cytochalasin D and led to increased actin filament skewness and decreased occupancy, indicative of more bundled actin filaments. This latter effect could be partially mimicked by the actin filament <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>izer Jasplakinolide (JASP). However, AFL1 did not substantially inhibit actin filament dynamics, indicating that AFL1 acts via a different mechanism than JASP-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ization. AFL1 partially colocalized with actin filaments but not with microtubules, further indicating actin-filament–related function of AFL1. These data provide insight into endocytosis and actin filament responses to low water potential stress and demonstrate an involvement of AFL1 in these key cellular processes.</p>

An E3 Ligase Affects the NLR Receptor Stability and Immunity to Powdery Mildew
<p>Following the detection of pathogen cognate effectors, plant Nod-like receptors (NLRs) trigger isolate-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic immunity that is generally associated with cell death. The regulation of NLR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity is important to ensure effective immunity. In barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), the allelic Mildew locus A (MLA) receptors mediate isolate-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic disease resistance against powdery mildew fungus (<i>Blumeria graminis</i> f. sp. <i>hordei</i>). Currently, how MLA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity is controlled remains unknown. Here, we identified an MLA-interacting RING-type E3 ligase, MIR1, that interacts with several MLAs. We showed that the carboxyl-terminal TPR domain of MIR1 mediates the interaction with the coiled-coil domain-containing region of functional MLAs, such as MLA1, MLA6, and MLA10, but not with that of the nonfunctional MLA18-1. MIR1 can ubiquitinate the amino-terminal region of MLAs in vitro and promotes the proteasomal degradation of MLAs in vitro and in planta. Both proteasome inhibitor treatment and virus-induced gene silencing-mediated <i>MIR1</i> silencing significantly increased MLA abundance in barley transgenic lines. Furthermore, overexpression of MIR1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ically compromised MLA-mediated disease resistance in barley, while coexpression of MIR1 and MLA10 attenuated MLA10-induced cell death signaling in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. Together, our data reveal a mechanism for the control of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity of MLA immune receptors and for the attenuation of MLA-triggered defense signaling by a RING-type E3 ligase via the ubiquitin proteasome system.</p>

Cell-Type-Specific H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase Activity in Root Tissues Enables K<sup>+</sup> Retention and Mediates Acclimation of Barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) to Salinity Stress
<p>While the importance of cell type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity in plant adaptive responses is widely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accept</span></strong>ed, only a limited number of studies have addressed this issue at the functional level. We have combined electrophysiological, imaging, and biochemical techniques to reveal the physiological mechanisms conferring higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity of apical root cells to salinity in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>). We show that salinity application to the root apex arrests root growth in a highly tissue- and treatment-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic manner. Although salinity-induced transient net Na<sup>+</sup> uptake was about 4-fold higher in the root apex compared with the mature zone, mature root cells accumulated more cytosolic and vacuolar Na<sup>+</sup>, suggesting that the higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity of apical cells to salt is not related to either enhanced Na<sup>+</sup> exclusion or sequestration inside the root. Rather, the above differential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity between the two zones originates from a 10-fold difference in K<sup>+</sup> efflux between the mature zone and the apical region (much poorer in the root apex) of the root. Major factors contributing to this poor K<sup>+</sup> retention ability are (1) an intrinsically lower H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity in the root apex, (2) greater salt-induced membrane depolarization, and (3) a higher reactive oxygen species production under NaCl and a larger density of reactive oxygen species-activated cation currents in the apex. Salinity treatment increased (2- to 5-fold) the content of 10 (out of 25 detected) amino acids in the root apex but not in the mature zone and changed the organic acid and sugar contents. The causal link between the observed changes in the root metabolic profile and the regulation of transporter activity is discussed.</p>

Baseline hearing abilities and variability in wild beluga whales (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>)
<p>While hearing is the primary sensory modality for odontocetes, there are few data addressing variation within a natural population. This work describes the hearing ranges (4–150 kHz) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivities of seven apparently healthy, wild beluga whales (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>) during a population health assessment project that captured and released belugas in Bristol Bay, Alaska. The baseline hearing abilities and subsequent variations were addressed. Hearing was measured using auditory evoked potentials (AEPs). All audiograms showed a typical cetacean U-shape; substantial variation (>30 dB) was found between most and least <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive thresholds. All animals heard well, up to at least 128 kHz. Two heard up to 150 kHz. Lowest auditory thresholds (35–45 dB) were identified in the range 45–80 kHz. Greatest differences in hearing abilities occurred at both the high end of the auditory range and at frequencies of maximum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity. In general, wild beluga hearing was quite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive. Hearing abilities were similar to those of belugas measured in zoological settings, reinforcing the comparative importance of both settings. The relative degree of variability across the wild belugas suggests that audiograms from multiple individuals are needed to properly describe the maximum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity and population variance for odontocetes. Hearing measures were easily incorporated into field-based settings. This detailed examination of hearing abilities in wild Bristol Bay belugas provides a basis for a better understanding of the potential impact of anthropogenic noise on a noise-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive species. Such information may help design noise-limiting mitigation measures that could be applied to areas heavily influenced and inhabited by endangered belugas.</p>

Improving the accuracy of synovial fluid analysis in the diagnosis of prosthetic joint infection with simple and inexpensive biomarkers
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aims of this study were to increase the diagnostic accuracy   of the analysis of synovial fluid in the differentiation of prosthetic   joint infection (PJI) by the addition of inexpensive biomarkers   such as the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), adenosine deaminase   (ADA), alpha-2-macrogloblulin (α2M) and procalcitonin.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between January 2013 and December 2015, synovial fluid and removed   implants were requested from 143 revision total joint arthroplasties.   A total of 55 patients met inclusion criteria of the receipt of   sufficient synovial fluid, tissue samples and removed implants for   analysis.</p><p>The diagnosis of PJI followed the definition from a recent International   Consensus Meeting to create two groups of patients; septic and aseptic.   Using receiver operating characteristic curves we determined the   cutoff values and diagnostic accuracy for each marker.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were 23 PJIs and 32 patients with aseptic loosening. The   levels of total leucocyte count, proportion of polymorphonuclear   leucocytes (PMNs), CRP, ADA and α2M in the synovial fluid were all   significantly higher in those with a PJI than in those with aseptic   loosening. The levels of procalcitonin were comparable in the two   groups.</p><p>Cutoff values for the optimal performance in the diagnosis of   infection were: total leucocyte count > 1463 cells/μL (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity   (Sens) 100%, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity (Spec) 71.9%, positive predictive value   (PPV) 71.9%, negative predictive value (NPV) 100%); proportion of   PMNs > 81% (Sens 78.3%, Spec 75.0%, PPV 69.2%, NPV 82.8%); CRP >   6.7mg/L (Sens 78.3%, Spec 93.8%, PPV 90.0%, NPV 85.7%); ADA > 61U/L   (Sens 78.3%, Spec 96.9%, PPV 94.7%, NPV 86.1%) and α2M > 958 mg/L   (Sens 47.8%, Spec 96.9%, PPV 91.7%, NPV 72.1%).</p><p>The addition of a raised level of CRP or ADA to the total leukocyte   count increased the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity: total leukocyte count > 1463 cells/μL   and CRP > 6.7mg/L (Sens 78.3%, Spec 100%, PPV 100%, NPV 86.5%) or   with ADA > 61U/L (Sens 78.3%, Spec 96.9%, PPV 94.7%, NPV 86.1%). </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The total leucocyte count in the synovial fluid offers great   negative predictive value in the diagnosis of PJI and the addition   of more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic markers such as CRP and ADA improves the positive   predictive value.

High-Sensitivity Cardiac Troponin and the Risk Stratification of Patients With Renal Impairment Presenting With Suspected Acute Coronary Syndrome
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>High-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity cardiac troponin testing may improve the risk stratification and diagnosis of myocardial infarction, but concentrations can be challenging to interpret in patients with renal impairment, and the effectiveness of testing in this group is uncertain.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a prospective multicenter study of consecutive patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome, we evaluated the performance of high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity cardiac troponin I in those with and without renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>). The negative predictive value and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity of troponin concentrations below the risk stratification threshold (5 ng/L) at presentation were reported for a primary outcome of index type 1 myocardial infarction, or type 1 myocardial infarction or cardiac death at 30 days. The positive predictive value and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity at the 99th centile diagnostic threshold (16 ng/L in women, 34 ng/L in men) was determined for index type 1 myocardial infarction.

Role of Diastolic Stress Testing in the Evaluation for Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is challenging and relies largely on demonstration of elevated cardiac filling pressures (pulmonary capillary wedge pressure). Current guidelines recommend use of natriuretic peptides (N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide) and rest/exercise echocardiography (E/e′ ratio) to make this determination. Data to support this practice are conflicting.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Simultaneous echocardiographic-catheterization studies were prospectively conducted at rest and during exercise in subjects with invasively proven HFpEF (n=50) and participants with dyspnea but no identifiable cardiac pathology (n=24).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>N-Terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide levels were below the level considered to exclude disease (≤125 pg/mL) in 18% of subjects with HFpEF. E/e′ ratio was correlated with directly measured pulmonary capillary wedge pressure at rest (<i>r</i>=0.63, <i>P</i><0.0001) and during exercise (<i>r</i>=0.57, <i>P</i><0.0001). Although <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic, current guidelines were poorly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive, identifying only 34% to 60% of subjects with invasively proven HFpEF on the basis of resting echocardiographic data alone.

Direct Comparison of 4 Very Early Rule-Out Strategies for Acute Myocardial Infarction Using High-Sensitivity Cardiac Troponin I
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Four strategies for very early rule-out of acute myocardial infarction using high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) have been identified. It remains unclear which strategy is most attractive for clinical application.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We prospectively enrolled unselected patients presenting to the emergency department with symptoms suggestive of acute myocardial infarction. The final diagnosis was adjudicated by 2 independent cardiologists. Hs-cTnI levels were measured at presentation and after 1 hour in a blinded fashion. We directly compared all 4 hs-cTnI–based rule-out strategies: limit of detection (LOD, hs-cTnI<2 ng/L), single cutoff (hs-cTnI<5 ng/L), 1-hour algorithm (hs-cTnI<5 ng/L and 1-hour change<2 ng/L), and the 0/1-hour algorithm recommended in the European Society of Cardiology guideline combining LOD and 1-hour algorithm.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 2828 enrolled patients, acute myocardial infarction was the final diagnosis in 451 (16%) patients. The LOD approach ruled out 453 patients (16%) with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity of 100% (95% confidence interval [CI], 99.2%–100%), the single cutoff 1516 patients (54%) with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity of 97.1% (95% CI, 95.1%–98.3%), the 1-hour algorithm 1459 patients (52%) with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity of 98.4% (95% CI, 96.8%–99.2%), and the 0/1-hour algorithm 1463 patients (52%) with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity of 98.4% (95% CI, 96.8%–99.2%).

A Critical Role of Sodium Flux via the Plasma Membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> Exchanger SOS1 in the Salt Tolerance of Rice
<p>Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) stands among the world's most important crop species. Rice is salt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive, and the undue accumulation of sodium ions (Na<sup>+</sup>) in shoots has the strongest negative correlation with rice productivity under long-term salinity. The plasma membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger protein Salt Overly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive 1 (SOS1) is the sole Na<sup>+</sup> efflux transporter that has been genetically characterized to date. Here, the importance of SOS1-facilitated Na<sup>+</sup> flux in the salt tolerance of rice was analyzed in a reverse-genetics approach. A <i>sos1</i> loss-of-function mutant displayed exceptional salt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity that was correlated with excessive Na<sup>+</sup> intake and impaired Na<sup>+</sup> loading into the xylem, thus indicating that SOS1 controls net root Na<sup>+</sup> uptake and long-distance Na<sup>+</sup> transport to shoots. The acute Na<sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity of <i>sos1</i> plants at low NaCl concentrations <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">allow</span></strong>ed analysis of the transcriptional response to sodicity stress without effects of the osmotic stress intrinsic to high-salinity treatments. In contrast with that in the wild type, <i>sos1</i> mutant roots displayed preferential down-regulation of stress-related genes in response to salt treatment, despite the greater intensity of stress experienced by the mutant. These results suggest there is impaired stress detection or an inability to mount a comprehensive response to salinity in <i>sos1</i>. In summary, the plasma membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger SOS1 plays a major role in the salt tolerance of rice by controlling Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis and possibly contributing to the sensing of sodicity stress.</p>

CyanoGate: A Modular Cloning Suite for Engineering Cyanobacteria Based on the Plant MoClo Syntax
<p>Recent advances in synthetic biology research have been underpinned by an exponential increase in available genomic information and a proliferation of advanced DNA assembly tools. The adoption of plasmid vector assembly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>s and parts libraries has greatly enhanced the reproducibility of research and the exchange of parts between different labs and biological systems. However, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>ized modular cloning (MoClo) system is not yet available for cyanobacteria, which lag behind other prokaryotes in synthetic biology despite their huge potential regarding biotechnological applications. By building on the assembly library and syntax of the Plant Golden Gate MoClo kit, we have developed a versatile system called CyanoGate that unites cyanobacteria with plant and algal systems. Here, we describe the generation of a suite of parts and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accept</span></strong>or vectors for making (1) marked/unmarked knock-outs or integrations using an integrative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accept</span></strong>or vector, and (2) transient multigene expression and repression systems using known and previously undescribed replicative vectors. We tested and compared the CyanoGate system in the established model cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 and the more recently described fast-growing strain <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973. The UTEX 2973 fast-growth phenotype was only evident under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic growth conditions; however, UTEX 2973 accumulated high levels of proteins with strong native or synthetic promoters. The system is publicly available and can be readily expanded to accommodate other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>ized MoClo parts to accelerate the development of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reliabl</span></strong>e synthetic biology tools for the cyanobacterial community.</p>

Of particular interest is the application of synthetic biology to chloroplast biotechnology to generate plants capable of producing new metabolites, vaccines, biofuels, and high-value chemicals. Progress made in the assembly of large DNA molecules, composing multiple transcriptional units, has significantly aided in the ability to rapidly construct novel vectors for genetic engineering. In particular, Golden Gate assembly has provided a facile molecular tool for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>ized assembly of synthetic genetic elements into larger DNA constructs. In this work, a complete modular chloroplast cloning system, MoChlo, was developed and validated for fast and flexible chloroplast engineering in plants. A library of 128 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>ized chloroplast-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic parts (47 promoters, 38 5′ untranslated regions [5′UTRs], nine promoter:5′UTR fusions, 10 3′UTRs, 14 genes of interest, and 10 chloroplast-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic destination vectors) were mined from the literature and modified for use in MoChlo assembly, along with chloroplast-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic destination vectors. The strategy was validated by assembling synthetic operons of various sizes and determining the efficiency of assembly. This method was successfully used to generate chloroplast transformation vectors containing up to seven transcriptional units in a single vector (∼10.6-kb synthetic operon). To enable researchers with limited resources to engage in chloroplast biotechnology, and to accelerate progress in the field, the entire kit, as described, is available through Addgene at minimal cost. Thus, the MoChlo kit represents a valuable tool for fast and flexible design of heterologous metabolic pathways for plastid metabolic engineering.</p>

A Comprehensive Toolkit for Inducible, Cell Type-Specific Gene Expression in Arabidopsis
<p>Understanding the context-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic role of gene function is a key objective of modern biology. To this end, we generated a resource for inducible cell type-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic transactivation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) based on the well-established combination of the chimeric GR-LhG4 transcription factor and the synthetic <i>pOp</i> promoter. Harnessing the flexibility of the GreenGate cloning system, we produced a comprehensive set of transgenic lines termed GR-LhG4 driver lines targeting most tissues in the Arabidopsis shoot and root with a strong focus on the indeterminate meristems. When we combined these transgenic lines with effectors under the control of the <i>pOp</i> promoter, we observed tight temporal and spatial control of gene expression. In particular, inducible expression in F1 plants obtained from crosses of driver and effector lines <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">allow</span></strong>s for rapid assessment of the cell type-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic impact of an effector with high temporal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion. Thus, our comprehensive and flexible method is suitable for overcoming the limitations of ubiquitous genetic approaches, the outputs of which often are difficult to interpret due to the widespread existence of compensatory mechanisms and the integration of diverging effects in different cell types.</p>

Roles of Receptor-Like Cytoplasmic Kinase VII Members in Pattern-Triggered Immune Signaling
<p>Pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">consist</span></strong> of receptor kinases (RKs) and receptor-like proteins, sense microbe- and host-derived molecular patterns associated with pathogen infection to trigger immune responses in plants. Several kinases of the 46-member Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase (RLCK) subfamily VII play important roles in pattern-triggered immunity, but it is unclear whether different RLCK VII members act <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ically or redundantly in immune signaling. Here, we constructed nine higher order mutants of this subfamily (named <i>rlck vii-1</i> to <i>rlck vii-9</i>) and systematically characterized their immune phenotypes. The mutants <i>rlck vii-5</i>, -<i>7</i>, and -<i>8</i> had compromised reactive oxygen species production in response to all patterns tested, indicating that the corresponding members are broadly required for the signaling of multiple PRRs. However, <i>rlck vii-4</i> was defective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ically in chitin-induced reactive oxygen species production, suggesting that RCLK VII-4 members mediate the signaling of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic PRRs. Furthermore, RLCK VII-4 members were required for the chitin-triggered activation of MAPK, demonstrating that these kinases link a PRR to MAPK activation. Moreover, we found that RLCK VII-6 and -8 also were required for RK-mediated root growth. Together, these results show that numerous RLCK VII members are involved in pattern-triggered immune signaling and uncover both common and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic roles of these kinases in plant development and immunity mediated by various RKs.</p>

RECX Interacts with Mitochondrial RECA to Maintain Mitochondrial Genome Stability
<p>The chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes are essential for photosynthesis and respiration, respectively. RECA and RECG, which are plant-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic homologs of the bacterial homologous recombination repair proteins RecA and RecG, maintain organelle genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity by suppressing aberrant recombination between short dispersed repeats (SDRs) in the moss <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. In this study, we analyzed the plant-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic factor RECX, a homolog of bacterial RecX that regulates RecA. RECX fused to GFP colocalized with mitochondrial RECA1 and chloroplast RECA2 on mitochondrial and chloroplast nucleoids, respectively. Knockout (KO) and overexpression (OEX) of <i>RECX</i> did not alter the <i>P. patens</i> morphological phenotype. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA, however, showed that products from recombination between SDRs increased significantly in <i>RECX</i> OEX mitochondria and modestly in <i>RECX</i> KO mitochondria. By contrast, analysis of chloroplast DNA revealed no substantial alteration in the number of products from recombination between SDRs in <i>RECX</i> KO and OEX chloroplasts. Yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed interactions between RECX and RECA1 and between RECX and RECA2. Expression profiles showed a positive correlation between <i>RECX</i> and factors maintaining the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity of both organelle genomes and <i>RECA1</i>. Collectively, these results suggest that RECX maintains mitochondrial genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity, likely by modulating RECA1 activity, and that the compromised function of RECX induces mitochondrial genome in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity.</p>

5′ to 3′ mRNA Decay Contributes to the Regulation of Arabidopsis Seed Germination by Dormancy
<p>The regulation of plant gene expression, necessary for development and adaptive responses, relies not only on RNA transcription but also on messenger RNA (mRNA) fate. To understand whether seed germination relies on the degradation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic subsets of mRNA, we investigated whether the 5′ to 3′ RNA decay machinery participated in the regulation of this process. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seeds of <i>exoribonuclease4</i> (<i>xrn4</i>) and <i>varicose</i> (<i>vcs</i>) mutants displayed distinct dormancy phenotypes. Transcriptome analysis <i>of xrn4-5</i> and <i>vcs-8</i> mutant seeds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">allow</span></strong>ed us to identify genes that are likely to play a role in the control of germination. Study of 5′ untranslated region features of these transcripts revealed that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic motifs, secondary energy, and GC content could play a role in their degradation by XRN4 and VCS, and Gene Ontology clustering revealed novel actors of seed dormancy and germination. Several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic transcripts identified as being putative targets of XRN4 and VCS in seeds (<i>PECTIN LYASE-LIKE</i>, <i>ASPARTYL PROTEASE</i>, <i>DWD-HYPERSENSITIVE-TO-ABA3</i>, and <i>YELLOW STRIPE-LIKE5</i>) were further studied by reverse genetics, and their functional roles in the germination process were confirmed by mutant analysis. These findings suggest that completion of germination and its regulation by dormancy also depend on the degradation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic subsets of mRNA.</p>

The IQD Family of Calmodulin-Binding Proteins Links Calcium Signaling to Microtubules, Membrane Subdomains, and the Nucleus
<p>Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) signaling and dynamic reorganization of the cytoskeleton are essential processes for the coordination and control of plant cell shape and cell growth. Calmodulin (CaM) and closely related calmodulin-like (CML) polypeptides are principal sensors of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. CaM/CMLs decode and relay information encrypted by the second messenger via differential interactions with a wide spectrum of targets to modulate their diverse biochemical activities. The plant-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic IQ67 DOMAIN (IQD) family emerged as possibly the largest class of CaM-interacting proteins with undefined molecular functions and biological roles. Here, we show that the 33 members of the IQD family in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) differentially localize, using green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged proteins, to multiple and distinct subcellular sites, including microtubule (MT) arrays, plasma membrane subdomains, and nuclear compartments. Intriguingly, the various IQD-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic localization patterns coincide with the subcellular patterns of IQD-dependent recruitment of CaM, suggesting that the diverse IQD members sequester Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM signaling modules to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic subcellular sites for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precis</span></strong>e regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent processes. Because MT localization is a hallmark of most IQD family members, we quantitatively analyzed GFP-labeled MT arrays in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> cells transiently expressing GFP-IQD fusions and observed IQD-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic MT patterns, which point to a role of IQDs in MT organization and dynamics. Indeed, stable overexpression of select IQD proteins in Arabidopsis altered cellular MT orientation, cell shape, and organ morphology. Because IQDs share biochemical properties with scaffold proteins, we propose that IQD families provide an assortment of platform proteins for integrating CaM-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling at multiple cellular sites to regulate cell function, shape, and growth.</p>

Functional Analysis of Cellulose Synthase (CESA) Protein Class Specificity
<p>The cellulose synthase complex (CSC) exhibits a 6-fold symmetry and is known as a “rosette.” Each CSC is believed to contain between 18 and 24 CESA proteins that each synthesize an individual glucan chain. These chains form the microfibrils that confer the remarkable structural properties of cellulose. At least three different classes of CESA proteins are essential to form the CSC. However, while organization of the CSC determines microfibril structure, how individual CESA proteins are organized within the CSC remains unclear. Parts of the plant CESA proteins map sufficiently well onto the bacterial CESA (BcsA) structure, indicating that they are likely to share a common catalytic mechanism. However, plant CESA proteins are much larger than the bacterial BcsA protein, prompting the suggestion that these plant-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic regions are important for interactions between CESA proteins and for conferring CESA class <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity. In this study, we have undertaken a comprehensive analysis of well-defined regions of secondary cell wall CESA proteins, with the aim of defining what distinguishes different CESA proteins and hence what determines the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity of each CESA class. Our results demonstrate that CESA class <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity extends throughout the protein and not just in the highly variable regions. Furthermore, we find that different CESA isoforms vary greatly in their levels of site <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity and this is likely to be determined by the constraints imposed by their position within the CSC rather than their primary structure.</p>

SENSITIVE TO FREEZING2 Aides in Resilience to Salt and Drought in Freezing-Sensitive Tomato
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>IVE TO FREEZING2 (SFR2) is crucial for protecting chloroplast membranes following freezing in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). It has been shown that SFR2 homologs are present in all land plants, including freezing-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive species, raising the question of SFR2 function beyond freezing tolerance. Similar to freezing, salt and drought can cause dehydration. Thus, it is hypothesized that in freezing-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive plants SFR2 may play roles in their resilience to salt or drought. To test this hypothesis, <i>SlSFR2</i> RNAi lines were generated in the cold/freezing-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive species tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i> [M82 <i>cv</i>]). Hyper<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity to salt and drought of <i>SlSFR2</i>-RNAi lines was observed. Higher tolerance of wild-type tomatoes was correlated with the production of trigalactosyldiacylglycerol, a product of SFR2 activity. Tomato SFR2 in vitro activity is Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and its optimal pH is 7.5, similar to that of Arabidopsis SFR2, but the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic activity of tomato SFR2 in vitro is almost double that of Arabidopsis SFR2. When salt and drought stress were applied to Arabidopsis, no conditions could be identified at which SFR2 was induced prior to irreversibly impacting plant growth, suggesting that SFR2 protects Arabidopsis primarily against freezing. Discovery of tomato SFR2 function in drought and salt resilience provides further insights into general membrane lipid remodeling-based stress tolerance mechanisms and together with protection against freezing in freezing-resistant plants such as Arabidopsis, it adds lipid remodeling as a possible target for the engineering of abiotic stress-resilient crops.</p>

Pheromones exert top-down effects on visual recognition in the jumping spider <i>Lyssomanes viridis</i>
<p>In diverse and productive habitats, predaceous arthropods are expected to frequently encounter dangerous con<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ics and hetero<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ics. This should make quick and accurate discriminations between species and sexes adaptive. By simultaneously sampling both visual cues and pheromones, and by utilizing stringent species- and sex-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic visual recognition templates, an individual should be able to increase both its speed and accuracy in making such discriminations. We tested for the use and stringency of visual recognition templates in the jumping spider <i>Lyssomanes viridis</i> by presenting males with animated images of con<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ics, hetero<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ics and composite images that combined the facial coloration and morphology of one sex or species with the leg coloration of another. Males' courtship <i>versus</i> threat displays indicated whether a stimulus was perceived as a potential mate or a threat. By comparing males' visual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inspect</span></strong>ion times of, and display types towards, the various images in the presence <i>versus</i> absence of female pheromones, we were able to deduce whether males tend to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inspect</span></strong> a subset of the color pattern and morphological features that make up their con<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic recognition templates (i.e. those on just the face or just the legs), or all features, and whether this changes in the presence of pheromones. We found that the male recognition template for con<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic female was surprisingly coarse, whereas the recognition template for con<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic male, and especially the male face, was more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic. Pheromones hastened the recognition of images with coloration and morphology closely matching those of con<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ics, presumably by activating con<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic visual recognition templates. When males were presented with an image that was, overall, a poor match to a con<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic female, but that contained a subset of female or female-like features, female pheromones usually did not hasten recognition, but did increase the likelihood that the image would be identified as a female. Taken together, our data suggest that males examined features on both the face and the legs in both the presence and absence of pheromones, and that female pheromones tipped the balance in favor of a female identification when a male was unsure how to categorize an incongruous set of visual features.</p>

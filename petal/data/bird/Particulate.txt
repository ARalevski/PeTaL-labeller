Extracellular ATP Shapes a Defense-Related Transcriptome Both Independently and along with Other Defense Signaling Pathways
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ATP</span></strong> is not only an essential metabolite of cellular biochemistry but also acts as a signal in the extracellular milieu. In plants, extracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ATP</span></strong> is monitored by the purinergic receptor P2K1. Recent studies have revealed that extracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ATP</span></strong> acts as a damage-associated molecular pattern in plants, and its signaling through P2K1 is important for mounting an effective defense response against various pathogenic microorganisms. Biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens attack plants using different strategies, to which plants respond accordingly with salicylate-based or jasmonate/ethylene-based defensive signaling, respectively. Interestingly, defense mediated by P2K1 is effective against pathogens of both lifestyles, raising the question of the level of interplay between extracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ATP</span></strong> signaling and that of jasmonate, ethylene, and salicylate. To address this issue, we analyzed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ATP</span></strong>-induced transcriptomes in wild-type Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings and mutant seedlings defective in essential components in the signaling pathways of jasmonate, ethylene, and salicylate (classic defense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormone</span></strong>s) as well as a mutant and an overexpression line of the P2K1 receptor. We found that P2K1 function is crucial for faithful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ATP</span></strong>-induced transcriptional changes and that a subset of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s is more responsive in the P2K1 overexpression line. We also found that more than half of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ATP</span></strong>-responsive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s required signaling by one or more of the pathways for the classical defense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormone</span></strong>s, with the jasmonate-based signaling being more critical than others. By contrast, the other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ATP</span></strong>-responsive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s were unaffected by deficiencies in signaling for any of the classical defense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormone</span></strong>s. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ATP</span></strong>-responsive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s were highly enriched for defense-related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> Ontology terms. We further tested the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ATP</span></strong>-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in knockout mutants of transcription factors, demonstrating that MYCs acting downstream of the jasmonate receptor complex and calmodulin-binding transcription activators are nuclear transducers of P2K1-mediated extracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ATP</span></strong> signaling.</p>

The Citrus Transcription Factor CsMADS6 Modulates Carotenoid Metabolism by Directly Regulating Carotenogenic Genes
<p>Although remarkable progress has been made toward understanding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carotenoid</span></strong> biosynthesis, the mechanisms that regulate the transcription of carotenogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s remain poorly understood. Lycopene β-cyclases (LCYb) are critical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzyme</span></strong>s located at the branch point of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carotenoid</span></strong> biosynthetic pathway. Here, we used the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promoter</span></strong> sequence of <i>LCYb1</i> as bait in a yeast one-hybrid screen for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promoter</span></strong>-binding proteins from sweet orange (<i>Citrus sinensis</i>). This screen identified a MADS transcription factor, CsMADS6, that was coordinately expressed with fruit development and coloration. Acting as a nucleus-localized transcriptional activator, CsMADS6 directly bound the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promoter</span></strong> of <i>LCYb1</i> and activated its expression. Overexpression of <i>CsMADS6</i> in citrus calli increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carotenoid</span></strong> contents and induced the expression of <i>LCYb1</i> and other carotenogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, including <i>phytoene synthase</i> (<i>PSY</i>), <i>phytoene desaturase</i> (<i>PDS</i>), and <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carotenoid</span></strong> cleavage dioxygenase1</i> (<i>CCD1</i>). CsMADS6 up-regulated the expression of <i>PSY</i>, <i>PDS</i>, and <i>CCD1</i> by directly binding to their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promoter</span></strong>s, which suggested the multitargeted regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carotenoid</span></strong> metabolism by CsMADS6. In addition, the ectopic expression of <i>CsMADS6</i> in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) affected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carotenoid</span></strong> contents and the expression of carotenogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. The sepals of <i>CsMADS6</i>-overexpressing tomato lines exhibited dramatic changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carotenoid</span></strong> profiles, accompanied by changes in plastid ultrastructure. Global transcriptome analysis of transgenic sepals revealed that CsMADS6 regulates a series of pathways that promote increases in flux through the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carotenoid</span></strong> pathway. Overall, these findings establish that CsMADS6 directly regulates <i>LCYb1</i> and other carotenogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s to coordinately and positively modulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carotenoid</span></strong> metabolism in plants, which may provide strategies to improve the nutritional quality of crops.</p>

Novel Stress-Inducible Antisense RNAs of Protein-Coding Loci Are Synthesized by RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase
<p>Our previous study identified approximately 6,000 abiotic stress-responsive noncoding transcripts existing on the antisense strand of protein-coding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s and implied that a type of antisense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> was synthesized from a sense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> template by <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> polymerase</i> (<i>RDR</i>). Expression analyses revealed that the expression of novel abiotic stress-induced antisense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> on 1,136 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> loci was reduced in the <i>rdr1/2/6</i> mutants. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>se protection indicated that the <i>RD29A</i> antisense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> and other RDR1/2/6-dependent antisense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>s are involved in the formation of ds<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>. The accumulation of stress-inducible antisense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> was decreased and increased in <i>dcp5</i> and <i>xrn4</i>, respectively, but not changed in <i>dcl2/3/4</i>, <i>nrpd1a</i> and <i>nrpd1b</i>. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>-seq analyses revealed that the majority of the RDR1/2/6-dependent antisense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> loci did not overlap with RDR1/2/6-dependent 20–30 nt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> loci. Additionally, <i>rdr1/2/6</i> mutants decreased the degradation rate of the sense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> and exhibited arrested root growth during the recovery stage following a drought stress, whereas <i>dcl2/3/4</i> mutants did not. Collectively, these results indicate that RDRs have stress-inducible antisense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> synthesis activity and a novel biological function that is different from the known endogenous small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> pathways from protein-coding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. These data reveal a novel mechanism of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> regulation during abiotic stress response that involves complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> degradation pathways.</p>

Gene expression kinetics governs stimulus-specific decoration of the <i>Salmonella</i> outer membrane
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A is the innermost component of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecule</span></strong>s that occupy the outer leaflet of the outer membrane in Gram-negative bacteria. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A is recognized by the host immune system and targeted by cationic antimicrobial compounds. In <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhimurium, the phosphates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A are chemically modified by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzyme</span></strong>s encoded by targets of the transcriptional regulator PmrA. These modifications increase resistance to the cationic peptide antibiotic polymyxin B by reducing the negative charge of the LPS. We report the mechanism by which <i>Salmonella</i> produces different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A profiles when PmrA is activated by low Mg<sup>2+</sup> versus a mildly acidic pH. Low Mg<sup>2+</sup> favored modification of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A phosphates with 4-amino-4-deoxy-<sc>l</sc>-aminoarabinose (<sc>l</sc>-Ara4N) by activating the regulatory protein PhoP, which initially increased the LPS negative charge by promoting transcription of <i>lpxT</i>, encoding an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzyme</span></strong> that adds an additional phosphate group to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A. Later, PhoP activated PmrA posttranslationally, resulting in expression of PmrA-activated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, including those encoding the LpxT inhibitor PmrR and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzyme</span></strong>s responsible for the incorporation of <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N. By contrast, a mildly acidic pH favored modification of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A phosphates with a mixture of <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N and phosphoethanolamine (pEtN) by simultaneously inducing the PhoP-activated <i>lpxT</i> and PmrA-activated <i>pmrR</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. Although <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N reduces the LPS negative charge more than does pEtN, modification of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A phosphates solely with <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N required a prior transient increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A negative charge. Our findings demonstrate how bacteria tailor their cell surface to different stresses, such as those faced inside phagocytes.</p>

Antagonistic Actions of FPA and IBM2 Regulate Transcript Processing from Genes Containing Heterochromatin
<p>Repressive epi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic marks, such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> and histone methylation, are sometimes located within <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intron</span></strong>s. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), INCREASE IN BONSAI METHYLATION2 (IBM2), an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>-binding protein containing a bromo-adjacent homology domain, is required to process functional transcript isoforms of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s carrying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intron</span></strong>ic heterochromatin. In a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic screen for suppressors of the <i>ibm2</i> mutation, we identified FPA, an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>-binding protein that promotes use of proximal polyadenylation sites in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s targeted by IBM2, including <i>IBM1</i> encoding an essential H3K9 histone demethylase and the disease resistance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> <i>RECOGNITION OF PERONOSPORA PARASITICA7</i>. Both IBM2 and FPA are involved in the processing of their common m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> targets: Transcription of IBM2 target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s is restored when <i>FPA</i> is mutated in <i>ibm2</i> and impaired in transgenic plants overexpressing <i>FPA</i>. By contrast, transposons targeted by IBM2 and localized outside <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intron</span></strong>s are not under this antagonistic control. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> methylation patterns of some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s and transposons are modified in <i>fpa</i> plants, including the large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intron</span></strong> of <i>IBM1</i>, but these changes are rather limited and reversed when the mutant is complemented, indicating that FPA has a restricted role in mediating silencing. These data reveal a complex regulation by IBM2 and FPA pathways in processing m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>s of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s bearing heterochromatic marks.</p>

ROS1-Dependent DNA Demethylation Is Required for ABA-Inducible <i>NIC3</i> Expression
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> methylation plays an important role in diverse developmental processes in many eukaryotes, including the response to environmental stress. Abscisic acid (ABA) is a plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormone</span></strong> that is up-regulated under stress. The involvement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> methylation in the ABA response has been reported but is poorly understood. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> demethylation is a reverse process of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> methylation and often induces structural changes of chromatin leading to transcriptional activation. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana)</i>, active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> demethylation depends on the activity of REPRESSOR OF SILENCING 1 (ROS1), which directly excises 5-methylcytosine from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong>. Here we showed that <i>ros1</i> mutants were hypersensitive to ABA during early seedling development and root elongation. Expression levels of some ABA-inducible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s were decreased in <i>ros1</i> mutants, and more than 60% of their proximal regions became hypermethylated, indicating that a subset of ABA-inducible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s are under the regulation of ROS1-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> demethylation. Notable among them is <i>NICOTINAMIDASE 3</i> (<i>NIC3</i>) that encodes an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzyme</span></strong> that converts nicotinamide to nicotinic acid in the NAD<sup>+</sup> salvage pathway. Many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzyme</span></strong>s in this pathway are known to be involved in stress responses. The <i>nic3</i> mutants display hypersensitivity to ABA, whereas overexpression of <i>NIC3</i> restores normal ABA responses. Our data suggest that <i>NIC3</i> is responsive to ABA but requires ROS1-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> demethylation at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promoter</span></strong> as a prerequisite to transcriptional activation. These findings suggest that ROS1-induced active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> demethylation maintains the active state of <i>NIC3</i> transcription in response to ABA.</p>

Genomic Insights into the Evolution of the Nicotine Biosynthesis Pathway in Tobacco<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>In tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nicotine</span></strong> is the predominant alkaloid. It is produced in the roots and accumulated mainly in the leaves. Jasmonates play a central signaling role in damage-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nicotine</span></strong> formation. The genome sequence of tobacco provides us an almost complete inventory of structural and regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nicotine</span></strong> pathway. Phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic and expression analyses revealed a series of structural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nicotine</span></strong> pathway, forming a regulon, under the control of jasmonate-responsive ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR (ERF) transcription factors. The duplication of NAD and polyamine metabolic pathways and the subsequent recruitment of duplicated primary metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nicotine</span></strong> biosynthesis regulon were suggested to be the drivers for pyridine and pyrrolidine ring formation steps early in the pathway. Transcriptional regulation by ERF and cooperatively acting MYC2 transcription factors are corroborated by the frequent occurrence of cognate cis-regulatory elements of the factors in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promoter</span></strong> regions of the downstream structural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. The allotetraploid tobacco has homologous clusters of <i>ERF</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s on different chromosomes, which are possibly derived from two ancestral diploids and include either <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nicotine</span></strong>-controlling <i>ERF189</i> or <i>ERF199</i>. A large chromosomal deletion was found within one allele of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nicotine</span></strong>-controlling <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nicotine</span></strong>2</i> locus, which is part of one of the <i>ERF</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters, and which has been used to breed tobacco cultivars with a low-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nicotine</span></strong> content.</p>

A human postcatalytic spliceosome structure reveals essential roles of metazoan factors for exon ligation
<p>During <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exon</span></strong> ligation, the <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> spliceosome recognizes the 3′-splice site (3′SS) of precursor messenger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> (pre-m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>) through non–Watson-Crick pairing with the 5′SS and the branch adenosine, in a conformation stabilized by Prp18 and Prp8. Here we present the 3.3-angstrom cryo–electron microscopy structure of a human postcatalytic spliceosome just after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exon</span></strong> ligation. The 3′SS docks at the active site through conserved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> interactions in the absence of Prp18. Unexpectedly, the metazoan-specific FAM32A directly bridges the 5′-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exon</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intron</span></strong> 3′SS of pre-m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> and promotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exon</span></strong> ligation, as shown by functional assays. CACTIN, SDE2, and NKAP—factors implicated in alte<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>tive splicing—further stabilize the catalytic conformation of the spliceosome during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exon</span></strong> ligation. Together these four proteins act as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exon</span></strong> ligation factors. Our study reveals how the human spliceosome has co-opted additional proteins to modulate a conserved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>-based mechanism for 3′SS selection and to potentially fine-tune alte<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>tive splicing at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exon</span></strong> ligation stage.</p>

Extracellular ATP Acts on Jasmonate Signaling to Reinforce Plant Defense
<p>Damaged cells send various signals to stimulate defense responses. Recent identification and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic studies of the plant purinoceptor, P2K1 (also known as DORN1), have demonstrated that extracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ATP</span></strong> is a signal involved in plant stress responses, including wounding, perhaps to evoke plant defense. However, it remains largely unknown how extracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ATP</span></strong> induces plant defense responses. Here, we demonstrate that extracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ATP</span></strong> induces plant defense mediated through activation of the intracellular signaling of jasmonate (JA), a well-characterized defense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormone</span></strong>. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ATP</span></strong> pretreatment induced resistance against the necrotrophic fungus, <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>. The induced resistance was enhanced in the P2K1 receptor overexpression line, but reduced in the receptor mutant, <i>dorn1</i>-<i>3</i>. Mining the transcriptome data revealed that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ATP</span></strong> induces a set of JA-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. In addition, the P2K1-associated coexpression network contains defense-related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, including those encoding jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins, which play key roles as repressors of JA signaling. We examined whether extracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ATP</span></strong> impacts the stability of JAZ1 in Arabidopsis. The results showed that the JAZ1 stability decreased in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ATP</span></strong> addition in a proteasome-dependent manner. This reduction required intracellular signaling via second messengers—cytosolic calcium, reactive oxygen species, and nitric oxide. Interestingly, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ATP</span></strong>-induced JAZ1 degradation was attenuated in the JA receptor mutant, <i>coi1</i>, but not in the JA biosynthesis mutant, <i>aos</i>, or upon addition of JA biosynthesis inhibitors. Immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ATP</span></strong> increases the interaction between COI1 and JAZ1, suggesting direct cross talk between extracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ATP</span></strong> and JA in intracellular signaling events. Taken together, these results suggest that extracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ATP</span></strong> signaling directly impacts the JA signaling pathway to maximize plant defense responses.</p>

Cytokinin Biosynthesis Promotes Cortical Cell Responses during Nodule Development
<p>Legume mutants have shown the requirement for receptor-mediated cytokinin signaling in symbiotic nodule organo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>sis. While the receptors are central regulators, cytokinin also is accumulated during early phases of symbiotic interaction, but the pathways involved have not yet been fully resolved. To identify the source, timing, and effect of this accumulation, we followed transcript levels of the cytokinin biosynthetic pathway <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in a sliding developmental zone of <i>Lotus japonicus</i> roots. <i>LjIpt2</i> and <i>LjLog4</i> were identified as the major contributors to the first cytokinin burst. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic dependence and Nod factor responsiveness of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s confirm that cytokinin biosynthesis is a key target of the common symbiosis pathway. The accumulation of <i>LjIpt2</i> and <i>LjLog4</i> transcripts occurs independent of the <i>LjLhk1</i> receptor during nodulation. Together with the rapid repression of both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s by cytokinin, this indicates that <i>LjIpt2</i> and <i>LjLog4</i> contribute to, rather than respond to, the initial cytokinin buildup. Analysis of the cytokinin response using the synthetic cytokinin sensor, <i>TCSn</i>, showed that this response occurs in cortical cells before spreading to the epidermis in <i>L. japonicus</i>. While mutant analysis identified redundancy in several biosynthesis families, we found that mutation of <i>LjIpt4</i> limits nodule numbers. Overexpression of <i>LjIpt3</i> or <i>LjLog4</i> alone was insufficient to produce the robust formation of spontaneous nodules. In contrast, overexpressing a complete cytokinin biosynthesis pathway leads to large, often fused spontaneous nodules. These results show the importance of cytokinin biosynthesis in initiating and balancing the requirement for cortical cell activation without uncontrolled cell proliferation.</p>

Genome-Wide Prediction of Metabolic Enzymes, Pathways, and Gene Clusters in Plants
<p>Plant metabolism underpins many traits of ecological and agronomic importance. Plants produce numerous compounds to cope with their environments but the biosynthetic pathways for most of these compounds have not yet been elucidated. To engineer and improve metabolic traits, we need comprehensive and accurate knowledge of the organization and regulation of plant metabolism at the genome scale. Here, we present a computational pipeline to identify metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzyme</span></strong>s, pathways, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters from a sequenced genome. Using this pipeline, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>rated metabolic pathway databases for 22 species and identified metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters from 18 species. This unified resource can be used to conduct a wide array of comparative studies of plant metabolism. Using the resource, we discovered a widespread occurrence of metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters in plants: 11,969 clusters from 18 species. The prevalence of metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters offers an intriguing possibility of an untapped source for uncovering new metabolite biosynthesis pathways. For example, more than 1,700 clusters contain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzyme</span></strong>s that could <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>rate a specialized metabolite scaffold (signature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzyme</span></strong>s) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzyme</span></strong>s that modify the scaffold (tailoring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzyme</span></strong>s). In four species with sufficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> expression data, we identified 43 highly coexpressed clusters that contain signature and tailoring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzyme</span></strong>s, of which eight were characterized previously to be functional pathways. Finally, we identified patterns of genome organization that implicate local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> duplication and, to a lesser extent, single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> transposition as having played roles in the evolution of plant metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters.</p>

DNA-induced liquid phase condensation of cGAS activates innate immune signaling
<p>The binding of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> to cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS) leads to the production of the secondary messenger cyclic GMP–AMP (cGAMP), which activates innate immune responses. We have shown that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> binding to cGAS robustly induced the formation of liquidlike droplets in which cGAS was activated. The disordered and positively charged cGAS N terminus enhanced cGAS-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> phase separation by increasing the valencies of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> binding. Long <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> was more efficient in promoting cGAS liquid phase separation and cGAS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzyme</span></strong> activity than short <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong>.

Paralogs of the C-Terminal Domain of the Cyanobacterial Orange Carotenoid Protein Are Carotenoid Donors to Helical Carotenoid Proteins
<p>The photoactive Orange <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carotenoid</span></strong> Protein (OCP) photoprotects cyanobacteria cells by quenching singlet oxygen and excess excitation energy. Its N-terminal domain is the active part of the protein, and the C-terminal domain regulates the activity. Recently, the characteristics of a family of soluble <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carotenoid</span></strong>-binding proteins (Helical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carotenoid</span></strong> Proteins [HCPs]), paralogs of the N-terminal domain of OCP, were described. Bioinformatics studies also revealed the existence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s coding for homologs of CTD. Here, we show that the latter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s encode <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carotenoid</span></strong> proteins (CTDHs). This family of proteins contains two subgroups with distinct characteristics. One CTDH of each clade was further characterized, and they proved to be very good singlet oxygen quenchers. When synthesized in <i>Escherichia coli</i> or <i>Synechocystis</i> PCC 6803, CTDHs formed dimers that share a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carotenoid</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecule</span></strong> and are able to transfer their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carotenoid</span></strong> to apo-HCPs and apo-OCP. The CTDHs from clade 2 have a cysteine in position 103. A disulfide bond is easily formed between the monomers of the dimer preventing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carotenoid</span></strong> transfer. This suggests that the transfer of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carotenoid</span></strong> could be redox regulated in clade 2 CTDH. We also demonstrate here that apo-OCPs and apo-CTDHs are able to take the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carotenoid</span></strong> directly from membranes, while HCPs are unable to do so. HCPs need the presence of CTDH to become holo-proteins. We propose that, in cyanobacteria, the CTDHs are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carotenoid</span></strong> donors to HCPs.</p>

Cytokinin-Auxin Crosstalk in the Gynoecial Primordium Ensures Correct Domain Patterning<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) gynoecium consists of two congenitally fused carpels made up of two lateral valve domains and two medial domains, which retain meristematic properties and later fuse to produce the female reproductive structures vital for fertilization. Polar auxin transport (PAT) is important for setting up distinct apical auxin signaling domains in the early floral meristem remnants allowing for lateral domain identity and outgrowth. Crosstalk between auxin and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Cytokinin</span></strong> plays an important role in the development of other meristematic tissues, but <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormone</span></strong> interaction studies to date have focused on more accessible later-stage gynoecia and the spatiotemporal interactions pivotal for patterning of early gynoecium primordia remain unknown. Focusing on the earliest stages, we propose a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Cytokinin</span></strong>-auxin feedback model during early gynoecium patterning and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormone</span></strong> homeostasis. Our results suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Cytokinin</span></strong> positively regulates auxin signaling in the incipient gynoecial primordium and strengthen the concept that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Cytokinin</span></strong> regulates auxin homeostasis during gynoecium development. Specifically, medial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Cytokinin</span></strong> promotes auxin biosynthesis components [<i>YUCCA1</i>/<i>4</i> (<i>YUC1</i>/<i>4</i>)] in, and PINFORMED7 (PIN7)-mediated auxin efflux from, the medial domain. The resulting laterally focused auxin signaling triggers <i>ARABIDOPSIS HISTIDINE PHOSPHOTRANSFER PROTEIN6</i> (<i>AHP6</i>), which then represses <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Cytokinin</span></strong> signaling in a PAT-dependent feedback. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Cytokinin</span></strong> also down-regulates PIN3, promoting auxin accumulation in the apex. The <i>yuc1</i>, <i>yuc4</i>, and <i>ahp6</i> mutants are hypersensitive to exogenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Cytokinin</span></strong> and 1-napthylphthalamic acid (NPA), highlighting their role in mediolateral gynoecium patterning. In summary, these mechanisms self-regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Cytokinin</span></strong> and auxin signaling domains, ensuring correct domain specification and gynoecium development.</p>

Plant-Specific Preprotein and Amino Acid Transporter Proteins Are Required for tRNA Import into Mitochondria
<p>A variety of eukaryotes, in particular plants, do not contain the required number of t<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>s to support the translation of mitochondria-encoded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s and thus need to import t<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>s from the cytosol. This study identified two Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) proteins, Tric1 and Tric2 (for t<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> import component), which on simultaneous inactivation by T-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> insertion lines displayed a severely delayed and chlorotic growth phenotype and significantly reduced t<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> import capacity into isolated mitochondria. The predicted t<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>-binding domain of Tric1 and Tric2, a sterile-α-motif at the C-terminal end of the protein, was required to restore t<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> uptake ability in mitochondria of complemented plants. The purified predicted t<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>-binding domain binds the T-arm of the t<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> for alanine with conserved lysine residues required for binding. T-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> inactivation of both Tric proteins further resulted in an increase in the in vitro rate of in organello protein synthesis, which was mediated by a reorganization of the nuclear transcriptome, in particular of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s encoding a variety of proteins required for mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> expression at both the transcriptional and translational levels. The characterization of Tric1/2 provides mechanistic insight into the process of t<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> import into mitochondria and supports the theory that the t<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> import pathway resulted from the repurposing of a preexisting protein import apparatus.</p>

CTDGFinder: A Novel Homology-Based Algorithm for Identifying Closely Spaced Clusters of Tandemly Duplicated Genes
<p>Closely spaced clusters of tandemly duplicated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s (CTDGs) contribute to the diversity of many phenotypes, including chemosensation, snake venom, and animal body plans. CTDGs have traditionally been identified subjectively as genomic neighborhoods containing several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> duplicates in close proximity; however, CTDGs are often highly variable with respect to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> number, intergenic distance, and synteny. This lack of formal definition hampers the study of CTDG evolutionary dynamics and the discovery of novel CTDGs in the exponentially growing body of genomic data. To address this gap, we developed a novel homology-based algorithm, CTDGFinder, which formalizes and automates the identification of CTDGs by examining the physical distribution of individual members of families of duplicated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s across chromosomes. Application of CTDGFinder accurately identified CTDGs for many well-known <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters (e.g., Hox and beta-globin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters) in the human, mouse and 20 other mammalian genomes. Differences between previously annotated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters and our inferred CTDGs were due to the exclusion of nonhomologs that have historically been considered parts of specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters, the inclusion or absence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s between the CTDGs and their corresponding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters, and the splitting of certain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters into distinct CTDGs. Examination of human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s showing tissue-specific enhancement of their expression by CTDGFinder identified members of several well-known <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters (e.g., cytochrome P450s and olfactory receptors) and revealed that they were unequally distributed across tissues. By formalizing and automating CTDG identification, CTDGFinder will facilitate understanding of CTDG evolutionary dynamics, their functional implications, and how they are associated with phenotypic diversity.</p>

The Evolution of Innate Immune Genes: Purifying and Balancing Selection on β-Defensins in Waterfowl
<p>In disease dynamics, high immune <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> diversity can confer a selective advantage to hosts in the face of a rapidly evolving and diverse pathogen fauna. This is supported empirically for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s involved in pathogen recognition and signalling. In contrast, effector <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s involved in pathogen clearance may be more constrained. β-Defensins are innate immune effector <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s; their main mode of action is via disruption of microbial membranes. Here, five β-defensin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s were characterized in mallards (<i>Anas platyrhynchos</i>) and other waterfowl; key reservoir species for many zoonotic diseases. All five <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s showed remarkably low diversity at the individual-, population-, and species-level. Furthermore, there was widespread sharing of identical alleles across species divides. Thus, specific β-defensin alleles were maintained not only spatially but also over long temporal scales, with many amino acid residues being fixed across all species investigated. Purifying selection to maintain individual, highly efficacious alleles was the primary evolutionary driver of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in waterfowl. However, we also found evidence for balancing selection acting on the most recently duplicated β-defensin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> (<i>AvBD3b</i>). For this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>, we found that amino acid replacements were more likely to be radical changes, suggesting that duplication of β-defensin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s allows exploration of wider functional space. Structural conservation to maintain function appears to be crucial for avian β-defensin effector <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecule</span></strong>s, resulting in low tolerance for new allelic variants. This contrasts with other types of innate immune <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, such as receptor and signalling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecule</span></strong>s, where balancing selection to maintain allelic diversity has been shown to be a strong evolutionary force.</p>

The Evolution of Genes within Genes and the Control of DNA Replication in Microviruses
<p>Single-stranded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong>(ss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong>) viral life cycles must balance double-stranded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> (ds<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong>) and ss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> biosynthesis. Previously published in vitro results suggest that microvirus C and host cell SSB proteins play antagonistic roles to achieve this balance. To investigate this in vivo, microvirus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> replication was characterized in cells expressing cloned C or <i>ssb</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, which would presumably alter the C:SSB protein ratios. Representatives of each microvirus clade (φX174, G4, and α3) were used in these studies. α3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> replication was significantly more complex. Results suggested that the recognized α3 C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> (C<sub>S</sub>: small) is one of two C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. A larger 5′ extended <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> could be translated from an upstream GTG start codon (C<sub>B</sub>: big). Wild-type α3 acquired resistance to elevated SSB levels by mutations that exclusively frameshifted the C<sub>B</sub> reading frame, whereas mutations in the origin of replication conferred resistance to elevated C protein levels. Expression of either the cloned C<sub>B</sub> or C<sub>S</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> complemented <i>am(C)</i> mutants, demonstrating functional redundancy. When the C<sub>S</sub> start codon was eliminated, strains were only viable if an additional amber mutation was placed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> C and propagated in an informational suppressing host. Thus, C<sub>B</sub> protein likely reaches toxic levels in the absence of C<sub>S</sub> translation. This phenomenon may have driven the evolution of the C<sub>S</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> within the larger C<sub>B</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> and could constitute a unique mechanism of regulation. Furthermore, cross-complementation data suggested that interactions between the α3 C and other viral proteins have evolved enough specificity to biochemically isolate its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> replication from G4 and φX174.</p>

The pseudokinase domains of guanylyl cyclase–A and –B allosterically increase the affinity of their catalytic domains for substrate
<p>Natriuretic peptides regulate multiple physiologic systems by activating transmembrane receptors containing intracellular guanylyl cyclase domains, such as GC-A and GC-B, also known as Npr1 and Npr2, respectively. Both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzyme</span></strong>s contain an intracellular, phosphorylated pseudokinase domain (PKD) critical for activation of the C-terminal cGMP-synthesizing guanylyl cyclase domain. Because <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ATP</span></strong> allosterically activates GC-A and GC-B, we investigated how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ATP</span></strong> binding to the PKD influenced guanylyl cyclase activity. Molecular modeling indicated that all the residues of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ATP</span></strong>-binding site of the prototypical kinase PKA, except the catalytic aspartate, are conserved in the PKDs of GC-A and GC-B. Kinase-inactivating alanine substitutions for the invariant lysine in subdomain II or the aspartate in the DYG-loop of GC-A and GC-B failed to decrease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzyme</span></strong> phosphate content, consistent with the PKDs lacking kinase activity. In contrast, both mutations reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzyme</span></strong> activation by blocking the ability of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ATP</span></strong> to decrease the Michaelis constant without affecting peptide-dependent activation. The analogous lysine-to-alanine substitution in a glutamate-substituted phosphomimetic mutant form of GC-B also reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzyme</span></strong> activity, consistent with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ATP</span></strong> stimulating guanylyl cyclase activity through an allosteric, phosphorylation-independent mechanism. Mutations designed to rigidify the conserved regulatory or catalytic spines within the PKDs increased guanylyl cyclase activity, increased sensitivity to natriuretic peptide, or reduced the Michaelis constant in the absence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ATP</span></strong>, consistent with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ATP</span></strong> binding stabilizing the PKD in a conformation analogous to that of catalytically active kinases. We conclude that allosteric mechanisms evolutionarily conserved in the PKDs promote the catalytic activation of transmembrane guanylyl cyclases.</p>

<i>Arabidopsis</i> ATXR2 deposits H3K36me3 at the promoters of <i>LBD</i> genes to facilitate cellular dedifferentiation
<p>Cellular dedifferentiation, the transition of differentiated somatic cells to pluripotent stem cells, ensures developmental plasticity and contributes to wound healing in plants. Wounding induces cells to form a mass of unorganized pluripotent cells called callus at the wound site. Explanted cells can also form callus tissues in vitro. Reversible cellular differentiation-dedifferentiation processes in higher eukaryotes are controlled mainly by chromatin modifications. We demonstrate that ARABIDOPSIS TRITHORAX-RELATED 2 (ATXR2), a histone lysine methyltransferase that promotes the accumulation of histone H3 proteins that are trimethylated on lysine 36 (H3K36me3) during callus formation, promotes early stages of cellular dedifferentiation through activation of <i>LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES DOMAIN</i> (<i>LBD</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. The <i>LBD</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> are activated during cellular dedifferentiation to enhance the formation of callus. Leaf explants from <i>Arabidopsis atxr2</i> mutants exhibited a reduced ability to form callus and a substantial reduction in <i>LBD</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> expression. ATXR2 bound to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promoter</span></strong>s of <i>LBD</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s and was required for the deposition of H3K36me3 at these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promoter</span></strong>s. ATXR2 was recruited to <i>LBD</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promoter</span></strong>s by the transcription factors AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 7 (ARF7) and ARF19. Leaf explants from <i>arf7-1arf19-2</i> double mutants were defective in callus formation and showed reduced H3K36me3 accumulation at <i>LBD</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promoter</span></strong>s. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic analysis provided further support that ARF7 and ARF19 were required for the ability of ATXR2 to promote the expression of <i>LBD</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. These observations indicate that the ATXR2-ARF-LBD axis is key for the epi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic regulation of callus formation in <i>Arabidopsis</i>.</p>

Control of Cognate Sense mRNA Translation by cis-Natural Antisense RNAs
<p>Cis-Natural Antisense Transcripts (cis-NATs), which overlap protein coding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s and are transcribed from the opposite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> strand, constitute an important group of noncoding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>s. Whereas several examples of cis-NATs regulating the expression of their cognate sense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> are known, most cis-NATs function by altering the steady-state level or structure of m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> via changes in transcription, m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> stability, or splicing, and very few cases involve the regulation of sense m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> translation. This study was designed to systematically search for cis-NATs influencing cognate sense m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> translation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Establishment of a pipeline relying on sequencing of total polyA<sup>+</sup> and polysomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> from Arabidopsis grown under various conditions (i.e. nutrient deprivation and phyto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormone</span></strong> treatments) allowed the identification of 14 cis-NATs whose expression correlated either positively or negatively with cognate sense m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> translation.

RNA Polymerase II Read-Through Promotes Expression of Neighboring Genes in SAL1-PAP-XRN Retrograde Signaling
<p>In plants, the molecular function(s) of the nucleus-localized 5′-3′ EXORIBONUCLEASES (XRNs) are unclear; however, their activity is reported to have a significant effect on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> expression and SAL1-mediated retrograde signaling. Using parallel analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> ends, we documented a dramatic increase in uncapped <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> substrates of the XRNs in both <i>sal1</i> and <i>xrn2xrn3</i> mutants. We found that a major consequence of reducing SAL1 or XRN activity was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> Polymerase II 3′ read-through. This occurred at 72% of expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, demonstrating a major genome-wide role for the XRN-torpedo model of transcription termination in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Read-through is speculated to have a negative effect on transcript abundance; however, we did not observe this. Rather, we identified a strong association between read-through and increased transcript abundance of tandemly orientated downstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, strongly correlated with the proximity (less than 1,000 bp) and expression of the upstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>. We observed read-through in the proximity of 903 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s up-regulated in the <i>sal1-8</i> retrograde signaling mutant; thus, this phenomenon may account directly for up to 23% of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s up-regulated in <i>sal1-8</i>.

Engineering Artificial MicroRNAs for Multiplex Gene Silencing and Simplified Transgenic Screen

Cytokinin Targets Auxin Transport to Promote Shoot Branching
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Cytokinin</span></strong> promotes shoot branching by activating axillary buds, but its mechanism of action in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) in this process is unclear. We have shown previously that a hextuple mutant lacking a clade of type-A Arabidopsis Response Regulators (ARRs) known to act in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Cytokinin</span></strong> signaling has reduced shoot branching compared with the wild type. Since these proteins typically act as negative regulators of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Cytokinin</span></strong> signaling, this is an unexpected result. To explore this paradox more deeply, we characterized the effects of loss of function of the type-B ARR, ARR1, which positively regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Cytokinin</span></strong>-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> expression. The <i>arr1</i> mutant has increased branching, consistent with a role antagonistic to the type-A ARRs but in apparent conflict with the known positive role for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Cytokinin</span></strong> in bud activation. We show that the <i>arr</i> branching phenotypes correlate with increases in stem auxin transport and steady-state levels of the auxin export proteins PIN3 and PIN7 on the plasma membrane of xylem-associated cells in the main stem. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Cytokinin</span></strong> treatment results in an increased accumulation of PIN3, PIN7, and the closely related PIN4 within several hours, and loss of <i>PIN3</i>, <i>PIN4</i>, and <i>PIN7</i> can partially rescue the <i>arr1</i> branching phenotype. This suggests that there are multiple signaling pathways for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Cytokinin</span></strong> in bud outgrowth; one of these pathways regulates PIN proteins in shoots, independently of the canonical signaling function of the <i>ARR</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s tested here. A hypothesis consistent with the <i>arr</i> shoot phenotypes is that feedback control of biosynthesis leads to altered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Cytokinin</span></strong> accumulation, driving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Cytokinin</span></strong> signaling via this pathway.</p>

Trehalose 6-Phosphate Regulates Photosynthesis and Assimilate Partitioning in Reproductive Tissue<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Transgenic maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) that expresses rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) <i>TREHALOSE PHOSPHATE PHOSPHATASE1</i> (<i>TPP1</i>) from the rice <i>MADS6</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promoter</span></strong>, which is active over the flowering period, produces higher yields than wild type. This yield increase occurs with or without drought conditions during flowering. To understand the mechanistic basis of the increased yield, we characterized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> expression and metabolite profiles in leaves and developing female reproductive tissue, comprising florets, node, pith, and shank, over the flowering period with and without drought. The <i>MADS6</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promoter</span></strong> was most active in the vasculature, particularly phloem companion cells in florets and pith, consistent with the largest decreases in trehalose 6-phosphate (T6P) levels (2- to 3-fold) being found in pith and florets. Low T6P led to decreased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> expression for primary metabolism and increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> expression for secondary metabolism, particularly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>-related pathways. Despite similar changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> expression, the pith and floret displayed opposing assimilate profiles: sugars, sugar phosphates, amino acids, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s increased in florets, but decreased in pith. Possibly explaining this assimilate distribution, seven <i>SWEET</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s were found to be up-regulated in the transgenic plants. SnRK1 activity and the expression of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> for the SnRK1 beta subunit, expression of SnRK1 marker <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, and endogenous trehalose pathway <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s were also altered. Furthermore, leaves of the transgenic maize maintained a higher photosynthetic rate for a longer period compared to wild type. In conclusion, we found that decreasing T6P in reproductive tissues down-regulates primary metabolism and up-regulates secondary metabolism, resulting in different metabolite profiles in component tissues. Our data implicate T6P/ SnRK1 as a major regulator of whole-plant resource allocation for crop yield improvement.</p>

Wounding Triggers Callus Formation via Dynamic Hormonal and Transcriptional Changes
<p>Wounding is a primary trigger of organ re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>ration, but how wound stress reactivates cell proliferation and promotes cellular reprogramming remains elusive. In this study, we combined transcriptome analysis with quantitative hormonal analysis to investigate how wounding induces callus formation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Our time course <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>-seq analysis revealed that wounding induces dynamic transcriptional changes, starting from rapid stress responses followed by the activation of metabolic processes and protein synthesis and subsequent activation of cell cycle regulators. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> ontology analyses further uncovered that wounding modifies the expression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormone</span></strong> biosynthesis and response <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, and quantitative analysis of endogenous plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormone</span></strong>s revealed accumulation of cytokinin prior to callus formation. Mutants defective in cytokinin synthesis and signaling display reduced efficiency in callus formation, indicating that de novo synthesis of cytokinin is critical for wound-induced callus formation. We further demonstrate that type-B ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR-mediated cytokinin signaling regulates the expression of <i>CYCLIN D3;1</i> (<i>CYCD3;1</i>) and that mutations in <i>CYCD3;1</i> and its homologs <i>CYCD3;2</i> and <i>3</i> cause defects in callus formation. In addition to these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormone</span></strong>-mediated changes, our transcriptome data uncovered that wounding activates multiple developmental regulators, and we found novel roles of ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR 115 and PLETHORA3 (PLT3), PLT5, and PLT7 in callus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>ration. All together, these results provide novel mechanistic insights into how wounding reactivates cell proliferation during callus formation.</p>

An Ethylene-Induced Regulatory Module Delays Flower Senescence by Regulating Cytokinin Content
<p>In many plant species, including rose (<i>Rosa hybrida</i>), flower senescence is promoted by the gaseous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormone</span></strong> ethylene and inhibited by the cytokinin (CTK) class of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormone</span></strong>s. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these antagonistic effects are not well understood. In this study, we characterized the association between a patho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>sis-related PR-10 family <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> from rose (<i>RhPR10.1</i>) and the hormonal regulation of flower senescence. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR analysis showed that <i>RhPR10.1</i> was expressed at high levels during senescence in different floral organs, including petal, sepal, receptacle, stamen, and pistil, and that expression was induced by ethylene treatment. Silencing of <i>RhPR10.1</i> expression in rose plants by virus-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> silencing accelerated flower senescence, which was accompanied by a higher ion leakage rate in the petals, as well as increased expression of the senescence marker <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> <i>RhSAG12</i>. CTK content and the expression of three CTK signaling pathway <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s were reduced in <i>RhPR10.1</i>-silenced plants, and the accelerated rate of petal senescence that was apparent in the <i>RhPR10.1</i>-silenced plants was restored to normal levels by CTK treatment. Finally, RhHB6, a homeodomain-Leu zipper I transcription factor, was observed to bind to the <i>RhPR10.1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promoter</span></strong>, and silencing of its expression also promoted flower senescence. Our results reveal an ethylene-induced RhHB6-RhPR10.1 regulatory module that functions as a brake of ethylene-promoted senescence through increasing the CTK content.</p>

Expansion of Secretin-Like G Protein-Coupled Receptors and Their Peptide Ligands via Local Duplications Before and After Two Rounds of Whole-Genome Duplication
<p>In humans, the secretin-like G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family comprises 15 members with 18 corresponding peptide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. Although members have been identified in a large variety of vertebrate and nonvertebrate species, the origin and relationship of these proteins remain unresolved. To address this issue, we employed large-scale genome comparisons to identify genome fragments with conserved synteny and matched these fragments to linkage groups in reconstructed early gnathostome ancestral chromosomes (<i>GAC</i>). This genome comparison revealed that most receptor and peptide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s were clustered in three <i>GAC</i> linkage groups and suggested that the ancestral forms of five peptide subfamilies (corticotropin-releasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormone</span></strong>-like, calcitonin-like, parathyroid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormone</span></strong>-like, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glucagon</span></strong>-like, and growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormone</span></strong>-releasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormone</span></strong>-like) and their cognate receptor families emerged through tandem local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> duplications before two rounds (2R) of whole-genome duplication. These subfamily <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s have, then, been amplified by 2R whole-genome duplication, followed by additional local duplications and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> loss prior to the divergence of land vertebrates and teleosts. This study delineates a possible evolutionary scenario for whole secretin-like peptide and receptor family members and may shed light on evolutionary mechanisms for expansion of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> family with a large number of paralogs.</p>

The tissue-specific transcriptomic landscape of the mid-gestational mouse embryo
<p>Differential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> expression is a prerequisite for the formation of multiple cell types from the fertilized egg during embryo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>sis. Understanding the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> regulatory networks controlling cellular differentiation requires the identification of crucial differentially expressed control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s and, ideally, the determination of the complete transcriptomes of each individual cell type. Here, we have analyzed the transcriptomes of six major tissues dissected from mid-gestational (TS12) mouse embryos. Approximately one billion reads derived by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>-seq analysis provided extended transcript lengths, novel first <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exon</span></strong>s and alte<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>tive transcripts of known <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. We have identified 1375 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s showing tissue-specific expression, providing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> signatures for each of the six tissues. In addition, we have identified 1403 novel putative long noncoding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> loci, 439 of which show differential expression. Our analysis provides the first complete transcriptome data for the mouse embryo.

Ssrp1a controls organogenesis by promoting cell cycle progression and RNA synthesis
<p>Tightly controlled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> replication and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> transcription are essential for differentiation and tissue growth in multicellular organisms. Histone chaperones, including the FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) complex, are central for these processes and act by mediating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> access through nucleosome reorganisation. However, their roles in vertebrate organo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>sis are poorly understood. Here, we report the identification of zebrafish mutants for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> encoding Structure specific recognition protein 1a (Ssrp1a), which, together with Spt16, forms the FACT heterodimer. Focussing on the liver and eye, we show that zygotic Ssrp1a is essential for proliferation and differentiation during organo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>sis. Specifically, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> expression indicative of progressive organ differentiation is disrupted and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> transcription is globally reduced. Ssrp1a-deficient embryos exhibit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> synthesis defects and prolonged S phase, uncovering a role distinct from that of Spt16, which promotes G<sub>1</sub> phase progression. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> deletion/replacement experiments in <i>Drosophila</i> show that Ssrp1b, Ssrp1a and N-terminal Ssrp1a, equivalent to the yeast homologue Pob3, can substitute <i>Drosophila</i> Ssrp function. These data suggest that (1) Ssrp1b does not compensate for Ssrp1a loss in the zebrafish embryo, probably owing to insufficient expression levels, and (2) despite fundamental structural differences, the mechanisms mediating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> accessibility by FACT are conserved between yeast and metazoans. We propose that the essential functions of Ssrp1a in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> replication and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> transcription, together with its dynamic spatiotemporal expression, ensure organ-specific differentiation and proportional growth, which are crucial for the forming embryo.</p>

K63-linked polyubiquitin chains bind to DNA to facilitate DNA damage repair
<p>Polyubiquitylation is canonically viewed as a posttranslational modification that governs protein stability or protein-protein interactions, in which distinct polyubiquitin linkages ultimately determine the fate of modified protein(s). We explored whether polyubiquitin chains have any nonprotein-related function. Using in vitro pull-down assays with synthetic materials, we found that polyubiquitin chains with the Lys<sup>63</sup> (K63) linkage bound to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> through a motif we called the “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong>-interacting patch” (DIP), which is composed of the adjacent residues Thr<sup>9</sup>, Lys<sup>11</sup>, and Glu<sup>34</sup>. Upon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> damage, the binding of K63-linked polyubiquitin chains to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> enhanced the recruitment of repair factors through their interaction with an Ile<sup>44</sup> patch in ubiquitin to facilitate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> repair. Furthermore, experimental or cancer patient–derived mutations within the DIP impaired the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> binding capacity of ubiquitin and subsequently attenuated K63-linked polyubiquitin chain accumulation at sites of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> damage, thereby resulting in defective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> repair and increased cellular sensitivity to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong>-damaging agents. Our results therefore highlight a critical physiological role for K63-linked polyubiquitin chains in binding to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> to facilitate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> damage repair.</p>

Learning-dependent chromatin remodeling highlights noncoding regulatory regions linked to autism
<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder that is associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic risk factors. Most human disease-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are not located in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s but rather are in regulatory regions that control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> expression. The function of regulatory regions is determined through epi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic mechanisms. Parallels between the cellular basis of development and the formation of long-term memory have long been recognized, particularly the role of epi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic mechanisms in both processes. We analyzed how learning alters chromatin accessibility in the mouse hippocampus using a new high-throughput sequencing bioinformatics strategy we call DEScan (differential enrichment scan). DEScan, which enabled the analysis of data from epigenomic experiments containing multiple replicates, revealed changes in chromatin accessibility at 2365 regulatory regions—most of which were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promoter</span></strong>s. Learning-regulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promoter</span></strong>s were active during forebrain development in mice and were enriched in epi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic modifications indicative of bivalent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promoter</span></strong>s. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promoter</span></strong>s were disproportionally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intron</span></strong>ic, showed a complex relationship with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> expression and alternative splicing during memory consolidation and retrieval, and were enriched in the data set relative to known ASD risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. Genotyping in a clinical cohort within one of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promoter</span></strong>s (<i>SHANK3</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promoter</span></strong> 6) revealed that the SNP rs6010065 was associated with ASD. Our data support the idea that learning recapitulates development at the epi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic level and demonstrate that behaviorally induced epi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic changes in mice can highlight regulatory regions relevant to brain disorders in patients.</p>

STING is an essential mediator of the Ku70-mediated production of IFN-λ1 in response to exogenous DNA
<p>We previously identified Ku70, a subunit of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> repair protein complex, as a cytosolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> sensor that induces the production of interferon-λ1 (IFN-λ1) by human primary cells and cell lines. IFN-λ1 is a type III IFN and has similar antiviral activity to that of the type I IFNs (IFN-α and IFN-β). We observed that human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells, which are deficient in the innate immune adaptor protein STING (stimulator of IFN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s), did not produce IFN-λ1 in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> unless they were reconstituted with STING. Conversely, parental HEK 293 cells produced IFN-λ1 after they were exposed to exogenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong>; however, when STING was knocked out in the HEK 293 cells through the CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas9 genome editing system, they lost this response. Through confocal microscopy, we demonstrated that endogenous Ku70 was located in the nucleus and then translocated to the cytoplasm upon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> exposure to form a complex with STING. Additionally, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> binding domain of Ku70 was essential for formation of the Ku70-STING complex. Knocking down STING in primary human macrophages inhibited their ability to produce IFN-λ1 in response to transfection with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> or infection with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> virus HSV-2 (herpes simplex virus–2). Together, these data suggest that STING mediates the Ku70-mediated IFN-λ1 innate immune response to exogenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> virus infection.</p>

<i>OsMADS6</i> Controls Flower Development by Activating Rice <i>FACTOR OF DNA METHYLATION LIKE1</i>
<p><i>OsMADS6</i>, an ancient <i>AGAMOUS-LIKE6</i> (<i>AGL6</i>)-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>, has essential functions in specifying floral organ and meristem identity in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). However, how <i>AGL6</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s control flower development remains largely unknown. In this study, we report that OsMADS6 directly targets <i>FACTOR OF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> METHYLATION LIKE 1</i> (<i>OsFDML1</i>), a rice homolog of the <i>SUPPRESSOR OF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> SILENCING3</i>-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> <i>FACTOR OF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> METHYLATION 1</i> (<i>FDM1</i>) from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Arabidopsis <i>FDM1</i> is involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>-directed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> methylation and <i>OsFDML1</i> regulates flower development. The expression of <i>OsFDML1</i> overlaps with that of <i>OsMADS6</i> in the palea primordia and the ovule, and OsMADS6 directly promotes <i>OsFDML1</i> expression through binding to regions containing putative CArG motifs within the <i>OsFDML1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promoter</span></strong> during rice spikelet development. Consistent with the phenotypes of <i>osmads6</i> mutants, the <i>osfdml1</i> mutants showed floral defects, including altered palea identity with lemma-like shape containing no marginal region of palea, increased numbers of stigmas and fused carpels, and meristem indeterminacy. Moreover, transgenic plants overexpressing <i>OsFDML1</i> displayed floral defects, such as abnormal paleae. Phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic analysis showed that <i>OsFDML1</i> homologs exist only in terrestrial plants. In addition, protein-protein interaction assays showed that OsFDML1 interacts with its close paralog OsFDML2, similar to the activity of OsFDML1 homologs in Arabidopsis. These results provide insight into how the ancient <i>AGL6</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> regulates floral development.</p>

ALY RNA-Binding Proteins Are Required for Nucleocytosolic mRNA Transport and Modulate Plant Growth and Development
<p>The regulated transport of m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>s from the cell nucleus to the cytosol is a critical step linking transcript synthesis and processing with translation. However, in plants, only a few of the factors that act in the m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> export pathway have been functionally characterized. Flowering plant genomes encode several members of the ALY protein family, which function as m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> export factors in other organisms. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) ALY1 to ALY4 are commonly detected in root and leaf cells, but they are differentially expressed in reproductive tissue. Moreover, the subnuclear distribution of ALY1/2 differs from that of ALY3/4. ALY1 binds with higher affinity to single-stranded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> than double-stranded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> and single-stranded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> and interacts preferentially with 5-methylcytosine-modified single-stranded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>. Compared with the full-length protein, the individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> recognition motif of ALY1 binds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> only weakly. ALY proteins interact with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> helicase UAP56, indicating a link to the m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> export machinery. Consistently, ALY1 complements the lethal phenotype of yeast cells lacking the ALY1 ortholog Yra1. Whereas individual <i>aly</i> mutants have a wild-type appearance, disruption of <i>ALY1</i> to <i>ALY4</i> in <i>4xaly</i> plants causes vegetative and reproductive defects, including strongly reduced growth, altered flower morphology, as well as abnormal ovules and female gametophytes, causing reduced seed production. Moreover, polyadenylated m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>s accumulate in the nuclei of <i>4xaly</i> cells. Our results highlight the requirement of efficient m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> nucleocytosolic transport for proper plant growth and development and indicate that ALY1 to ALY4 act partly redundantly in this process; however, differences in expression and subnuclear localization suggest distinct functions.</p>

The <i>TRAF Mediated Gametogenesis Progression</i> (<i>TRAMGaP</i>) Gene Is Required for Megaspore Mother Cell Specification and Gametophyte Development
<p>In plants, the role of TRAF-like proteins with meprin and the TRAF homology (MATH) domain is far from clear. In animals, these proteins serve as adapter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecule</span></strong>s to mediate signal transduction from Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor to downstream effector <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecule</span></strong>s. A seed-sterile mutant with a disrupted TRAF-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> (<i>At5g26290</i>) exhibiting aberrant gameto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>sis led us to investigate the developmental role of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The mutation was semidominant and resulted in pleiotropic phenotypes with such features as short siliques with fewer ovules, pollen and seed sterility, altered Megaspore Mother Cell (MMC) specification, and delayed programmed cell death in megaspores and the tapetum, features that overlapped those in other well-characterized mutants. Seed sterility and reduced transmission frequency of the mutant alleles pointed to a dual role, sporophytic and gametophytic, for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> on the male side. The mutant also showed altered expression of various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s involved in such cellular and developmental pathways as regulation of transcription, biosynthesis and transport of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormone</span></strong>-mediated signaling, and gametophyte development. The diverse phenotypes of the mutant and the altered expression of key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s related to gametophyte and seed development could be explained based on the functional similarly between <i>At5g26290</i> and MATH-BTB domain proteins that modulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> expression through the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome system. These results show a novel link between a TRAF-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> and reproductive development in plants.</p>

Roles of miR319 and TCP Transcription Factors in Leaf Development
<p>Sophisticated regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> expression, including micro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>s (mi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>s) and their target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, is required for leaf differentiation, growth, and senescence. The impact of miR319 and its target <i>TEOSINTE BRANCHED1</i>, <i>CYCLOIDEA</i>, and <i>PROLIFERATING CELL NUCLEAR ANTIGEN BINDING FACTOR</i> (<i>TCP</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s on leaf development has been extensively investigated, but the redundancies of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families often interfere with the evaluation of their function and regulation in the developmental context. Here, we present the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic evidence of the involvement of the <i>MIR319</i> and <i>TCP</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaf development. Single mutations in <i>MIR319A</i> and <i>MIR319B</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s moderately inhibited the formation of leaf serrations, whereas double mutations increased the extent of this inhibition and resulted in the formation of smooth leaves. Mutations in <i>MIR319</i> and gain-of-function mutations in the <i>TCP4</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> conferred resistance against miR319 and impaired the cotyledon boundary and leaf serration formation. These mutations functionally associated with <i>CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, which regulate the cotyledon boundary and leaf serration formation. In contrast, loss-of-function mutations in miR319-targeted and nontargeted <i>TCP</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s cooperatively induced the formation of serrated leaves in addition to changes in the levels of their downstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> transcript. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the <i>MIR319</i> and <i>TCP</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families underlie robust and multilayer control of leaf development. This study also provides a framework toward future researches on redundant mi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>s and transcription factors in Arabidopsis and crop plants.</p>

Structure Annotation and Quantification of Wheat Seed Oxidized Lipids by High-Resolution LC-MS/MS
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> oxidation is a process ubiquitous in life, but the direct and comprehensive analysis of oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s has been limited by available analytical methods. We applied high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to quantify oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s (glycerides, fatty acids, phospho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, lysophospho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, and galacto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s) and implemented a platform-independent high-throughput-amenable analysis pipeline for the high-confidence annotation and acyl composition analysis of oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> contents of 90 different naturally aged wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) seed stocks were quantified in an untargeted high-resolution LC-MS experiment, resulting in 18,556 quantitative mass-to-charge ratio features. In a posthoc liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry experiment, high-resolution MS/MS spectra (5 mD accuracy) were recorded for 8,957 out of 12,080 putatively monoisotopic features of the LC-MS data set. A total of 353 nonoxidized and 559 oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s with up to four additional oxygen atoms were annotated based on the accurate mass recordings (1.5 ppm tolerance) of the LC-MS data set and filtering procedures. MS/MS spectra available for 828 of these annotations were analyzed by translating experimentally known fragmentation rules of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s into the fragmentation of oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s. This led to the identification of 259 nonoxidized and 365 oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s by both accurate mass and MS/MS spectra and to the determination of acyl compositions for 221 nonoxidized and 295 oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s. Analysis of 15-year aged wheat seeds revealed increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> oxidation and hydrolysis in seeds stored in ambient versus cold conditions.</p>

STABILIZED1 Modulates Pre-mRNA Splicing for Thermotolerance
<p>High-temperature stress often leads to differential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> splicing, thus accumulating different types and/or amounts of mature m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>s in eukaryotic cells. However, regulatory mechanisms underlying plant precursor m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> (pre-m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>) splicing in the environmental stress conditions remain elusive. Herein, we describe that a U5-snRNP-interacting protein homolog STABILIZED1 (STA1) has pre-m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> splicing activity for heat-inducible transcripts including <i>HEAT STRESS TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR</i>s and various <i>HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN</i>s for the establishment of heat stress tolerance in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Our cell-based splicing reporter assay demonstrated STA1 acts on pre-m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> splicing for specific subsets of stress-related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. Cellular reconstitution of heat-inducible transcription cascades supported the view that STA1-dependent pre-m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> splicing plays a role in DREB2A-dependent <i>HSFA3</i> expression for heat-responsive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> expression. Further <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic analysis with a loss-of-function mutant <i>sta1</i>-<i>1</i>, <i>STA1</i>-expressing transgenic plants in Col background, and <i>STA1</i>-expressing transgenic plants in the <i>sta1</i>-<i>1</i> background verified that STA1 is essential in expression of necessary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s including <i>HSFA3</i> for two-step heat stress tolerance in plants. However, constitutive overexpression of the c<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> version of <i>HSFA3</i> in the <i>sta1</i>-<i>1</i> background is unable to execute plant heat stress tolerance in <i>sta1</i>-<i>1</i>. Consistently our global target analysis of STA1 showed that its splicing activity modulates a rather broad range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> expression in response to heat treatment. The findings of this study reveal that heat-inducible STA1 activity for pre-m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> splicing serves as a molecular regulatory mechanism underlying the plant stress tolerance to high-temperature stress.</p>

Gibberellin Signaling Requires Chromatin Remodeler PICKLE to Promote Vegetative Growth and Phase Transitions
<p>PICKLE (PKL) is an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ATP</span></strong>-dependent chromodomain-helicase-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong>-binding domain (CHD3) chromatin remodeling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzyme</span></strong> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Previous studies showed that PKL promotes embryonic-to-vegetative transition by inhibiting expression of seed-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s during seed germination. The <i>pkl</i> mutants display a low penetrance of the “pickle root” phenotype, with a thick and green primary root that retains embryonic characteristics. The penetrance of this pickle root phenotype in <i>pkl</i> is dramatically increased in gibberellin (GA)-deficient conditions. At adult stages, the <i>pkl</i> mutants are semidwarfs with delayed flowering time, which resemble reduced GA-signaling mutants. These findings suggest that PKL may play a positive role in regulating GA signaling. A recent biochemical analysis further showed that PKL and GA signaling repressors DELLAs antagonistically regulate hypocotyl cell elongation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s by direct protein-protein interaction. To elucidate further the role of PKL in GA signaling and plant development, we studied the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic interaction between PKL and DELLAs using the hextuple mutant containing <i>pkl</i> and <i>della</i> pentuple (<i>dP</i>) mutations. Here, we show that PKL is required for most of GA-promoted developmental processes, including vegetative growth such as hypocotyl, leaf, and inflorescence stem elongation, and phase transitions such as juvenile-to-adult leaf and vegetative-to-reproductive phase. The removal of all DELLA functions (in the <i>dP</i> background) cannot rescue these phenotypes in <i>pkl</i>. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong>-sequencing analysis using the <i>ga1</i> (a GA-deficient mutant), <i>pkl</i>, and the <i>ga1 pkl</i> double mutant further shows that expression of 80% of GA-responsive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in seedlings is PKL dependent, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s that function in cell elongation, cell division, and phase transitions. These results indicate that the CHD3 chromatin remodeler PKL is required for regulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> expression during most of GA-regulated developmental processes.</p>

Stability of Single-Parent Gene Expression Complementation in Maize Hybrids upon Water Deficit Stress
<p>Heterosis is the superior performance of F1 hybrids compared with their homozygous, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tically distinct parents. In this study, we monitored the transcriptomic divergence of the maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) inbred lines B73 and Mo17 and their reciprocal F1 hybrid progeny in primary roots under control and water deficit conditions simulated by polyethylene glycol treatment. Single-parent expression (SPE) of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s is an extreme instance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> expression complementation, in which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s are active in only one of two parents but are expressed in both reciprocal hybrids. In this study, 1,997 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s only expressed in B73 and 2,024 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s only expressed in Mo17 displayed SPE complementation under control and water deficit conditions. As a consequence, the number of active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in hybrids exceeded the number of active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in the parental inbred lines significantly independent of treatment. SPE patterns were substantially more stable to expression changes by water deficit treatment than other genotype-specific expression profiles. While, on average, 75% of all SPE patterns were not altered in response to polyethylene glycol treatment, only 17% of the remaining genotype-specific expression patterns were not changed by water deficit. Nonsyntenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s that lack syntenic orthologs in other grass species, and thus evolved late in the grass lineage, were significantly overrepresented among SPE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. Hence, the significant overrepresentation of nonsyntenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s among SPE patterns and their stability under water limitation might suggest a function of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s during the early developmental manifestation of heterosis under fluctuating environmental conditions in hybrid progeny of the inbred lines B73 and Mo17.</p>

Transcriptional Gene Silencing Maintained by OTS1 SUMO Protease Requires a DNA-Dependent Polymerase V-Dependent Pathway
<p>The expression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s with aberrant structure is prevented at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation levels. Aberrant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> silencing at the posttranscriptional level is well studied; however, it is not well understood how aberrant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s are silenced at the transcriptional level. In this study, through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic screening a transgenic report line that harbors an aberrant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> (<i>35S-LUC</i>, lacking 3′-untranslated region [3′-UTR]) and lacks luciferase (LUC) activity, we identify that the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) protease <i>OTS1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> is required for maintaining the silence of the reporter <i>35S-LUC</i> and an endogenous mutator-like element <i>MULE-F19G14</i> at the transcriptional level, which requires <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong>-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">RNA</span></strong> polymerase (Pol) V and DDR complex, but not Pol IV. The increased transcripts in <i>ots1</i> mutants are terminated by the 3′-UTRs of downstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. In addition to <i>ots1</i> mutations, mutations in several known or putative SUMO proteases and two SUMO E3 ligases, <i>SIZ1</i> and <i>MMS21</i>, have similar effects on this silencing regulation. Taken together, our results reveal that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzyme</span></strong>s involved in the SUMOylation process restrain aberrant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> transcription by using a downstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> 3′-UTR, and this regulation requires a functional Pol V-dependent pathway in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>).</p>

SUPPRESSOR OF FRIGIDA (SUF4) Supports Gamete Fusion via Regulating Arabidopsis <i>EC1</i> Gene Expression
<p>The <i>EGG CELL1</i> (<i>EC1</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> family of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) comprises five members that are specifically expressed in the egg cell and redundantly control gamete fusion during double fertilization. We investigated the activity of all five <i>EC1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promoter</span></strong>s in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promoter</span></strong>-deletion studies and identified SUF4 (SUPPRESSOR OF FRIGIDA4), a C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> transcription factor, as a direct regulator of the <i>EC1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> expression. In particular, we demonstrated that SUF4 binds to all five Arabidopsis <i>EC1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promoter</span></strong>s, thus regulating their expression. The down-regulation of <i>SUF4</i> in homozygous <i>suf4-1</i> ovules results in reduced <i>EC1</i> expression and delayed sperm fusion, which can be rescued by expressing SUF4-β-glucuronidase under the control of the <i>SUF4</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">promoter</span></strong>. To identify more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> products able to regulate <i>EC1</i> expression together with SUF4, we performed coexpression studies that led to the identification of <i>MOM1</i> (<i>MORPHEUS’ MOLECULE1</i>), a component of a silencing mechanism that is independent of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong> methylation marks. In <i>mom1-3</i> ovules, both <i>SUF4</i> and <i>EC1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s are down-regulated, and <i>EC1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s show higher levels of histone 3 lysine-9 acetylation, suggesting that MOM1 contributes to the regulation of <i>SUF4</i> and <i>EC1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> expression.</p>

Old but Not (So) Degenerated—Slow Evolution of Largely Homomorphic Sex Chromosomes in Ratites
<p>De<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>ration of the nonrecombining chromosome is a common feature of sex chromosome evolution, readily evident by the presence of a pair of largely heteromorphic chromosomes, like in eutherian mammals and birds. However, in ratites (order Palaeognathae, including, e.g., ostrich), the Z and W chromosomes are similar in size and largely undifferentiated, despite avian sex chromosome evolution was initiated > 130 Ma. To better understand what may limit sex chromosome evolution, we performed ostrich transcriptome sequencing and studied <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s from the nonrecombining region of the W chromosome. Fourteen gametologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> pairs present on the W chromosome and Z chromosome were identified, with synonymous sequence divergence of 0.027–0.177. The location of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s on the Z chromosome was consistent with a sequential increase in divergence, starting 110–157 and ending 24–30 Ma. On the basis of the occurrence of Z-linked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s hemizygous in females, we estimate that about one-third of the Z chromosome does not recombine with the W chromosome in female meiosis. Pairwise <i>d</i><sub>N</sub><i>/d</i><sub>S</sub> between gametologs decreased with age, suggesting strong evolutionary constraint in old gametologs. Lineage-specific <i>d</i><sub>N</sub><i>/d</i><sub>S</sub> was consistently higher in W-linked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, in accordance with the lower efficacy of selection expected in nonrecombining chromosomes. A higher ratio of GC > AT:AT > GC substitutions in W-linked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s supports a role for GC-biased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> conversion in differentially driving base composition on the two sex chromosomes. A male-to-female (M:F) expression ratio of close to one for recombining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s and close to two for Z-linked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s lacking a W copy show that dosage compensation is essentially absent. Some gametologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s have retained active expression of the W copy in females (giving a M:F ratio of 1 for the gametologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> pair), whereas for others W expression has become severely reduced resulting in a M:F ratio of close to 2. These observations resemble the patterns of sex chromosome evolution seen in other avian and mammalian lineages, suggesting similar underlying evolutionary processes, although the rate of sex chromosome differentiation has been atypically low. Lack of dosage compensation may be a factor hindering sex chromosome evolution in this lineage.</p>

Differential effects of vitamins E and C and carotenoids on growth, resistance to oxidative stress, fledging success and plumage colouration in wild great tits
<p>Oxidative stress is the imbalance between the production of reactive species and antioxidants, which causes damage to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, proteins and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">DNA</span></strong>. Antioxidants, like vitamins and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carotenoid</span></strong>s, can limit oxidative damage and can therefore regulate the trade-off between growth, which is a period of high reactive species production, and self-maintenance. However, the role of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carotenoid</span></strong>s as antioxidants <i>in vivo</i> has been debated, and it has been suggested that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carotenoid</span></strong>-based signals indicate the availability of non-pigmentary antioxidants (e.g. vitamins) that protect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carotenoid</span></strong>s from oxidation, known as the ‘protection hypothesis’. To evaluate the importance of vitamins versus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carotenoid</span></strong>s as antioxidants during growth and to test the protection hypothesis, we supplemented nestling great tits, <i>Parus major</i>, 3, 5 and 7 days after hatching with a single dose of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carotenoid</span></strong>s and/or vitamins in a 2×2 full-factorial design. We subsequently measured body condition, antioxidant capacity, oxidative damage, fledging success and plumage reflectance. Vitamins enhanced antioxidant capacity, but did not affect oxidative damage. Vitamin-treated nestlings had higher growth rates and higher probability of fledging. In contrast, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carotenoid</span></strong>s did not affect any of these traits. Furthermore, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carotenoid</span></strong>-based colouration increased over the breeding season in nestlings that received vitamins only. This study shows that vitamins are limiting for growth rate and fledging success, and suggests that vitamins could regulate the trade-off between growth and self-maintenance in favour of the former. Moreover, our results are consistent with the idea that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carotenoid</span></strong>s are minor antioxidants in birds, but they do not support the protection hypothesis.</p>

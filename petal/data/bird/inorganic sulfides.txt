Sulfur isotopes in diamonds reveal differences in continent construction
<p>Neoproterozoic West African diamonds contain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfid</span></strong>e inclusions with mass-independently fractionated (MIF) sulfur isotopes that trace Archean surficial signatures into the mantle. Two episodes of subduction are recorded in these West African <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfid</span></strong>e inclusions: thickening of the continental lithosphere through horizontal processes around 3 billion years ago and reworking and diamond growth around 650 million years ago. We find that the sulfur isotope record in worldwide diamond inclusions is consistent with changes in tectonic processes that formed the continental lithosphere in the Archean. Slave craton diamonds that formed 3.5 billion years ago do not contain any MIF sulfur. Younger diamonds from the Kaapvaal, Zimbabwe, and West African cratons do contain MIF sulfur, which suggests craton construction by advective thickening of mantle lithosphere through conventional subduction-style horizontal tectonics.</p>

Large-scale ocean deoxygenation during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum
<p>The consequences of global warming for fisheries are not well understood, but the geological record demonstrates that carbon cycle perturbations are frequently associated with ocean deoxygenation. Of particular interest is the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), where the carbon dioxide input into the atmosphere was similar to the IPCC RCP8.5 emission scenario. Here we present sulfur-isotope data that record a positive 1 per mil excursion during the PETM. Modeling suggests that large parts of the ocean must have become <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfid</span></strong>ic. The toxicity of hydrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfid</span></strong>e will render two of the largest and least explored ecosystems on Earth, the mesopelagic and bathypelagic zones, uninhabitable by multicellular organisms. This will affect many marine species whose ecozones stretch into the deep ocean.</p>

Tunable intraparticle frameworks for creating complex heterostructured nanoparticle libraries
<p>Complex heterostructured nanoparticles with precisely defined materials and interfaces are important for many applications. However, rationally incorporating such features into nanoparticles with rigorous morphology control remains a synthetic bottleneck. We define a modular divergent synthesis strategy that progressively transforms simple nanoparticle synthons into increasingly sophisticated products. We introduce a series of tunable interfaces into zero-, one-, and two-dimensional copper <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfid</span></strong>e nanoparticles using cation exchange reactions. Subsequent manipulation of these intraparticle frameworks yielded a library of 47 distinct heterostructured metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfid</span></strong>e derivatives, including particles that contain asymmetric, patchy, porous, and sculpted nanoarchitectures. This generalizable mix-and-match strategy provides predictable retrosynthetic pathways to complex nanoparticle features that are otherwise inaccessible.</p>

A bound reaction intermediate sheds light on the mechanism of nitrogenase
<p>Reduction of N<sub>2</sub> by nitrogenases occurs at an organometallic iron cofactor that commonly also contains either molybdenum or vanadium. The well-characterized resting state of the cofactor does not bind substrate, so its mode of action remains enigmatic. Carbon monoxide was recently found to replace a bridging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfid</span></strong>e, but the mechanistic relevance was unclear. Here we report the structural analysis of vanadium nitrogenase with a bound intermediate, interpreted as a μ<sup>2</sup>-bridging, protonated nitrogen that implies the site and mode of substrate binding to the cofactor. Binding results in a flip of amino acid glutamine 176, which hydrogen-bonds the ligand and creates a holding position for the displaced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfid</span></strong>e. The intermediate likely represents state E<sub>6</sub> or E<sub>7</sub> of the Thorneley-Lowe model and provides clues to the remainder of the catalytic cycle.</p>

Redefining near-unity luminescence in quantum dots with photothermal threshold quantum yield
<p>A variety of optical applications rely on the absorption and reemission of light. The quantum yield of this process often plays an essential role. When the quantum yield deviates from unity by significantly less than 1%, applications such as luminescent concentrators and optical refrigerators become possible. To evaluate such high performance, we develop a measurement technique for luminescence efficiency with sufficient accuracy below one part per thousand. Photothermal threshold quantum yield is based on the quantization of light to minimize overall measurement uncertainty. This technique is used to guide a procedure capable of making ensembles of near-unity emitting cadmium selenide/cadmium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfid</span></strong>e (CdSe/CdS) core-shell quantum dots. We obtain a photothermal threshold quantum yield luminescence efficiency of 99.6 ± 0.2%, indicating nearly complete suppression of nonradiative decay channels.</p>

Chemically reversible isomerization of inorganic clusters
<p>Structural transformations in molecules and solids have generally been studied in isolation, whereas intermediate systems have eluded characterization. We show that a pair of cadmium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfid</span></strong>e (CdS) cluster isomers provides an advantageous experimental platform to study isomerization in well-defined, atomically precise systems. The clusters coherently interconvert over an ~1–electron volt energy barrier with a 140–milli–electron volt shift in their excitonic energy gaps. There is a diffusionless, displacive reconfiguration of the inorganic core (solid-solid transformation) with first order (isomerization-like) transformation kinetics. Driven by a distortion of the ligand-binding motifs, the presence of hydroxyl species changes the surface energy via physisorption, which determines “phase” stability in this system. This reaction possesses essential characteristics of both solid-solid transformations and molecular isomerizations and bridges these disparate length scales.</p>

Extraordinary plasticity of an inorganic semiconductor in darkness
<p>Inorganic semiconductors generally tend to fail in a brittle manner. Here, we report that extraordinary “plasticity” can take place in an inorganic semiconductor if the deformation is carried out “in complete darkness.” Room-temperature deformation tests of zinc <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfid</span></strong>e (ZnS) were performed under varying light conditions. ZnS crystals immediately fractured when they deformed under light irradiation. In contrast, it was found that ZnS crystals can be plastically deformed up to a deformation strain of ε<sub>t</sub> = 45% in complete darkness. In addition, the optical bandgap of the deformed ZnS crystals was distinctly decreased after deformation. These results suggest that dislocations in ZnS become mobile in complete darkness and that multiplied dislocations can affect the optical bandgap over the whole crystal. Inorganic semiconductors are not necessarily intrinsically brittle.</p>

Gut bacteria selectively promoted by dietary fibers alleviate type 2 diabetes
<p>The gut microbiota benefits humans via short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production from carbohydrate fermentation, and deficiency in SCFA production is associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We conducted a randomized clinical study of specifically designed isoenergetic diets, together with fecal shotgun metagenomics, to show that a select group of SCFA-producing strains was promoted by dietary fibers and that most other potential producers were either diminished or unchanged in patients with T2DM. When the fiber-promoted SCFA producers were present in greater diversity and abundance, participants had better improvement in hemoglobin A1c levels, partly via increased glucagon-like peptide-1 production. Promotion of these positive responders diminished producers of metabolically detrimental compounds such as indole and hydrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfid</span></strong>e. Targeted restoration of these SCFA producers may present a novel ecological approach for managing T2DM.</p>

Archaeal (Per)Chlorate Reduction at High Temperature: An Interplay of Biotic and Abiotic Reactions
<sec><title>Archaea Powered by Rocket Fuel</title><p>Perchlorate is a ubiquitous chlorine-based compound that forms naturally in the atmosphere. It is only present in large deposits in a few locations, such as the Atacama Desert in Chile, which has been assumed to be because perchlorate-reducing bacteria normally degrade it into chloride and oxygen. <bold>Liebensteiner <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 85; see the Perspective by <bold>Nerenberg</bold>), however, found that an archeon, <i>Archaeoglobus fulgidus</i>, can also reduce perchlorate. The archaeal perchlorate reduction pathway shares limited similarity with bacterial perchlorate reduction: Instead of producing chloride and oxygen, enzymatically produced chlorite reacts with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfid</span></strong>e to produce oxidized sulfur compounds. Because hyperthermophilic anaerobic archaea similar to <i>A. fulgidus</i> are thought to have been among the first complex organisms to evolve on Earth, they may have started creating oxidized conditions in some habitats before the emergence of oxygen-generating photosynthesis.</p></sec>

SULTR3s Function in Chloroplast Sulfate Uptake and Affect ABA Biosynthesis and the Stress Response
<p>Plants are major sulfur reducers in the global sulfur cycle. Sulfate, the major natural sulfur source in soil, is absorbed by plant roots and transported into plastids, where it is reduced and assimilated into Cys for further metabolic processes. Despite its importance, how sulfate is transported into plastids is poorly understood. We previously demonstrated using single Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) genetic mutants that each member of the sulfate transporter (SULTR) subfamily 3 was able to transport sulfate across the chloroplast envelope membrane. To resolve the function of SULTR3s, we constructed a <i>sultr3</i> quintuple mutant completely knocking out all five members of the subfamily. Here we report that all members of the <i>SULTR3</i> subfamily show chloroplast membrane localization. Sulfate uptake by chloroplasts of the quintuple mutant is reduced by more than 50% compared with the wild type. Consequently, Cys and abscisic acid (ABA) content are reduced to ∼67 and ∼20% of the wild-type level, respectively, and strong positive correlations are found among sulfate, Cys, and ABA content. The <i>sultr3</i> quintuple mutant shows obvious growth retardation with smaller rosettes and shorter roots. Seed germination of the <i>sultr3</i> quintuple mutant is hypersensitive to exogenous ABA and salt stress, but is rescued by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfid</span></strong>e supplementation. Furthermore, sulfate-induced stomatal closure is abolished in the quintuple mutant, strongly suggesting that chloroplast sulfate is required for stomatal closure. Our genetic analyses unequivocally demonstrate that sulfate transporter subfamily 3 is responsible for more than half of the chloroplast sulfate uptake and influences downstream sulfate assimilation and ABA biosynthesis.</p>

Hydrogen Sulfide Disturbs Actin Polymerization via <i>S</i>-Sulfhydration Resulting in Stunted Root Hair Growth
<p>Hydrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfid</span></strong>e (H<sub>2</sub>S) is an important signaling molecule in plants. Our previous report suggested that H<sub>2</sub>S signaling affects the actin cytoskeleton and root hair growth. However, the underlying mechanisms of its effects are not understood. <i>S</i>-Sulfhydration of proteins is regulated directly by H<sub>2</sub>S, which converts the thiol groups of cysteine (Cys) residues to per<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfid</span></strong>es and alters protein function. In this work, we studied the effects of <i>S</i>-sulfhydration on actin dynamics in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We generated transgenic plants overexpressing the H<sub>2</sub>S biosynthesis-related genes <i><sc>l</sc>-CYSTEINE DESULFHYDRASE</i> (<i>LCD</i>) and <i><sc>d</sc>-CYSTEINE DESULFHYDRASE</i> in the <i>O-acetylserine(thiol)lyase isoform a1</i> (<i>oasa1</i>) mutant and Columbia-0 backgrounds. The H<sub>2</sub>S content increased significantly in overexpressing <i>LCD</i>/<i>oasa1</i> plants. The density of filamentous actin (F-actin) bundles and the F-actin/globular actin ratio decreased in overexpressing <i>LCD</i>/<i>oasa1</i> plants. <i>S</i>-Sulfhydration also was enhanced in overexpressing <i>LCD</i>/<i>oasa1</i> plants. An analysis of actin dynamics suggested that <i>S</i>-sulfhydration inhibited actin polymerization. We also found that ACTIN2 (ACT2) was <i>S</i>-sulfhydrated at Cys-287. Cys-287 is adjacent to the D-loop, which acts as a central region for hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions and stabilizes F-actin filaments. Overaccumulation of H<sub>2</sub>S caused the depolymerization of F-actin bundles and inhibited root hair growth. Introduction of <i>ACT2</i> carrying a Cys-287-to-Ser mutation into an <i>act2-1</i> mutant partially suppressed H<sub>2</sub>S-dependent inhibition of root hair growth. We conclude that H<sub>2</sub>S regulates actin dynamics and affects root hair growth.</p>

Hydrogen Sulfide Increases Production of NADPH Oxidase-Dependent Hydrogen Peroxide and Phospholipase D-Derived Phosphatidic Acid in Guard Cell Signaling<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Hydrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfid</span></strong>e (H<sub>2</sub>S) is an important gaseous signaling molecule in plants that participates in stress responses and development. <sc>l</sc>-Cys desulfhydrase 1, one of the enzymatic sources of H<sub>2</sub>S in plants, participates in abscisic acid-induced stomatal closure. We combined pharmacological and genetic approaches to elucidate the involvement of H<sub>2</sub>S in stomatal closure and the interplay between H<sub>2</sub>S and other second messengers of the guard cell signaling network, such as hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and phospholipase D (PLD)-derived phosphatidic acid in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Both NADPH oxidase isoforms, respiratory burst oxidase homolog (RBOH)D and RBOHF, were required for H<sub>2</sub>S-induced stomatal closure. In vivo imaging using the cytosolic ratiometric fluorescent biosensor roGFP2-Orp1 revealed that H<sub>2</sub>S stimulates H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production in Arabidopsis guard cells. Additionally, we observed an interplay between H<sub>2</sub>S and PLD activity in the regulation of reactive oxygen species production and stomatal movement. The PLDα1 and PLDδ isoforms were required for H<sub>2</sub>S-induced stomatal closure, and most of the H<sub>2</sub>S-dependent H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production required the activity of PLDα1. Finally, we showed that H<sub>2</sub>S induced increases in the PLDδ-derived phosphatidic acid levels in guard cells. Our results revealed the involvement of H<sub>2</sub>S in the signaling network that controls stomatal closure, and suggest that H<sub>2</sub>S regulates NADPH oxidase and PLD activity in guard cells.</p>

Restoration of Hydrogen Sulfide Production in Diabetic Mice Improves Reparative Function of Bone Marrow Cells
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Bone marrow cell (BMC)–based treatment for critical limb ischemia in diabetic patients yielded a modest therapeutic effect resulting from cell dysfunction. Therefore, approaches that improve diabetic stem/progenitor cell functions may provide therapeutic benefits. Here, we tested the hypothesis that restoration of hydrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfid</span></strong>e (H<sub>2</sub>S) production in diabetic BMCs improves their reparative capacities.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Mouse BMCs were isolated by density-gradient centrifugation. Unilateral hind limb ischemia was conducted in 12- to 14-week-old db/+ and db/db mice by ligation of the left femoral artery. The H<sub>2</sub>S level was measured by either gas chromatography or staining with florescent dye <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfid</span></strong>efluor 7 <sc>AM</sc>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Both H<sub>2</sub>S production and cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE), an H<sub>2</sub>S enzyme, levels were significantly decreased in BMCs from diabetic db/db mice. Administration of H<sub>2</sub>S donor diallyl tri<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfid</span></strong>e (DATS) or overexpression of CSE restored H<sub>2</sub>S production and enhanced cell survival and migratory capacity in high glucose (HG)–treated BMCs. Immediately after hind limb ischemia surgery, the db/+ and db/db mice were administered DATS orally and/or given a local intramuscular injection of green fluorescent protein–labeled BMCs or red fluorescent protein–CSE–overexpressing BMCs (CSE-BMCs). Mice with hind limb ischemia were divided into 6 groups: db/+, db/db, db/db+BMCs, db/db+DATS, db/db+DATS+BMCs, and db/db+CSE-BMCs. DATS and CSE overexpression greatly enhanced diabetic BMC retention in ischemic hind limbs followed by improved blood perfusion, capillary/arteriole density, skeletal muscle architecture, and cell survival and decreased perivascular CD68<sup>+</sup> cell infiltration in the ischemic hind limbs of diabetic mice. It is interesting to note that DATS or CSE overexpression rescued high glucose–impaired migration, tube formation, and survival of BMCs or mature human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells. Moreover, DATS restored nitric oxide production and decreased endothelial nitric oxide synthase phosphorylation at threonine 495 levels in human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells and improved BMC angiogenic activity under high glucose condition. Last, silencing CSE by siRNA significantly increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase phosphorylation at threonine 495 levels in human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Decreased CSE-mediated H<sub>2</sub>S bioavailability is an underlying source of BMC dysfunction in diabetes mellitus. Our data indicate that H<sub>2</sub>S and overexpression of CSE in diabetic BMCs may rescue their dysfunction and open novel avenues for cell-based therapeutics of critical limb ischemia in diabetic patients.</p></sec>

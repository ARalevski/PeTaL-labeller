Uncertainty boosts Brexit jitters for U.K. scientists
<p>U.K. scientists dreading the country's impending departure from the European Union, known as Brexit, now face possible outcomes ranging from undesirable to potentially disastrous. On 11 December, Parliament will vote on a withdrawal agreement that lays out the terms of a costly but smooth departure from the European Union, starting in March 2019. If the agreement is rejected, the United Kingdom could <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crash</span></strong> out instead, triggering chaos at the border, food shortages, and economic hardship. A no-deal exit would also immediately void many research agreements. Regardless of how the United Kingdom departs, it will have to negotiate new science agreements with the European Union and come up with a new EU immigration policy. A long-awaited government white paper on immigration is expected to be published this month. Two and a half years after the divisive popular referendum that launched the Brexit process, some scientists hold out hope for a reprieve: A growing number of politicians are agitating for a second referendum that might reverse the first one.</p>

Supporting recovery from brain injury
<p>The beauty and intricacy of the human brain is unfortunately also mirrored by its vulnerability. Damage to the brain is typically permanent. Because cells of the adult brain, apart from rare exceptions, no longer divide, there is essentially no regrowth of damaged brain tissue. Acquired brain injury in the majority of cases occurs directly through traumatic events such as an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accid</span></strong>ent involving a blow to the head or indirectly through interruption of the blood supply, namely a stroke. Brain injury is a major burden, with an estimated 1.7 million people in the United States suffering a traumatic brain injury and nearly 800,000 Americans suffering a stroke each year (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). However, current treatment options for such brain injuries are still limited and are focused on the first hours after the insult. On page 50 of this issue, Abe <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) describe a new approach in mouse and primate models that aims to enhance the ability of the brain to regain functionality in the days and weeks after brain injury.</p>

Circular RNAs hint at new realm of genetics
<p>For decades, loops of genetic material known as circular RNA were considered a kind of genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accid</span></strong>ent. But scientists have given them new attention in recent years, and a set of papers published this month suggests some of them actually give rise to proteins, just like their more familiar, linear counterparts, messenger RNA. The new research reveals that, despite their unusual structure, circular RNAs can communicate with ribosomes, the cell’s proteinmaking machinery. And several proteins in fly, mouse, and human cells appear to be translated from circular RNAs. Researchers haven’t yet shown that these new proteins have an important function, many suspect they are a previously unrecognized way that cells control gene expression.</p>

Pervasive Externalities at the Population, Consumption, and Environment Nexus
<sec><title>Sticky Responses</title><p>A textbook example of an unaccounted-for consequence (externality) of commercial or industrial activity is the production of pollutants where neither the producer nor the buyer bears the cost of using common environmental resources. <bold>Dasgupta and Ehrlich</bold> (p. 324) offer a theoretical analysis of externalities in two other areas of modern life—human fertility and material consumption. For example, when fertility decline lags mortality decline, the consequence could be environmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crash</span></strong>, the likelihood of which is greater if the environmental effects of consumption or population growth are external to the market.</p></sec>

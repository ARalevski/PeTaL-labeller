Integrated proximal proteomics reveals IRS2 as a determinant of cell survival in ALK-driven neuroblastoma
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oncogen</span></strong>ic anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is one of the few druggable targets in neuroblastoma, and therapy resistance to ALK-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) comprises an inevitable clinical challenge. Therefore, a better understanding of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oncogen</span></strong>ic signaling network rewiring driven by ALK is necessary to improve and guide future therapies. Here, we performed quantitative mass spectrometry–based proteomics on neuroblastoma cells treated with one of three clinically relevant ALK TKIs (crizotinib, LDK378, or lorlatinib) or an experimentally used ALK TKI (TAE684) to unravel aberrant ALK signaling pathways. Our integrated proximal proteomics (IPP) strategy included multiple signaling layers, such as the ALK interactome, phosphotyrosine interactome, phosphoproteome, and proteome. We identified the signaling adaptor protein IRS2 (insulin receptor substrate 2) as a major ALK target and an ALK TKI–sensitive signaling node in neuroblastoma cells driven by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oncogen</span></strong>ic ALK. TKI treatment decreased the recruitment of IRS2 to ALK and reduced the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS2. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated depletion of ALK or IRS2 decreased the phosphorylation of the survival-promoting kinase Akt and of a downstream target, the transcription factor FoxO3, and reduced the viability of three ALK-driven neuroblastoma cell lines. Collectively, our IPP analysis provides insight into the proximal architecture of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oncogen</span></strong>ic ALK signaling by revealing IRS2 as an adaptor protein that links ALK to neuroblastoma cell survival through the Akt-FoxO3 signaling axis.</p>

KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> inhibition produces a driver-limited state revealing collateral dependencies
<p>Inhibitors targeting KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>, a mutant form of the guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) KRAS, are a promising new class of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oncogen</span></strong>e-specific therapeutics for the treatment of tumors driven by the mutant protein. These inhibitors react with the mutant cysteine residue by binding covalently to the switch-II pocket (S-IIP) that is present only in the inactive guanosine diphosphate (GDP)–bound form of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>, sparing the wild-type protein. We used a genome-scale CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) functional genomics platform to systematically identify genetic interactions with a KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> inhibitor in cellular models of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> mutant lung and pancreatic cancer. Our data revealed genes that were selectively essential in this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oncogen</span></strong>ic driver–limited cell state, meaning that their loss enhanced cellular susceptibility to direct KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> inhibition. We termed such genes “collateral dependencies” (CDs) and identified two classes of combination therapies targeting these CDs that increased KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> target engagement or blocked residual survival pathways in cells and in vivo. From our findings, we propose a framework for assessing genetic dependencies induced by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oncogen</span></strong>e inhibition.</p>

Oncogenic PI3K promotes methionine dependency in breast cancer cells through the cystine-glutamate antiporter xCT
<p>The precursor homocysteine is metabolized either through the methionine cycle to produce methionine or through the transsulfuration pathway to synthesize cysteine. Alternatively, cysteine can be obtained through uptake of its oxidized form, cystine. Many cancer cells exhibit methionine dependency such that their proliferation is impaired in growth media in which methionine is replaced by homocysteine. We showed that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oncogen</span></strong>ic <i>PIK3CA</i> and decreased expression of <i>SLC7A11</i>, a gene that encodes a cystine transporter also known as xCT, correlated with increased methionine dependency in breast cancer cells. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oncogen</span></strong>ic <i>PIK3CA</i> was sufficient to confer methionine dependency to mammary epithelial cells, partly by decreasing cystine uptake through the transcriptional and posttranslational inhibition of xCT. Manipulation of xCT activity altered the proliferation of breast cancer cells in methionine-deficient, homocysteine-containing media, suggesting that it functionally contributed to methionine dependency. We propose that concurrent with decreased cystine uptake through xCT, <i>PIK3CA</i> mutant cells use homocysteine through the transsulfuration pathway to synthesize cysteine. Consequently, less homocysteine is available to produce methionine, contributing to methionine dependency. These results indicate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oncogen</span></strong>ic <i>PIK3CA</i> alters methionine and cysteine utilization, partly by inhibiting xCT to contribute to the methionine dependency phenotype in breast cancer cells.</p>

A compact synthetic pathway rewires cancer signaling to therapeutic effector release
<p>An important goal in synthetic biology is to engineer biochemical pathways to address unsolved biomedical problems. One long-standing problem in molecular medicine is the specific identification and ablation of cancer cells. Here, we describe a method, named Rewiring of Aberrant Signaling to Effector Release (RASER), in which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oncogen</span></strong>ic ErbB receptor activity, instead of being targeted for inhibition as in existing treatments, is co-opted to trigger therapeutic programs. RASER integrates ErbB activity to specifically link <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oncogen</span></strong>ic states to the execution of desired outputs. A complete mathematical model of RASER and modularity in design enable rational optimization and output programming. Using RASER, we induced apoptosis and CRISPR-Cas9–mediated transcription of endogenous genes specifically in ErbB-hyperactive cancer cells. Delivery of apoptotic RASER by adeno-associated virus selectively ablated ErbB-hyperactive cancer cells while sparing ErbB-normal cells. RASER thus provides a new strategy for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oncogen</span></strong>e-specific cancer detection and treatment.</p>

Dampening oncogenic RAS signaling
<p>The control of normal cellular homeostasis is a function of signaling by the RAS guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) KRAS, NRAS, and HRAS and their downstream signaling proteins, such as the RAF kinases (BRAF and CRAF), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase (MEK), and extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK), which together constitute the RAS-MAPK pathway (<i>1</i>). This pathway is dysregulated in human diseases, particularly cancer, in which mutations or other nongenetic events hyperactivate the pathway in more than 50% of cases (<i>1</i>). Activating mutations in RAS genes occur in more than 30% of all cancers and seemingly lock RAS into a constitutively active, GTP-bound state to signal autonomously without the need for upstream input (<i>1</i>). Therapeutic suppression of pathogenic RASMAPK signaling to maximize disease control in cancer patients remains an elusive goal. Multiple strategies targeting upstream [e.g., receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)] or downstream (e.g., MEK) RAS pathway proteins to limit RAS-GTP–mediated signaling in RAS-MAPK pathway–driven cancers are under evaluation (<i>1</i>–<i>3</i>). However, recent studies have extended our knowledge of how certain forms of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oncogen</span></strong>ic RAS and other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oncogen</span></strong>ic MAPK pathway proteins function not in an autonomous manner but instead semiautonomously, such that they still respond to upstream regulation (<i>4</i>–<i>8</i>). These findings reveal mechanisms by which RAS signaling is dysregulated in cancer and highlight newly identified therapeutic strategies with the potential to target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oncogen</span></strong>ic RAS-MAPK signaling.</p>

Transmembrane voltage potential is an essential cellular parameter for the detection and control of tumor development in a <i>Xenopus</i> model
<p>Understanding mechanisms that orchestrate cell behavior into appropriately patterned tissues and organs within the organism is an essential element of preventing, detecting and treating cancer. Bioelectric signals (resting transmembrane voltage potential gradients in all cells) underlie an important and broadly conserved set of control mechanisms that regulate pattern formation. We tested the role of transmembrane potential in tumorigenesis mediated by canonical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oncogen</span></strong>es in <i>Xenopus laevis</i>. Depolarized membrane potential (<i>V</i><sub>mem</sub>) was a characteristic of induced tumor-like structures (ITLSs) generated by overexpression of <i>Gli1</i>, <i>Kras<sup>G12D</sup></i>, <i>Xrel3</i> or <i>p53<sup>Trp248</sup></i>. This bioelectric signature was also present in precursor ITLS sites. <i>V</i><sub>mem</sub> is a bioelectric marker that reveals ITLSs before they become histologically and morphologically apparent. Moreover, voltage was functionally important: overexpression of hyperpolarizing ion transporters caused a return to normal <i>V</i><sub>mem</sub> and significantly reduced ITLS formation <i>in vivo</i>. To characterize the molecular mechanism by which <i>V</i><sub>mem</sub> change regulates ITLS phenotypes, we performed a suppression screen. <i>V</i><sub>mem</sub> hyperpolarization was transduced into downstream events via <i>V</i><sub>mem</sub>-regulated activity of SLC5A8, a sodium-butyrate exchanger previously implicated in human cancer. These data indicate that butyrate, a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, might be responsible for transcriptional events that mediate suppression of ITLSs by hyperpolarization. <i>V</i><sub>mem</sub> is a convenient cellular parameter by which tumors induced by human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oncogen</span></strong>es can be detected <i>in vivo</i> and represents a new diagnostic modality. Moreover, control of resting membrane potential is functionally involved in the process by which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oncogen</span></strong>e-bearing cells depart from normal morphogenesis programs to form tumors. Modulation of <i>V</i><sub>mem</sub> levels is a novel and promising strategy for tumor normalization.</p>

The Src family kinase Fgr is a transforming oncoprotein that functions independently of SH3-SH2 domain regulation
<p>Fgr is a member of the Src family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, which are overexpressed and constitutively active in many human cancers. Fgr expression is restricted to myeloid hematopoietic cells and is markedly increased in a subset of bone marrow samples from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here, we investigated the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oncogen</span></strong>ic potential of Fgr using Rat-2 fibroblasts that do not express the kinase. Expression of either wild-type or regulatory tail-mutant constructs of Fgr promoted cellular transformation (inferred from colony formation in soft agar), which was accompanied by phosphorylation of the Fgr activation loop, suggesting that the kinase domain of Fgr functions independently of regulation by its noncatalytic SH3-SH2 region. Unlike other family members, recombinant Fgr was not activated by SH3-SH2 domain ligands. However, hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry data suggested that the regulatory SH3 and SH2 domains packed against the back of the kinase domain in a Src-like manner. Sequence alignment showed that the activation loop of Fgr was distinct from that of all other Src family members, with proline rather than alanine at the +2 position relative to the activation loop tyrosine. Substitution of the activation loop of Fgr with the sequence from Src partially inhibited kinase activity and suppressed colony formation. Last, Fgr expression enhanced the sensitivity of human myeloid progenitor cells to the cytokine GM-CSF. Because its kinase domain is not sensitive to SH3-SH2–mediated control, simple overexpression of Fgr without mutation may contribute to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oncogen</span></strong>ic transformation in AML and other blood cancers.</p>

Targeting TNFR2 with antagonistic antibodies inhibits proliferation of ovarian cancer cells and tumor-associated T<sub>regs</sub>
<p>Major barriers to cancer therapy include the lack of selective inhibitors of regulatory T cells (T<sub>regs</sub>) and the lack of broadly applicable ways to directly target tumors through frequently expressed surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oncogen</span></strong>es. Tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2) is an attractive target protein because of its restricted abundance to highly immunosuppressive T<sub>regs</sub> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oncogen</span></strong>ic presence on human tumors. We characterized the effect of TNFR2 inhibition using antagonistic antibodies. In culture-based assays, we found that two TNFR2 antagonists inhibited T<sub>reg</sub> proliferation, reduced soluble TNFR2 secretion from normal cells, and enabled T effector cell expansion. The antagonistic activity occurred in the presence of added TNF, a natural TNFR2 agonist. These TNFR2 antibodies killed T<sub>regs</sub> isolated from ovarian cancer ascites more potently than it killed T<sub>regs</sub> from healthy donor samples, suggesting that these antibodies may have specificity for the tumor microenvironment. The TNFR2 antagonists also killed OVCAR3 ovarian cancer cells, which have abundant surface TNFR2. The antibodies stabilized antiparallel dimers in cell surface TNFR2 that rendered the receptor unable to activate the nuclear factor κB pathway and trigger cell proliferation. Our data suggest that, by targeting tumor cells and immunosuppressive tumor-associated T<sub>regs</sub>, antagonistic TNFR2 antibodies may be an effective treatment for cancers positive for TNFR2.</p>

Restoring tumor suppression
<p>Many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oncogen</span></strong>es and tumor suppressors that are mutated during cancer development act as enzymatic switches that phosphorylate (kinases) or dephosphorylate (phosphatases) substrates. Much attention has focused on therapeutically inhibiting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oncogen</span></strong>ic kinases that are activated by mutation. However, there has been less focus on targeting phosphatases, despite their importance in cancer development. The tumor suppressor PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog on chromosome 10) is the most frequently inactivated phosphatase in human cancer (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). The loss of PTEN phosphatase activity increases downstream activity of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)–AKT signaling pathway (<i>3</i>, <i>4</i>). Preclinical studies have shown that targeting the PI3K-AKT pathway reduces tumor growth when PTEN is inactivated (<i>5</i>). However, many PTEN mutant tumors are resistant to such therapies. On page 651 of this issue, Lee <i>et al.</i> (<i>6</i>) activate PTEN phosphatase by inhibiting a newly described inhibitory system and thereby reduce PI3K-AKT signaling and tumor growth in mice.</p>

Reprogramming normal human epithelial tissues to a common, lethal neuroendocrine cancer lineage
<p>The use of potent therapies inhibiting critical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oncogen</span></strong>ic pathways active in epithelial cancers has led to multiple resistance mechanisms, including the development of highly aggressive, small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (SCNC). SCNC patients have a dismal prognosis due in part to a limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving this malignancy and the lack of effective treatments. Here, we demonstrate that a common set of defined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oncogen</span></strong>ic drivers reproducibly reprograms normal human prostate and lung epithelial cells to small cell prostate cancer (SCPC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC), respectively. We identify shared active transcription factor binding regions in the reprogrammed prostate and lung SCNCs by integrative analyses of epigenetic and transcriptional landscapes. These results suggest that neuroendocrine cancers arising from distinct epithelial tissues may share common vulnerabilities that could be exploited for the development of drugs targeting SCNCs.</p>

Fusion oncogenes—genetic musical chairs
<p>The cytogenetic definitions of many cancers predate the genome sequencing era. Indeed, some classes of cancers (largely subtypes of sarcomas, lymphomas, and leukemias) have long been defined by simple and distinct patterns of chromosomal changes, or karyotypes, that, in many cases, feature a single pathognomonic somatic translocation of two genomic regions that creates a fusion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oncogen</span></strong>e (for example, the Philadelphia chromosome translocation in chronic myelogenous leukemia results in the <i>BCR-ABL1</i> fusion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oncogen</span></strong>e) (<i>1</i>). Whereas many common cancers display genomic complexity consistent with multistep <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oncogen</span></strong>esis, such as carcinomas of breast and lung, cancers that are defined by translocations typically display simple karyotypes, suggesting that they were shaped by a single translocation. However, the cytogenetic simplicity of these cancers may mask more complex genomic events. On page 891 of this issue, Anderson <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) report whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of 50 Ewing sarcomas (EWSs), an aggressive sarcoma that is defined by fusion between the EWS RNA binding protein 1 (<i>EWSR1</i>) gene on chromosome 22 and an E26 transformation-specific (ETS) family transcription factor gene, either <i>FLI1</i> at 11q24 or <i>ERG</i> at 21q11 (<i>3</i>). Anderson <i>et al.</i> show that ∼40% of <i>EWSR1-FLI1</i> fusions and all <i>EWSR1-ERG</i> fusions arise via a complex rearrangement pattern called chromoplexy, which was first identified in prostate cancer (<i>4</i>). They suggest that chromoplexy “bursts” may be early initiating events in Ewing sarcomagenesis and mark a more aggressive form of the disease.</p>

Transmission between Archaic and Modern Human Ancestors during the Evolution of the Oncogenic Human Papillomavirus 16
<p>Every human suffers through life a number of papillomaviruses (PVs) infections, most of them asymptomatic. A notable exception are persistent infections by <i>Human papillomavirus 16</i> (HPV16), the most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oncogen</span></strong>ic infectious agent for humans and responsible for most infection-driven anogenital cancers. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oncogen</span></strong>ic potential is not homogeneous among HPV16 lineages, and genetic variation within HPV16 exhibits some geographic structure. However, an in-depth analysis of the HPV16 evolutionary history was still wanting. We have analyzed extant HPV16 diversity and compared the evolutionary and phylogeographical patterns of humans and of HPV16. We show that codivergence with modern humans explains at most 30% of the present viral geographical distribution. The most explanatory scenario suggests that ancestral HPV16 already infected ancestral human populations and that viral lineages co-diverged with the hosts in parallel with the split between archaic Neanderthal-Denisovans and ancestral modern human populations, generating the ancestral HPV16A and HPV16BCD viral lineages, respectively. We propose that after out-of-Africa migration of modern human ancestors, sexual transmission between human populations introduced HPV16A into modern human ancestor populations. We hypothesize that differential coevolution of HPV16 lineages with different but closely related ancestral human populations and subsequent host-switch events in parallel with introgression of archaic alleles into the genomes of modern human ancestors may be largely responsible for the present-day differential prevalence and association with cancers for HPV16 variants.</p>

RUNX2 correlates with subtype-specific breast cancer in a human tissue microarray, and ectopic expression of <i>Runx2</i> perturbs differentiation in the mouse mammary gland
<p>RUNX2, a master regulator of osteogenesis, is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oncogen</span></strong>ic in the lymphoid lineage; however, little is known about its role in epithelial cancers. Upregulation of <i>RUNX2</i> in cell lines correlates with increased invasiveness and the capacity to form osteolytic disease in models of breast and prostate cancer. However, most studies have analysed the effects of this gene in a limited number of cell lines and its role in primary breast cancer has not been resolved. Using a human tumour tissue microarray, we show that high RUNX2 expression is significantly associated with oestrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor (PR)/HER2-negative breast cancers and that patients with high RUNX2 expression have a poorer survival rate than those with negative or low expression. We confirm <i>RUNX2</i> as a gene that has a potentially important functional role in triple-negative breast cancer. To investigate the role of this gene in breast cancer, we made a transgenic model in which <i>Runx2</i> is specifically expressed in murine mammary epithelium under the control of the mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV) promoter. We show that ectopic <i>Runx2</i> perturbs normal development in pubertal and lactating animals, delaying ductal elongation and inhibiting lobular alveolar differentiation. We also show that the <i>Runx2</i> transgene elicits age-related, pre-neoplastic changes in the mammary epithelium of older transgenic animals, suggesting that elevated RUNX2 expression renders such tissue more susceptible to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oncogen</span></strong>ic changes and providing further evidence that this gene might have an important, context-dependent role in breast cancer.</p>

In <i>Drosophila</i>, RhoGEF2 cooperates with activated Ras in tumorigenesis through a pathway involving Rho1–Rok–Myosin-II and JNK signalling
<p>The <i>Ras</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oncogen</span></strong>e contributes to ∼30% of human cancers, but alone is not sufficient for tumorigenesis. In a <i>Drosophila</i> screen for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oncogen</span></strong>es that cooperate with an activated allele of <i>Ras</i> (<i>Ras<sup>ACT</sup></i>) to promote tissue overgrowth and invasion, we identified the GTP exchange factor <i>RhoGEF2</i>, an activator of Rho-family signalling. Here, we show that RhoGEF2 also cooperates with an activated allele of a downstream effector of Ras, <i>Raf</i> (<i>Raf<sup>GOF</sup></i>). We dissect the downstream pathways through which RhoGEF2 cooperates with Ras<sup>ACT</sup> (and Raf<sup>GOF</sup>), and show that RhoGEF2 requires Rho1, but not Rac, for tumorigenesis. Furthermore, of the Rho1 effectors, we show that RhoGEF2 + Ras (Raf)-mediated tumorigenesis requires the Rho kinase (Rok)–Myosin-II pathway, but not Diaphanous, Lim kinase or protein kinase N. The Rho1–Rok–Myosin-II pathway leads to the activation of Jun kinase (JNK), in cooperation with Ras<sup>ACT</sup>. Moreover, we show that activation of Rok or Myosin II, using constitutively active transgenes, is sufficient for cooperative tumorigenesis with Ras<sup>ACT</sup>, and together with Ras<sup>ACT</sup> leads to strong activation of JNK. Our results show that Rok–Myosin-II activity is necessary and sufficient for Ras-mediated tumorigenesis. Our observation that activation of Myosin II, which regulates Filamentous actin (F-actin) contractility without affecting F-actin levels, cooperates with Ras<sup>ACT</sup> to promote JNK activation and tumorigenesis, suggests that increased cell contractility is a key factor in tumorigenesis. Furthermore, we show that signalling via the Tumour necrosis factor (TNF; also known as Egr)-ligand–JNK pathway is most likely the predominant pathway that activates JNK upon Rok activation. Overall, our analysis highlights the need for further analysis of the Rok–Myosin-II pathway in cooperation with Ras in human cancers.</p>

Trans-inhibition of activation and proliferation signals by Fc receptors in mast cells and basophils
<p>Allergic and autoimmune inflammation are associated with the activation of mast cells and basophils by antibodies against allergens or auto-antigens, respectively. Both cell types express several receptors for the Fc portion of antibodies, the engagement of which by antigen-antibody complexes controls their responses. When aggregated on the plasma membrane, high-affinity immunoglobulin E (IgE) receptors (FcεRI) and low-affinity IgG receptors (FcγRIIIA in mice, FcγRIIA in humans) induce these cells to release and secrete proinflammatory mediators, chemokines, and cytokines that account for clinical symptoms. When coaggregated with activating receptors on the same cells, other low-affinity IgG receptors (FcγRIIB in both species) inhibit mast cell and basophil activation. We found that FcγRIIB inhibited not only signals triggered by activating receptors with which they were coengaged (cis-inhibition), but also signals triggered by receptors engaged independently (trans-inhibition). Trans-inhibition acted upon the FcεRI-dependent activation of mouse mast cells, mouse basophils, and human basophils, and upon growth factor receptor (Kit)–dependent normal mouse mast cell proliferation, as well as the constitutive in vitro proliferation and the in vivo growth of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oncogen</span></strong>e (v-Abl)–transformed mastocytoma cells. Trans-inhibition was induced by receptors, whether inhibitory (FcγRIIB) or activating (FcεRI), which recruited the lipid phosphatase SHIP1. By hydrolyzing PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>, SHIP1 induced a global unresponsiveness that affected biological responses triggered by receptors that use phosphoinositide 3-kinase to signal. These data suggest that trans-inhibition controls numerous physiological and pathological processes, and that it may be used as a therapeutic tool in inflammation, especially but not exclusively, in allergy and autoimmunity.</p>

The p85 isoform of the kinase S6K1 functions as a secreted oncoprotein to facilitate cell migration and tumor growth

Convergence of Wnt, growth factor, and heterotrimeric G protein signals on the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Daple
<p>Cellular proliferation, differentiation, and morphogenesis are shaped by multiple signaling cascades, and their dysregulation plays an integral role in cancer progression. Three cascades that contribute to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oncogen</span></strong>ic potential are those mediated by Wnt proteins and the receptor Frizzled (FZD), growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), and heterotrimeric G proteins and associated GPCRs. Daple is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the G protein G<sub>αi</sub>. Daple also binds to FZD and the Wnt/FZD mediator Dishevelled (Dvl), and it enhances β-catenin–independent Wnt signaling in response to Wnt5a-FZD7 signaling. We identified Daple as a substrate of multiple RTKs and non-RTKs and, hence, as a point of convergence for the three cascades. We found that phosphorylation near the Dvl-binding motif in Daple by both RTKs and non-RTKs caused Daple/Dvl complex dissociation and augmented the ability of Daple to bind to and activate G<sub>αi</sub>, which potentiated β-catenin–independent Wnt signals and stimulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) similarly to Wnt5a/FZD7 signaling. Although Daple acts as a tumor suppressor in the healthy colon, the concurrent increased abundance of Daple and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in colorectal tumors was associated with poor patient prognosis. Thus, the Daple-dependent activation of G<sub>αi</sub> and the Daple-dependent enhancement of β-catenin–independent Wnt signals are not only stimulated by Wnt5a/FZD7 to suppress tumorigenesis but also hijacked by growth factor–activated RTKs to enhance tumor progression. These findings identify a cross-talk paradigm among growth factor RTKs, heterotrimeric G proteins, and the Wnt/FZD pathway in cancer.</p>

SILAC identifies LAD1 as a filamin-binding regulator of actin dynamics in response to EGF and a marker of aggressive breast tumors
<p>Mutations mimicking growth factor–induced proliferation and motility characterize aggressive subtypes of mammary tumors. To unravel currently unknown players in these processes, we performed phosphoproteomic analysis on untransformed mammary epithelial cells (MCF10A) that were stimulated in culture with epidermal growth factor (EGF). We identified ladinin-1 (LAD1), a largely uncharacterized protein to date, as a phosphorylation-regulated mediator of the EGF-to-ERK pathway. Further experiments revealed that LAD1 mediated the proliferation and migration of mammary cells. LAD1 was transcriptionally induced, phosphorylated, and partly colocalized with actin stress fibers in response to EGF. Yeast two-hybrid, proximity ligation, and coimmunoprecipitation assays revealed that LAD1 bound to actin–cross-linking proteins called filamins. Cosedimentation analyses indicated that LAD1 played a role in actin dynamics, probably in collaboration with the scaffold protein 14-3-3σ (also called SFN). Depletion of LAD1 decreased the expression of transcripts associated with cell survival and inhibited the growth of mammary xenografts in an animal model. Furthermore, LAD1 predicts poor patient prognosis and is highly expressed in aggressive subtypes of breast cancer characterized as integrative clusters 5 and 10, which partly correspond to triple-negative and HER2-positive tumors.

MAFB enhances oncogenic Notch signaling in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia
<p>Activating mutations in the gene encoding the cell-cell contact signaling protein Notch1 are common in human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALLs). However, expressing <i>Notch1</i> mutant alleles in mice fails to efficiently induce the development of leukemia. We performed a gain-of-function screen to identify proteins that enhanced signaling by leukemia-associated Notch1 mutants. The transcription factors MAFB and ETS2 emerged as candidates that individually enhanced Notch1 signaling, and when coexpressed, they synergistically increased signaling to an extent similar to that induced by core components of the Notch transcriptional complex. In mouse models of T-ALL, MAFB enhanced leukemogenesis by the naturally occurring Notch1 mutants, decreased disease latency, and increased disease penetrance. Decreasing MAFB abundance in mouse and human T-ALL cells reduced the expression of Notch1 target genes, including <i>MYC</i> and <i>HES1</i>, and sustained MAFB knockdown impaired T-ALL growth in a competitive setting. MAFB bound to ETS2 and interacted with the acetyltransferases PCAF and P300, highlighting its importance in recruiting coactivators that enhance Notch1 signaling. Together, these data identify a mechanism for enhancing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oncogen</span></strong>ic potential of weak Notch1 mutants in leukemia models, and they reveal the MAFB-ETS2 transcriptional axis as a potential therapeutic target in T-ALL.</p>

Regulation of autophagy, NF-κB signaling, and cell viability by miR-124 in <i>KRAS</i> mutant mesenchymal-like NSCLC cells
<p><i>KRAS</i> mutant non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) may be classified into epithelial or mesenchymal subtypes. Despite having the same “driver” mutation, mesenchymal NSCLCs are less responsive than are epithelial NSCLCs to inhibition of the RAS pathway. Identifying alternative networks that promote survival specifically in mesenchymal NSCLC may lead to more effective treatments for this subtype. Through their numerous targets in cellular signaling pathways, noncoding microRNAs (miRNAs) often function as tumor suppressors or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oncogen</span></strong>es. In particular, some miRNAs regulate the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We derived an EMT-related miRNA signature by profiling the abundance of miRNAs in a panel of epithelial (KE) or mesenchymal (KM) <i>KRAS</i> mutant NSCLC cell lines. This signature revealed a number of suppressed miRNAs in KM cell lines, including members of the miR-200 family, which can suppress tumor progression by inhibiting EMT. Reconstituting KM cells with one of these miRNAs, miR-124, disrupted autophagy and decreased cell survival by reducing the abundance of p62, which is both an adaptor for selective autophagy and a regulator of the transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NF-κB). Suppression of p62 by miR-124 correlated with reduced abundance of the autophagy activator beclin 1 (BECN1), the ubiquitin ligase TRAF6, and the NF-κB subunit RELA/p65. The abundance of miR-124 inversely correlated with the expression of <i>BECN1</i> and <i>TRAF6</i> in patient NSCLC samples. These findings reveal how the loss of miR-124 promotes cell survival networks in the aggressive mesenchymal subtype of <i>KRAS</i> mutant NSCLC, which might lead to improved subtype-selective therapeutic strategies for patients.</p>

The transcription factor MAFK induces EMT and malignant progression of triple-negative breast cancer cells through its target GPNMB
<p>Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is particularly aggressive and difficult to treat. For example, the transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) pathway is implicated in TNBC progression and metastasis, but its opposing role in tumor suppression in healthy tissues and early-stage lesions makes it a challenging target. Therefore, additional molecular characterization of TNBC may lead to improved patient prognosis by informing the development and optimum use of targeted therapies. We found that musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma (MAF) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oncogen</span></strong>e family protein K (MAFK), a member of the small MAF family of transcription factors that are induced by the TGF-β pathway, was abundant in human TNBC and aggressive mouse mammary tumor cell lines. MAFK promoted tumorigenic growth and metastasis by 4T1 cells when implanted subcutaneously in mice. Overexpression of MAFK in mouse breast epithelial NMuMG cells induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotypes and promoted tumor formation and invasion in mice. MAFK induced the expression of the gene encoding the transmembrane glycoprotein nmb (GPNMB). Similar to MAFK, GPNMB overexpression in NMuMG cells induced EMT, tumor formation, and invasion, in mice, whereas knockdown of MAFK in tumor cells before implantation suppressed tumor growth and progression. <i>MAFK</i> and <i>GPNMB</i> expression correlated with poor prognosis in TNBC patients. These findings suggest that MAFK and its target gene <i>GPNMB</i> play important roles in the malignant progression of TNBC cells, offering potentially new therapeutic targets for TNBC patients.</p>

Pentraxin-3 is a PI3K signaling target that promotes stem cell–like traits in basal-like breast cancers
<p>Basal-like breast cancers (BLBCs) exhibit hyperactivation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway because of the frequent mutational activation of the <i>PIK3CA</i> catalytic subunit and the genetic loss of its negative regulators PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) and INPP4B (inositol polyphosphate-4-phosphatase type II). However, PI3K inhibitors have had limited clinical efficacy in BLBC management because of compensatory amplification of PI3K downstream signaling loops. Therefore, identification of critical PI3K mediators is paramount to the development of effective BLBC therapeutics. Using transcriptomic analysis of activated PIK3CA–expressing BLBC cells, we identified the gene encoding the humoral pattern recognition molecule pentraxin-3 (PTX3) as a critical target of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oncogen</span></strong>ic PI3K signaling. We found that PTX3 abundance is stimulated, in part, through AKT- and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)–dependent pathways and that presence of PTX3 is necessary for PI3K-induced stem cell–like traits. We further showed that <i>PTX3</i> expression is greater in tumor samples from patients with BLBC and that it is prognostic of poor patient survival. Our results thus reveal PTX3 as a newly identified PI3K-regulated biomarker and a potential therapeutic target in BLBC.</p>

Acetylation-dependent regulation of MDM2 E3 ligase activity dictates its oncogenic function
<p>Abnormal activation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oncogen</span></strong>ic E3 ubiquitin ligase murine double minute 2 (MDM2) is frequently observed in human cancers. By ubiquitinating the tumor suppressor p53 protein, which leads to its proteasome-mediated destruction, MDM2 limits the tumor-suppressing activity of p53. On the other hand, by ubiquitinating itself, MDM2 targets itself for destruction and promotes the p53 tumor suppressor pathway, a process that can be antagonized by the deubiquitinase herpesvirus-associated ubiquitin-specific protease (HAUSP). We investigated the regulation of MDM2 substrate specificity and found that acetyltransferase p300–mediated acetylation and stabilization of MDM2 are molecular switches that block self-ubiquitination, thereby shifting its E3 ligase activity toward p53. In vitro and in cancer cell lines, p300-mediated acetylation of MDM2 on Lys<sup>182</sup> and Lys<sup>185</sup> enabled HAUSP to bind, presumably deubiquitinate, and stabilize MDM2. This acetylation within the nuclear localization signal domain decreased its interaction with the acidic domain, subsequently increased the interaction between the acidic domain and RING domain in MDM2, enabled the binding of HAUSP to the acidic domain in MDM2, and shifted MDM2 activity from autoubiquitination to p53 ubiquitination. However, upon genotoxic stress through exposure to etoposide, the deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) deacetylated MDM2 at Lys<sup>182</sup> and Lys<sup>185</sup>, thereby promoting self-ubiquitination and less ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of p53, thus increasing p53-dependent apoptosis. Therefore, this study indicates that dynamic acetylation is a molecular switch in the regulation of MDM2 substrate specificity, revealing further insight into the posttranslational regulation of the MDM2/p53 cell survival axis.</p>

The neuropilin 2 isoform NRP2b uniquely supports TGFβ-mediated progression in lung cancer
<p>Neuropilins (NRP1 and NRP2) are co-receptors for heparin-binding growth factors and class 3 semaphorins. Different isoforms of NRP1 and NRP2 are produced by alternative splicing. We found that in non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines, transforming growth factor–β (TGFβ) signaling preferentially increased the abundance of NRP2b. NRP2b and NRP2a differ only in their carboxyl-terminal regions. Although the presence of NRP2b inhibited cultured cell proliferation and primary tumor growth, NRP2b enhanced cellular migration, invasion into Matrigel, and tumorsphere formation in cultured cells in response to TGFβ signaling and promoted metastasis in xenograft mouse models. These effects of overexpressed NRP2b contrast with the effects of overexpressed NRP2a. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)–induced phosphorylation of the kinase AKT was specifically promoted by NRP2b, whereas inhibiting the HGF receptor MET attenuated NRP2b-dependent cell migration. Unlike NRP2a, NRP2b did not bind the PDZ domain scaffolding protein GAIP carboxyl terminus–interacting protein (GIPC1) and only weakly recruited phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), potentially explaining the difference between NRP2b-mediated and NRP2a-mediated effects. Analysis of NSCLC patient tumors showed that NRP2b abundance correlated with that of the immune cell checkpoint receptor ligand PD-L1 as well as with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotypes in the tumors, acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors, disease progression, and poor survival in patients. NRP2b knockdown attenuated the acquisition of resistance to the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib in cultured NSCLC cells. Thus, in NSCLC, NRP2b contributed to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oncogen</span></strong>ic response to TGFβ and correlated with tumor progression in patients.</p>

Reactivation of PTEN tumor suppressor for cancer treatment through inhibition of a MYC-WWP1 inhibitory pathway
<p>Activation of tumor suppressors for the treatment of human cancer has been a long sought, yet elusive, strategy. PTEN is a critical tumor suppressive phosphatase that is active in its dimer configuration at the plasma membrane. Polyubiquitination by the ubiquitin E3 ligase WWP1 (WW domain–containing ubiquitin E3 ligase 1) suppressed the dimerization, membrane recruitment, and function of PTEN. Either genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of WWP1 triggered PTEN reactivation and unleashed tumor suppressive activity. <i>WWP1</i> appears to be a direct MYC (MYC proto-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oncogen</span></strong>e) target gene and was critical for MYC-driven tumorigenesis. We identified indole-3-carbinol, a compound found in cruciferous vegetables, as a natural and potent WWP1 inhibitor. Thus, our findings unravel a potential therapeutic strategy for cancer prevention and treatment through PTEN reactivation.</p>

The chromatin of cancer
<p>Developments in modern genomics tools have led to rapid progress in our understanding of the genetic basis of cancer. Recent large-scale efforts have primarily focused on two types of analysis: mapping acquired somatic mutations by whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>), and identification of common inherited variants that increase cancer risk using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) (<i>3</i>). Despite the power of these technologies, we are still far from understanding how the variants and mutations found in individual tumors precisely drive the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oncogen</span></strong>ic process. A large number of genetic variants increase risk for cancer, but most explain only a very small fraction of the risk. Furthermore, although acquired somatic mutations are found in almost all tumors, most do not carry complete sets of mutations that, according to our present mechanistic understanding, would be sufficient to cause cancer. On page 420 of this issue, Corces <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) show how a third type of genomics approach—functional genomic analyses of primary human tumors—can begin to bridge this gap in our mechanistic understanding of the tumorigenic process.</p>

Cancer origins—genetics rules the day
<p>A major goal of cancer research is to identify central molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the development of tumors and their response to treatment, with the aim of uncovering key vulnerabilities. Early events in the development of cancer may inform such vulnerabilities (<i>1</i>), but early tumors are much more difficult to observe and study in patients than established tumors. Indeed, one of the hardest issues to resolve in early tumor development is the relative contributions of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oncogen</span></strong>ic driver mutations and the nonpathogenic gene networks expressed in a precancerous cell. On page 91 of this issue, Park <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) investigate the mechanisms of development of neuro endocrine cancer in the lung and the prostate using human epithelial cells in culture. They find that these neuroendocrine tumors can arise from non-neuroendocrine epithelial cells, which converge upon reprogramming toward a neuroendocrine fate via a common and specific combination of genetic factors.</p>

Programmable protein circuits in living cells
<p>Synthetic protein-level circuits could enable engineering of powerful new cellular behaviors.

In this study, we show that engineered viral proteases can function as composable protein components, which can together implement a broad variety of circuit-level functions in mammalian cells. In this system, termed CHOMP (circuits of hacked orthogonal modular proteases), input proteases dock with and cleave target proteases to inhibit their function. These components can be connected to generate regulatory cascades, binary logic gates, and dynamic analog signal-processing functions. To demonstrate the utility of this system, we rationally designed a circuit that induces cell death in response to upstream activators of the Ras <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oncogen</span></strong>e. Because CHOMP circuits can perform complex functions yet be encoded as single transcripts and delivered without genomic integration, they offer a scalable platform to facilitate protein circuit engineering for biotechnological applications.</p>

Cancer mutations and targeted drugs can disrupt dynamic signal encoding by the Ras-Erk pathway
<p>The Ras-Erk (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) pathway encodes information in its dynamics; the duration and frequency of Erk activity can specify distinct cell fates.

We used optogenetic profiling to show that both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oncogen</span></strong>ic B-Raf mutations and B-Raf inhibitors can cause corruption of this transmission, so that short pulses of input Ras activity are distorted into abnormally long Erk outputs. These changes can reshape downstream transcription and cell fates, resulting in improper decisions to proliferate. These findings illustrate how altered dynamic signal transmission properties, and not just constitutively increased signaling, can contribute to cell proliferation and perhaps cancer, and how optogenetic profiling can dissect mechanisms of signaling dysfunction in disease.</p>

Developmental and oncogenic programs in H3K27M gliomas dissected by single-cell RNA-seq

The linker histone H1.0 generates epigenetic and functional intratumor heterogeneity
<p>Tumors comprise functionally diverse subpopulations of cells with distinct proliferative potential. Here, we show that dynamic epigenetic states defined by the linker histone H1.0 determine which cells within a tumor can sustain the long-term cancer growth. Numerous cancer types exhibit high inter- and intratumor heterogeneity of H1.0, with H1.0 levels correlating with tumor differentiation status, patient survival, and, at the single-cell level, cancer stem cell markers. Silencing of H1.0 promotes maintenance of self-renewing cells by inducing derepression of megabase-sized gene domains harboring downstream effectors of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oncogen</span></strong>ic pathways. Self-renewing epigenetic states are not stable, and reexpression of H1.0 in subsets of tumor cells establishes transcriptional programs that restrict cancer cells’ long-term proliferative potential and drive their differentiation.

Molecular Evolution of the Yap/Yorkie Proto-Oncogene and Elucidation of Its Core Transcriptional Program
<p>Throughout Metazoa, developmental processes are controlled by a surprisingly limited number of conserved signaling pathways. Precisely how these signaling cassettes were assembled in early animal evolution remains poorly understood, as do the molecular transitions that potentiated the acquisition of their myriad developmental functions. Here we analyze the molecular evolution of the proto-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oncogen</span></strong>e yes-associated protein (Yap)/Yorkie, a key effector of the Hippo signaling pathway that controls organ size in both <i>Drosophila</i> and mammals. Based on heterologous functional analysis of evolutionarily distant Yap/Yorkie orthologs, we demonstrate that a structurally distinct interaction interface between Yap/Yorkie and its partner TEAD/Scalloped became fixed in the eumetazoan common ancestor. We then combine transcriptional profiling of tissues expressing phylogenetically diverse forms of Yap/Yorkie with ChIP-seq validation to identify a common downstream gene expression program underlying the control of tissue growth in <i>Drosophila</i>. Intriguingly, a subset of the newly identified Yorkie target genes are also induced by Yap in mammalian tissues, thus revealing a conserved Yap-dependent gene expression signature likely to mediate organ size control throughout bilaterian animals. Combined, these experiments provide new mechanistic insights while revealing the ancient evolutionary history of Hippo signaling.</p>

<i>H. pylori</i> virulence factor CagA increases intestinal cell proliferation by Wnt pathway activation in a transgenic zebrafish model
<p>Infection with <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> is a major risk factor for the development of gastric cancer, and infection with strains carrying the virulence factor CagA significantly increases this risk. To investigate the mechanisms by which CagA promotes carcinogenesis, we generated transgenic zebrafish expressing CagA ubiquitously or in the anterior intestine. Transgenic zebrafish expressing either the wild-type or a phosphorylation-resistant form of CagA exhibited significantly increased rates of intestinal epithelial cell proliferation and showed significant upregulation of the Wnt target genes <i>cyclinD1</i>, <i>axin2</i> and the zebrafish <i>c-myc</i> ortholog <i>myca</i>. Coexpression of CagA with a loss-of-function allele encoding the β-catenin destruction complex protein Axin1 resulted in a further increase in intestinal proliferation. Coexpression of CagA with a null allele of the key β-catenin transcriptional cofactor Tcf4 restored intestinal proliferation to wild-type levels. These results provide <i>in vivo</i> evidence of Wnt pathway activation by CagA downstream of or in parallel to the β-catenin destruction complex and upstream of Tcf4. Long-term transgenic expression of wild-type CagA, but not the phosphorylation-resistant form, resulted in significant hyperplasia of the adult intestinal epithelium. We further utilized this model to demonstrate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oncogen</span></strong>ic cooperation between CagA and a loss-of-function allele of <i>p53</i> is sufficient to induce high rates of intestinal small cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, establishing the utility of our transgenic zebrafish model in the study of CagA-associated gastrointestinal cancers.</p>

Deregulation of <i>myc</i> leads to tumorigenesis and is a hallmark of many human cancers. We have recently identified homologs of <i>myc</i> (<i>myc1</i>, <i>myc2</i>) and <i>max</i> in the early diploblastic cnidarian <i>Hydra</i> and have characterized <i>myc1</i> in detail. Here we show that <i>myc2</i> is transcriptionally activated in the interstitial stem cell system. Furthermore, in contrast to <i>myc1</i>, <i>myc2</i> expression is also detectable in proliferating epithelial stem cells throughout the gastric region. <i>myc2</i> but not <i>myc1</i> is activated in cycling precursor cells during early oogenesis and spermatogenesis, suggesting that the <i>Hydra</i> Myc2 protein has a possible non-redundant function in cell cycle progression. The Myc2 protein displays the principal design and properties of vertebrate Myc proteins. In complex with Max, Myc2 binds to DNA with similar affinity as Myc1–Max heterodimers. Immunoprecipitation of <i>Hydra</i> chromatin revealed that both Myc1 and Myc2 bind to the enhancer region of <i>CAD</i>, a classical Myc target gene in mammals.

Genome-Wide Prediction of Metabolic Enzymes, Pathways, and Gene Clusters in Plants
<p>Plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism underpins many traits of ecological and agronomic importance. Plants produce numerous compounds to cope with their environments but the biosynthetic pathways for most of these compounds have not yet been elucidated. To engineer and improve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic traits, we need comprehensive and accurate knowledge of the organization and regulation of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism at the genome scale. Here, we present a computational pipeline to identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic enzymes, pathways, and gene clusters from a sequenced genome. Using this pipeline, we generated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic pathway databases for 22 species and identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic gene clusters from 18 species. This unified resource can be used to conduct a wide array of comparative studies of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism. Using the resource, we discovered a widespread occurrence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic gene clusters in plants: 11,969 clusters from 18 species. The prevalence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic gene clusters offers an intriguing possibility of an untapped source for uncovering new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ite biosynthesis pathways. For example, more than 1,700 clusters contain enzymes that could generate a specialized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ite scaffold (signature enzymes) and enzymes that modify the scaffold (tailoring enzymes). In four species with sufficient gene expression data, we identified 43 highly coexpressed clusters that contain signature and tailoring enzymes, of which eight were characterized previously to be functional pathways. Finally, we identified patterns of genome organization that implicate local gene duplication and, to a lesser extent, single gene transposition as having played roles in the evolution of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic gene clusters.</p>

The metabolic cost of communicative sound production in bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>)
<p>Bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>) produce various communicative sounds that are important for social behavior, maintaining group cohesion and coordinating foraging. For example, whistle production increases during disturbances, such as separations of mother–calf pairs and vessel approaches. It is clear that acoustic communication is important to the survival of these marine mammals, yet the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic cost of producing whistles and other socials sounds and the energetic consequences of modifying these sounds in response to both natural and anthropogenic disturbance are unknown. We used flow-through respirometry to determine whether the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic cost of sound production could be quantified in two captive dolphins producing social sounds (whistles and squawks). On average, we found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic rates measured during 2 min periods of sound production were 1.2 times resting values. Up to 7 min were required for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism to return to resting values following vocal periods. The total <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic cost (over resting values) of the 2 min vocal period plus the required recovery period (163.3 to 2995.9 ml O<sub>2</sub> or 3279.6 to 60,166.7 J) varied by individual as well as by mean duration of sounds produced within the vocal period. Observed variation in received cumulative sound energy levels of vocalizations was not related to total <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic costs. Furthermore, our empirical findings did not agree with previous theoretical estimates of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic cost of whistles. This study provides the first empirical data on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic cost of sound production in dolphins, which can be used to estimate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic costs of vocal responses to environmental perturbations in wild dolphins.</p>

Abl and Arg mediate cysteine cathepsin secretion to facilitate melanoma invasion and metastasis
<p>The incidence of melanoma is increasing, particularly in young women, and the disease remains incurable for many because of its aggressive, metastatic nature and its high rate of resistance to conventional, targeted, and immunological agents. Cathepsins are proteases that are critical for melanoma progression and therapeutic resistance. Intracellular cathepsins cleave or degrade proteins that restrict cancer progression, whereas extracellular cathepsins directly cleave the extracellular matrix and activate proinvasive proteases in the tumor microenvironment. Cathepsin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion is markedly increased in cancer cells. We investigated the signaling pathways leading to increased cathepsin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion in melanoma cells. We found that the nonreceptor tyrosine kinases Abl and Arg (Abl/Arg) promoted the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion of cathepsin B and cathepsin L by activating transcription factors (namely, Ets1, Sp1, and NF-κB/p65) that have key roles in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), invasion, and therapeutic resistance. In some melanoma cell lines, Abl/Arg promoted the Ets1/p65-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion of cathepsin B and cathepsin L in a kinase-independent manner, whereas in other melanoma lines, Abl/Arg promoted the kinase-dependent, Sp1/Ets1/p65–mediated induction of cathepsin L <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion and the Sp1/p65-mediated induction of cathepsin B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion. As an indication of clinical relevance, the abundance of mRNAs encoding Abl/Arg, Sp1, Ets1, and cathepsins was positively correlated in primary melanomas, and Abl/Arg-driven invasion in culture and metastasis in vivo required cathepsin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion. These data suggest that drugs targeting Abl kinases, many of which are FDA-approved, might inhibit cathepsin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion in some melanomas and potentially other aggressive cancers harboring activated Abl kinases.</p>

Direct Proteomic Quantification of the Secretome of Activated Immune Cells
<sec><title>Tracking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ed Proteins</title><p>The proteins <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ed by cells provide a flow of information within tissues and are thus of particular interest. However, systematic detection of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ed proteins is tricky because they tend to be present in small amounts within complex mixtures of proteins where other components are very abundant. <bold>Meissner <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 475) developed a method for screening the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ed proteins from cultured mouse macrophages in response to cues that cause inflammation. The amount of contaminating proteins was reduced by culturing the cells without added serum and then sensitive mass spectrometry techniques were used to detect and quantify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion of nearly 800 different proteins. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion was compared from cells lacking the signaling adaptor proteins MyD88 or TRIF, or both. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion of some proteins were regulated redundantly and were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ed without one of the adaptors, but others required both signals for release. Some anti-inflammatory proteins were released at later times in response to synergistic signals from both adaptor proteins, perhaps as a fail-safe mechanism to prevent excessive inflammation.</p></sec>

Metabolic and Proliferative State of Vascular Adventitial Fibroblasts in Pulmonary Hypertension Is Regulated Through a MicroRNA-124/PTBP1 (Polypyrimidine Tract Binding Protein 1)/Pyruvate Kinase Muscle Axis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>An emerging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic theory of pulmonary hypertension (PH) suggests that cellular and mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic dysfunction underlies the pathology of this disease. We and others have previously demonstrated the existence of hyperproliferative, apoptosis-resistant, proinflammatory adventitial fibroblasts from human and bovine hypertensive pulmonary arterial walls (PH-Fibs) that exhibit constitutive reprogramming of glycolytic and mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism, accompanied by an increased ratio of glucose catabolism through glycolysis versus the tricarboxylic acid cycle. However, the mechanisms responsible for these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic alterations in PH-Fibs remain unknown. We hypothesized that in PH-Fibs microRNA-124 (miR-124) regulates PTBP1 (polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1) expression to control alternative splicing of pyruvate kinase muscle (PKM) isoforms 1 and 2, resulting in an increased PKM2/PKM1 ratio, which promotes glycolysis and proliferation even in aerobic environments.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Pulmonary adventitial fibroblasts were isolated from calves and humans with severe PH (PH-Fibs) and from normal subjects. PTBP1 gene knockdown was achieved via PTBP1-siRNA; restoration of miR-124 was performed with miR-124 mimic. TEPP-46 and shikonin were used to manipulate PKM2 glycolytic function. Histone deacetylase inhibitors were used to treat cells. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic products were determined by mass spectrometry–based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>omics analyses, and mitochondrial function was analyzed by confocal microscopy and spectrofluorometry.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We detected an increased PKM2/PKM1 ratio in PH-Fibs compared with normal subjects.

Furthermore, normalizing the PKM2/PKM1 ratio in PH-Fibs by miR-124 overexpression or PTBP1 knockdown reversed the glycolytic phenotype (decreased the production of glycolytic intermediates and byproducts, ie, lactate), rescued mitochondrial reprogramming, and decreased cell proliferation. Pharmacological manipulation of PKM2 activity with TEPP-46 and shikonin or treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors produced similar results.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In PH, miR-124, through the alternative splicing factor PTBP1, regulates the PKM2/PKM1 ratio, the overall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic, proliferative, and inflammatory state of cells.

Separating host and microbiome contributions to drug pharmacokinetics and toxicity
<p>The gut microbiota is implicated in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism of many medical drugs, with consequences for interpersonal variation in drug efficacy and toxicity. However, quantifying microbial contributions to drug <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism is challenging, particularly in cases where host and microbiome perform the same <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic transformation. We combined gut commensal genetics with gnotobiotics to measure brivudine drug <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism across tissues in mice that vary in a single microbiome-encoded enzyme.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
F-Actin Mediated Focusing of Vesicles at the Cell Tip Is Essential for Polarized Growth
<p>F-actin has been shown to be essential for tip growth in an array of plant models, including <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. One hypothesis is that diffusion can transport <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ory vesicles, while actin plays a regulatory role during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion. Alternatively, it is possible that actin-based transport is necessary to overcome vesicle transport limitations to sustain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion. Therefore, a quantitative analysis of diffusion, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion kinetics, and cell geometry is necessary to clarify the role of actin in polarized growth. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis, we first show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ory vesicles move toward and accumulate at the tip in an actin-dependent manner. We then depolymerized F-actin to decouple vesicle diffusion from actin-mediated transport and measured the diffusion coefficient and concentration of vesicles. Using these values, we constructed a theoretical diffusion-based model for growth, demonstrating that with fast-enough vesicle fusion kinetics, diffusion could support normal cell growth rates. We further refined our model to explore how experimentally extrapolated vesicle fusion kinetics and the size of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion zone limit diffusion-based growth. This model predicts that diffusion-mediated growth is dependent on the size of the region of exocytosis at the tip and that diffusion-based growth would be significantly slower than normal cell growth. To further explore the size of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion zone, we used a cell wall degradation enzyme cocktail and determined that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion zone is smaller than 6 μm in diameter at the tip. Taken together, our results highlight the requirement for active transport in polarized growth and provide important insight into vesicle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion during tip growth.</p>

Altered lipid homeostasis in <i>Drosophila</i> InsP<sub>3</sub> receptor mutants leads to obesity and hyperphagia
<p>Obesity is a complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic disorder that often manifests with a strong genetic component in humans. However, the genetic basis for obesity and the accompanying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic syndrome is poorly defined. At a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic level, obesity arises from an imbalance between the nutritional intake and energy utilization of an organism. Mechanisms that sense the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic state of the individual and convey this information to satiety centers help achieve this balance. Mutations in genes that alter or modify such signaling mechanisms are likely to lead to either obese individuals, who in mammals are at high risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease, or excessively thin individuals with accompanying health problems. Here we show that <i>Drosophila</i> mutants for an intracellular calcium signaling channel, the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP<sub>3</sub>R) store excess triglycerides in their fat bodies and become unnaturally obese on a normal diet. Although excess insulin signaling can rescue obesity in InsP<sub>3</sub>R mutants to some extent, we show that it is not the only cause of the defect. Through mass spectrometric analysis of lipids we find that homeostasis of storage and membrane lipids are altered in InsP<sub>3</sub>R mutants. Possibly as a compensatory mechanism, InsP<sub>3</sub>R mutant adults also feed excessively. Thus, reduced InsP<sub>3</sub>R function alters lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism and causes hyperphagia in adults. Together, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic and behavioral changes lead to obesity. Our results implicate altered InsP<sub>3</sub> signaling as a previously unknown causative factor for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic syndrome in humans. Importantly, our studies also suggest preventive dietary interventions.</p>

Darkened Leaves Use Different Metabolic Strategies for Senescence and Survival
<p>In plants, an individually darkened leaf initiates senescence much more rapidly than a leaf from a whole darkened plant. Combining transcriptomic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>omic approaches in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), we present an overview of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic strategies that are employed in response to different darkening treatments. Under darkened plant conditions, the perception of carbon starvation drove a profound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic readjustment in which branched-chain amino acids and potentially monosaccharides released from cell wall loosening became important substrates for maintaining minimal ATP production. Concomitantly, the increased accumulation of amino acids with a high nitrogen-carbon ratio may provide a safety mechanism for the storage of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ically derived cytotoxic ammonium and a pool of nitrogen for use upon returning to typical growth conditions. Conversely, in individually darkened leaf, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic profiling that followed our <sup>13</sup>C-enrichment assays revealed a temporal and differential exchange of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites, including sugars and amino acids, between the darkened leaf and the rest of the plant. This active transport could be the basis for a progressive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic shift in the substrates fueling mitochondrial activities, which are central to the catabolic reactions facilitating the retrieval of nutrients from the senescing leaf. We propose a model illustrating the specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic strategies employed by leaves in response to these two darkening treatments, which support either rapid senescence or a strong capacity for survival.</p>

Glutathione Transferase U13 Functions in Pathogen-Triggered Glucosinolate Metabolism<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Glutathione (GSH) and indole glucosinolates (IGs) exert key functions in the immune system of the model plant Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Appropriate GSH levels are important for execution of both pre- and postinvasive disease resistance mechanisms to invasive pathogens, whereas an intact PENETRATION2 (PEN2)-pathway for IG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism is essential for preinvasive resistance in this species. Earlier indirect evidence suggested that the latter pathway involves conjugation of GSH with unstable products of IG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism and further processing of the resulting adducts to biologically active molecules. Here we describe the identification of Glutathione-<i>S</i>-Transferase class-tau member 13 (GSTU13) as an indispensable component of the PEN2 immune pathway for IG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism. <i>gstu13</i> mutant plants are defective in the pathogen-triggered biosynthesis of end products of the PEN2 pathway, including 4-O-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosyl-indol-3-yl formamide, indole-3-ylmethyl amine, and raphanusamic acid. In line with this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic defect, lack of functional GSTU13 results in enhanced disease susceptibility toward several fungal pathogens including <i>Erysiphe pisi</i>, <i>Colletotrichum gloeosporioides</i>, and <i>Plectosphaerella cucumerina</i>. Seedlings of <i>gstu13</i> plants fail also to deposit the (1,3)-β-glucan cell wall polymer, callose, after recognition of the bacterial flg22 epitope. We show that GSTU13 mediates specifically the role of GSH in IG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism without noticeable impact on other immune functions of this tripeptide. We postulate that GSTU13 connects GSH with the pathogen-triggered PEN2 pathway for IG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism to deliver <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites that may have numerous functions in the innate immune system of Arabidopsis.</p>

A Comprehensively Curated Genome-Scale Two-Cell Model for the Heterocystous Cyanobacterium <i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120
<p><i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120 is a nitrogen-fixing filamentous cyanobacterium. Under nitrogen-limiting conditions, a fraction of the vegetative cells in each filament terminally differentiate to nongrowing heterocysts. Heterocysts are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ically and structurally specialized to enable O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive nitrogen fixation. The functionality of the filament, as an association of vegetative cells and heterocysts, is postulated to depend on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic exchange of electrons, carbon, and fixed nitrogen. In this study, we compile and evaluate a comprehensive curated stoichiometric model of this two-cell system, with the objective function based on the growth of the filament under diazotrophic conditions. The predicted growth rate under nitrogen-replete and -deplete conditions, as well as the effect of external carbon and nitrogen sources, was thereafter verified. Furthermore, the model was utilized to comprehensively evaluate the optimality of putative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic exchange reactions between heterocysts and vegetative cells. The model suggested that optimal growth requires at least four exchange <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites. Several combinations of exchange <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites resulted in predicted growth rates that are higher than growth rates achieved by only considering exchange of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites previously suggested in the literature.

Patients With Long-QT Syndrome Caused by Impaired <i>hERG</i>-Encoded K<sub>v</sub>11.1 Potassium Channel Have Exaggerated Endocrine Pancreatic and Incretin Function Associated With Reactive Hypoglycemia

Genomic Signatures of Specialized Metabolism in Plants
<sec><title>Specialized Evolution</title><p>Many plants make chemical compounds that are potentially of use to humans, but their evolutionary histories are unknown. <bold>Chae <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 510) examined how algae and land plants have been able to evolve secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism biochemistry—those compounds produced in response to their environment—in the face of purifying evolutionary pressure to maintain primary and necessary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic pathways. Genomic data was used to separate the primary from the secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism pathway genes and to construct the evolutionary trajectories of secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism. Secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic pathways tend to be controlled by clustered, co-regulated sets of newly duplicated and maintained genes.</p></sec>

A Connection between Lysine and Serotonin Metabolism in Rice Endosperm
<p>Cereal endosperms produce a vast array of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites, including the essential amino acid lysine (Lys). Enhanced accumulation of Lys has been achieved via <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic engineering in cereals, but the potential connection between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic engineering and Lys fortification is unclear. In mature seeds of engineered High Free Lysine (HFL) rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), the endosperm takes on a characteristic dark-brown appearance. In this study, we use an integrated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>omic and transcriptomic approach combined with functional validation to elucidate the key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites responsible for the dark-brown phenotype. Importantly, we found that serotonin biosynthesis was elevated dramatically and closely linked with dark-brown endosperm color in HFL rice. A functional connection between serotonin and endosperm color was confirmed via overexpression of TDC3, a key enzyme of serotonin biosynthesis. Furthermore, we show that both the jasmonate signaling pathway and <i>TDC</i> expression were strongly induced in the late stage of endosperm development of HFL rice, coinciding with serotonin accumulation and dark-brown pigmentation. We propose a model for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic connection between Lys and serotonin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism in which elevated 2-aminoadipate from Lys catabolism may play a key role in the connection between the jasmonate signaling pathway, serotonin accumulation, and the brown phenotype in rice endosperm. Our data provide a deeper understanding of amino acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism in rice. In addition, the finding that both Lys and serotonin accumulate in HFL rice grains should promote efforts to create a nutritionally favorable crop.</p>

Impaired Malate and Fumarate Accumulation Due to the Mutation of the Tonoplast Dicarboxylate Transporter Has Little Effects on Stomatal Behavior
<p>Malate is a central <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ite involved in a multiplicity of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic pathways, being associated with mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism and playing significant roles in stomatal movements. Vacuolar malate transport has been characterized at the molecular level and is performed by at least one carrier protein and two channels in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) vacuoles. The absence of the Arabidopsis tonoplast Dicarboxylate Transporter (tDT) in the <i>tdt</i> knockout mutant was associated previously with an impaired accumulation of malate and fumarate in leaves. Here, we investigated the consequences of this lower accumulation on stomatal behavior and photosynthetic capacity as well as its putative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic impacts. Neither the stomatal conductance nor the kinetic responses to dark, light, or high CO<sub>2</sub> were highly affected in <i>tdt</i> plants. In addition, we did not observe any impact on stomatal aperture following incubation with abscisic acid, malate, or citrate. Furthermore, an effect on photosynthetic capacity was not observed in the mutant lines. However, leaf mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism was affected in the <i>tdt</i> plants. Levels of the intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle were altered, and increases in both light and dark respiration were observed. We conclude that manipulation of the tonoplastic organic acid transporter impacted mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism, while the overall stomatal and photosynthetic capacity were unaffected.</p>

Plant Glandular Trichomes: Natural Cell Factories of High Biotechnological Interest
<p>Multicellular glandular trichomes are epidermal outgrowths characterized by the presence of a head made of cells that have the ability to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>e or store large quantities of specialized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites. Our understanding of the transcriptional control of glandular trichome initiation and development is still in its infancy. This review points to some central questions that need to be addressed to better understand how such specialized cell structures arise from the plant protodermis. A key and unique feature of glandular trichomes is their ability to synthesize and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>e large amounts, relative to their size, of a limited number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites. As such, they qualify as true cell factories, making them interesting targets for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic engineering. In this review, recent advances regarding terpene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic engineering are highlighted, with a special focus on tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>). In particular, the choice of transcriptional promoters to drive transgene expression and the best ways to sink existing pools of terpene precursors are discussed. The bioavailability of existing pools of natural precursor molecules is a key parameter and is controlled by so-called cross talk between different biosynthetic pathways. As highlighted in this review, the exact nature and extent of such cross talk are only partially understood at present. In the future, awareness of, and detailed knowledge on, the biology of plant glandular trichome development and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism will generate new leads to tap the largely unexploited potential of glandular trichomes in plant resistance to pests and lead to the improved production of specialized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites with high industrial or pharmacological value.</p>

Distinct Mechanisms of the ORANGE Protein in Controlling Carotenoid Flux
<p>β-Carotene adds nutritious value and determines the color of many fruits, including melon (<i>Cucumis melo</i>). In melon mesocarp, β-carotene accumulation is governed by the <i>Orange</i> gene (<i>CmOr</i>) golden single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) through a yet to be discovered mechanism. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), OR increases carotenoid levels by posttranscriptionally regulating phytoene synthase (PSY). Here, we identified a <i>CmOr</i> nonsense mutation (<i>Cmor</i>-lowβ) that lowered fruit β-carotene levels with impaired chromoplast biogenesis. <i>Cmor</i>-lowβ exerted a minimal effect on <i>PSY</i> transcripts but dramatically decreased PSY protein levels and enzymatic activity, leading to reduced carotenoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic flux and accumulation. However, the golden SNP was discovered to not affect PSY protein levels and carotenoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic flux in melon fruit, as shown by carotenoid and immunoblot analyses of selected melon genotypes and by using chemical pathway inhibitors. The high β-carotene accumulation in golden SNP melons was found to be due to a reduced further <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism of β-carotene. This was revealed by genetic studies with double mutants including <i>carotenoid isomerase</i> (<i>yofi</i>), a carotenoid-isomerase nonsense mutant, which arrests the turnover of prolycopene. The <i>yofi</i> F2 segregants accumulated prolycopene independently of the golden SNP. Moreover, <i>Cmor</i>-lowβ was found to inhibit chromoplast formation and chloroplast disintegration in fruits from 30 d after anthesis until ripening, suggesting that <i>CmOr</i> regulates the chloroplast-to-chromoplast transition. Taken together, our results demonstrate that <i>CmOr</i> is required to achieve PSY protein levels to maintain carotenoid biosynthesis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic flux but that the mechanism of the <i>CmOr</i> golden SNP involves an inhibited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism downstream of β-carotene to dramatically affect both carotenoid content and plastid fate.</p>

Primary Metabolism during Biosynthesis of Secondary Wall Polymers of Protoxylem Vessel Elements
<p>Xylem vessels, the water-conducting cells in vascular plants, undergo characteristic secondary wall deposition and programmed cell death. These processes are regulated by the VASCULAR-RELATED NAC-DOMAIN (VND) transcription factors. Here, to identify changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism that occur during protoxylem vessel element differentiation, we subjected tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) BY-2 suspension culture cells carrying an inducible <i>VND7</i> system to liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based wide-target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ome analysis and transcriptome analysis. Time-course data for 128 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites showed dynamic changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites related to amino acid biosynthesis. The concentration of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, an important intermediate of the glycolysis pathway, immediately decreased in the initial stages of cell differentiation. As cell differentiation progressed, specific amino acids accumulated, including the shikimate-related amino acids and the translocatable nitrogen-rich amino acid arginine. Transcriptome data indicated that cell differentiation involved the active up-regulation of genes encoding the enzymes catalyzing fructose 6-phosphate biosynthesis from glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate biosynthesis from oxaloacetate, and phenylalanine biosynthesis, which includes shikimate pathway enzymes. Concomitantly, active changes in the amount of fructose 6-phosphate and phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate were detected during cell differentiation. Taken together, our results show that protoxylem vessel element differentiation is associated with changes in primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism, which could facilitate the production of polysaccharides and lignin monomers and, thus, promote the formation of the secondary cell wall. Also, these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic shifts correlate with the active transcriptional regulation of specific enzyme genes. Therefore, our observations indicate that primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism is actively regulated during protoxylem vessel element differentiation to alter the cell’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic activity for the biosynthesis of secondary wall polymers.</p>

Disclosing the Molecular Basis of the Postharvest Life of Berry in Different Grapevine Genotypes
<p>The molecular events that characterize postripening grapevine berries have rarely been investigated and are poorly defined. In particular, a detailed definition of changes occurring during the postharvest dehydration, a process undertaken to make some particularly special wine styles, would be of great interest for both winemakers and plant biologists. We report an exhaustive survey of transcriptomic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>omic responses in berries representing six grapevine genotypes subjected to postharvest dehydration under identical controlled conditions. The modulation of phenylpropanoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism clearly distinguished the behavior of genotypes, with stilbene accumulation as the major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic event, although the transient accumulation/depletion of anthocyanins and flavonols was the prevalent variation in genotypes that do not accumulate stilbenes. The modulation of genes related to phenylpropanoid/stilbene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism highlighted the distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>omic plasticity of genotypes, allowing for the identification of candidate structural and regulatory genes. In addition to genotype-specific responses, a core set of genes was consistently modulated in all genotypes, representing the common features of berries undergoing dehydration and/or commencing senescence. This included genes controlling ethylene and auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism as well as genes involved in oxidative and osmotic stress, defense responses, anaerobic respiration, and cell wall and carbohydrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism. Several transcription factors were identified that may control these shared processes in the postharvest berry. Changes representing both common and genotype-specific responses to postharvest conditions shed light on the cellular processes taking place in harvested berries stored under dehydrating conditions for several months.</p>

Increased homeothermy during reproduction in a basal placental mammal
<p>Homeothermic endothermy, the maintenance of a high and stable body temperature (<i>T</i><sub>b</sub>) using heat produced by elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism, is energetically expensive. There is increasing evidence that the earliest endotherms were heterotherms that, rather than maintaining strict homeothermy, allowed <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> to fluctuate with large variations between active and rest-phase <i>T</i><sub>b</sub>. The high level of homeothermy observed in modern mammals is therefore likely to have evolved from an ancestral heterothermic state. One of the hypotheses for the evolution of endothermy is that homeothermy allows for greater energetic output during reproduction (parental care model). We tested this hypothesis by measuring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic rates over a range of ambient temperatures in both reproductive and non-reproductive greater hedgehog tenrecs (<i>Setifer setosus</i>), a physiologically primitive mammal from Madagascar. Tenrecs have some of the lowest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic rates and highest levels of <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> variability of any mammal and are therefore good models of the ancestral eutherian state. During pregnancy and lactation, there was an increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism and <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> below the thermoneutral zone, accompanied by a decrease in <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> variability. The lower critical limit of the thermoneutral zone was estimated at ~25°C. However, whereas increases in resting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism were substantial below 20°C (up to 150% higher during reproduction), daytime rest-phase ambient temperatures at the study site rarely reached equivalent low levels. Thus, <i>S. setosus</i> provide an example for how relatively low-cost increases in homeothermy could have led to substantial increases in fitness by allowing for the faster production of young. The mechanisms necessary for increases in thermogenesis during reproduction would have further benefited the development of homeothermy in mammals.</p>

Inhibition of Endothelial Notch Signaling Impairs Fatty Acid Transport and Leads to Metabolic and Vascular Remodeling of the Adult Heart
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Nutrients are transported through endothelial cells before being <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ized in muscle cells. However, little is known about the regulation of endothelial transport processes. Notch signaling is a critical regulator of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism and angiogenesis during development. Here, we studied how genetic and pharmacological manipulation of endothelial Notch signaling in adult mice affects endothelial fatty acid transport, cardiac angiogenesis, and heart function.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Endothelial-specific Notch inhibition was achieved by conditional genetic inactivation of Rbp-jκ in adult mice to analyze fatty acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism and heart function. Wild-type mice were treated with neutralizing antibodies against the Notch ligand Delta-like 4. Fatty acid transport was studied in cultured endothelial cells and transgenic mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Treatment of wild-type mice with Delta-like 4 neutralizing antibodies for 8 weeks impaired fractional shortening and ejection fraction in the majority of mice. Inhibition of Notch signaling specifically in the endothelium of adult mice by genetic ablation of Rbp-jκ caused heart hypertrophy and failure. Impaired heart function was preceded by alterations in fatty acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism and an increase in cardiac blood vessel density. Endothelial Notch signaling controlled the expression of endothelial lipase, Angptl4, CD36, and Fabp4, which are all needed for fatty acid transport across the vessel wall. In endothelial-specific Rbp-jκ–mutant mice, lipase activity and transendothelial transport of long-chain fatty acids to muscle cells were impaired. In turn, lipids accumulated in the plasma and liver. The attenuated supply of cardiomyocytes with long-chain fatty acids was accompanied by higher glucose uptake, increased concentration of glycolysis intermediates, and mTOR-S6K signaling. Treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin or displacing glucose as cardiac substrate by feeding a ketogenic diet prolonged the survival of endothelial-specific Rbp-jκ–deficient mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This study identifies Notch signaling as a novel regulator of fatty acid transport across the endothelium and as an essential repressor of angiogenesis in the adult heart. The data imply that the endothelium controls cardiomyocyte <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism and function.</p></sec>

MicroRNA-146a was either genetically or pharmacologically knocked out or genetically overexpressed in cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, overexpression of dihydrolipoyl succinyltransferase (DLST) in the murine heart was performed by means of an adeno-associated virus.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>MicroRNA-146a was upregulated in whole heart tissue in multiple murine pressure overload models. Also, microRNA-146a levels were moderately increased in left ventricular biopsies of patients with aortic stenosis. Overexpression of microRNA-146a in cardiomyocytes provoked cardiac hypertrophy and left ventricular dysfunction in vivo, whereas genetic knockdown or pharmacological blockade of microRNA-146a blunted the hypertrophic response and attenuated cardiac dysfunction in vivo. Mechanistically, microRNA-146a reduced its target DLST—the E2 subcomponent of the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, a rate-controlling tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme. DLST protein levels significantly decreased on pressure overload in wild-type mice, paralleling a decreased oxidative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism, whereas DLST protein levels and hence oxidative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism were partially maintained in microRNA-146a knockout mice.

The receptor tyrosine kinase EphA2 promotes glutamine metabolism in tumors by activating the transcriptional coactivators YAP and TAZ
<p>Malignant tumors reprogram cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism to support cancer cell proliferation and survival. Although most cancers depend on a high rate of aerobic glycolysis, many cancer cells also display addiction to glutamine. Glutamine transporters and glutaminase activity are critical for glutamine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism in tumor cells. We found that the receptor tyrosine kinase EphA2 activated the TEAD family transcriptional coactivators YAP and TAZ (YAP/TAZ), likely in a ligand-independent manner, to promote glutamine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism in cells and mouse models of HER2-positive breast cancer. Overexpression of EphA2 induced the nuclear accumulation of YAP and TAZ and increased the expression of YAP/TAZ target genes. Inhibition of the GTPase Rho or the kinase ROCK abolished EphA2-dependent YAP/TAZ nuclear localization. Silencing <i>YAP</i> or <i>TAZ</i> substantially reduced the amount of intracellular glutamate through decreased expression of <i>SLC1A5</i> and <i>GLS</i>, respectively, genes that encode proteins that promote glutamine uptake and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism. The regulatory DNA elements of both <i>SLC1A5</i> and <i>GLS</i> contain TEAD binding sites and were bound by TEAD4 in an EphA2-dependent manner. In patient breast cancer tissues, <i>EphA2</i> expression positively correlated with that of <i>YAP</i> and <i>TAZ</i>, as well as that of <i>GLS</i> and <i>SLC1A5</i>. Although high expression of <i>EphA2</i> predicted enhanced metastatic potential and poor patient survival, it also rendered HER2-positive breast cancer cells more sensitive to glutaminase inhibition. The findings define a previously unknown mechanism of EphA2-mediated glutaminolysis through YAP/TAZ activation in HER2-positive breast cancer and identify potential therapeutic targets in patients.</p>

Resveratrol stimulates the metabolic reprogramming of human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to enhance effector function
<p>The polyphenol resveratrol activates the deacetylase Sirt1, resulting in various antioxidant, chemoprotectant, neuroprotective, cardioprotective, and anti-inflammatory properties. We found that at high concentrations of resveratrol, human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells showed defective antigen receptor signaling and arrest at the G<sub>1</sub> stage of the cell cycle, whereas at low concentrations, cells were readily activated and exhibited enhanced Sirt1 deacetylase activity. Nevertheless, low-dose resveratrol rapidly stimulated genotoxic stress in the T cells, which resulted in engagement of a DNA damage response pathway that depended on the kinase ATR [ataxia telangiectasia–mutated (ATM) and Rad3-related], but not ATM, and subsequently in premitotic cell cycle arrest. The concomitant activation of p53 was coupled to the expression of gene products that regulate cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism, leading to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic reprogramming that was characterized by decreased glycolysis, increased glutamine consumption, and a shift to oxidative phosphorylation.

The glycosylation pathway is required for the secretion of Slit and for the maintenance of the Slit receptor Robo on axons
<p>Slit proteins act as repulsive axon guidance cues by activating receptors of the Roundabout (Robo) family. During early neurogenesis in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, Slit prevents the growth cones of longitudinal tract neurons from inappropriately crossing the midline, thus restricting these cells to trajectories parallel to the midline. Slit is expressed in midline glial cells, and Robo is present in longitudinal axon tracts and growth cones. We showed that the enzyme Mummy (Mmy) controlled Slit-Robo signaling through mechanisms that affected both the ligand and the receptor. Mmy was required for the glycosylation of Slit, which was essential for Slit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion. Mmy was also required for maintaining the abundance and spatial distribution of Robo through an indirect mechanism that was independent of Slit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion. Moreover, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion of Slit was required to maintain the fasciculation and position of longitudinal axon tracts, thus maintaining the hardwiring of the nervous system.

<p>Viruses regulate host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic networks to improve their survival. The molecules that are responsive to viral infection and regulate such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic changes are hardly known, but are essential for understanding viral infection. Here we identify a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) that is induced by multiple viruses, but not by type I interferon (IFN-I), and facilitates viral replication in mouse and human cells. In vivo deficiency of lncRNA-ACOD1 (a lncRNA identified by its nearest coding gene <i>Acod1</i>, aconitate decarboxylase 1) significantly attenuates viral infection through IFN-I–IRF3 (interferon regulatory factor 3)–independent pathways. Cytoplasmic lncRNA-ACOD1 directly binds the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic enzyme glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT2) near the substrate niche, enhancing its catalytic activity. Recombinant GOT2 protein and its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites could rescue viral replication upon lncRNA-ACOD1 deficiency and increase lethality. This work reveals a feedback mechanism of virus-induced lncRNA-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic promotion of viral infection and a potential target for developing broad-acting antiviral therapeutics.</p>

Metabolic recycling of ammonia via glutamate dehydrogenase supports breast cancer biomass
<p>Ammonia is a ubiquitous by-product of cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism; however, the biological consequences of ammonia production are not fully understood, especially in cancer. We found that ammonia is not merely a toxic waste product but is recycled into central amino acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism to maximize nitrogen utilization. In our experiments, human breast cancer cells primarily assimilated ammonia through reductive amination catalyzed by glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH); secondary reactions enabled other amino acids, such as proline and aspartate, to directly acquire this nitrogen. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic recycling of ammonia accelerated proliferation of breast cancer. In mice, ammonia accumulated in the tumor microenvironment and was used directly to generate amino acids through GDH activity. These data show that ammonia is not only a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ed waste product but also a fundamental nitrogen source that can support tumor biomass.</p>

mTOR regulates metabolic adaptation of APCs in the lung and controls the outcome of allergic inflammation
<p>Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) occupy diverse anatomical tissues, but their tissue-restricted homeostasis remains poorly understood. Here, working with mouse models of inflammation, we found that mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)–dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic adaptation was required at discrete locations. mTOR was dispensable for dendritic cell (DC) homeostasis in secondary lymphoid tissues but necessary to regulate cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism and accumulation of CD103<sup>+</sup> DCs and alveolar macrophages in lung. Moreover, while numbers of mTOR-deficient lung CD11b<sup>+</sup> DCs were not changed, they were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ically reprogrammed to skew allergic inflammation from eosinophilic T helper cell 2 (T<sub>H</sub>2) to neutrophilic T<sub>H</sub>17 polarity. The mechanism for this change was independent of translational control but dependent on inflammatory DCs, which produced interleukin-23 and increased fatty acid oxidation. mTOR therefore mediates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic adaptation of APCs in distinct tissues, influencing the immunological character of allergic inflammation.</p>

Fructose-driven glycolysis supports anoxia resistance in the naked mole-rat
<p>The African naked mole-rat’s (<i>Heterocephalus glaber</i>) social and subterranean lifestyle generates a hypoxic niche. Under experimental conditions, naked mole-rats tolerate hours of extreme hypoxia and survive 18 minutes of total oxygen deprivation (anoxia) without apparent injury. During anoxia, the naked mole-rat switches to anaerobic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism fueled by fructose, which is actively accumulated and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ized to lactate in the brain.

Fructose-driven glycolytic respiration in naked mole-rat tissues avoids feedback inhibition of glycolysis via phosphofructokinase, supporting viability.

Branched-Chain Amino Acid Catabolism Impacts Triacylglycerol Homeostasis in <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>
<p>Nitrogen (N) starvation-induced triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis, and its complex relationship with starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism in algal cells, has been intensively studied; however, few studies have examined the interaction between amino acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism and TAG biosynthesis. Here, via a forward genetic screen for TAG homeostasis, we isolated a <i>Chlamydomonas</i> (<i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>) mutant (<i>bkdE1α</i>) that is deficient in the E1α subunit of the branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) complex. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>omics analysis revealed a defect in the catabolism of branched-chain amino acids in <i>bkdE1α</i>. Furthermore, this mutant accumulated 30% less TAG than the parental strain during N starvation and was compromised in TAG remobilization upon N resupply. Intriguingly, the rate of mitochondrial respiration was 20% to 35% lower in <i>bkdE1α</i> compared with the parental strains. Three additional knockout mutants of the other components of the BCKDH complex exhibited phenotypes similar to that of <i>bkdE1α</i>. Transcriptional responses of <i>BCKDH</i> to different N status were consistent with its role in TAG homeostasis. Collectively, these results indicate that branched-chain amino acid catabolism contributes to TAG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism by providing carbon precursors and ATP, thus highlighting the complex interplay between distinct subcellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>isms for oil storage in green microalgae.</p>

Local and Systemic Metabolic Responses during Light-Induced Rapid Systemic Signaling
<p>Plants evolved multiple signaling pathways that transduce light-related signals between leaves. These are thought to improve light stress acclimation in a process termed systemic acquired acclimation. Although responses to light stress have been studied extensively in local leaves, and to a lesser degree in systemic leaves, little is known about the responses that occur in the different tissues that connect the local to the systemic leaves. These could be important in defining the specificity of the systemic response as well as in supporting the generation of different systemic signals. Here, we report that local application of light stress to one rosette leaf of bolting Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants resulted in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic response that encompassed local, systemic and transport tissues (stem tissues that connect the local to the systemic tissues), demonstrating a high degree of physical and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic continuity between different tissues throughout the plant. Our results further indicate that the response of many of the systemically altered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites is associated with the function of the reactive oxygen species wave and that the levels of eight different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites are altered in a similar manner in all tissues tested (local, systemic, and transport). These compounds could define a core <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic signature for light stress that propagates from the local to the systemic leaves. Our findings suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic changes occurring in cells that connect the local and systemic tissues play an important role in systemic acquired acclimation and could convey specificity to the rapid systemic response of plants to light stress.</p>

Starch Deficiency Enhances Lipid Biosynthesis and Turnover in Leaves
<p>Starch and lipids represent two major forms of carbon and energy storage in plants and play central roles in diverse cellular processes. However, whether and how starch and lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic pathways interact to regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism and growth are poorly understood. Here, we show that lipids can partially compensate for the lack of function of transient starch during normal growth and development in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Disruption of starch synthesis resulted in a significant increase in fatty acid synthesis via posttranslational regulation of the plastidic acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase and a concurrent increase in the synthesis and turnover of membrane lipids and triacylglycerol. Genetic analysis showed that blocking fatty acid peroxisomal β-oxidation, the sole pathway for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic breakdown of fatty acids in plants, significantly compromised or stunted the growth and development of mutants defective in starch synthesis under long days or short days, respectively. We also found that the combined disruption of starch synthesis and fatty acid turnover resulted in increased accumulation of membrane lipids, triacylglycerol, and soluble sugars and altered fatty acid flux between the two lipid biosynthetic pathways compartmentalized in either the chloroplast or the endoplasmic reticulum. Collectively, our findings provide insight into the role of fatty acid β-oxidation and the regulatory network controlling fatty acid synthesis, and they reveal the mechanistic basis by which starch and lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic pathways interact and undergo cross talk to modulate carbon allocation, energy homeostasis, and plant growth.</p>

A Specific Glycogen Mobilization Strategy Enables Rapid Awakening of Dormant Cyanobacteria from Chlorosis
<p>Many organisms survive stressful conditions via entry into a dormant state that can be rapidly exited when the stressor disappears; this ability provides a strong selective advantage. In the cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803, the exit from nitrogen chlorosis takes less than 48 h and is enabled by the impressive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic flexibility of these cyanobacteria, which pass through heterotrophic and mixotrophic phases before reentering photoautotrophic growth. Switching between these states requires delicate coordination of carbohydrate oxidation, CO<sub>2</sub> fixation, and photosynthesis. Here, we investigated the contribution of the different carbon catabolic routes by assessing mutants of these pathways during nitrogen chlorosis and resuscitation. The addition of nitrate to nitrogen-starved cells rapidly starts the awakening program. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism switches from maintenance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism, characterized by residual photosynthesis and low cellular ATP levels, to an initial heterotrophic phase, characterized by respiration and an immediate increase in ATP levels. This respiration relies on glycogen breakdown catalyzed by the glycogen phosphorylase GlgP2. In the following transient mixotrophic phase, photosynthesis and CO<sub>2</sub> fixation restart and glycogen is consumed. During the mixotrophic phase, parallel operation of the oxidative pentose phosphate cycle and the Entner-Doudoroff pathway is required for resuscitation to proceed; the glycolytic route via the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway has minor importance. Our data suggest that, during resuscitation, only the Entner-Doudoroff and oxidative pentose phosphate pathways supply the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic intermediates necessary for the anabolic reactions required to reconstitute a vegetative cell. Intriguingly, the key enzymes for glycogen catabolism are already expressed during the preceding chlorotic phase, in apparent preparation for rapid resuscitation.</p>

Trehalose 6-Phosphate Regulates Photosynthesis and Assimilate Partitioning in Reproductive Tissue<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Transgenic maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) that expresses rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) <i>TREHALOSE PHOSPHATE PHOSPHATASE1</i> (<i>TPP1</i>) from the rice <i>MADS6</i> promoter, which is active over the flowering period, produces higher yields than wild type. This yield increase occurs with or without drought conditions during flowering. To understand the mechanistic basis of the increased yield, we characterized gene expression and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ite profiles in leaves and developing female reproductive tissue, comprising florets, node, pith, and shank, over the flowering period with and without drought. The <i>MADS6</i> promoter was most active in the vasculature, particularly phloem companion cells in florets and pith, consistent with the largest decreases in trehalose 6-phosphate (T6P) levels (2- to 3-fold) being found in pith and florets. Low T6P led to decreased gene expression for primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism and increased gene expression for secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism, particularly lipid-related pathways. Despite similar changes in gene expression, the pith and floret displayed opposing assimilate profiles: sugars, sugar phosphates, amino acids, and lipids increased in florets, but decreased in pith. Possibly explaining this assimilate distribution, seven <i>SWEET</i> genes were found to be up-regulated in the transgenic plants. SnRK1 activity and the expression of the gene for the SnRK1 beta subunit, expression of SnRK1 marker genes, and endogenous trehalose pathway genes were also altered. Furthermore, leaves of the transgenic maize maintained a higher photosynthetic rate for a longer period compared to wild type. In conclusion, we found that decreasing T6P in reproductive tissues down-regulates primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism and up-regulates secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism, resulting in different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ite profiles in component tissues. Our data implicate T6P/ SnRK1 as a major regulator of whole-plant resource allocation for crop yield improvement.</p>

Predicting Dynamic Metabolic Demands in the Photosynthetic Eukaryote <i>Chlorella vulgaris</i>
<p>Phototrophic organisms exhibit a highly dynamic proteome, adapting their biomass composition in response to diurnal light/dark cycles and nutrient availability. Here, we used experimentally determined biomass compositions over the course of growth to determine and constrain the biomass objective function (BOF) in a genome-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic model of <i>Chlorella vulgaris</i> UTEX 395 over time. Changes in the BOF, which encompasses all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites necessary to produce biomass, influence the state of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic network thus directly affecting predictions. Simulations using dynamic BOFs predicted distinct proteome demands during heterotrophic or photoautotrophic growth. Model-driven analysis of extracellular nitrogen concentrations and predicted nitrogen uptake rates revealed an intracellular nitrogen pool, which contains 38% of the total nitrogen provided in the medium for photoautotrophic and 13% for heterotrophic growth. Agreement between flux and gene expression trends was determined by statistical comparison. Accordance between predicted flux trends and gene expression trends was found for 65% of multisubunit enzymes and 75% of allosteric reactions. Reactions with the highest agreement between simulations and experimental data were associated with energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism, terpenoid biosynthesis, fatty acids, nucleotides, and amino acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism.

A total of 103 genes related to internal transport reactions were identified and added to the updated model of <i>C. vulgaris</i>, <i>i</i>CZ946, thus increasing our knowledgebase by 10% for this model green alga.</p>

Phospholipid:Diacylglycerol Acyltransferase-Mediated Triacylglyerol Synthesis Augments Basal Thermotolerance
<p>High temperatures rapidly induce a genetically programmed heat-shock response (HSR) that is essential to establish short-term acquired thermotolerance. In addition, an immediate HSR-independent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic response is triggered, resulting in an accumulation of unsaturated triacylglycerols (TAGs) in the cytosol. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic processes involved in heat-induced TAG formation in plants and their physiological significance remain to be clarified. Lipidomic analyses of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings indicated that during heat stress, polyunsaturated fatty acids from thylakoid galactolipids are incorporated into cytosolic TAGs. In addition, rapid conversion of plastidic monogalactosyl diacylglycerols (MGDGs) into oligogalactolipids, acylated MGDGs, and diacylglycerols (DAGs), the direct precursor of TAGs, was observed. For TAG synthesis, DAG requires a fatty acid from the acyl-CoA pool or phosphatidylcholine. Since seedlings deficient in PHOSPHOLIPID:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1 (PDAT1) were unable to accumulate TAGs after heat stress, phosphatidylcholine appears to be the major fatty acid donor. Results suggest that rapid plastid lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism drives TAG accumulation during heat stress. PDAT1-mediated TAG accumulation was found to increase heat resistance, since nonacclimated <i>pdat1</i> mutant seedlings were more sensitive to severe heat stress, as indicated by a more dramatic decline of the maximum efficiency of PSII and lower seedling survival compared to wild-type seedlings. In contrast, nonacclimated <i>trigalactosyldiacylglycerol1</i> (<i>tgd1</i>) mutants overaccumulating TAGs and oligogalactolipids were more resistant to heat stress. Hence, thylakoid lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism and TAG formation increases thermotolerance in addition to the genetically encoded HSR.</p>

3-Hydroxyisobutyrate Dehydrogenase Is Involved in Both, Valine and Isoleucine Degradation in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>In plants, amino acid catabolism is especially relevant in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic stress situations (e.g. limited carbohydrate availability during extended darkness). Under these conditions, amino acids are used as alternative substrates for respiration. Complete oxidation of the branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) leucine, isoleucine (Ile), and valine (Val) in the mitochondria efficiently allows the formation of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. However, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic pathways for BCAA breakdown are largely unknown so far in plants. A systematic search for Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) genes encoding proteins resembling enzymes involved in BCAA catabolism in animals, fungi, and bacteria as well as proteomic analyses of mitochondrial fractions from Arabidopsis allowed the identification of a putative 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase, AtHDH1 (At4g20930), involved in Val degradation. Systematic substrate screening analyses revealed that the protein uses 3-hydroxyisobutyrate but additionally 3-hydroxypropionate as substrates. This points to a role of the enzyme not only in Val but possibly also in Ile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism. At4g20930 knockdown plants were characterized to test this conclusion. Root toxicity assays revealed increased root growth inhibition of the mutants if cultivated in the presence of Val or Ile but not in the presence of leucine.

Autophagy Deficiency Compromises Alternative Pathways of Respiration following Energy Deprivation in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>Under heterotrophic conditions, carbohydrate oxidation inside the mitochondrion is the primary energy source for cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism. However, during energy-limited conditions, alternative substrates are required to support respiration. Amino acid oxidation in plant cells plays a key role in this by generating electrons that can be transferred to the mitochondrial electron transport chain via the electron transfer flavoprotein/ubiquinone oxidoreductase system. Autophagy, a catabolic mechanism for macromolecule and protein recycling, allows the maintenance of amino acid pools and nutrient remobilization. Although the association between autophagy and alternative respiratory substrates has been suggested, the extent to which autophagy and primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism interact to support plant respiration remains unclear. To investigate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic importance of autophagy during development and under extended darkness, Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants with disruption of autophagy (<i>atg</i> mutants) were used. Under normal growth conditions, <i>atg</i> mutants showed lower growth and seed production with no impact on photosynthesis. Following extended darkness, <i>atg</i> mutants were characterized by signatures of early senescence, including decreased chlorophyll content and maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II coupled with increases in dark respiration. Transcript levels of genes involved in alternative pathways of respiration and amino acid catabolism were up-regulated in <i>atg</i> mutants. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ite profiles of dark-treated leaves revealed an extensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic reprogramming in which increases in amino acid levels were partially compromised in <i>atg</i> mutants. Although an enhanced respiration in <i>atg</i> mutants was observed during extended darkness, autophagy deficiency compromises protein degradation and the generation of amino acids used as alternative substrates to the respiration.</p>

Two Glycerol-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases from <i>Chlamydomonas</i> Have Distinct Roles in Lipid Metabolism
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism of glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) is important for environmental stress responses by eukaryotic microalgae. G3P is an essential precursor for glycerolipid synthesis and the accumulation of triacylglycerol (TAG) in response to nutrient starvation. G3P dehydrogenase (GPDH) mediates G3P synthesis, but the roles of specific GPDH isoforms are currently poorly understood. Of the five GPDH enzymes in the model alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, <i>GPD2</i> and <i>GPD3</i> were shown to be induced by nutrient starvation and/or salt stress. Heterologous expression of GPD2, a putative chloroplastic GPDH, and GPD3, a putative cytosolic GPDH, in a yeast <i>gpd1</i>Δ mutant demonstrated the functionality of both enzymes. <i>C. reinhardtii</i> knockdown mutants for <i>GPD2</i> and <i>GPD3</i> showed no difference in growth but displayed significant reduction in TAG concentration compared with the wild type in response to phosphorus or nitrogen starvation. Overexpression of <i>GPD2</i> and <i>GPD3</i> in <i>C. reinhardtii</i> gave distinct phenotypes. <i>GPD2</i> overexpression lines showed only subtle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic phenotypes and no significant alteration in growth. In contrast, <i>GPD3</i> overexpression lines displayed significantly inhibited growth and chlorophyll concentration, reduced glycerol concentration, and changes to lipid composition compared with the wild type, including increased abundance of phosphatidic acids but reduced abundance of diglycerides, triglycerides, and phosphatidylglycerol lipids. This may indicate a block in the downstream glycerolipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism pathway in <i>GPD3</i> overexpression lines. Thus, lipid engineering by GPDH modification may depend on the activities of other downstream enzyme steps. These results also suggest that GPD2 and GPD3 GPDH isoforms are important for nutrient starvation-induced TAG accumulation but have distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic functions.</p>

Repression of CYSTATHIONINE <i>γ</i>-SYNTHASE in Seeds Recruits the <i>S</i>-Methylmethionine Cycle
<p><i>S</i>-Methylmethionine (SMM) was suggested previously to participate in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism of methionine (Met) in seeds. To further reveal its roles, we had previously produced transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) RNA interference (RNAi) seeds with lower transcript expression of CYSTATHIONINE γ-SYNTHASE (<i>AtCGS</i>), Met’s main regulatory enzyme. Unexpectedly, these seeds accumulated significantly higher levels of Met compared with control seeds through an as yet unknown mechanism. Here, transcript and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic analyses coupled with isotope-labeled [<sup>13</sup>C]SMM and [<sup>13</sup>C]Met feeding experiments enabled us to reveal that SMM that was synthesized in rosette leaves of RNAi plants significantly contributed to the accumulation of Met in their seeds at late stages of development. Seed-specific repression of <i>AtCGS</i> in RNAi seeds triggered the induction of genes operating in the SMM cycle of rosette leaves, leading to elevated transport of SMM toward the seeds, where higher reconversion rates of SMM to Met were detected. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic rearrangements in RNAi seeds resulted in an altered sulfur-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism, such as lower amounts of Cys and glutathione, as well as a differential composition of glucosinolates. Together, the data propose a novel cross talk existing between seeds and rosette leaves along with mutual effects between the Asp family and SMM pathways operating in these tissues. They also shed light on the effects of higher Met levels on seed physiology and behavior.</p>

Dissecting the Metabolic Role of Mitochondria during Developmental Leaf Senescence
<p>The functions of mitochondria during leaf senescence, a type of programmed cell death aimed at the massive retrieval of nutrients from the senescing organ to the rest of the plant, remain elusive. Here, combining experimental and analytical approaches, we showed that mitochondrial integrity in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) is conserved until the latest stages of leaf senescence, while their number drops by 30%. Adenylate phosphorylation state assays and mitochondrial respiratory measurements indicated that the leaf energy status also is maintained during this time period. Furthermore, after establishing a curated list of genes coding for products targeted to mitochondria, we analyzed in isolation their transcript profiles, focusing on several key mitochondrial functions, such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle, mitochondrial electron transfer chain, iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis, transporters, as well as catabolic pathways. In tandem with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>omic approach, our data indicated that mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism was reorganized to support the selective catabolism of both amino acids and fatty acids. Such adjustments would ensure the replenishment of α-ketoglutarate and glutamate, which provide the carbon backbones for nitrogen remobilization. Glutamate, being the substrate of the strongly up-regulated cytosolic glutamine synthase, is likely to become a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ically limiting factor in the latest stages of developmental leaf senescence. Finally, an evolutionary age analysis revealed that, while branched-chain amino acid and proline catabolism are very old mitochondrial functions particularly enriched at the latest stages of leaf senescence, auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism appears to be rather newly acquired. In summation, our work shows that, during developmental leaf senescence, mitochondria orchestrate catabolic processes by becoming increasingly central energy and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic hubs.</p>

Class II Cytochrome P450 Reductase Governs the Biosynthesis of Alkaloids
<p>Expansion of the biosynthesis of plant specialized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites notably results from the massive recruitment of cytochrome P450s that catalyze multiple types of conversion of biosynthetic intermediates. For catalysis, P450s require a two-electron transfer catalyzed by shared cytochrome P450 oxidoreductases (CPRs), making these auxiliary proteins an essential component of specialized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism. CPR isoforms usually group into two distinct classes with different proposed roles, namely involvement in primary and basal specialized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>isms for class I and inducible specialized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism for class II. By studying the role of CPRs in the biosynthesis of monoterpene indole alkaloids, we provide compelling evidence of an operational specialization of CPR isoforms in <i>Catharanthus roseus</i> (Madagascar periwinkle). Global analyses of gene expression correlation combined with transcript localization in specific leaf tissues and gene-silencing experiments of both classes of CPR all point to the strict requirement of class II CPRs for monoterpene indole alkaloid biosynthesis with a minimal or null role of class I. Direct assays of interaction and reduction of P450s in vitro, however, showed that both classes of CPR performed equally well. Such high specialization of class II CPRs in planta highlights the evolutionary strategy that ensures an efficient reduction of P450s in specialized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism.</p>

The effects of age and lifetime flight behavior on flight capacity in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>
<p>The effects of flight behavior on physiology and senescence may be profound in insects because of the extremely high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic costs of flight. Flight capacity in insects decreases with age; in contrast, limiting flight behavior extends lifespan and slows the age-related loss of antioxidant capacity and accumulation of oxidative damage in flight muscles. In this study, we tested the effects of age and lifetime flight behavior on flight capacity by measuring wingbeat frequency, the ability to fly in a hypo-dense gas mixture, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic rate in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Specifically, 5-day-old adult flies were separated into three life-long treatments: (1) those not allowed to fly (no flight), (2) those allowed – but not forced – to fly (voluntary flight) and (3) those mechanically stimulated to fly (induced flight). Flight capacity senesced earliest in flies from the no-flight treatment, followed by the induced-flight group and then the voluntary flight group. Wingbeat frequency senesced with age in all treatment groups, but was most apparent in the voluntary- and induced-flight groups. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic rate during agitated flight senesced earliest and most rapidly in the induced flight group, and was low and uniform throughout age in the no-flight group. Early senescence in the induced-flight group was likely due to the acceleration of deleterious aging phenomena such as the rapid accumulation of damage at the cellular level, while the early loss of flight capacity and low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic rates in the no-flight group demonstrate that disuse effects can also significantly alter senescence patterns of whole-insect performance.</p>

Regulation of succinate-fuelled mitochondrial respiration in liver and skeletal muscle of hibernating thirteen-lined ground squirrels
<p>Hibernating ground squirrels (<i>Ictidomys tridecemlineatus</i>) alternate between two distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic states throughout winter: torpor, during which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic rate (MR) and body temperature (<i>T</i><sub>b</sub>) are considerably suppressed, and interbout euthermia (IBE), during which MR and <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> briefly return to euthermic levels. Previous studies showed suppression of succinate-fuelled respiration during torpor in liver and skeletal muscle mitochondria; however, these studies used only a single, saturating succinate concentration. Therefore, they could not address whether mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic suppression occurs under physiological substrate concentrations or whether differences in the kinetics of mitochondrial responses to changing substrate concentration might also contribute to mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic regulation during torpor. The present study confirmed that succinate oxidation is reduced during torpor in liver and skeletal muscle at 37 and 10°C over a 100-fold range of succinate concentrations. At 37°C, this suppression resulted from inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), which had a greater affinity for oxaloacetate (an SDH inhibitor) during torpor. At 10°C, SDH was not inhibited, suggesting that SDH inhibition initiates but does not maintain mitochondrial suppression during torpor. Moreover, in both liver and skeletal muscle, mitochondria from torpid animals maintained relatively higher respiration rates at low succinate concentrations, which reduces the extent of energy savings that can be achieved during torpor, but may also maintain mitochondrial oxidative capacity above some lower critical threshold, thereby preventing cellular and/or mitochondrial injury during torpor and facilitating rapid recruitment of oxidative capacity during arousal.</p>

MicroRNA-195 Regulates Metabolism in Failing Myocardium Via Alterations in Sirtuin 3 Expression and Mitochondrial Protein Acetylation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Heart failure leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic abnormalities of the failing myocardium coupled with an energy-depleted state and cardiac remodeling. The mitochondrial deacetylase sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) plays a pivotal role in the maintenance of mitochondrial function through regulating the mitochondrial acetylome. It is interesting to note that unique cardiac and systemic microRNAs have been shown to play an important role in cardiac remodeling by modulating key signaling elements in the myocardium.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Cellular signaling was analyzed in human cardiomyocyte-like AC16 cells, and acetylation levels in rodent models of SIRT3<sup>–/–</sup>and transgenic microRNA-195 (miR-195) overexpression were compared with wild type. Luciferase assays, Western blotting, immunoprecipitation assays, and echocardiographic analysis were performed. Enzymatic activities of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and ATP synthase were measured.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In failing human myocardium, we observed induction of miR-195 along with decreased expression of the mitochondrial deacetylase SIRT3 that was associated with increased global protein acetylation. We further investigated the role of miR-195 in SIRT3-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic processes and its impact on regulating enzymes involved in deacetylation. Proteomic analysis of the total acetylome showed increased overall acetylation, and specific lysine acetylation of 2 central mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic enzymes, PDH and ATP synthase, as well. miR-195 downregulates SIRT3 expression through direct 3′-untranslated region targeting. Treatments with either sirtuin inhibitor nicotinamide, small interfering RNA–mediated SIRT3 knockdown or miR-195 overexpression enhanced acetylation of PDH complex and ATP synthase. This effect diminished PDH and ATP synthase activity and impaired mitochondrial respiration.SIRT3<sup>–/–</sup> and miR-195 transgenic mice consistently showed enhanced global protein acetylation, including PDH complex and ATP synthase, associated with decreased enzymatic activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Altogether, these data suggest that increased levels of miR-195 in failing myocardium regulate a novel pathway that involves direct SIRT3 suppression and enzymatic inhibition via increased acetylation of PDH and ATP synthase that are essential for cardiac energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism.</p></sec>

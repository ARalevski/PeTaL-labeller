Ancient genomes revisit the ancestry of domestic and Przewalski’s horses
<p>The Eneolithic Botai culture of the Central Asian steppes provides the earliest archaeological evidence for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hors</span></strong>e husbandry, ~5500 years ago, but the exact nature of early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hors</span></strong>e domestication remains controversial. We generated 42 ancient-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hors</span></strong>e genomes, including 20 from Botai. Compared to 46 published ancient- and modern-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hors</span></strong>e genomes, our data indicate that Przewalski’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hors</span></strong>es are the feral descendants of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hors</span></strong>es herded at Botai and not truly wild <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hors</span></strong>es. All domestic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hors</span></strong>es dated from ~4000 years ago to present only show ~2.7% of Botai-related ancestry. This indicates that a massive genomic turnover underpins the expansion of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hors</span></strong>e stock that gave rise to modern domesticates, which coincides with large-scale human population expansions during the Early Bronze Age.</p>

Ancient goat genomes reveal mosaic domestication in the Fertile Crescent
<p>Current genetic data are equivocal as to whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">goat</span></strong> domestication occurred multiple times or was a singular process. We generated genomic data from 83 ancient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">goat</span></strong>s (51 with genome-wide coverage) from Paleolithic to Medieval contexts throughout the Near East. Our findings demonstrate that multiple divergent ancient wild <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">goat</span></strong> sources were domesticated in a dispersed process that resulted in genetically and geographically distinct Neolithic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">goat</span></strong> populations, echoing contemporaneous human divergence across the region. These early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">goat</span></strong> populations contributed differently to modern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">goat</span></strong>s in Asia, Africa, and Europe. We also detect early selection for pigmentation, stature, reproduction, milking, and response to dietary change, providing 8000-year-old evidence for human agency in molding genome variation within a partner species.</p>

Ancient steroids establish the Ediacaran fossil <i>Dickinsonia</i> as one of the earliest animals
<p>The enigmatic Ediacara biota (571 million to 541 million years ago) represents the first macroscopic complex organisms in the geological record and may hold the key to our understanding of the origin of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als. Ediacaran macrofossils are as “strange as life on another planet” and have evaded taxonomic classification, with interpretations ranging from marine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als or giant single-celled protists to terrestrial lichens. Here, we show that lipid biomarkers extracted from organically preserved Ediacaran macrofossils unambiguously clarify their phylogeny. <i>Dickinsonia</i> and its relatives solely produced cholesteroids, a hallmark of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als. Our results make these iconic members of the Ediacara biota the oldest confirmed macroscopic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als in the rock record, indicating that the appearance of the Ediacara biota was indeed a prelude to the Cambrian explosion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al life.</p>

Reduction of blood oxygen levels enhances postprandial cardiac hypertrophy in Burmese python (<i>Python bivittatus</i>)
<p>Physiological cardiac hypertrophy is characterized by reversible enlargement of cardiomyocytes and changes in chamber architecture, which increase stroke volume and [Formula] via augmented convective oxygen transport. Cardiac hypertrophy is known to occur in response to repeated elevations of O<sub>2</sub> demand and/or reduced O<sub>2</sub> supply in several species of vertebrate ectotherms, including postprandial Burmese pythons (<i>Python bivittatus</i>). Recent data suggest postprandial cardiac hypertrophy in <i>P. bivittatus</i> is a facultative rather than obligatory response to digestion, though the triggers of this response are unknown. Here, we hypothesized that an O<sub>2</sub> supply–demand mismatch stimulates postprandial cardiac enlargement in Burmese pythons. To test this hypothesis, we rendered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als anemic prior to feeding, essentially halving blood oxygen content during the postprandial period. Fed anemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als had heart rates 126% higher than those of fasted controls, which, coupled with a 71% increase in mean arterial pressure, suggests fed anemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als were experiencing significantly elevated cardiac work. We found significant cardiac hypertrophy in fed anemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als, which exhibited ventricles 39% larger than those of fasted controls and 28% larger than in fed controls. These findings support our hypothesis that those <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als with a greater magnitude of O<sub>2</sub> supply–demand mismatch exhibit the largest hearts. The ‘low O<sub>2</sub> signal’ stimulating postprandial cardiac hypertrophy is likely mediated by elevated ventricular wall stress associated with postprandial hemodynamics.</p>

<i>Cryptosporidium parvum</i>-induced ileo-caecal adenocarcinoma and Wnt signaling in a mouse model
<p><i>Cryptosporidium</i> species are apicomplexan protozoans that are found worldwide. These parasites constitute a large risk to human and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al health. They cause self-limited diarrhea in immunocompetent hosts and a life-threatening disease in immunocompromised hosts. Interestingly, <i>Cryptosporidium parvum</i> has been related to digestive carcinogenesis in humans. Consistent with a potential tumorigenic role of this parasite, in an original reproducible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al model of chronic cryptosporidiosis based on dexamethasone-treated or untreated adult SCID mice, we formerly reported that <i>C. parvum</i> (strains of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al and human origin) is able to induce digestive adenocarcinoma even in infections induced with very low inoculum. The aim of this study was to further characterize this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al model and to explore metabolic pathways potentially involved in the development of <i>C. parvum</i>-induced ileo-caecal oncogenesis. We searched for alterations in genes or proteins commonly involved in cell cycle, differentiation or cell migration, such as β-catenin, <i>Apc</i>, E-cadherin, <i>Kras</i> and <i>p53</i>. After infection of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als with <i>C. parvum</i> we demonstrated immunohistochemical abnormal localization of Wnt signaling pathway components and p53. Mutations in the selected loci of studied genes were not found after high-throughput sequencing. Furthermore, alterations in the ultrastructure of adherens junctions of the ileo-caecal neoplastic epithelia of <i>C. parvum</i>-infected mice were recorded using transmission electron microscopy. In conclusion, we found for the first time that the Wnt signaling pathway, and particularly the cytoskeleton network, seems to be pivotal for the development of the <i>C. parvum</i>-induced neoplastic process and cell migration of transformed cells. Furthermore, this model is a valuable tool in understanding the host-pathogen interactions associated with the intricate infection process of this parasite, which is able to modulate host cytoskeleton activities and several host-cell biological processes and remains a significant cause of infection worldwide.</p>

Digital chemical test impresses
<p>Toxicologists this week unveiled a chemical safety screening tool that could greatly reduce the need for six common <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al tests. Those tests account for nearly 60% of the estimated 3 million to 4 million <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als used annually in risk testing worldwide. The computerized tool—built on a massive database of molecular structures and existing safety data—appears to match, and sometimes improve on, the results of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al tests for properties such as skin sensitization and eye irritation, the researchers report in today's issue of <i>Toxicological Sciences</i>. But it also has limitations; for instance, the method can't reliably evaluate a chemical's risk of causing cancer. And it's not clear how open regulatory agencies will be to adopting a non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al approach, although both European and U.S. regulators say they are open to the idea. Still, the big data approach is encouraging to those seeking to reduce and replace <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al testing.</p>

Moving in the Anthropocene: Global reductions in terrestrial mammalian movements
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al movement is fundamental for ecosystem functioning and species survival, yet the effects of the anthropogenic footprint on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al movements have not been estimated across species. Using a unique GPS-tracking database of 803 individuals across 57 species, we found that movements of mammals in areas with a comparatively high human footprint were on average one-half to one-third the extent of their movements in areas with a low human footprint. We attribute this reduction to behavioral changes of individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als and to the exclusion of species with long-range movements from areas with higher human impact. Global loss of vagility alters a key ecological trait of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als that affects not only population persistence but also ecosystem processes such as predator-prey interactions, nutrient cycling, and disease transmission.</p>

Drag, but not buoyancy, affects swim speed in captive Steller sea lions
<p>Swimming at an optimal speed is critical for breath-hold divers seeking to maximize the time they can spend foraging underwater. Theoretical studies have predicted that the optimal swim speed for an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al while transiting to and from depth is independent of buoyancy, but is dependent on drag and metabolic rate. However, this prediction has never been experimentally tested. Our study assessed the effects of buoyancy and drag on the swim speed of three captive Steller sea lions (<i>Eumetopias jubatus</i>) that made 186 dives. Our study <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als were trained to dive to feed at fixed depths (10–50 m) under artificially controlled buoyancy and drag conditions. Buoyancy and drag were manipulated using a pair of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tubes attached to harnesses worn by the sea lions, and buoyancy conditions were designed to fall within the natural range of wild <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als (∼12–26% subcutaneous fat). Drag conditions were changed with and without the PVC tubes, and swim speeds were recorded and compared during descent and ascent phases using an accelerometer attached to the harnesses. Generalized linear mixed-effect models with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al as the random variable and five explanatory variables (body mass, buoyancy, dive depth, dive phase, and drag) showed that swim speed was best predicted by two variables, drag and dive phase (AIC = −139). Consistent with a previous theoretical prediction, the results of our study suggest that the optimal swim speed of Steller sea lions is a function of drag, and is independent of dive depth and buoyancy.</p>

Olfactory experience primes the heat shock transcription factor HSF-1 to enhance the expression of molecular chaperones in <i>C. elegans</i>
<p>Learning, a process by which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als modify their behavior as a result of experience, enables organisms to synthesize information from their surroundings to acquire resources and avoid danger. We showed that a previous encounter with only the odor of pathogenic bacteria prepared <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> to survive exposure to the pathogen by increasing the heat shock factor 1 (HSF-1)–dependent expression of genes encoding molecular chaperones. Experience-mediated enhancement of chaperone gene expression required serotonin, which primed HSF-1 to enhance the expression of molecular chaperone genes by promoting its localization to RNA polymerase II–enriched nuclear loci, even before transcription occurred. However, HSF-1–dependent chaperone gene expression was stimulated only if and when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als encountered the pathogen. Thus, learning equips <i>C. elegans</i> to better survive environmental dangers by preemptively and specifically initiating transcriptional mechanisms throughout the whole organism that prepare the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al to respond rapidly to proteotoxic agents. These studies provide one plausible basis for the protective role of environmental enrichment in disease.</p>

Self-organization and progenitor targeting generate stable patterns in planarian regeneration
<p>During <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al regeneration, cells must organize into discrete and functional systems. We show that self-organization, along with patterning cues, govern progenitor behavior in planarian regeneration. Surgical paradigms allowed the manipulation of planarian eye regeneration in predictable locations and numbers, generating alternative stable neuroanatomical states for wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als with multiple functional ectopic eyes. We used <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als with multiple ectopic eyes and eye transplantation to demonstrate that broad progenitor specification, combined with self-organization, allows anatomy maintenance during regeneration. We propose a model for regenerative progenitors involving (i) migratory targeting cues, (ii) self-organization into existing or regenerating eyes, and (iii) a broad zone, associated with coarse progenitor specification, in which eyes can be targeted by progenitors. These three properties help explain how tissues can be organized during regeneration.</p>

Ancient genomic changes associated with domestication of the horse
<p>The genomic changes underlying both early and late stages of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hors</span></strong>e domestication remain largely unknown. We examined the genomes of 14 early domestic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hors</span></strong>es from the Bronze and Iron Ages, dating to between ~4.1 and 2.3 thousand years before present. We find early domestication selection patterns supporting the neural crest hypothesis, which provides a unified developmental origin for common domestic traits. Within the past 2.3 thousand years, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hors</span></strong>es lost genetic diversity and archaic DNA tracts introgressed from a now-extinct lineage. They accumulated deleterious mutations later than expected under the cost-of-domestication hypothesis, probably because of breeding from limited numbers of stallions. We also reveal that Iron Age Scythian steppe nomads implemented breeding strategies involving no detectable inbreeding and selection for coat-color variation and robust forelimbs.</p>

Large Numbers of Novel miRNAs Originate from DNA Transposons and Are Coincident with a Large Species Radiation in Bats
<p>Vesper bats (family Vespertilionidae) experienced a rapid adaptive radiation beginning around 36 Ma that resulted in the second most species-rich mammalian family (>400 species). Coincident with that radiation was an initial burst of DNA transposon activity that has continued into the present in some species. Such extensive and recent DNA transposon activity has not been seen in any other extant mammal. Indeed, retrotransposon activity is much more common in all other sequenced mammal genomes. Deep sequencing of the small RNA fraction from a vespertilionid bat, <i>Eptesicus fuscus</i>, as well as a dog and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hors</span></strong>e revealed large numbers of 17–24 bp putative miRNAs (p/miRNAs). Although the origination rate of p/miRNAs is similar in all three taxa, 61.1% of postdivergence p/miRNAs in <i>Eptesicus</i> are derived from transposable elements (TEs) compared with only 23.9% and 16.5% in the dog and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hors</span></strong>e, respectively. Not surprisingly, given the retrotransposon bias of dog and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hors</span></strong>e, the majority of TE-derived p/miRNAs are associated with retrotransposons. In <i>Eptesicus</i>, however, 58.7% of the TE-derived and 35.9% of the total p/miRNAs arose not from retrotransposons but from bat-specific DNA transposons. Notably, we observe that the timing of the DNA transposon expansion and the resulting introduction of novel p/miRNAs coincide with the rapid diversification of the family Vespertilionidae. Furthermore, potential targets of the DNA transposon-derived p/miRNAs are identifiable and enriched for genes that are important for regulation of transcription. We propose that lineage-specific DNA transposon activity lead to the rapid and repeated introduction of novel p/miRNAs. Some of these p/miRNAs are likely functional miRNAs and potentially influenced the diversification of Vespertilionidae. Our observations suggest a mechanism for introducing functional genomic variation rapidly through the expansion of DNA transposons that fits within the TE-thrust hypothesis.</p>

Seasonal accumulation of acetylated triacylglycerols by a freeze-tolerant insect
<p>Most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als store energy as long-chain triacylglycerols (lcTAGs). Trace amounts of acetylated triacylglycerols (acTAGs) have been reported in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als, but are not accumulated, likely because they have lower energy density than lcTAGs. Here we report that acTAGs comprise 36% of the neutral lipid pool of overwintering prepupae of the goldenrod gall fly, <i>Eurosta solidaginis</i>, while only 17% of the neutral lipid pool is made up of typical lcTAGs. These high concentrations of acTAGs, present only during winter, appear to be synthesized by <i>E. solidaginis</i> and are not found in other freeze-tolerant insects, nor in the plant host. The mixture of acTAGs found in <i>E. solidaginis</i> has a significantly lower melting point than equivalent lcTAGs, and thus remains liquid at temperatures at which <i>E. solidaginis</i> is frozen in the field, and depresses the melting point of aqueous solutions in a manner unusual for neutral lipids. We note that accumulation of acTAGs coincides with preparation for overwintering and the seasonal acquisition of freeze tolerance. This is the first observation of accumulation of acTAGs by an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al, and the first evidence of dynamic interconversion between acTAGs and lcTAGs during development and in response to stress.</p>

The cost of muscle power production: muscle oxygen consumption per unit work increases at low temperatures in <i>Xenopus laevis</i>
<p>Metabolic energy (ATP) supply to muscle is essential to support activity and behaviour. It is expected, therefore, that there is strong selection to maximise muscle power output for a given rate of ATP use. However, the viscosity and stiffness of muscle increases with a decrease in temperature, which means that more ATP may be required to achieve a given work output. Here, we tested the hypothesis that ATP use increases at lower temperatures for a given power output in <i>Xenopus laevis.</i> To account for temperature variation at different time scales, we considered the interaction between acclimation for 4 weeks (to 15 or 25°C) and acute exposure to these temperatures. Cold-acclimated frogs had greater sprint speed at 15°C than warm-acclimated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als. However, acclimation temperature did not affect isolated gastrocnemius muscle biomechanics. Isolated muscle produced greater tetanus force, and faster isometric force generation and relaxation, and generated more work loop power at 25°C than at 15°C acute test temperature. Oxygen consumption of isolated muscle at rest did not change with test temperature, but oxygen consumption while muscle was performing work was significantly higher at 15°C than at 25°C, regardless of acclimation conditions. Muscle therefore consumed significantly more oxygen at 15°C for a given work output than at 25°C, and plastic responses did not modify this thermodynamic effect. The metabolic cost of muscle performance and activity therefore increased with a decrease in temperature. To maintain activity across a range of temperature, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als must increase ATP production or face an allocation trade-off at lower temperatures. Our data demonstrate the potential energetic benefits of warming up muscle before activity, which is seen in diverse groups of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als such as bees, which warm flight muscle before take-off, and humans performing warm ups before exercise.</p>

The olfactory neuron AWC promotes avoidance of normally palatable food following chronic dietary restriction
<p>Changes in metabolic state alter foraging behavior and food preference in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als. Here, I show that normally attractive food becomes repulsive to <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> if <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als are chronically undernourished as a result of alimentary tract defects. This behavioral plasticity is achieved in two ways: increased food leaving and induction of aversive behavior towards food. A particularly strong food avoider is defective in the chitin synthase that makes the pharyngeal lining. Food avoidance induced by underfeeding is mediated by cGMP signaling in the olfactory neurons AWC and AWB, and the gustatory neurons ASJ and ASK. Food avoidance is enhanced by increased population density and is reduced if the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als are unable to correctly interpret their nutritional state as a result of defects in the AMP kinase or TOR/S6kinase pathways. The TGF-β/DBL-1 pathway suppresses food avoidance and the cellular basis for this is distinct from its role in aversive olfactory learning of harmful food. This study suggests that nutritional state feedback via nutrient sensors, population size and olfactory neurons guides food preference in <i>C. elegans</i>.</p>

Rapid cold hardening improves recovery of ion homeostasis and chill coma recovery time in the migratory locust, <i>Locusta migratoria</i>
<p>Chill tolerance of insects is defined as the ability to tolerate low temperature under circumstances not involving freezing of intracellular or extracellular fluids. For many insects chill tolerance is crucial for their ability to persist in cold environments and mounting evidence indicates that chill tolerance is associated with the ability to maintain ion and water homeostasis, thereby ensuring muscular function and preventing chill injury at low temperature. The present study describes the relationship between muscle and haemolymph ion homeostasis and time to regain posture following cold shock (CS, 2 h at −4°C) in the chill-susceptible locust <i>Locusta migratoria</i>. This relationship was examined in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als with and without a prior rapid cold-hardening treatment (RCH, 2 h at 0°C) to investigate the physiological underpinnings of RCH. CS elicited a doubling of haemolymph [K<sup>+</sup>] and this disturbance was greater in locusts pre-exposed to RCH. Recovery of ion homeostasis was, however, markedly faster in RCH-treated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als, which correlated well with whole-organism performance as hardened individuals regained posture faster than non-hardened individuals following CS. The present study indicates that loss and recovery of muscular function are associated with the resting membrane potential of excitable membranes as attested by the changes in the equilibrium potential for K<sup>+</sup> (<i>E</i><sub>K</sub>) following CS. Both hardened and non-hardened <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als regained movement once K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis had recovered to a fixed level (<i>E</i><sub>K</sub>≈−41 mV). RCH is therefore not associated with altered sensitivity to ion disturbance but instead is correlated to a faster recovery of haemolymph [K<sup>+</sup>].</p>

Flexible strategies for flight control: an active role for the abdomen
<p>Moving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als orchestrate myriad motor systems in response to multimodal sensory inputs. Coordinating movement is particularly challenging in flight control, where <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als deal with potential instability and multiple degrees of freedom of movement. Prior studies have focused on wings as the primary flight control structures, for which changes in angle of attack or shape are used to modulate lift and drag forces. However, other actuators that may impact flight performance are reflexively activated during flight. We investigated the visual–abdominal reflex displayed by the hawkmoth <i>Manduca sexta</i> to determine its role in flight control. We measured the open-loop stimulus–response characteristics (measured as a transfer function) between the visual stimulus and abdominal response in tethered moths. The transfer function reveals a 41 ms delay and a high-pass filter behavior with a pass band starting at ~0.5 Hz. We also developed a simplified mathematical model of hovering flight wherein articulation of the thoracic–abdominal joint redirects an average lift force provided by the wings. We show that control of the joint, subject to a high-pass filter, is sufficient to maintain stable hovering, but with a slim stability margin. Our experiments and models suggest a novel mechanism by which articulation of the body or ‘airframe’ of an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al can be used to redirect lift forces for effective flight control. Furthermore, the small stability margin may increase flight agility by easing the transition from stable flight to a more maneuverable, unstable regime.</p>

<p>Focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is one of the most important renal diseases related to end-stage renal failure. Bradykinin has been implicated in the pathogenesis of renal inflammation, whereas the role of its receptor 2 (B2RBK; also known as BDKRB2) in FSGS has not been studied. FSGS was induced in wild-type and B2RBK-knockout mice by a single intravenous injection of Adriamycin (ADM). In order to further modulate the kinin receptors, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als were also treated with the B2RBK antagonist HOE-140 and the B1RBK antagonist DALBK. Here, we show that the blockage of B2RBK with HOE-140 protects mice from the development of FSGS, including podocyte foot process effacement and the re-establishment of slit-diaphragm-related proteins. However, B2RBK-knockout mice were not protected from FSGS. These opposite results were due to B1RBK expression. B1RBK was upregulated after the injection of ADM and this upregulation was exacerbated in B2RBK-knockout <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als. Furthermore, treatment with HOE-140 downregulated the B1RBK receptor. The blockage of B1RBK in B2RBK-knockout <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als promoted FSGS regression, with a less-inflammatory phenotype. These results indicate a deleterious role of both kinin receptors in an FSGS model and suggest a possible cross-talk between them in the progression of disease.</p>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
The fraction of strongly bound cross-bridges is increased in mice that carry the myopathy-linked myosin heavy chain mutation MYH4<sup>L342Q</sup>
<p>Myosinopathies have emerged as a new group of diseases and are caused by mutations in genes encoding myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoforms. One major hallmark of these diseases is skeletal muscle weakness or paralysis, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we have undertaken a detailed functional study of muscle fibers from <i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i> mice, which carry a mutation that provokes an L342Q change within the catalytic domain of the type IIb skeletal muscle myosin protein MYH4. Because homozygous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als develop rapid muscle-structure disruption and lower-limb paralysis, they must be killed by postnatal day 13, so all experiments were performed using skeletal muscles from adult heterozygous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als (<i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i>/+). <i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i>/+ mice contain MYH4<sup>L342Q</sup> expressed at 7% of the levels of the wild-type (WT) protein, and are overtly and histologically normal. However, mechanical and X-ray diffraction pattern analyses of single membrane-permeabilized fibers revealed, upon maximal Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation, higher stiffness as well as altered meridional and equatorial reflections in <i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i>/+ mice when compared with age-matched WT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als. Under rigor conditions, by contrast, no difference was observed between <i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i>/+ and WT mice. Altogether, these findings prove that, in adult <i>MYH4<sup>L342Q</sup></i> heterozygous mice, the transition from weak to strong myosin cross-bridge binding is facilitated, increasing the number of strongly attached myosin heads, thus enhancing force production. These changes are predictably exacerbated in the type IIb fibers of homozygous mice, in which the embryonic myosin isoform is fully replaced by MYH4<sup>L342Q</sup>, leading to a hypercontraction, muscle-structure disruption and lower-limb paralysis. Overall, these findings provide important insights into the molecular pathogenesis of skeletal myosinopathies.</p>

Highly efficient targeted mutagenesis in axolotl using Cas9 RNA-guided nuclease
<p>Among tetrapods, only urodele salamanders, such as the axolotl <i>Ambystoma mexicanum</i>, can completely regenerate limbs as adults. The mystery of why salamanders, but not other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als, possess this ability has for generations captivated scientists seeking to induce this phenomenon in other vertebrates. Although many recent advances in molecular biology have allowed limb regeneration and tissue repair in the axolotl to be investigated in increasing detail, the molecular toolkit for the study of this process has been limited. Here, we report that the CRISPR-Cas9 RNA-guided nuclease system can efficiently create mutations at targeted sites within the axolotl genome. We identify individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als treated with RNA-guided nucleases that have mutation frequencies close to 100% at targeted sites. We employ this technique to completely functionally ablate EGFP expression in transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als and recapitulate developmental phenotypes produced by loss of the conserved gene <i>brachyury</i>. Thus, this advance allows a reverse genetic approach in the axolotl and will undoubtedly provide invaluable insight into the mechanisms of salamanders' unique regenerative ability.</p>

Spatial representations of self and other in the hippocampus
<p>An <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al’s awareness of its location in space depends on the activity of place cells in the hippocampus. How the brain encodes the spatial position of others has not yet been identified. We investigated neuronal representations of other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als’ locations in the dorsal CA1 region of the hippocampus with an observational T-maze task in which one rat was required to observe another rat’s trajectory to successfully retrieve a reward. Information reflecting the spatial location of both the self and the other was jointly and discretely encoded by CA1 pyramidal cells in the observer rat. A subset of CA1 pyramidal cells exhibited spatial receptive fields that were identical for the self and the other. These findings demonstrate that hippocampal spatial representations include dimensions for both self and nonself.</p>

Elderly chimps may get Alzheimer's disease
<p>Researchers have discovered tell-tale signs of Alzheimer's disease in 20 elderly chimpanzee brains, rekindling a decades-old debate over whether humans are the only species that develop the debilitating condition. By examining brain regions afflicted by Alzheimer's in humans, the team discovered that 13 chimps had amyloid plaques, and four also had the neurofibrillary tangles typical of more advanced stages of Alzheimer's. Whether chimps actually succumb to Alzheimer's or are immune from symptoms despite having the key brain abnormalities is unclear, because there were no behavioral data to indicate that these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als developed dementia. But either way, the work suggests that chimps could help scientists better understand the disease and how to fight it. And although some scientists are eager to begin new studies on chimps, but many wonder whether such research on these now-endangered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als will receive moral, or monetary, support.</p>

Immunology taught by rats
<p>Immunology may be best taught by viruses (<i>1</i>), and possibly by humans (<i>2</i>), but the rats of New York City surprisingly also have plenty to offer.

Among these are Norway rat hepaciviruses (NrHVs), which belong to the same family as hepatitis C virus (HCV).

Decoding the evolution of species
<p>In the middle of the 20th century, researchers identified DNA and proteins and began to understand how they shape organisms. At first, scientists assumed that differences in protein sequence, structure, and function uniquely define any <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al, including humans. Yet these building blocks are extraordinarily similar among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als, and human proteins can substitute for their counterparts in far simpler species (<i>1</i>–<i>3</i>). The modern dogma is that differences between species are largely a result of mutations in the noncoding instructions that determine when, where, and how much of a gene is expressed. On page 921 of this issue, Burga <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) show that scientists may have underestimated the contribution of protein-coding mutations to evolution.</p>

Branch-specific plasticity of a bifunctional dopamine circuit encodes protein hunger
<p>Free-living <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als must not only regulate the amount of food they consume but also choose which types of food to ingest. The shifting of food preference driven by nutrient-specific hunger can be essential for survival, yet little is known about the underlying mechanisms. We identified a dopamine circuit that encodes protein-specific hunger in <i>Drosophila</i>. The activity of these neurons increased after substantial protein deprivation. Activation of this circuit simultaneously promoted protein intake and restricted sugar consumption, via signaling to distinct downstream neurons. Protein starvation triggered branch-specific plastic changes in these dopaminergic neurons, thus enabling sustained protein consumption. These studies reveal a crucial circuit mechanism by which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als adjust their dietary strategy to maintain protein homeostasis.</p>

Transgenerational transmission of environmental information in <i>C. elegans</i>
<p>The environment experienced by an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al can sometimes influence gene expression for one or a few subsequent generations. Here, we report the observation that a temperature-induced change in expression from a <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> heterochromatic gene array can endure for at least 14 generations. Inheritance is primarily in cis with the locus, occurs through both oocytes and sperm, and is associated with altered trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me3) before the onset of zygotic transcription. Expression profiling reveals that temperature-induced expression from endogenous repressed repeats can also be inherited for multiple generations. Long-lasting epigenetic memory of environmental change is therefore possible in this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al.</p>

Epigenetics and the evolution of instincts

Vectorial representation of spatial goals in the hippocampus of bats
<p>To navigate, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als need to represent not only their own position and orientation, but also the location of their goal. Neural representations of an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al’s own position and orientation have been extensively studied. However, it is unknown how navigational goals are encoded in the brain. We recorded from hippocampal CA1 neurons of bats flying in complex trajectories toward a spatial goal. We discovered a subpopulation of neurons with angular tuning to the goal direction. Many of these neurons were tuned to an occluded goal, suggesting that goal-direction representation is memory-based. We also found cells that encoded the distance to the goal, often in conjunction with goal direction. The goal-direction and goal-distance signals make up a vectorial representation of spatial goals, suggesting a previously unrecognized neuronal mechanism for goal-directed navigation.</p>

Loss of CRWN Nuclear Proteins Induces Cell Death and Salicylic Acid Defense Signaling
<p>Defects in the nuclear lamina of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al cell nuclei have dramatic effects on nuclear structure and gene expression as well as diverse physiological manifestations. We report that deficiencies in CROWDED NUCLEI (CRWN), which are candidate nuclear lamina proteins in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), trigger widespread changes in transcript levels and whole-plant phenotypes, including dwarfing and spontaneous cell death lesions. These phenotypes are caused in part by ectopic induction of plant defense responses via the salicylic acid pathway. Loss of CRWN proteins induces the expression of the salicylic acid biosynthetic gene <i>ISOCHORISMATE SYNTHASE1</i>, which leads to spontaneous defense responses in <i>crwn1 crwn2</i> and <i>crwn1 crwn4</i> mutants, which are deficient in two of the four CRWN paralogs. The symptoms of ectopic defense response, including pathogenesis marker gene expression and cell death, increase in older <i>crwn</i> double mutants. These age-dependent effects are postulated to reflect an increase in nuclear dysfunction or damage over time, a phenomenon reminiscent of aging effects seen in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al nuclei and in some human laminopathy patients.</p>

Synthetic MicroProteins: Versatile Tools for Posttranslational Regulation of Target Proteins

MicroProtein candidates that potentially target a wide range of different protein classes were recently identified in a computational approach.

SCYL2 Genes Are Involved in Clathrin-Mediated Vesicle Trafficking and Essential for Plant Growth
<p>Protein transport between organelles is an essential process in all eukaryotic cells and is mediated by the regulation of processes such as vesicle formation, transport, docking, and fusion. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als, SCY1-LIKE2 (SCYL2) binds to clathrin and has been shown to play roles in trans-Golgi network-mediated clathrin-coated vesicle trafficking. Here, we demonstrate that SCYL2A and SCYL2B, which are Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) homologs of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al SCYL2, are vital for plant cell growth and root hair development. Studies of the SCYL2 isoforms using multiple single or double loss-of-function alleles show that SCYL2B is involved in root hair development and that SCYL2A and SCYL2B are essential for plant growth and development and act redundantly in those processes. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and a β-glucuronidase-aided promoter assay show that <i>SCYL2A</i> and <i>SCYL2B</i> are differentially expressed in various tissues. We also show that SCYL2 proteins localize to the Golgi, trans-Golgi network, and prevacuolar compartment and colocalize with Clathrin Heavy Chain1 (CHC1). Furthermore, bimolecular fluorescence complementation and coimmunoprecipitation data show that SCYL2B interacts with CHC1 and two Soluble NSF Attachment Protein Receptors (SNAREs): Vesicle Transport through t-SNARE Interaction11 (VTI11) and VTI12. Finally, we present evidence that the root hair tip localization of Cellulose Synthase-Like D3 is dependent on SCYL2B. These findings suggest the role of SCYL2 genes in plant cell developmental processes via clathrin-mediated vesicle membrane trafficking.</p>

A Plant Cryptochrome Controls Key Features of the <i>Chlamydomonas</i> Circadian Clock and Its Life Cycle
<p>Cryptochromes are flavin-binding proteins that act as blue light receptors in bacteria, fungi, plants, and insects and are components of the circadian oscillator in mammals. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al and plant cryptochromes are evolutionarily divergent, although the unicellular alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> (<i>Chlamydomonas</i> throughout) has both an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al-like cryptochrome and a plant cryptochrome (pCRY; formerly designated CPH1). Here, we show that the pCRY protein accumulates at night as part of a complex. Functional characterization of pCRY was performed based on an insertional mutant that expresses only 11% of the wild-type pCRY level. The <i>pcry</i> mutant is defective for central properties of the circadian clock. In the mutant, the period is lengthened significantly, ultimately resulting in arrhythmicity, while blue light-based phase shifts show large deviations from what is observed in wild-type cells. We also show that pCRY is involved in gametogenesis in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>. pCRY is down-regulated in pregametes and gametes, and in the <i>pcry</i> mutant, there is altered transcript accumulation under blue light of the strictly light-dependent, gamete-specific gene <i>GAS28</i>. pCRY acts as a negative regulator for the induction of mating ability in the light and for the loss of mating ability in the dark. Moreover, pCRY is necessary for light-dependent germination, during which the zygote undergoes meiosis that gives rise to four vegetative cells. In sum, our data demonstrate that pCRY is a key blue light receptor in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> that is involved in both circadian timing and life cycle progression.</p>

Fine-Tuning Motile Cilia and Flagella: Evolution of the Dynein Motor Proteins from Plants to Humans at High Resolution
<p>The flagellum is a key innovation linked to eukaryogenesis. It provides motility by regulated cycles of bending and bend propagation, which are thought to be controlled by a complex arrangement of seven distinct dyneins in repeated patterns of outer- (OAD) and inner-arm dynein (IAD) complexes. Electron tomography showed high similarity of this axonemal repeat pattern across ciliates, algae, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als, but the diversity of dynein sequences across the eukaryotes has not yet comprehensively been resolved and correlated with structural data. To shed light on the evolution of the axoneme I performed an exhaustive analysis of dyneins using the available sequenced genome data. Evidence from motor domain phylogeny allowed expanding the current set of nine dynein subtypes by eight additional isoforms with, however, restricted taxonomic distributions. I confirmed the presence of the nine dyneins in all eukaryotic super-groups indicating their origin predating the last eukaryotic common ancestor. The comparison of the N-terminal tail domains revealed a most likely axonemal dynein origin of the new classes, a group of chimeric dyneins in plants/algae and Stramenopiles, and the unique domain architecture and origin of the outermost OADs present in green algae and ciliates but not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als. The correlation of sequence and structural data suggests the single-headed class-8 and class-9 dyneins to localize to the distal end of the axonemal repeat and the class-7 dyneins filling the region up to the proximal heterodimeric IAD. Tracing dynein gene duplications across the eukaryotes indicated ongoing diversification and fine-tuning of flagellar functions in extant taxa and species.</p>

Molecular Evolution of the Yap/Yorkie Proto-Oncogene and Elucidation of Its Core Transcriptional Program
<p>Throughout Metazoa, developmental processes are controlled by a surprisingly limited number of conserved signaling pathways. Precisely how these signaling cassettes were assembled in early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al evolution remains poorly understood, as do the molecular transitions that potentiated the acquisition of their myriad developmental functions. Here we analyze the molecular evolution of the proto-oncogene yes-associated protein (Yap)/Yorkie, a key effector of the Hippo signaling pathway that controls organ size in both <i>Drosophila</i> and mammals. Based on heterologous functional analysis of evolutionarily distant Yap/Yorkie orthologs, we demonstrate that a structurally distinct interaction interface between Yap/Yorkie and its partner TEAD/Scalloped became fixed in the eumetazoan common ancestor. We then combine transcriptional profiling of tissues expressing phylogenetically diverse forms of Yap/Yorkie with ChIP-seq validation to identify a common downstream gene expression program underlying the control of tissue growth in <i>Drosophila</i>. Intriguingly, a subset of the newly identified Yorkie target genes are also induced by Yap in mammalian tissues, thus revealing a conserved Yap-dependent gene expression signature likely to mediate organ size control throughout bilaterian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als. Combined, these experiments provide new mechanistic insights while revealing the ancient evolutionary history of Hippo signaling.</p>

The Evolution of Human Cells in Terms of Protein Innovation
<p>Humans are composed of hundreds of cell types. As the genomic DNA of each somatic cell is identical, cell type is determined by what is expressed and when. Until recently, little has been reported about the determinants of human cell identity, particularly from the joint perspective of gene evolution and expression. Here, we chart the evolutionary past of all documented human cell types via the collective histories of proteins, the principal product of gene expression. FANTOM5 data provide cell-type–specific digital expression of human protein-coding genes and the SUPERFAMILY resource is used to provide protein domain annotation. The evolutionary epoch in which each protein was created is inferred by comparison with domain annotation of all other completely sequenced genomes. Studying the distribution across epochs of genes expressed in each cell type reveals insights into human cellular evolution in terms of protein innovation. For each cell type, its history of protein innovation is charted based on the genes it expresses. Combining the histories of all cell types enables us to create a timeline of cell evolution. This timeline identifies the possibility that our common ancestor Coelomata (cavity-forming <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als) provided the innovation required for the innate immune system, whereas cells which now form the brain of human have followed a trajectory of continually accumulating novel proteins since Opisthokonta (boundary of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als and fungi). We conclude that exaptation of existing domain architectures into new contexts is the dominant source of cell-type–specific domain architectures.</p>

Genetic and phenotypically flexible components of seasonal variation in immune function
<p>Animals cope with seasonal variation in environmental factors by adjustments of physiology and life history. When seasonal variation is partly predictable, such adjustments can be based on a genetic component or be phenotypically flexible. Animals have to allocate limited resources over different demands, including immune function. Accordingly, immune traits could change seasonally, and such changes could have a genetic component that differs between environments. We tested this hypothesis in genotypically distinct groups of a widespread songbird, the stonechat (<i>Saxicola torquata</i>). We compared variation in immunity during 1 year in long-distance migrants, short-distance migrants, tropical residents and hybrids in a common garden environment. Additionally, we investigated phenotypically flexible responses to temperature by applying different temperature regimes to one group. We assessed constitutive immunity by measuring hemagglutination, hemolysis, haptoglobin and bactericidal ability against <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. Genotypic groups differed in patterns of variation of all measured immune indices except haptoglobin. Hybrids differed from, but were rarely intermediate to, parental subspecies. Temperature treatment only influenced patterns of hemolysis and bactericidal ability against <i>E. coli.</i> We conclude that seasonal variation in constitutive immunity has a genetic component, that heredity does not follow simple Mendelian rules, and that some immune measures are relatively rigid while others are more flexible. Furthermore, our results support the idea that seasonal variability in constitutive immunity is associated with variability in environment and annual-cycle demands. This study stresses the importance of considering seasonal variation in immune function in relation to the ecology and life history of the organism of interest.</p>

Prior experience with conspecific signals enhances auditory midbrain responsiveness to conspecific vocalizations
<p>There is a long history in neuroethology of investigating how communication signals influence the brain and behavior. It has become increasingly clear that brain areas associated with sensory processing are plastic in adults and that this plasticity is related to reproductive condition. However, the role of communication signal reception in adult auditory plasticity has received relatively little attention. Here, we investigated whether the reception of communication signals (a frog chorus) could enhance the responsiveness of the auditory system to future reception of communication signals (a single male call). We found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als that had been exposed to 10 days of a male chorus had stronger auditory midbrain immediate early gene expression than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als that had been exposed to 10 days of random tones when tested with 30 min of male calls or 30 min of tones. Our results suggest that exposure to dynamic social stimuli, like frog choruses, may play an important role in shaping the neural and behavioral responses to communication signals.</p>

Gut microbiota dictates the metabolic response of <i>Drosophila</i> to diet
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al nutrition is profoundly influenced by the gut microbiota, but knowledge of the scope and core mechanisms of the underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al–microbiota interactions is fragmentary. To investigate the nutritional traits shaped by the gut microbiota of <i>Drosophila</i>, we determined the microbiota-dependent response of multiple metabolic and performance indices to systematically varied diet composition. Diet-dependent differences between <i>Drosophila</i> bearing its unmanipulated microbiota (conventional flies) and experimentally deprived of its microbiota (axenic flies) revealed evidence for: microbial sparing of dietary B vitamins, especially riboflavin, on low-yeast diets; microbial promotion of protein nutrition, particularly in females; and microbiota-mediated suppression of lipid/carbohydrate storage, especially on high sugar diets. The microbiota also sets the relationship between energy storage and body mass, indicative of microbial modulation of the host signaling networks that coordinate metabolism with body size. This analysis identifies the multiple impacts of the microbiota on the metabolism of <i>Drosophila</i>, and demonstrates that the significance of these different interactions varies with diet composition and host sex.</p>

Scaling of the hydrostatic skeleton in the earthworm <i>Lumbricus terrestris</i>
<p>The structural and functional consequences of changes in size or scale have been well studied in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als with rigid skeletons, but relatively little is known about scale effects in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als with hydrostatic skeletons. We used glycol methacrylate histology and microscopy to examine the scaling of mechanically important morphological features of the earthworm <i>Lumbricus terrestris</i> over an ontogenetic size range from 0.03 to 12.89 g. We found that <i>L. terrestris</i> becomes disproportionately longer and thinner as it grows. This increase in the length to diameter ratio with size means that, when normalized for mass, adult worms gain ~117% mechanical advantage during radial expansion, compared with hatchling worms. We also found that the cross-sectional area of the longitudinal musculature scales as body mass to the ~0.6 power across segments, which is significantly lower than the 0.66 power predicted by isometry. The cross-sectional area of the circular musculature, however, scales as body mass to the ~0.8 power across segments, which is significantly higher than predicted by isometry. By modeling the interaction of muscle cross-sectional area and mechanical advantage, we calculate that the force output generated during both circular and longitudinal muscle contraction scales near isometry. We hypothesize that the allometric scaling of earthworms may reflect changes in soil properties and burrowing mechanics with size.</p>

An increase in minimum metabolic rate and not activity explains field metabolic rate changes in a breeding seabird
<p>The field metabolic rate (FMR) of a free-ranging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al can be considered as the sum of its maintenance costs (minimum metabolic rate, MMR) and additional costs associated with thermoregulation, digestion, production and activity. However, the relationships between FMR and BMR and how they relate to behaviour and extrinsic influences is not clear. In seabirds, FMR has been shown to increase during the breeding season. This is presumed to be the result of an increase in foraging activity, stimulated by increased food demands from growing chicks, but few studies have investigated in detail the factors that underlie these increases. We studied free-ranging Australasian gannets (<i>Morus serrator</i>) throughout their 5 month breeding season, and evaluated FMR, MMR and activity-related metabolic costs on a daily basis using the heart rate method. In addition, we simultaneously recorded behaviour (flying and diving) in the same individuals. FMR increased steadily throughout the breeding season, increasing by 11% from the incubation period to the long chick-brooding period. However, this was not accompanied by either an increase in flying or diving behaviour, or an increase in the energetic costs of activity. Instead, the changes in FMR could be explained exclusively by a progressive increase in MMR. Seasonal changes in MMR could be due to a change in body composition or a decrease in body condition associated with changing the allocation of resources between provisioning adults and growing chicks. Our study highlights the importance of measuring physiological parameters continuously in free-ranging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als in order to understand fully the mechanisms underpinning seasonal changes in physiology and behaviour.</p>

RUNX2 correlates with subtype-specific breast cancer in a human tissue microarray, and ectopic expression of <i>Runx2</i> perturbs differentiation in the mouse mammary gland
<p>RUNX2, a master regulator of osteogenesis, is oncogenic in the lymphoid lineage; however, little is known about its role in epithelial cancers. Upregulation of <i>RUNX2</i> in cell lines correlates with increased invasiveness and the capacity to form osteolytic disease in models of breast and prostate cancer. However, most studies have analysed the effects of this gene in a limited number of cell lines and its role in primary breast cancer has not been resolved. Using a human tumour tissue microarray, we show that high RUNX2 expression is significantly associated with oestrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor (PR)/HER2-negative breast cancers and that patients with high RUNX2 expression have a poorer survival rate than those with negative or low expression. We confirm <i>RUNX2</i> as a gene that has a potentially important functional role in triple-negative breast cancer. To investigate the role of this gene in breast cancer, we made a transgenic model in which <i>Runx2</i> is specifically expressed in murine mammary epithelium under the control of the mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV) promoter. We show that ectopic <i>Runx2</i> perturbs normal development in pubertal and lactating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als, delaying ductal elongation and inhibiting lobular alveolar differentiation. We also show that the <i>Runx2</i> transgene elicits age-related, pre-neoplastic changes in the mammary epithelium of older transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als, suggesting that elevated RUNX2 expression renders such tissue more susceptible to oncogenic changes and providing further evidence that this gene might have an important, context-dependent role in breast cancer.</p>

Osteoarticular tissue infection and development of skeletal pathology in murine brucellosis
<p>Brucellosis, a frequent bacterial zoonosis, can produce debilitating chronic disease with involvement of multiple organs in human patients. Whereas acute brucellosis is well studied using the murine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al model, long-term complications of host-pathogen interaction remain largely elusive. Human brucellosis frequently results in persistent, chronic osteoarticular system involvement, with complications such as arthritis, spondylitis and sacroiliitis. Here, we focused on identifying infectious sites in the mouse that parallel <i>Brucella melitensis</i> foci observed in patients. <i>In vivo</i> imaging showed rapid bacterial dispersal to multiple sites of the murine axial skeleton. In agreement with these findings, immunohistochemistry revealed the presence of bacteria in bones and limbs, and in the lower spine vertebrae of the axial skeleton where they were preferentially located in the bone marrow. Surprisingly, some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als developed arthritis in paws and spine after infection, but without obvious bacteria in these sites. The identification of <i>Brucella</i> in the bones of mice corroborates the findings in humans that these osteoarticular sites are important niches for the persistence of <i>Brucella</i> in the host, but the mechanisms that mediate pathological manifestations in these sites remain unclear. Future studies addressing the immune responses within osteoarticular tissue foci could elucidate important tissue injury mediators and <i>Brucella</i> survival strategies.</p>

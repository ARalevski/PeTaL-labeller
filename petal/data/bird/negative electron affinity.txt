Mutations in the NPxxY motif stabilize pharmacologically distinct conformational states of the α<sub>1B</sub>- and β<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptors
<p>G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) convert extracellular stimuli to intracellular responses that regulate numerous physiological processes. Crystallographic and biophysical advances in GPCR structural analysis have aided investigations of structure-function relationships that clarify our understanding of these dynamic receptors, but the molecular mechanisms associated with activation and signaling for individual GPCRs may be more complex than was previously appreciated. Here, we investigated the proposed water-mediated, hydrogen-bonded activation switch between the conserved NPxxY motif on transmembrane helix 7 (TMH7) and a conserved tyrosine in TMH5, which contributes to α<sub>1B</sub>-adrenoceptor (α<sub>1B</sub>-AR) and β<sub>2</sub>-AR activation. Disrupting this bond by mutagenesis stabilized the α<sub>1B</sub>-AR and the β<sub>2</sub>-AR in inactive-state conformations, which displayed decreased agonist potency for stimulating downstream IP<sub>1</sub> and cAMP signaling, respectively. Compared to that for wild-type receptors, agonist-mediated β-arrestin recruitment was substantially reduced or abolished for all α<sub>1B</sub>-AR and β<sub>2</sub>-AR inactive-state mutants. However, the inactive-state β<sub>2</sub>-ARs exhibited decreased agonist <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity, whereas the inactive-state α<sub>1B</sub>-ARs had enhanced agonist <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity. Conversely, antagonist <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity was unchanged for inactive-state conformations of both α<sub>1B</sub>-AR and β<sub>2</sub>-AR. Removing the influence of agonist <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity on agonist potency gave a measure of signaling efficacy, which was markedly decreased for the α<sub>1B</sub>-AR mutants but little altered for the β<sub>2</sub>-AR mutants. These findings highlight the pharmacological heterogeneity of inactive-state GPCR conformations, which may facilitate the rational design of drugs that target distinct conformational states of GPCRs.</p>

Antihomotypic affinity maturation improves human B cell responses against a repetitive epitope
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity maturation selects B cells expressing somatically mutated antibody variants with improved antigen-binding properties to protect from invading pathogens. We determined the molecular mechanism underlying the clonal selection and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity maturation of human B cells expressing protective antibodies against the circumsporozoite protein of the malaria parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> (PfCSP). We show in molecular detail that the repetitive nature of PfCSP facilitates direct homotypic interactions between two PfCSP repeat-bound monoclonal antibodies, thereby improving antigen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity and B cell activation. These data provide a mechanistic explanation for the strong selection of somatic mutations that mediate homotypic antibody interactions after repeated parasite exposure in humans. Our findings demonstrate a different mode of antigen-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity maturation to improve antibody responses to PfCSP and presumably other repetitive antigens.</p>

Trans-inhibition of activation and proliferation signals by Fc receptors in mast cells and basophils
<p>Allergic and autoimmune inflammation are associated with the activation of mast cells and basophils by antibodies against allergens or auto-antigens, respectively. Both cell types express several receptors for the Fc portion of antibodies, the engagement of which by antigen-antibody complexes controls their responses. When aggregated on the plasma membrane, high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity immunoglobulin E (IgE) receptors (FcεRI) and low-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity IgG receptors (FcγRIIIA in mice, FcγRIIA in humans) induce these cells to release and secrete proinflammatory mediators, chemokines, and cytokines that account for clinical symptoms. When coaggregated with activating receptors on the same cells, other low-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity IgG receptors (FcγRIIB in both species) inhibit mast cell and basophil activation. We found that FcγRIIB inhibited not only signals triggered by activating receptors with which they were coengaged (cis-inhibition), but also signals triggered by receptors engaged independently (trans-inhibition). Trans-inhibition acted upon the FcεRI-dependent activation of mouse mast cells, mouse basophils, and human basophils, and upon growth factor receptor (Kit)–dependent normal mouse mast cell proliferation, as well as the constitutive in vitro proliferation and the in vivo growth of oncogene (v-Abl)–transformed mastocytoma cells. Trans-inhibition was induced by receptors, whether inhibitory (FcγRIIB) or activating (FcεRI), which recruited the lipid phosphatase SHIP1. By hydrolyzing PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>, SHIP1 induced a global unresponsiveness that affected biological responses triggered by receptors that use phosphoinositide 3-kinase to signal. These data suggest that trans-inhibition controls numerous physiological and pathological processes, and that it may be used as a therapeutic tool in inflammation, especially but not exclusively, in allergy and autoimmunity.</p>

A disease-linked <i>ULBP6</i> polymorphism inhibits NKG2D-mediated target cell killing by enhancing the stability of NKG2D ligand binding
<p>NKG2D (natural killer group 2, member D) is an activating receptor found on the surface of immune cells, including natural killer (NK) cells, which regulates innate and adaptive immunity through recognition of the stress-induced ligands ULBP1 (UL16 binding protein 1) to ULBP6 and MICA/B. Similar to class I human leukocyte antigen (HLA), these NKG2D ligands have a major histocompatibility complex–like fold and exhibit pronounced polymorphism, which influences human disease susceptibility. However, whereas class I HLA polymorphisms occur predominantly in the α1α2 groove and affect antigen binding, the effects of most NKG2D ligand polymorphisms are unclear. We studied the molecular and functional consequences of the two major alleles of <i>ULBP6</i>, the most polymorphic <i>ULBP</i> gene, which are associated with autoimmunity and relapse after stem cell transplantation. Surface plasmon resonance and crystallography studies revealed that the arginine-to-leucine polymorphism within ULBP0602 affected the NKG2D-ULBP6 interaction by generating an energetic hotspot. This resulted in an NKG2D-ULBP0602 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity of 15.5 nM, which is 10- to 1000-fold greater than the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ities of other ULBP-NKG2D interactions and limited NKG2D-mediated activation. In addition, soluble ULBP0602 exhibited high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity competitive binding for NKG2D and partially suppressed NKG2D-mediated activation of NK cells by other NKG2D ligands. These effects resulted in a decrease in a range of NKG2D-mediated effector functions. Our results reveal that <i>ULBP</i> polymorphisms affect the strength of human lymphocyte responses to cellular stress signals and may offer opportunities for therapeutic intervention.</p>

Germinal center antibody mutation trajectories are determined by rapid self/foreign discrimination
<p>Antibodies have the specificity to differentiate foreign antigens that mimic self antigens, but it remains unclear how such specificity is acquired. In a mouse model, we generated B cells displaying an antibody that cross-reacts with two related protein antigens expressed on self versus foreign cells. B cell anergy was imposed by self antigen but reversed upon challenge with high-density foreign antigen, leading to germinal center recruitment and antibody gene hypermutation. Single-cell analysis detected rapid selection for mutations that decrease self <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity and slower selection for epistatic mutations that specifically increase foreign <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity. Crystal structures revealed that these mutations exploited subtle topological differences to achieve 5000-fold preferential binding to foreign over self epitopes. Resolution of antigenic mimicry drove the optimal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity maturation trajectory, highlighting the value of retaining self-reactive clones as substrates for protective antibody responses.</p>

GS<sup>yellow</sup>, a Multifaceted Tag for Functional Protein Analysis in Monocot and Dicot Plants
<p>The ability to tag proteins has boosted the emergence of generic molecular methods for protein functional analysis. Fluorescent protein tags are used to visualize protein localization, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity tags enable the mapping of molecular interactions by, for example, tandem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity purification or chromatin immunoprecipitation. To apply these widely used molecular techniques on a single transgenic plant line, we developed a multifunctional tandem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity purification tag, named GS<sup>yellow</sup>, which combines the streptavidin-binding peptide tag with citrine yellow fluorescent protein. We demonstrated the versatility of the GS<sup>yellow</sup> tag in the dicot Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) using a set of benchmark proteins. For proof of concept in monocots, we assessed the localization and dynamic interaction profile of the leaf growth regulator ANGUSTIFOLIA3 (AN3), fused to the GS<sup>yellow</sup> tag, along the growth zone of the maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) leaf. To further explore the function of ZmAN3, we mapped its DNA-binding landscape in the growth zone of the maize leaf through chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing. Comparison with AN3 target genes mapped in the developing maize tassel or in Arabidopsis cell cultures revealed strong conservation of AN3 target genes between different maize tissues and across monocots and dicots, respectively. In conclusion, the GS<sup>yellow</sup> tag offers a powerful molecular tool for distinct types of protein functional analyses in dicots and monocots. As this approach involves transforming a single construct, it is likely to accelerate both basic and translational plant research.</p>

Sucrose Transporter Localization and Function in Phloem Unloading in Developing Stems
<p>How sucrose transporters (SUTs) regulate phloem unloading in monocot stems is poorly understood and particularly so for species storing high Suc concentrations. To this end, <i>Sorghum bicolor</i> SUTs SbSUT1 and SbSUT5 were characterized by determining their transport properties heterologously expressed in yeast or <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes, and their in planta cellular and subcellular localization. The plasma membrane-localized SbSUT1 and SbSUT5 exhibited a strong selectivity for Suc and high Suc <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ities in <i>X. laevis</i> oocytes at pH 5—SbSUT1, 6.3 ± 0.7 m<sc>m,</sc> and SbSUT5, 2.4 ± 0.5 m<sc>m</sc> Suc. The Suc <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity of SbSUT1 was dependent on membrane potential and pH. In contrast, SbSUT5 Suc <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity was independent of membrane potential and pH but supported high transport rates at neutral pH. Suc transport by the tonoplast localized SbSUT4 could not be detected using yeast or <i>X. laevis</i> oocytes. Across internode development, SUTs, other than SbSUT4, were immunolocalized to sieve elements, while for elongating and recently elongated internodes, SUTs also were detected in storage parenchyma cells. We conclude that apoplasmic Suc unloading from de-energized protophloem sieve elements in meristematic zones may be mediated by reversal of SbSUT1 and/or by uniporting SWEETs. Storage parenchyma localized SbSUT1 and SbSUT5 may accumulate Suc from the stem apoplasms of elongating and recently elongated internodes, whereas SbSUT4 may function to release Suc from vacuoles. Transiting from an apoplasmic to symplasmic unloading pathway as the stem matures, SbSUT1 and SbSUT5 increasingly function in Suc retrieval into metaphloem sieve elements to maintain a high turgor to drive symplasmic unloading by bulk flow.</p>

Molecular and functional characterization of hemocyanin of the giant African millipede, <i>Archispirostreptus gigas</i>
<p>In contrast to other terrestrial arthropods, where gaseous O<sub>2</sub> that fuels aerobic metabolism diffuses to the tissues in tracheal tubes, and most other metazoans, where O<sub>2</sub> is transported to tissues by circulating respiratory proteins, the myriapods (millipedes and centipedes) strikingly have tracheal systems as well as circulating hemocyanin (Hc). In order to elucidate the evolutionary origin and biological significance of millipede Hc, we report the molecular structure (subunit composition and amino acid sequence) of multimeric (36-mer) Hc from the forest floor-dwelling giant African millipede <i>Archispirostreptus gigas</i> and its allosteric oxygen-binding properties under various physico-chemical conditions. <i>Archispirostreptus gigas</i> Hc consists of only a single subunit type with differential glycosylation. Phylogenic analysis revealed that millipede Hc is a sister group to centipede HcA, which supports an early divergence of distinct Hc subunits in myriapods and an ancient origin of multimeric Hcs. <i>Archispirostreptus gigas</i> Hc binds O<sub>2</sub> with a high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity and shows a strong Bohr effect. O<sub>2</sub> binding is, moreover, modulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, which increase the O<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity of the Hc in the tense (T; deoxygenated) as well as the relaxed (R; oxygenated) states, and by (<sc>l</sc>)-lactate, which modulates Hc–O<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity by changing the allosteric equilibrium constant, <i>L</i>. Cooperativity in O<sub>2</sub> binding at half O<sub>2</sub> saturation (<i>n</i><sub>50</sub>) is pH dependent and maximal at ~pH 7.4, and the number of interacting O<sub>2</sub>-binding sites (<i>q</i>) is markedly increased by binding Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The data are discussed in the light of the mutually supplementary roles of Hc and the tracheal system for tissue O<sub>2</sub> supply.</p>

The channel-kinase TRPM7 regulates antigen gathering and internalization in B cells
<p>Members of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family of ion channels are cellular sensors involved in numerous physiological and pathological processes. We identified the TRP subfamily M member 7 (TRPM7) channel-kinase as a previously uncharacterized regulator of B cell activation. We showed that TRPM7 played a critical role in the early events of B cell activation through both its ion channel and kinase functions. DT40 B cells deficient in TRPM7 or expressing a kinase-deficient mutant of TRPM7 showed defective gathering of antigen and prolonged B cell receptor (BCR) signaling. We showed that lipid metabolism was altered in TRPM7-deficient cells and in cells expressing a kinase-deficient mutant of TRPM7 and suggest that PLC-γ2 may be a target of the kinase activity of TRPM7. Primary B cells that expressed less TRPM7 or were treated with a pharmacological inhibitor of TRPM7 also displayed defective antigen gathering and increased BCR signaling. Finally, we demonstrated that blocking TRPM7 function compromised antigen internalization and presentation to T cells. These data suggest that TRPM7 controls an essential process required for B cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity maturation and the production of high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity antibodies.</p>

Molecular basis for high-affinity agonist binding in GPCRs
<p>G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) in the G protein–coupled active state have higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity for agonists as compared with when they are in the inactive state, but the molecular basis for this is unclear. We have determined four active-state structures of the β<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor (β<sub>1</sub>AR) bound to conformation-specific nanobodies in the presence of agonists of varying efficacy. Comparison with inactive-state structures of β<sub>1</sub>AR bound to the identical ligands showed a 24 to 42% reduction in the volume of the orthosteric binding site. Potential hydrogen bonds were also shorter, and there was up to a 30% increase in the number of atomic contacts between the receptor and ligand. This explains the increase in agonist <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity of GPCRs in the active state for a wide range of structurally distinct agonists.</p>

Crystal structure of a TAPBPR–MHC I complex reveals the mechanism of peptide editing in antigen presentation
<p>Central to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell–mediated immunity is the recognition of peptide–major histocompatibility complex class I (p–MHC I) proteins displayed by antigen-presenting cells. Chaperone-mediated loading of high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity peptides onto MHC I is a key step in the MHC I antigen presentation pathway. However, the structure of MHC I with a chaperone that facilitates peptide loading has not been determined. We report the crystal structure of MHC I in complex with the peptide editor TAPBPR (TAP-binding protein–related), a tapasin homolog. TAPBPR remodels the peptide-binding groove of MHC I, resulting in the release of low-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity peptide. Changes include groove relaxation, modifications of key binding pockets, and domain adjustments. This structure captures a peptide-receptive state of MHC I and provides insights into the mechanism of peptide editing by TAPBPR and, by analogy, tapasin.</p>

Life, death, and antibodies
<p>The production of high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity antibodies has fascinated immunologists for many decades. A potent arm of the immune response, these antibodies are forged in transient tissue structures called germinal centers (GCs) that appear in lymph nodes a few days after an infection is initiated. Over the ensuing days and weeks, the GC witnesses a cellular pantomime that includes rapid bursts of B lymphocyte proliferation and multicellular migratory cycles that have a unique purpose. These B cells are in the act of mutating, reshaping, testing, and improving their antibody specificities. While their antibody is refined, GC B cells are also undergoing further differentiation to be retasked for new, long-term occupations as circulating memory cells in the blood or bone marrow-resident, long-lived plasma cells that will produce high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity, protective antibodies for life. These intense proliferation and selection processes are balanced by an extraordinary rate of programmed cell death (apoptosis), and there is much speculation as to how and why so many B cells are targeted for apoptosis. On page 193 of this issue, Mayer <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) identify the paths leading to B cell apoptosis in the GC reaction.</p>

Chemogenetics revealed: DREADD occupancy and activation via converted clozapine

Nevertheless, the in vivo mechanism of action of CNO at DREADDs has never been confirmed.

The Potassium Transporter SlHAK10 Is Involved in Mycorrhizal Potassium Uptake
<p>Most terrestrial plants form a root symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, which receive fixed carbon from the plant and enhance the plant’s uptake of mineral nutrients. AM symbiosis improves the phosphorous and nitrogen nutrition of host plants; however, little is known about the role of AM symbiosis in potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) nutrition. Here, we report that inoculation with the AM fungus <i>Rhizophagus irregularis</i> improved tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) plant growth and K<sup>+</sup> acquisition and that K<sup>+</sup> deficiency has a negative effect on root growth and AM colonization. Based on its homology to a <i>Lotus japonicus</i> AM-induced K<sup>+</sup> transporter, we identified a mycorrhiza-specific tomato K<sup>+</sup> transporter, SlHAK10 (<i>Solanum lycopersicum High-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity Potassium Transporter10</i>), that was exclusively expressed in arbuscule-containing cells. <i>SlHAK10</i> could restore a yeast K<sup>+</sup> uptake-defective mutant in the low-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity concentration range. Loss of function of <i>SlHAK10</i> led to a significant decrease in mycorrhizal K<sup>+</sup> uptake and AM colonization rate under low-K<sup>+</sup> conditions but did not affect arbuscule development. Overexpressing <i>SlHAK10</i> from the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter or the AM-specific <i>Solanum melongena Phosphate Transporter4</i> not only improved plant growth and K<sup>+</sup> uptake but also increased AM colonization efficiency and soluble sugar content in roots supplied with low K<sup>+</sup>. Our results indicate that tomato plants have a SlHAK10<i>-</i>mediated mycorrhizal K<sup>+</sup> uptake pathway and that improved plant K<sup>+</sup> nutrition could increase carbohydrate accumulation in roots, which facilitates AM fungal colonization.</p>

Interaction of 2′,3′-cAMP with Rbp47b Plays a Role in Stress Granule Formation
<p>2′,3′-cAMP is an intriguing small molecule that is conserved among different kingdoms. 2′,3′-cAMP is presumably produced during RNA degradation, with increased cellular levels observed especially under stress conditions. Previously, we observed the presence of 2′,3′-cAMP in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) protein complexes isolated from native lysate, suggesting that 2′,3′-cAMP has potential protein partners in plants. Here, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity purification experiments revealed that 2′,3′-cAMP associates with the stress granule (SG) proteome. SGs are aggregates composed of protein and mRNA, which enable cells to selectively store mRNA for use in response to stress such as heat whereby translation initiation is impaired. Using size-exclusion chromatography and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity purification analyses, we identified Rbp47b, the key component of SGs, as a potential interacting partner of 2′,3′-cAMP. Furthermore, SG formation was promoted in 2′,3′-cAMP-treated Arabidopsis seedlings, and interactions between 2′,3′-cAMP and RNA-binding domains of Rbp47b, RRM2 and RRM3, were confirmed in vitro using microscale thermophoresis. Taken together, these results (1) describe novel small-molecule regulation of SG formation, (2) provide evidence for the biological role of 2′,3′-cAMP, and (3) demonstrate an original biochemical pipeline for the identification of protein-metabolite interactors.</p>

Sugar Transporter STP7 Specificity for <sc>l</sc>-Arabinose and <sc>d</sc>-Xylose Contrasts with the Typical Hexose Transporters STP8 and STP12
<p>The controlled distribution of sugars between assimilate-exporting source tissues and sugar-consuming sink tissues is a key element for plant growth and development. Monosaccharide transporters of the SUGAR TRANSPORT PROTEIN (STP) family contribute to the uptake of sugars into sink cells. Here, we report on the characterization of STP7, STP8, and STP12, three previously uncharacterized members of this family in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Heterologous expression in yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) revealed that STP8 and STP12 catalyze the high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity proton-dependent uptake of glucose and also accept galactose and mannose. STP12 additionally transports xylose. <i>STP8</i> and <i>STP12</i> are highly expressed in reproductive organs, where their protein products might contribute to sugar uptake into the pollen tube and the embryo sac. <i>stp8.1</i> and <i>stp12.1</i> T-DNA insertion lines developed normally, which may point toward functional redundancy with other STPs. In contrast to all other STPs, STP7 does not transport hexoses but is specific for the pentoses <sc>l</sc>-arabinose and <sc>d</sc>-xylose. <i>STP7-</i>promoter-reporter gene plants showed an expression of <i>STP7</i> especially in tissues with high cell wall turnover, indicating that STP7 might contribute to the uptake and recycling of cell wall sugars. Uptake analyses with radioactive <sc>l</sc>-arabinose revealed that 11 other STPs are able to transport <sc>l</sc>-arabinose with high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity. Hence, functional redundancy might explain the missing-mutant phenotype of two <i>stp7</i> T-DNA insertion lines.

9-cis-Neoxanthin in Light Harvesting Complexes of Photosystem II Regulates the Binding of Violaxanthin and Xanthophyll Cycle
<p>The light-harvesting chlorophyll <i>a/b</i> complex of photosystem II (LHCII) is able to switch to multiple functions under different light conditions (i.e. harvesting solar energy for photosynthesis and dissipating excess excitation energy for photoprotection). The role of the different carotenoids bound to LHCII in regulating the structure and function of the complex is a long-lasting question in photosynthesis research. 9-cis-Neoxanthin (Nx) is one of the important carotenoids, which can only be found in the LHCIIs. High-resolution structural analysis of LHCII shows that Nx is located between different monomeric LHCIIs, with one side protruding into the lipid membrane. In this study, the various functional significances of this unique feature of Nx binding in LHCII are studied with the in vitro reconstituted LHCIIs both with and without Nx and the native complexes isolated either from wild-type Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) or from its mutant <i>aba4-3</i> lacking Nx. Our results reveal that the binding of Nx affects the binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity of violaxanthin (Vx) to LHCII significantly. In the absence of Nx, Vx has a much higher binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity to trimeric LHCII.

Many of the novel markers identified in our study are intracellular proteins not previously identified in the peripheral circulation or have functional roles relevant to myocardial injury. For example, the cardiac LIM protein, cysteine- and glycine-rich protein 3, is thought to mediate cardiac mechanotransduction and stress responses, whereas the mitochondrial ATP synthase F<sub>0</sub> subunit component is a vasoactive peptide on its release from cells.

Structure of the TAPBPR–MHC I complex defines the mechanism of peptide loading and editing
<p>Adaptive immunity is shaped by a selection of peptides presented on major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) molecules. The chaperones Tapasin (Tsn) and TAP-binding protein–related (TAPBPR) facilitate MHC I peptide loading and high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity epitope selection. Despite the pivotal role of Tsn and TAPBPR in controlling the hierarchical immune response, their catalytic mechanism remains unknown. Here, we present the x-ray structure of the TAPBPR–MHC I complex, which delineates the central step of catalysis. TAPBPR functions as peptide selector by remodeling the MHC I α2-1-helix region, stabilizing the empty binding groove, and inserting a loop into the groove that interferes with peptide binding. The complex explains how mutations in MHC I–specific chaperones cause defects in antigen processing and suggests a unifying mechanism of peptide proofreading.</p>

Potent peptidic fusion inhibitors of influenza virus
<p>Influenza therapeutics with new targets and mechanisms of action are urgently needed to combat potential pandemics, emerging viruses, and constantly mutating strains in circulation. We report here on the design and structural characterization of potent peptidic inhibitors of influenza hemagglutinin. The peptide design was based on complementarity-determining region loops of human broadly neutralizing antibodies against the hemagglutinin (FI6v3 and CR9114). The optimized peptides exhibit nanomolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity and neutralization against influenza A group 1 viruses, including the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and avian H5N1 strains. The peptide inhibitors bind to the highly conserved stem epitope and block the low pH–induced conformational rearrangements associated with membrane fusion. These peptidic compounds and their advantageous biological properties should accelerate the development of new small molecule– and peptide-based therapeutics against influenza virus.</p>

Rotary and linear molecular motors driven by pulses of a chemical fuel
<p>Many biomolecular motors catalyze the hydrolysis of chemical fuels, such as adenosine triphosphate, and use the energy released to direct motion through information ratchet mechanisms. Here we describe chemically-driven artificial rotary and linear molecular motors that operate through a fundamentally different type of mechanism. The directional rotation of [2]- and [3]catenane rotary molecular motors and the transport of substrates away from equilibrium by a linear molecular pump are induced by acid-base oscillations. The changes simultaneously switch the binding site <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ities and the labilities of barriers on the track, creating an energy ratchet. The linear and rotary molecular motors are driven by aliquots of a chemical fuel, trichloroacetic acid. A single fuel pulse generates 360° unidirectional rotation of up to 87% of crown ethers in a [2]catenane rotary motor.</p>

The microanatomic segregation of selection by apoptosis in the germinal center
<p>B cells undergo rapid cell division and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity maturation in anatomically distinct sites in lymphoid organs called germinal centers (GCs). Homeostasis is maintained in part by B cell apoptosis. However, the precise contribution of apoptosis to GC biology and selection is not well defined. We developed apoptosis-indicator mice and used them to visualize, purify, and characterize dying GC B cells. Apoptosis is prevalent in the GC, with up to half of all GC B cells dying every 6 hours. Moreover, programmed cell death is differentially regulated in the light zone and the dark zone: Light-zone B cells die by default if they are not positively selected, whereas dark-zone cells die when their antigen receptors are damaged by activation-induced cytidine deaminase.</p>

Notch-Jagged complex structure implicates a catch bond in tuning ligand sensitivity
<p>Notch receptor activation initiates cell fate decisions and is distinctive in its reliance on mechanical force and protein glycosylation. The 2.5-angstrom-resolution crystal structure of the extracellular interacting region of Notch1 complexed with an engineered, high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity variant of Jagged1 (Jag1) reveals a binding interface that extends ~120 angstroms along five consecutive domains of each protein. <i>O</i>-Linked fucose modifications on Notch1 epidermal growth factor–like (EGF) domains 8 and 12 engage the EGF3 and C2 domains of Jag1, respectively, and different Notch1 domains are favored in binding to Jag1 than those that bind to the Delta-like 4 ligand. Jag1 undergoes conformational changes upon Notch binding, exhibiting catch bond behavior that prolongs interactions in the range of forces required for Notch activation. This mechanism enables cellular forces to regulate binding, discriminate among Notch ligands, and potentiate Notch signaling.</p>

IgG antibodies to dengue enhanced for FcγRIIIA binding determine disease severity
<p>Dengue virus (DENV) infection in the presence of reactive, non-neutralizing immunoglobulin G (IgG) (RNNIg) is the greatest risk factor for dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Progression to DHF/DSS is attributed to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE); however, because only a fraction of infections occurring in the presence of RNNIg advance to DHF/DSS, the presence of RNNIg alone cannot account for disease severity. We discovered that DHF/DSS patients respond to infection by producing IgGs with enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity for the activating Fc receptor FcγRIIIA due to afucosylated Fc glycans and IgG1 subclass. RNNIg enriched for afucosylated IgG1 triggered platelet reduction in vivo and was a significant risk factor for thrombocytopenia. Thus, therapeutics and vaccines restricting production of afucosylated, IgG1 RNNIg during infection may prevent ADE of DENV disease.</p>

Predictable convergence in hemoglobin function has unpredictable molecular underpinnings

Convergent increases in hemoglobin-oxygen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity were pervasive among high-altitude taxa, but few such changes were attributable to parallel amino acid substitutions at key residues. Thus, predictable changes in biochemical phenotype do not have a predictable molecular basis. Experiments involving resurrected ancestral proteins revealed that historical substitutions have context-dependent effects, indicating that possible adaptive solutions are contingent on prior history. Mutations that produce an adaptive change in one species may represent precluded possibilities in other species because of differences in genetic background.</p>

Pathological α-synuclein transmission initiated by binding lymphocyte-activation gene 3
<p>Emerging evidence indicates that the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD) may be due to cell-to-cell transmission of misfolded preformed fibrils (PFF) of α-synuclein (α-syn). The mechanism by which α-syn PFF spreads from neuron to neuron is not known. Here, we show that LAG3 (lymphocyte-activation gene 3) binds α-syn PFF with high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity (dissociation constant = 77 nanomolar), whereas the α-syn monomer exhibited minimal binding. α-Syn-biotin PFF binding to LAG3 initiated α-syn PFF endocytosis, transmission, and toxicity. Lack of LAG3 substantially delayed α-syn PFF–induced loss of dopamine neurons, as well as biochemical and behavioral deficits in vivo. The identification of LAG3 as a receptor that binds α-syn PFF provides a target for developing therapeutics designed to slow the progression of PD and related α-synucleinopathies.</p>

Down-regulation of the Sucrose Transporter <i>CsSUT1</i> Causes Male Sterility by Altering Carbohydrate Supply
<p>In plants, male sterility is an important agronomic trait, especially in hybrid crop production. Many factors are known to affect crop male sterility, but it remains unclear whether Suc transporters (SUTs) participate directly in this process. Here, we identified and functionally characterized the cucumber (<i>Cucumis sativus</i>) CsSUT1, a typical plasma membrane-localized energy-dependent high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity Suc-H<sup>+</sup> symporter. <i>CsSUT1</i> is expressed in male flowers and encodes a protein that is localized primarily in the tapetum, pollen, and companion cells of the phloem of sepals, petals, filaments, and pedicel. The male flowers of <i>CsSUT1</i>-RNA interference (RNAi) lines exhibited a decrease in Suc, hexose, and starch content, relative to those of the wild type, during the later stages of male flower development, a finding that was highly associated with male sterility. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that numerous genes associated with sugar metabolism, transport, and signaling, as well as with auxin signaling, were down-regulated, whereas most <i>myeloblastosis</i> (<i>MYB</i>) transcription factor genes were up-regulated in these <i>CsSUT1</i>-RNAi lines relative to wild type. Our findings demonstrate that male sterility can be induced by RNAi-mediated down-regulation of <i>CsSUT1</i> expression, through the resultant perturbation in carbohydrate delivery and subsequent alteration in sugar and hormone signaling and up-regulation of specific <i>MYB</i> transcription factors. This knowledge provides a new approach for bioengineering male sterility in crop plants.</p>

A Transcription Factor, OsMADS57, Regulates Long-Distance Nitrate Transport and Root Elongation
<p>Root nitrate uptake adjusts to the plant’s nitrogen demand for growth. Here, we report that OsMADS57, a MADS-box transcription factor, modulates nitrate translocation from rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) roots to shoots under low-nitrate conditions. <i>OsMADS57</i> is abundantly expressed in xylem parenchyma cells of root stele and is induced by nitrate. Compared with wild-type rice plants supplied with 0.2 mM nitrate, <i>osmads57</i> mutants had 31% less xylem loading of nitrate, while overexpression lines had 2-fold higher levels. Shoot-root <sup>15</sup>N content ratios were 40% lower in the mutants and 76% higher in the overexpression lines. Rapid NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> root influx experiments showed that mutation of <i>OsMADS57</i> did not affect root nitrate uptake. Reverse transcription quantitative PCR analysis of <i>OsNRT2</i> nitrate transporter genes showed that after 5 min in 0.2 mM nitrate, only <i>OsNRT2.3a</i> (a vascular-specific high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity nitrate transporter) had reduced (by two-thirds) expression levels. At 60 min of nitrate treatment, lower expression levels were also observed for three additional <i>NRT2</i> genes (<i>OsNRT2.1/2.2/2.4</i>). Conversely, in the overexpression lines, four <i>NRT2</i> genes had much higher expression profiles at all time points tested. As previously reported, <i>OsNRT2.3a</i> functions in nitrate translocation, indicating the possible interaction between <i>OsMADS57</i> and <i>OsNRT2.3a</i>. Yeast one-hybrid and transient expression assays demonstrated that OsMADS57 binds to the CArG motif (CATTTTATAG) within the <i>OsNRT2.3a</i> promoter. Moreover, seminal root elongation was inhibited in <i>osmads57</i> mutants, which may be associated with higher auxin levels in and auxin polar transport to root tips of mutant plants. Taken together, these results suggest that OsMADS57 has a role in regulating nitrate translocation from root to shoot via OsNRT2.3a.</p>

CALMODULIN-BINDING TRANSCRIPTION ACTIVATOR 6: A Key Regulator of Na<sup>+</sup> Homeostasis during Germination
<p>Salinity impairs seed germination and seedling establishment. We investigated the role of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) CALMODULIN-BINDING TRANSCRIPTION ACTIVATOR 6 (CAMTA6) in salinity stress responses during early germination. Compared with the wild type, the <i>camta6-4</i> and <i>camta6-5</i> mutants were more tolerant to NaCl and abscisic acid (ABA) and accumulated less Na<sup>+</sup>. In contrast, 4- to 11-d-old <i>camta6</i> seedlings were more sensitive to NaCl. In <i>camta6</i>, expression of <i>HIGH-AFFINITY K<sup>+</sup> TRANSPORTER1</i> (<i>AtHKT1;1</i>), encoding an Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> transporter, was restricted to the radicles and was not enhanced by NaCl or ABA. During germination, the <i>camta6 hkt1</i> double mutant was as sensitive as the wild type and <i>hkt1</i> to NaCl, suggesting that HKT1;1 is crucial for the salt tolerance of <i>camta6</i>. An ABA response element in the <i>HKT1;1</i> promoter was found to be indispensable for the enhanced expression of the gene in response to NaCl and to ABA. Transcriptome analysis of the wild type and <i>camta6-5</i> with and without salt treatment revealed 1,020 up-regulated and 1,467 down-regulated salt-responsive genes in the wild type. Among these, 638 up-regulated and 1,242 down-regulated genes were classified as CAMTA6-dependent. Expression of several known salt stress-associated genes, including <i>SALT OVERLY SENSITIVE1</i> and <i>Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> ANTIPORTER</i>, was impaired in <i>camta6</i> mutants. Bioinformatics analysis of the 5′ upstream sequences of the salt-responsive CAMTA6-dependent up-regulated genes revealed the CACGTGTC motif as the most prominent element, representing an ABA response element and a potential CAMTA-binding site. We suggest that CAMTA6 regulates, directly or indirectly, the expression of most of the salt-responsive genes in germinating seeds, including genes that are crucial for Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis and salt stress tolerance.</p>

The Wheat <i>Lr67</i> Gene from the Sugar Transport Protein 13 Family Confers Multipathogen Resistance in Barley
<p>Fungal pathogens are a major constraint to global crop production; hence, plant genes encoding pathogen resistance are important tools for combating disease. A few resistance genes identified to date provide partial, durable resistance to multiple pathogens and the wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) Lr67 hexose transporter variant (Lr67res) fits into this category. Two amino acids differ between the wild-type and resistant alleles – G144R and V387L. Exome sequence data from 267 barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) landraces and wild accessions was screened and neither of the Lr67res mutations was detected. The barley ortholog of Lr67, HvSTP13, was functionally characterized in yeast as a high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity hexose transporter. The G144R mutation was introduced into HvSTP13 and abolished Glc uptake, whereas the V387L mutation reduced Glc uptake by ∼ 50%. Glc transport by HvSTP13 heterologously expressed in yeast was reduced when coexpressed with <i>Lr67res</i>. Stable transgenic <i>Lr67res</i> barley lines exhibited seedling resistance to the barley-specific pathogens <i>Puccinia hordei</i> and <i>Blumeria graminis</i> f. sp. <i>hordei</i>, which cause leaf rust and powdery mildew, respectively. Barley plants expressing <i>Lr67res</i> exhibited early senescence and higher pathogenesis-related (<i>PR</i>) gene expression. Unlike previous observations implicating flavonoids in the resistance of transgenic sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>) expressing <i>Lr34res</i>, another wheat multipathogen resistance gene, barley flavonoids are unlikely to have a role in Lr67res-mediated resistance. Similar to observations made in yeast, Lr67res reduced Glc uptake <i>in planta</i>. These results confirm that the pathway by which <i>Lr67res</i> confers resistance to fungal pathogens is conserved between wheat and barley.</p>

Differential Roles of the Thylakoid Lumenal Deg Protease Homologs in Chloroplast Proteostasis<xref><sup>,2</sup></xref>
<p>Deg proteases are involved in protein quality control in prokaryotes. Of the three Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) homologs, Deg1, Deg5, and Deg8, located in the thylakoid lumen, Deg1 forms a homohexamer, whereas Deg5 and Deg8 form a heterocomplex. Both Deg1 and Deg5-Deg8 were shown separately to degrade photosynthetic proteins during photoinhibition. To investigate whether Deg1 and Deg5-Deg8 are redundant, a full set of Arabidopsis <i>Deg</i> knockout mutants were generated and their phenotypes were compared. Under all conditions tested, <i>deg1</i> mutants were affected more than the wild type and <i>deg5</i> and <i>deg8</i> mutants. Moreover, overexpression of Deg5-Deg8 could only partially compensate for the loss of Deg1. Comparative proteomics of <i>deg1</i> mutants revealed moderate up-regulation of thylakoid proteins involved in photoprotection, assembly, repair, and housekeeping and down-regulation of those that form photosynthetic complexes. Quantification of protein levels in the wild type revealed that Deg1 was 2-fold more abundant than Deg5-Deg8. Moreover, recombinant Deg1 displayed higher in vitro proteolytic activity. Affinity enrichment assays revealed that Deg1 was precipitated with very few interacting proteins, whereas Deg5-Deg8 was associated with a number of thylakoid proteins, including D1, OECs, LHCBs, Cyt <i>b</i><sub>6</sub><i>f</i>, and NDH subunits, thus implying that Deg5-Deg8 is capable of binding substrates but is unable to degrade them efficiently. This work suggests that differences in protein abundance and proteolytic activity underlie the differential importance of Deg1 and Deg5-Deg8 protease complexes observed in vivo.</p>

Physio-Genetic Dissection of Dark-Induced Leaf Senescence and Timing Its Reversal in Barley
<p>Barley crop model was analyzed for early and late events during the dark-induced leaf senescence (DILS) as well as for deciphering critical time limit for reversal of the senescence process. Chlorophyll fluorescence vitality index Rfd was determined as the earliest parameter that correlated well with the cessation of photosynthesis prior to microautophagy symptoms, initiation of DNA degradation, and severalfold increase in the endonuclease <i>BNUC1.</i> DILS was found characterized by up-regulation of processes that enable recycling of degraded macromolecules and metabolites, including increased NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> remobilization, gluconeogenesis, glycolysis, and partial up-regulation of glyoxylate and tricarboxylate acid cycles. The most evident differences in gene medleys between DILS and developmental senescence included hormone-activated signaling pathways, lipid catabolic processes, carbohydrate metabolic processes, low-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity ammonia remobilization, and RNA methylation. The mega-autophagy symptoms were apparent much later, specifically on day 10 of DILS, when disruption of organelles—nucleus and mitochondria —became evident. Also, during this latter-stage programmed cell death processes, namely, shrinking of the protoplast, tonoplast interruption, and vacuole breakdown, chromatin condensation, more DNA fragmentation, and disintegration of the cell membrane were prominent. Reversal of DILS by re-exposure of the plants from dark to light was possible until but not later than day 7 of dark exposure and was accompanied by regained photosynthesis, increase in chlorophyll, and reversal of Rfd, despite activation of macro-autophagy-related genes.</p>

Protein Carbonylation and Glycation in Legume Nodules
<p>Nitrogen fixation is an agronomically and environmentally important process catalyzed by bacterial nitrogenase within legume root nodules. These unique symbiotic organs have high metabolic rates and produce large amounts of reactive oxygen species that may modify proteins irreversibly. Here, we examined two types of oxidative posttranslational modifications of nodule proteins: carbonylation, which occurs by direct oxidation of certain amino acids or by interaction with reactive aldehydes arising from cell membrane lipid peroxides; and glycation, which results from the reaction of lysine and arginine residues with reducing sugars or their autooxidation products. We used a strategy based on the enrichment of carbonylated peptides by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity chromatography followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify 369 oxidized proteins in bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>) nodules. Of these, 238 corresponded to plant proteins and 131 to bacterial proteins. Lipid peroxidation products induced most carbonylation sites. This study also revealed that carbonylation has major effects on two key nodule proteins. Metal-catalyzed oxidation caused the inactivation of malate dehydrogenase and the aggregation of leghemoglobin. In addition, numerous glycated proteins were identified in vivo, including three key nodule proteins: sucrose synthase, glutamine synthetase, and glutamate synthase. Label-free quantification identified 10 plant proteins and 18 bacterial proteins as age-specifically glycated. Overall, our results suggest that the selective carbonylation or glycation of crucial proteins involved in nitrogen metabolism, transcriptional regulation, and signaling may constitute a mechanism to control cell metabolism and nodule senescence.</p>

The Extra-Pathway Interactome of the TCA Cycle: Expected and Unexpected Metabolic Interactions
<p>The plant tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle provides essential precursors for respiration, amino acid biosynthesis, and general nitrogen metabolism; moreover, it is closely involved in biotic stress responses and cellular redox homeostasis. To further understand the in vivo function of the TCA cycle enzymes, we combined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity purification with proteomics to generate a comprehensive extra-pathway protein-protein interaction network of the plant TCA cycle. We identified 125 extra-pathway interactions in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mostly related to the mitochondrial electron transport complex/ATP synthesis and amino acid metabolism but also to proteins associated with redox stress. We chose three high-scoring and two low-scoring interactions for complementary bimolecular fluorescence complementation and yeast two-hybrid assays, which highlighted the reliability of our approach, supported the intimate involvement of TCA cycle enzymes within many biological processes, and reflected metabolic changes reported previously for the corresponding mutant lines. To analyze the function of a subset of these interactions, we selected two mutants of mitochondrial glutaredoxin S15 and Amidase, which have not yet been analyzed with respect to their TCA cycle function, and performed metabolite profiling and flux analysis. Consistent with their interactions identified in this study, TCA cycle metabolites and the relative TCA flux of the two mutants were altered significantly.</p>

ALY RNA-Binding Proteins Are Required for Nucleocytosolic mRNA Transport and Modulate Plant Growth and Development
<p>The regulated transport of mRNAs from the cell nucleus to the cytosol is a critical step linking transcript synthesis and processing with translation. However, in plants, only a few of the factors that act in the mRNA export pathway have been functionally characterized. Flowering plant genomes encode several members of the ALY protein family, which function as mRNA export factors in other organisms. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) ALY1 to ALY4 are commonly detected in root and leaf cells, but they are differentially expressed in reproductive tissue. Moreover, the subnuclear distribution of ALY1/2 differs from that of ALY3/4. ALY1 binds with higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity to single-stranded RNA than double-stranded RNA and single-stranded DNA and interacts preferentially with 5-methylcytosine-modified single-stranded RNA. Compared with the full-length protein, the individual RNA recognition motif of ALY1 binds RNA only weakly. ALY proteins interact with the RNA helicase UAP56, indicating a link to the mRNA export machinery. Consistently, ALY1 complements the lethal phenotype of yeast cells lacking the ALY1 ortholog Yra1. Whereas individual <i>aly</i> mutants have a wild-type appearance, disruption of <i>ALY1</i> to <i>ALY4</i> in <i>4xaly</i> plants causes vegetative and reproductive defects, including strongly reduced growth, altered flower morphology, as well as abnormal ovules and female gametophytes, causing reduced seed production. Moreover, polyadenylated mRNAs accumulate in the nuclei of <i>4xaly</i> cells. Our results highlight the requirement of efficient mRNA nucleocytosolic transport for proper plant growth and development and indicate that ALY1 to ALY4 act partly redundantly in this process; however, differences in expression and subnuclear localization suggest distinct functions.</p>

The SlCBL10 Calcineurin B-Like Protein Ensures Plant Growth under Salt Stress by Regulating Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> Homeostasis<sup>1</sup>
<p>Characterization of a new tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) T-DNA mutant allowed for the isolation of the <i>CALCINEURIN B-LIKE PROTEIN 10</i> (<i>SlCBL10</i>) gene whose lack of function was responsible for the severe alterations observed in the shoot apex and reproductive organs under salinity conditions. Physiological studies proved that <i>SlCBL10</i> gene is required to maintain a proper low Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> ratio in growing tissues allowing tomato growth under salt stress. Expression analysis of the main responsible genes for Na<sup>+</sup> compartmentalization (i.e. <i>Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> EXCHANGERs</i>, <i>SALT OVERLY SENSITIVE</i>, <i>HIGH-AFFINITY K+ TRANSPORTER 1;2</i>, <i>H<sup>+</sup>-pyrophosphatase AVP1</i> [<i>SlAVP1</i>] and V-ATPase [<i>SlVHA-A1</i>]) supported a reduced capacity to accumulate Na<sup>+</sup> in <i>Slcbl10</i> mutant leaves, which resulted in a lower uploading of Na<sup>+</sup> from xylem, allowing the toxic ion to reach apex and flowers. Likewise, the tomato <i>CATION EXCHANGER 1</i> and <i>TWO-PORE CHANNEL 1</i> (<i>SlTPC1</i>), key genes for Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluxes to the vacuole, showed abnormal expression in <i>Slcbl10</i> plants indicating an impaired Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from vacuole. Additionally, complementation assay revealed that <i>SlCBL10</i> is a true ortholog of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>CBL10</i> gene, supporting that the essential function of CBL10 is conserved in Arabidopsis and tomato. Together, the findings obtained in this study provide new insights into the function of <i>SlCBL10</i> in salt stress tolerance. Thus, it is proposed that SlCBL10 mediates salt tolerance by regulating Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluxes in the vacuole, cooperating with the vacuolar cation channel <i>SlTPC1</i> and the two vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-pumps, <i>SlAVP1</i> and <i>SlVHA-A1</i>, which in turn are revealed as potential targets of <i>SlCBL10</i>.</p>

<p>Xylan is tightly associated with cellulose and lignin in secondary plant cell walls, contributing to its rigidity and structural integrity in vascular plants. However, the molecular features and the nanoscale forces that control the interactions among cellulose microfibrils, hemicelluloses, and lignin are still not well understood. Here, we combine comprehensive mass spectrometric glycan sequencing and molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the substitution pattern in softwood xylans and to investigate the effect of distinct intramolecular motifs on xylan conformation and on the interaction with cellulose surfaces in Norway spruce (<i>Picea abies</i>). We confirm the presence of motifs with evenly spaced glycosyl decorations on the xylan backbone, together with minor motifs with consecutive glucuronation. These domains are differently enriched in xylan fractions extracted by alkali and subcritical water, which indicates their preferential positioning in the secondary plant cell wall ultrastructure. The flexibility of the 3-fold screw conformation of xylan in solution is enhanced by the presence of arabinofuranosyl decorations. Additionally, molecular dynamic simulations suggest that the glycosyl substitutions in xylan are not only sterically tolerated by the cellulose surfaces but that they increase the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity for cellulose and favor the stabilization of the 2-fold screw conformation. This effect is more significant for the hydrophobic surface compared with the hydrophilic ones, which demonstrates the importance of nonpolar driving forces on the structural integrity of secondary plant cell walls. These novel molecular insights contribute to an improved understanding of the supramolecular architecture of plant secondary cell walls and have fundamental implications for overcoming lignocellulose recalcitrance and for the design of advanced wood-based materials.</p>

Autophosphorylation Affects Substrate-Binding Affinity of Tobacco Ca<sup>2+</sup>-Dependent Protein Kinase1
<p>Protein kinases regulate diverse physiological processes. Because many kinases preserve inherent autophosphorylation capability, autophosphorylation appears to be one of the most important mechanisms for cellular signaling. However, physiological functions of autophosphorylation are still largely unknown, other than the self-activation by phosphorylation of activation loop in the catalytic domain. REPRESSION OF SHOOT GROWTH (RSG) is the transcription factor involved in gibberellin (GA) feedback regulation. The tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein kinase, NtCDPK1, phosphorylates RSG, resulting in the negative regulation of RSG. NtCDPK1 was previously shown to be autophosphorylated in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner. Here, we investigated the functional importance of autophosphorylation in NtCDPK1. Ser-6 and Thr-21 were identified as autophosphorylation sites of NtCDPK1. Autophosphorylation not only reduced the binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity of NtCDPK1 for RSG, but also inhibited the homodimerization of NtCDPK1. Furthermore, autophosphorylation decreased the phosphorylation efficiency of RSG yet increased that of myelin basic protein. Ser-6 and Thr-21 of NtCDPK1 were phosphorylated in response to GAs in plants. The substitution of these autophosphorylation sites with Ala enhanced the NtCDPK1 overexpression-induced sensitization of seeds to a GA biosynthetic inhibitor during germination. These results suggest new functions of autophosphorylation in CDPKs, namely, autophosphorylation can prevent the excessive phosphorylation of substrates and alter the substrate preference of CDPKs.</p>

LIL3, a Light-Harvesting Complex Protein, Links Terpenoid and Tetrapyrrole Biosynthesis in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>The LIL3 protein of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) belongs to the light-harvesting complex (LHC) protein family, which also includes the light-harvesting chlorophyll-binding proteins of photosystems I and II, the early-light-inducible proteins, PsbS involved in nonphotochemical quenching, and the one-helix proteins and their cyanobacterial homologs designated high-light-inducible proteins. Each member of this family is characterized by one or two LHC transmembrane domains (referred to as the LHC motif) to which potential functions such as chlorophyll binding, protein interaction, and integration of interacting partners into the plastid membranes have been attributed. Initially, LIL3 was shown to interact with geranylgeranyl reductase (CHLP), an enzyme of terpene biosynthesis that supplies the hydrocarbon chain for chlorophyll and tocopherol. Here, we show another function of LIL3 for the stability of protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR). Multiple protein-protein interaction analyses suggest the direct physical interaction of LIL3 with POR but not with chlorophyll synthase. Consistently, LIL3-deficient plants exhibit substantial loss of POR as well as CHLP, which is not due to defective transcription of the POR and CHLP genes but to the posttranslational modification of their protein products. Interestingly, in vitro biochemical analyses provide novel evidence that LIL3 shows high binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity to protochlorophyllide, the substrate of POR. Taken together, this study suggests a critical role for LIL3 in the organization of later steps in chlorophyll biosynthesis. We suggest that LIL3 associates with POR and CHLP and thus contributes to the supply of the two metabolites, chlorophyllide and phytyl pyrophosphate, required for the final step in chlorophyll <i>a</i> synthesis.</p>

Salicylic Acid-Dependent Plant Stress Signaling via Mitochondrial Succinate Dehydrogenase
<p>Mitochondria are known for their role in ATP production and generation of reactive oxygen species, but little is known about the mechanism of their early involvement in plant stress signaling. The role of mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) in salicylic acid (SA) signaling was analyzed using two mutants: <i>disrupted in stress response1</i> (<i>dsr1</i>), which is a point mutation in SDH1 identified in a loss of SA signaling screen, and a knockdown mutant (<i>sdhaf2</i>) for SDH assembly factor 2 that is required for FAD insertion into SDH1. Both mutants showed strongly decreased SA-inducible stress promoter responses and low SDH maximum capacity compared to wild type, while <i>dsr1</i> also showed low succinate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity, low catalytic efficiency, and increased resistance to SDH competitive inhibitors. The SA-induced promoter responses could be partially rescued in <i>sdhaf2</i>, but not in <i>dsr1</i>, by supplementing the plant growth media with succinate. Kinetic characterization showed that low concentrations of either SA or ubiquinone binding site inhibitors increased SDH activity and induced mitochondrial H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production. Both <i>dsr1</i> and <i>sdhaf2</i> showed lower rates of SA-dependent H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production in vitro in line with their low SA-dependent stress signaling responses in vivo. This provides quantitative and kinetic evidence that SA acts at or near the ubiquinone binding site of SDH to stimulate activity and contributes to plant stress signaling by increased rates of mitochondrial H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production, leading to part of the SA-dependent transcriptional response in plant cells.</p>

Structural and Biochemical Characterization of Cinnamoyl-CoA Reductases
<p>Cinnamoyl-coenzyme A reductase (CCR) catalyzes the reduction of hydroxycinnamoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) esters using NADPH to produce hydroxycinnamyl aldehyde precursors in lignin synthesis. The catalytic mechanism and substrate specificity of cinnamoyl-CoA reductases from sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>), a strategic plant for bioenergy production, were deduced from crystal structures, site-directed mutagenesis, and kinetic and thermodynamic analyses. Although SbCCR1 displayed higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity for caffeoyl-CoA or <i>p</i>-coumaroyl-CoA than for feruloyl-CoA, the enzyme showed significantly higher activity for the latter substrate. Through molecular docking and comparisons between the crystal structures of the <i>Vitis vinifera</i> dihydroflavonol reductase and SbCCR1, residues threonine-154 and tyrosine-310 were pinpointed as being involved in binding CoA-conjugated phenylpropanoids. Threonine-154 of SbCCR1 and other CCRs likely confers strong substrate specificity for feruloyl-CoA over other cinnamoyl-CoA thioesters, and the T154Y mutation in SbCCR1 led to broader substrate specificity and faster turnover. Through data mining using our structural and biochemical information, four additional putative <i>CCR</i> genes were discovered from sorghum genomic data. One of these, SbCCR2, displayed greater activity toward <i>p</i>-coumaroyl-CoA than did SbCCR1, which could imply a role in the synthesis of defense-related lignin. Taken together, these findings provide knowledge about critical residues and substrate preference among CCRs and provide, to our knowledge, the first three-dimensional structure information for a CCR from a monocot species.</p>

CNGC2 Is a Ca<sup>2+</sup> Influx Channel That Prevents Accumulation of Apoplastic Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the Leaf
<p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> is absorbed by roots and transported upward through the xylem to the apoplastic space of the leaf, after which it is deposited into the leaf cell. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the tonoplast-localized Ca<sup>2+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> transporters CATION EXCHANGER1 (CAX1) and CAX3 sequester Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the cytosol into the vacuole, but it is not known what transporter mediates the initial Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx from the apoplast to the cytosol. Here, we report that Arabidopsis <i>CYCLIC NUCLEOTIDE-GATED CHANNEL2</i> (<i>CNGC2</i>) encodes a protein with Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx channel activity and is expressed in the leaf areas surrounding the free endings of minor veins, which is the primary site for Ca<sup>2+</sup> unloading from the vasculature and influx into leaf cells. Under hydroponic growth conditions, with 0.1 m<sc>m</sc> Ca<sup>2+</sup>, both Arabidopsis <i>cngc2</i> and <i>cax1cax3</i> loss-of-function mutants grew normally. Increasing the Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration to 10 m<sc>m</sc> induced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation, cell death, and leaf senescence and partially suppressed the hypersensitive response to avirulent pathogens in the mutants but not in the wild type. In vivo apoplastic Ca<sup>2+</sup> overaccumulation was found in the leaves of <i>cngc2</i> and <i>cax1cax</i>3 but not the wild type under the 10 m<sc>m</sc> Ca<sup>2+</sup> condition, as monitored by Oregon Green BAPTA 488 5N, a low-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity and membrane-impermeable Ca<sup>2+</sup> probe. Our results indicate that CNGC2 likely has no direct roles in leaf development or the hypersensitive response but, instead, that CNGC2 could mediate Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into leaf cells. Finally, the in vivo extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging method developed in this study provides a new tool for investigating Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in plant cells.</p>

Connecting the Sequence-Space of Bacterial Signaling Proteins to Phenotypes Using Coevolutionary Landscapes
<p>Two-component signaling (TCS) is the primary means by which bacteria sense and respond to the environment. TCS involves two partner proteins working in tandem, which interact to perform cellular functions whereas limiting interactions with non-partners (i.e., cross-talk). We construct a Potts model for TCS that can quantitatively predict how mutating amino acid identities affect the interaction between TCS partners and non-partners. The parameters of this model are inferred directly from protein sequence data. This approach drastically reduces the computational complexity of exploring the sequence-space of TCS proteins. As a stringent test, we compare its predictions to a recent comprehensive mutational study, which characterized the functionality of 20<sup>4</sup> mutational variants of the PhoQ kinase in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. We find that our best predictions accurately reproduce the amino acid combinations found in experiment, which enable functional signaling with its partner PhoP. These predictions demonstrate the evolutionary pressure to preserve the interaction between TCS partners as well as prevent unwanted cross-talk. Further, we calculate the mutational change in the binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity between PhoQ and PhoP, providing an estimate to the amount of destabilization needed to disrupt TCS.</p>

Evolutionary History of the Nesophontidae, the Last Unplaced Recent Mammal Family
<p>The mammalian evolutionary tree has lost several major clades through recent human-caused extinctions. This process of historical biodiversity loss has particularly affected tropical island regions such as the Caribbean, an area of great evolutionary diversification but poor molecular preservation. The most enigmatic of the recently extinct endemic Caribbean mammals are the Nesophontidae, a family of morphologically plesiomorphic lipotyphlan insectivores with no consensus on their evolutionary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ities, and which constitute the only major recent mammal clade to lack any molecular information on their phylogenetic placement. Here, we use a palaeogenomic approach to place Nesophontidae within the phylogeny of recent Lipotyphla. We recovered the near-complete mitochondrial genome and sequences for 17 nuclear genes from a ∼750-year-old Hispaniolan <i>Nesophontes</i> specimen, and identify a divergence from their closest living relatives, the Solenodontidae, more than 40 million years ago. Nesophontidae is thus an older distinct lineage than many extant mammalian orders, highlighting not only the role of island systems as “museums” of diversity that preserve ancient lineages, but also the major human-caused loss of evolutionary history.</p>

Regulation of succinate-fuelled mitochondrial respiration in liver and skeletal muscle of hibernating thirteen-lined ground squirrels
<p>Hibernating ground squirrels (<i>Ictidomys tridecemlineatus</i>) alternate between two distinct metabolic states throughout winter: torpor, during which metabolic rate (MR) and body temperature (<i>T</i><sub>b</sub>) are considerably suppressed, and interbout euthermia (IBE), during which MR and <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> briefly return to euthermic levels. Previous studies showed suppression of succinate-fuelled respiration during torpor in liver and skeletal muscle mitochondria; however, these studies used only a single, saturating succinate concentration. Therefore, they could not address whether mitochondrial metabolic suppression occurs under physiological substrate concentrations or whether differences in the kinetics of mitochondrial responses to changing substrate concentration might also contribute to mitochondrial metabolic regulation during torpor. The present study confirmed that succinate oxidation is reduced during torpor in liver and skeletal muscle at 37 and 10°C over a 100-fold range of succinate concentrations. At 37°C, this suppression resulted from inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), which had a greater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">affin</span></strong>ity for oxaloacetate (an SDH inhibitor) during torpor. At 10°C, SDH was not inhibited, suggesting that SDH inhibition initiates but does not maintain mitochondrial suppression during torpor. Moreover, in both liver and skeletal muscle, mitochondria from torpid animals maintained relatively higher respiration rates at low succinate concentrations, which reduces the extent of energy savings that can be achieved during torpor, but may also maintain mitochondrial oxidative capacity above some lower critical threshold, thereby preventing cellular and/or mitochondrial injury during torpor and facilitating rapid recruitment of oxidative capacity during arousal.</p>

Impact of Practice-Based Management of Pulmonary Artery Pressures in 2000 Patients Implanted With the CardioMEMS Sensor
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Elevated pulmonary artery (PA) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>es in patients with heart failure are associated with a high risk for hospitalization and mortality. Recent clinical trial evidence demonstrated a direct relationship between lowering remotely monitored PA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>es and heart failure hospitalization risk reduction with a novel implantable PA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e monitoring system (CardioMEMS HF System, St. Jude Medical). This study examines PA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e changes in the first 2000 US patients implanted in general practice use.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Deidentified data from the remote monitoring Merlin.net (St. Jude Medical) database were used to examine PA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e trends from the first consecutive 2000 patients with at least 6 months of follow-up. Changes in PA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>es were evaluated with an area under the curve methodology to estimate the total sum increase or decrease in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>es (mm Hg-day) during the follow-up period relative to the baseline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e. As a reference, the PA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e trends were compared with the historic CHAMPION clinical trial (CardioMEMS Heart Sensor Allows Monitoring of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e to Improve Outcomes in New York Heart Association [NYHA] Functional Class III Heart Failure Patients). The area under the curve results are presented as mean±2 SE, and <i>P</i> values comparing the area under the curve of the general-use cohort with outcomes in the CHAMPION trial were computed by the <i>t</i> test with equal variance.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Patients were on average 70±12 years old; 60% were male; 34% had preserved ejection fraction; and patients were followed up for an average of 333±125 days. At implantation, the mean PA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e for the general-use patients was 34.9±10.2 mm Hg compared with 31.3±10.9 mm Hg for CHAMPION treatment and 32.0±10.5 mm Hg for CHAMPION control groups. The general-use patients had an area under the curve of −32.8 mm Hg-day at the 1-month time mark, −156.2 mm Hg-day at the 3-month time mark, and −434.0 mm Hg-day after 6 months of hemodynamic guided care, which was significantly lower than the treatment group in the CHAMPION trial. Patients consistently transmitted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e information with a median of 1.27 days between transmissions after 6 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The first 2000 general-use patients managed with hemodynamic-guided heart failure care had higher PA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>es at baseline and experienced greater reduction in PA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e over time compared with the pivotal CHAMPION clinical trial. These data demonstrate that general use of implantable hemodynamic technology in a nontrial setting leads to significant lowering of PA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>es.</p></sec>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
F-Actin Mediated Focusing of Vesicles at the Cell Tip Is Essential for Polarized Growth
<p>F-actin has been shown to be essential for tip growth in an array of plant models, including <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. One hypothesis is that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion can transport secretory vesicles, while actin plays a regulatory role during secretion. Alternatively, it is possible that actin-based transport is necessary to overcome vesicle transport limitations to sustain secretion. Therefore, a quantitative analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion, secretion kinetics, and cell geometry is necessary to clarify the role of actin in polarized growth. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis, we first show that secretory vesicles move toward and accumulate at the tip in an actin-dependent manner. We then depolymerized F-actin to decouple vesicle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion from actin-mediated transport and measured the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion coefficient and concentration of vesicles. Using these values, we constructed a theoretical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-based model for growth, demonstrating that with fast-enough vesicle fusion kinetics, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion could support normal cell growth rates. We further refined our model to explore how experimentally extrapolated vesicle fusion kinetics and the size of the secretion zone limit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-based growth. This model predicts that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-mediated growth is dependent on the size of the region of exocytosis at the tip and that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-based growth would be significantly slower than normal cell growth. To further explore the size of the secretion zone, we used a cell wall degradation enzyme cocktail and determined that the secretion zone is smaller than 6 μm in diameter at the tip. Taken together, our results highlight the requirement for active transport in polarized growth and provide important insight into vesicle secretion during tip growth.</p>

Day-to-Day Blood Pressure Variability and Risk of Dementia in a General Japanese Elderly Population
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Several observational studies have reported that higher visit-to-visit blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e variability is a risk factor for cognitive impairment and dementia. However, no studies have investigated the association of day-to-day blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e variability assessed by home blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e measurement with the development of dementia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A total of 1674 community-dwelling Japanese elderly without dementia, ≥60 years of age, were followed up for 5 years (2007–2012).

These associations remained unchanged after adjustment for potential confounding factors, including home SBP. Compared with subjects in the first quartile of CoV levels of home SBP, the risks of the development of all-cause dementia, VaD, and AD were significantly higher in those in the fourth quartile (hazard ratio=2.27, 95% confidence interval=1.45–3.55, <i>P</i><0.001 for all-cause dementia; hazard ratio=2.79, 95% confidence interval=1.04–7.51, <i>P</i>=0.03 for VaD; hazard ratio=2.22, 95% confidence interval=1.31–3.75, <i>P</i><0.001 for AD).

Recovery from N Deprivation Is a Transcriptionally and Functionally Distinct State in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>
<p>Facing adverse conditions such as nitrogen (N) deprivation, microalgae enter cellular quiescence, a reversible cell cycle arrest with drastic changes in metabolism allowing cells to remain viable. Recovering from N deprivation and quiescence is an active and orderly process as we are showing here for <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>. We conducted comparative transcriptomics on this alga to discern processes relevant to quiescence in the context of N deprivation and recovery following refeeding. A mutant with slow recovery from N deprivation, <i>compromised hydrolysis of triacylglycerols7</i> (<i>cht7</i>), was included to better define the regulatory processes governing the respective transitions. We identified an ordered set of biological processes with expression patterns that showed sequential reversal following N resupply and uncovered acclimation responses specific to the recovery phase. Biochemical assays and microscopy validated selected inferences made based on the transcriptional analyses. These comprise (1) the restoration of N source preference and cellular bioenergetics during the early stage of recovery; (2) flagellum-based motility in the mid to late stage of recovery; and (3) recovery phase-specific gene groups cooperating in the rapid replenishment of chloroplast proteins. In the <i>cht7</i> mutant, a large number of programmed responses failed to readjust in a timely manner. Finally, evidence is provided for the involvement of the cAMP-protein kinase A pathway in gating the recovery. We conclude that the recovery from N deprivation represents not simply a reversal of processes directly following N deprivation, but a distinct cellular state.</p>

Excess Diffuse Light Absorption in Upper Mesophyll Limits CO<sub>2</sub> Drawdown and Depresses Photosynthesis
<p>In agricultural and natural systems, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e light can enhance plant primary productivity due to deeper penetration into and greater irradiance of the entire canopy. However, for individual sun-grown leaves from three species, photosynthesis is actually less efficient under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e compared with direct light. Despite its potential impact on canopy-level productivity, the mechanism for this leaf-level <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e light photosynthetic depression effect is unknown. Here, we investigate if the spatial distribution of light absorption relative to electron transport capacity in sun- and shade-grown sunflower (<i>Helianthus annuus</i>) leaves underlies its previously observed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e light photosynthetic depression. Using a new one-dimensional porous medium finite element gas-exchange model parameterized with light absorption profiles, we found that weaker penetration of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e versus direct light into the mesophyll of sun-grown sunflower leaves led to a more heterogenous saturation of electron transport capacity and lowered its CO<sub>2</sub> concentration drawdown capacity in the intercellular airspace and chloroplast stroma. This decoupling of light availability from photosynthetic capacity under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e light is sufficient to generate an 11% decline in photosynthesis in sun-grown but not shade-grown leaves, primarily because thin shade-grown leaves similarly distribute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e and direct light throughout the mesophyll. Finally, we illustrate how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e light photosynthetic depression could overcome enhancement in canopies with low light extinction coefficients and/or leaf area, pointing toward a novel direction for future research.</p>

Periodic heartbeat reversals cause cardiogenic inspiration and expiration with coupled spiracle leakage in resting blowflies, <i>Calliphora vicina</i>
<p>Respiration in insects is thought to be independent of the circulatory system because insects typically lack respiratory pigments and because oxygen transport occurs in the gaseous phase through a ramified tracheal system by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion and convection directly to the tissues. In the blowfly, as in other insects with periodic heartbeat reversal, the haemolymph is periodically shifted between the anterior body and abdomen, exerting alternating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e changes on the compliant tracheae in the thorax and in the abdomen. Simultaneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e and O<sub>2</sub> optode measurements show that, during negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e periods, the tracheal partial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e of oxygen (<i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>) increases by 0.5 kPa. In the quiescent fly, tracheal <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> is rather high (17.5–18.9 kPa), although the thoracic spiracles remain constricted. Microscopic video recordings and reflectance measurements revealed that the dorsal soft edges of the valve lips of the second spiracle leave a very small leak, which is passively widened during backward pulses of the heart. Thus, negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e, combined with increased leakage of the spiracle Sp2 valve enable inspiration in the thorax. The positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e periods are correlated with a new type of convective CO<sub>2</sub> micro-bursts as shown in flow-through measurements. The bulk of the CO<sub>2</sub> is, however, released after longer interbursts in macro-bursts with actively opening valves reminiscent of the open phase in a cyclic gas exchange. When the valves open, the <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> in the thoracic air sacs unexpectedly drops by a mean of 2.75±1.09 kPa, suggesting a displacement of O<sub>2</sub> by the transient accumulation of CO<sub>2</sub> in the tracheal system before its release.</p>

High-Target Versus Low-Target Blood Pressure Management During Cardiopulmonary Bypass to Prevent Cerebral Injury in Cardiac Surgery Patients
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cerebral injury is an important complication after cardiac surgery with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. The rate of overt stroke after cardiac surgery is 1% to 2%, whereas silent strokes, detected by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, are found in up to 50% of patients. It is unclear whether a higher versus a lower blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e during cardiopulmonary bypass reduces cerebral infarction in these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a patient- and assessor-blinded randomized trial, we allocated patients to a higher (70–80 mm Hg) or lower (40–50 mm Hg) target for mean arterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e by the titration of norepinephrine during cardiopulmonary bypass. Pump flow was fixed at 2.4 L·min<sup>−1</sup>·m<sup>−2</sup>. The primary outcome was the total volume of new ischemic cerebral lesions (summed in millimeters cubed), expressed as the difference between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-weighted imaging conducted preoperatively and again postoperatively between days 3 and 6. Secondary outcomes included <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-weighted imaging–evaluated total number of new ischemic lesions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among the 197 enrolled patients, mean (SD) age was 65.0 (10.7) years in the low-target group (n=99) and 69.4 (8.9) years in the high-target group (n=98).

Evidence for Hydraulic Vulnerability Segmentation and Lack of Xylem Refilling under Tension
<p>The vascular system of grapevine (<i>Vitis</i> spp.) has been reported as being highly vulnerable, even though grapevine regularly experiences seasonal drought. Consequently, stomata would remain open below water potentials that would generate a high loss of stem hydraulic conductivity via xylem embolism. This situation would necessitate daily cycles of embolism repair to restore hydraulic function. However, a more parsimonious explanation is that some hydraulic techniques are prone to artifacts in species with long vessels, leading to the overestimation of vulnerability. The aim of this study was to provide an unbiased assessment of (1) the vulnerability to drought-induced embolism in perennial and annual organs and (2) the ability to refill embolized vessels in two <i>Vitis</i> species X-ray micro-computed tomography observations of intact plants indicated that both <i>Vitis</i> <i>vinifera</i> and <i>Vitis</i> <i>riparia</i> were relatively vulnerable, with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e inducing 50% loss of stem hydraulic conductivity = −1.7 and −1.3 MPa, respectively. In <i>V. vinifera</i>, both the stem and petiole had similar sigmoidal vulnerability curves but differed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e inducing 50% loss of hydraulic conductivity (−1.7 and −1 MPa for stem and petiole, respectively). Refilling was not observed as long as bulk xylem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e remained negative (e.g. at the apical part of the plants; −0.11 ± 0.02 MPa) and change in percentage loss of conductivity was 0.02% ± 0.01%. However, positive xylem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e was observed at the basal part of the plant (0.04 ± 0.01 MPa), leading to a recovery of conductance (change in percentage loss of conductivity = −0.24% ± 0.12%). Our findings provide evidence that grapevine is unable to repair embolized xylem vessels under negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e, but its hydraulic vulnerability segmentation provides significant protection of the perennial stem.</p>

Bmal1 in Perivascular Adipose Tissue Regulates Resting-Phase Blood Pressure Through Transcriptional Regulation of Angiotensinogen
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) surrounding vessels constitutes a distinct functional integral layer of the vasculature required to preserve vascular tone under physiological conditions. However, there is little information on the relationship between PVAT and blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e regulation, including its potential contributions to circadian blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e variation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using unique brown adipocyte–specific aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like protein 1 (Bmal1) and angiotensinogen knockout mice, we determined the vasoactivity of homogenized PVAT in aortic rings and how brown adipocyte peripheral expression of Bmal1 and angiotensinogen in PVAT regulates the amplitude of diurnal change in blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e in mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We uncovered a peripheral clock in PVAT and demonstrated that loss of Bmal1 in PVAT reduces blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e in mice during the resting phase, leading to a superdipper phenotype. PVAT extracts from wild-type mice significantly induced contractility of isolated aortic rings in vitro in an endothelium-independent manner. This property was impaired in PVAT from brown adipocyte–selective Bmal1-deficient (BA-Bmal1-KO) mice. The PVAT contractile properties were mediated by local angiotensin II, operating through angiotensin II type 1 receptor–dependent signaling in the isolated vessels and linked to PVAT circadian regulation of angiotensinogen. Indeed, angiotensinogen mRNA and angiotensin II levels in PVAT of BA-Bmal1-KO mice were significantly reduced. Systemic infusion of angiotensin II, in turn, reduced Bmal1 expression in PVAT while eliminating the hypotensive phenotype during the resting phase in BA-Bmal1-KO mice. Angiotensinogen, highly expressed in PVAT, shows circadian expression in PVAT, and selective deletion of angiotensinogen in brown adipocytes recapitulates the phenotype of selective deletion of Bmal1 in brown adipocytes. Furthermore, angiotensinogen is a transcriptional target of Bmal1 in PVAT.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These data indicate that local Bmal1 in PVAT regulates angiotensinogen expression and the ensuing increase in angiotensin II, which acts on smooth muscle cells in the vessel walls to regulate vasoactivity and blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e in a circadian fashion during the resting phase. These findings will contribute to a better understanding of the cardiovascular complications of circadian disorders, alterations in the circadian dipping phenotype, and cross-talk between systemic and peripheral regulation of blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e.</p></sec>

Physiology of Angina and Its Alleviation With Nitroglycerin
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The mechanisms governing exercise-induced angina and its alleviation by the most commonly used antianginal drug, nitroglycerin, are incompletely understood. The purpose of this study was to develop a method by which the effects of antianginal drugs could be evaluated invasively during physiological exercise to gain further understanding of the clinical impact of angina and nitroglycerin.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Forty patients (mean age, 65.2±7.6 years) with exertional angina and coronary artery disease underwent cardiac catheterization via radial access and performed incremental exercise using a supine cycle ergometer. As they developed limiting angina, sublingual nitroglycerin was administered to half the patients, and all patients continued to exercise for 2 minutes at the same workload. Throughout exercise, distal coronary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e and flow velocity and central aortic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e were recorded with sensor wires.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Patients continued to exercise after nitroglycerin administration with less ST-segment depression (<i>P</i>=0.003) and therefore myocardial ischemia. Significant reductions in afterload (aortic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e, <i>P</i>=0.030) and myocardial oxygen demand were seen (tension-time index, <i>P</i>=0.024; rate-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e product, <i>P</i>=0.046), as well as an increase in myocardial oxygen supply (Buckberg index, <i>P</i>=0.017). Exercise reduced peripheral arterial wave reflection (<i>P</i><0.05), which was not further augmented by the administration of nitroglycerin (<i>P</i>=0.648). The observed increases in coronary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e gradient, stenosis resistance, and flow velocity did not reach statistical significance; however, the diastolic velocity–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e gradient relation was consistent with a significant increase in relative stenosis severity (k coefficient, <i>P</i><0.0001), in keeping with exercise-induced vasoconstriction of stenosed epicardial segments and dilatation of normal segments, with trends toward reversal with nitroglycerin.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The catheterization laboratory protocol provides a model to study myocardial ischemia and the actions of novel and established antianginal drugs.

We hypothesized that IL10 inhibits <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e overload–induced homing of BM-FPCs to the heart and their transdifferentiation to myofibroblasts and thus attenuates cardiac fibrosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e overload was induced in wild-type (WT) and IL10 knockout (IL10KO) mice by transverse aortic constriction. To determine the bone marrow origin, chimeric mice were created with enhanced green fluorescent protein WT mice marrow to the IL10KO mice. For mechanistic studies, FPCs were isolated from mouse bone marrow.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e overload enhanced BM-FPC mobilization and homing in IL10KO mice compared with WT mice. Furthermore, WT bone marrow (from enhanced green fluorescent protein mice) transplantation in bone marrow–depleted IL10KO mice (IL10KO chimeric mice) reduced transverse aortic constriction–induced BM-FPC mobilization compared with IL10KO mice. Green fluorescent protein costaining with α-smooth muscle actin or collagen 1α in left ventricular tissue sections of IL10KO chimeric mice suggests that myofibroblasts were derived from bone marrow after transverse aortic constriction. Finally, WT bone marrow transplantation in IL10KO mice inhibited transverse aortic constriction–induced cardiac fibrosis and improved heart function. At the molecular level, IL10 treatment significantly inhibited transforming growth factor-β–induced transdifferentiation and fibrotic signaling in WT BM-FPCs in vitro. Furthermore, fibrosis-associated microRNA (miRNA) expression was highly upregulated in IL10KO-FPCs compared with WT-FPCs. Polymerase chain reaction–based selective miRNA analysis revealed that transforming growth factor-β–induced enhanced expression of fibrosis-associated miRNAs (miRNA-21, -145, and -208) was significantly inhibited by IL10. Restoration of miRNA-21 levels suppressed the IL10 effects on transforming growth factor-β–induced fibrotic signaling in BM-FPCs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings suggest that IL10 inhibits BM-FPC homing and transdifferentiation to myofibroblasts in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e-overloaded myocardium. Mechanistically, we show for the first time that IL10 suppresses Smad–miRNA-21–mediated activation of BM-FPCs and thus modulates cardiac fibrosis.</p></sec>

MicroRNA-93 Controls Perfusion Recovery After Hindlimb Ischemia by Modulating Expression of Multiple Genes in the Cell Cycle Pathway
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>MicroRNAs are key regulators of gene expression in response to injury, but there is limited knowledge of their role in ischemia-induced angiogenesis, such as in peripheral arterial disease. Here, we used an unbiased strategy and took advantage of different phenotypic outcomes that follow surgically induced hindlimb ischemia between inbred mouse strains to identify key microRNAs involved in perfusion recovery from hindlimb ischemia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>From comparative microRNA profiling between inbred mouse strains that display profound differences in their extent of perfusion recovery after hindlimb ischemia, we found that the mouse strain with higher levels of microRNA-93 (miR-93) in hindlimb muscle before ischemia and the greater ability to upregulate miR-93 in response to ischemia had better perfusion recovery. In vitro, overexpression of miR-93 attenuated hypoxia-induced apoptosis in both endothelial and skeletal muscle cells and enhanced proliferation in both cell types. In addition, miR-93 overexpression enhanced endothelial cell tube formation. In vivo, miR-93 overexpression enhanced capillary density and perfusion recovery from hindlimb ischemia, and antagomirs to miR-93 attenuated perfusion recovery. Both in vitro and in vivo modulation of miR-93 resulted in alterations in the expression of >1 cell cycle pathway gene in 2 different cell types.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Our data indicate that miR-93 enhances perfusion recovery from hindlimb ischemia by modulation of multiple genes that coordinate the functional pathways of cell proliferation and apoptosis. Thus, miR-93 is a strong potential target for pharmacological modulation to promote angiogenesis in ischemic tissue.</p></sec>

Hindered cytoplasmic diffusion of inositol trisphosphate restricts its cellular range of action
<p>The range of action of intracellular messengers is determined by their rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion and degradation. Previous measurements in oocyte cytoplasmic extracts indicated that the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-liberating second messenger inositol trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>es with a coefficient (~280 μm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) similar to that in water, corresponding to a range of action of ~25 μm. Consequently, IP<sub>3</sub> is generally considered a “global” cellular messenger. We reexamined this issue by measuring local IP<sub>3</sub>-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> puffs to monitor IP<sub>3</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ing from spot photorelease in neuroblastoma cells. Fitting these data by numerical simulations yielded a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion coefficient (≤10 μm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) about 30-fold slower than that previously reported. We propose that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion of IP<sub>3</sub> in mammalian cells is hindered by binding to immobile, functionally inactive receptors that were diluted in oocyte extracts. The predicted range of action of IP<sub>3</sub> (<5 μm) is thus smaller than the size of typical mammalian cells, indicating that IP<sub>3</sub> should better be considered as a local rather than a global cellular messenger.</p>

Fluid-induced aseismic fault slip outpaces pore-fluid migration
<p>Earthquake swarms attributed to subsurface fluid injection are usually assumed to occur on faults destabilized by increased pore-fluid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>es. However, fluid injection could also activate aseismic slip, which might outpace pore-fluid migration and transmit earthquake-triggering stress changes beyond the fluid-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>ized region. We tested this theoretical prediction against data derived from fluid-injection experiments that activated and measured slow, aseismic slip on preexisting, shallow faults. We found that the pore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e and slip history imply a fault whose strength is the product of a slip-weakening friction coefficient and the local effective normal stress. Using a coupled shear-rupture model, we derived constraints on the hydromechanical parameters of the actively deforming fault. The inferred aseismic rupture front propagates faster and to larger distances than the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>ized pore fluid.</p>

Surface uplift and time-dependent seismic hazard due to fluid injection in eastern Texas
<p>Observations that unequivocally link seismicity and wastewater injection are scarce. Here we show that wastewater injection in eastern Texas causes uplift, detectable in radar interferometric data up to >8 kilometers from the wells. Using measurements of uplift, reported injection data, and a poroelastic model, we computed the crustal strain and pore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e. We infer that an increase of >1 megapascal in pore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e in rocks with low compressibility triggers earthquakes, including the 4.8–moment magnitude event that occurred on 17 May 2012, the largest earthquake recorded in eastern Texas. Seismic activity increased even while injection rates declined, owing to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion of pore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e from earlier periods with higher injection rates. Induced seismicity potential is suppressed where tight confining formations prevent pore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e from propagating into crystalline basement rocks.</p>

Sheet-Like Remodeling of the Transverse Tubular System in Human Heart Failure Impairs Excitation-Contraction Coupling and Functional Recovery by Mechanical Unloading
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac recovery in response to mechanical unloading by left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) has been demonstrated in subgroups of patients with chronic heart failure (HF). Hallmarks of HF are depletion and disorganization of the transverse tubular system (t-system) in cardiomyocytes. Here, we investigated remodeling of the t-system in human end-stage HF and its role in cardiac recovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Left ventricular biopsies were obtained from 5 donors and 26 patients with chronic HF undergoing implantation of LVADs. Three-dimensional confocal microscopy and computational image analysis were applied to assess t-system structure, density, and distance of ryanodine receptor clusters to the sarcolemma, including the t-system. Recovery of cardiac function in response to mechanical unloading was assessed by echocardiography during turndown of the LVAD.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The majority of HF myocytes showed remarkable t-system remodeling, particularly sheet-like invaginations of the sarcolemma. Circularity of t-system components was decreased in HF versus controls (0.37±0.01 versus 0.46±0.02; <i>P</i><0.01), and the volume/length ratio was increased in HF (0.36±0.01 versus 0.25±0.02 µm<sup>2</sup>; <i>P</i><0.0001). T-system density was reduced in HF, leading to increased ryanodine receptor–sarcolemma distances (0.96±0.05 versus 0.64±0.1 µm; <i>P</i><0.01). Low ryanodine receptor–sarcolemma distances at the time of LVAD implantation predicted high post-LVAD left ventricular ejection fractions (<i>P</i><0.01) and ejection fraction increases during unloading (<i>P</i><0.01). Ejection fraction in patients with pre-LVAD ryanodine receptor–sarcolemma distances >1 µm did not improve after mechanical unloading. In addition, calcium transients were recorded in field-stimulated isolated human cardiomyocytes and analyzed with respect to local t-system density. Calcium release in HF myocytes was restricted to regions proximal to the sarcolemma. Local calcium upstroke was delayed (23.9±4.9 versus 10.3±1.7 milliseconds; <i>P</i><0.05) and more asynchronous (18.1±1.5 versus 8.9±2.2 milliseconds; <i>P</i><0.01) in HF cells with low t-system density versus cells with high t-system density.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The t-system in end-stage human HF presents a characteristic novel phenotype consisting of sheet-like invaginations of the sarcolemma. Our results suggest that the remodeled t-system impairs excitation-contraction coupling and functional recovery during chronic LVAD unloading. An intact t-system at the time of LVAD implantation may constitute a precondition and predictor for functional cardiac recovery after mechanical unloading.</p></sec>

Above- and belowground controls on water use by trees of different wood types in an eastern US deciduous forest
<p>Stomata control tree transpiration by sensing and integrating environmental signals originating in the atmosphere and soil, and co-occurring species may differ in inherent stomatal sensitivity to these above- and belowground signals and in the types of signals to which they respond. Stomatal responsiveness to environmental signals is likely to differ across species having different types of wood (e.g., ring-porous, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e-porous and coniferous) because each wood type differs in the structure, size and spatial distribution of its xylem conduits as well as in the scaling of hydraulic properties with stem diameter. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of variation in soil water availability and atmospheric evaporative demand on stomatal regulation of transpiration in seven co-occurring temperate deciduous forest species representing three wood types. We measured whole-tree sap flux and soil and atmospheric variables in a mixed deciduous forest in central Pennsylvania over the course of a growing season characterized by severe drought and large fluctuations in atmospheric vapor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e deficit (<i>D</i>). The relative sensitivity of sap flux to soil drying was ∼2.2–2.3 times greater in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e-porous and coniferous species than in the ring-porous species. Stomata of the ring-porous oaks were only about half as responsive to increased <i>D</i> as those of trees of the other two wood types. These differences in responsiveness to changes in the below- and aboveground environment implied that regulation of leaf water potential in the ring-porous oaks was less stringent than that in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e-porous angiosperms or the conifers. The results suggest that increases in the frequency or intensity of summer droughts in the study region could have multiple consequences for forest function, including altered successional time courses or climax species composition and cumulative effects on whole-tree architecture, resulting in a structural and physiological legacy that would restrict the ability of trees to respond rapidly to more favorable growth conditions.</p>

Recovery performance in xylem hydraulic conductivity is correlated with cavitation resistance for temperate deciduous tree species
<p>Woody species hydraulically vulnerable to xylem cavitation may experience daily xylem embolism. How such species cope with the possibility of accumulated embolism is unclear. In this study, we examined seven temperate woody species to assess the hypothesis that low cavitation resistance (high vulnerability to cavitation) is compensated by high recovery performance via vessel refilling. We also evaluated leaf functional and xylem structural traits. The xylem recovery index (XRI), defined as the ratio of xylem hydraulic conductivity in plants rewatered after soil drought to that in plants under moist conditions, varied among species. The xylem water potential causing 50% loss of hydraulic conductivity (Ψ<sub>50</sub>) varied among the species studied, whereas only a slight difference was detected with respect to midday xylem water potential (Ψ<sub>min</sub>), indicating smaller hydraulic safety margins (Ψ<sub>min</sub> − Ψ<sub>50</sub>) for species more vulnerable to cavitation. Cavitation resistance (|Ψ<sub>50</sub>|) was negatively correlated with XRI across species, with cavitation-vulnerable species showing a higher performance in xylem recovery. Wood density was positively correlated with cavitation resistance and was negatively correlated with XRI. These novel results reveal that coordination exists between cavitation resistance and xylem recovery performance, in association with wood functional traits such as denser wood for cavitation-resistant xylem and less-dense but water-storable wood for refillable xylem. These findings provide insights into long-term maintenance of water transport in tree species growing under variable environmental conditions.</p>

Single-molecule diffusion-based estimation of ligand effects on G protein–coupled receptors
<p>G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) are major drug targets. Developing a method to measure the activities of GPCRs is essential for pharmacology and drug screening. However, it is difficult to measure the effects of a drug by monitoring the receptor on the cell surface; thus, changes in the concentrations of downstream signaling molecules, which depend on the signaling pathway selectivity of the receptor, are often used as an index of receptor activity. We show that single-molecule imaging analysis provides an alternative method for assessing the effects of ligands on GPCRs. Using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM), we monitored the dynamics of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion of metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 (mGluR3), a class C GPCR, under various ligand conditions. Our single-molecule tracking analysis demonstrated that increases and decreases in the average <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion coefficient of mGluR3 quantitatively reflected the ligand-dependent inactivation and activation of receptors, respectively. Through experiments with inhibitors and dual-color single-molecule imaging analysis, we found that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion of receptor molecules was altered by common physiological events associated with GPCRs, including G protein binding, and receptor accumulation in clathrin-coated pits. We also confirmed that agonist also decreased the average <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion coefficient for class A and B GPCRs, demonstrating that this parameter is a good index for estimating ligand effects on many GPCRs regardless of their phylogenetic groups, the chemical properties of the ligands, or G protein–coupling selectivity.</p>

Furthermore, we connected our artificial afferent nerve to motor nerves to construct a hybrid bioelectronic reflex arc to actuate muscles.

When early adopters don't adopt

Measurement of the small-scale structure of the intergalactic medium using close quasar pairs

We measured this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e-smoothing scale by quantifying absorption correlations in a sample of close quasar pairs.

Crohn's Disease Loci Are Common Targets of Protozoa-Driven Selection
<p>Previous studies indicated that a few risk variants for autoimmune diseases are subject to pathogen-driven selection. Nonetheless, the proportion of risk loci that has been targeted by pathogens and the type of infectious agent(s) that exerted the strongest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e remain to be evaluated. We assessed whether different pathogens exerted a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e on known Crohn's disease (CD) risk variants and demonstrate that these single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are preferential targets of protozoa-driven selection (<i>P</i> = 0.008). In particular, 19% of SNPs associated with CD have been subject to protozoa-driven selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e. Analysis of <i>P</i> values from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and meta-analyses indicated that protozoan-selected SNPs display significantly stronger association with CD compared with nonselected variants. This same behavior was not observed for GWASs of other autoimmune diseases. Thus, we integrated selection signatures and meta-analysis results to prioritize five genic SNPs for replication in an Italian cohort. Three SNPs were significantly associated with CD risk, and combination with meta-analysis results yielded <i>P</i> values < 4 × 10<sup>−6</sup>. The bona fide risk alleles are located in <i>ARHGEF2</i>, an interactor of <i>NOD2, NSF</i>, a gene involved in autophagy, and <i>HEBP1</i>, encoding a possible mediator of inflammation. Pathway analysis indicated that <i>ARHGEF2</i> and <i>NSF</i> participate in a molecular network, which also contains <i>VAMP3</i> (previously associated to CD) and is centered around miR-31 (known to be disregulated in CD). Thus, we show that protozoa-driven selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e had a major role in shaping predisposition to CD. We next used this information for the identification of three bona fide novel susceptibility loci.</p>

Simultaneous high-resolution pH and spectrophotometric recordings of oxygen binding in blood microvolumes
<p>Oxygen equilibrium curves have been widely used to understand oxygen transport in numerous organisms. A major challenge has been to monitor oxygen binding characteristics and concomitant pH changes as they occur <i>in vivo</i>, in limited sample volumes. Here we report a technique allowing highly resolved and simultaneous monitoring of pH and blood pigment saturation in minute blood volumes. We equipped a gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion chamber with a broad-range fibre-optic spectrophotometer and a micro-pH optode and recorded changes of pigment oxygenation along oxygen partial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e (<i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>) and pH gradients to test the setup. Oxygen binding parameters derived from measurements in only 15 μl of haemolymph from the cephalopod <i>Octopus vulgaris</i> showed low instrumental error (0.93%) and good agreement with published data. Broad-range spectra, each resolving 2048 data points, provided detailed insight into the complex absorbance characteristics of diverse blood types. After consideration of photobleaching and intrinsic fluorescence, pH optodes yielded accurate recordings and resolved a sigmoidal shift of 0.03 pH units in response to changing <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> from 0 to 21 kPa. Highly resolved continuous recordings along pH gradients conformed to stepwise measurements at low rates of pH changes. In this study we showed that a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion chamber upgraded with a broad-range spectrophotometer and an optical pH sensor accurately characterizes oxygen binding with minimal sample consumption and manipulation. We conclude that the modified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion chamber is highly suitable for experimental biologists who demand high flexibility, detailed insight into oxygen binding as well as experimental and biological accuracy combined in a single setup.</p>

Prognostic Value of Follow-Up Hemodynamic Variables After Initial Management in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Hemodynamic variables such as cardiac index and right atrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e have consistently been associated with survival in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) at the time of diagnosis. Recent studies have suggested that pulmonary arterial compliance may also predict prognosis in PAH. The prognostic importance of hemodynamic values achieved after treatment initiation is less well established.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Our objective was to evaluate the prognostic importance of clinical and hemodynamic variables during follow-up, including pulmonary arterial compliance, after initial management in PAH. We evaluated incident patients with idiopathic, drug- and toxin-induced, or heritable PAH enrolled in the French pulmonary hypertension registry between 2006 and 2016 who had a follow-up right-sided heart catheterization (RHC). The primary outcome was death or lung transplantation. We used stepwise Cox regression and the Kaplan-Meier method to assess variables obtained at baseline and at first follow-up RHC.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 981 patients, a primary outcome occurred in 331 patients (33.7%) over a median follow-up duration of 2.8 years (interquartile range, 1.1–4.6 years). In a multivariable model considering only baseline variables, no hemodynamic variables independently predicted prognosis. Median time to first follow-up RHC was 4.6 months (interquartile range, 3.7–7.8 months). At first follow-up RHC (n=763), New York Heart Association functional class, 6-minute walk distance, stroke volume index (SVI), and right atrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e were independently associated with death or lung transplantation, adjusted for age, sex, and type of PAH. Pulmonary arterial compliance did not independently predict outcomes at baseline or during follow-up. The adjusted hazard ratio for SVI was 1.28 (95% confidence interval, 1.11–1.49; <i>P</i><0.01) per 10-mL/m<sup>2</sup> decrease and for right atrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e was 1.05 (95% confidence interval, 1.02–1.09; <i>P</i><0.01) per 1–mm Hg increase. Among patients who had 2 (n=355) or 3 (n=193) low-risk prognostic features at follow-up, including a cardiac index ≥2.5 L·min<sup>−1</sup>·m<sup>−2</sup>, 6-minute walk distance >440 m, and New York Heart Association class I or II functional class, lower SVI was still associated with higher rates of death or lung transplantation (<i>P</i><0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>SVI and right atrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e were the hemodynamic variables that were independently associated with death or lung transplantation at first follow-up RHC after initial PAH treatment. These findings suggest that the SVI could be a more appropriate treatment target than cardiac index in PAH.</p></sec>

Phenotypic Consequences of a Genetic Predisposition to Enhanced Nitric Oxide Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Nitric oxide signaling plays a key role in the regulation of vascular tone and platelet activation. Here, we seek to understand the impact of a genetic predisposition to enhanced nitric oxide signaling on risk for cardiovascular diseases, thus informing the potential utility of pharmacological stimulation of the nitric oxide pathway as a therapeutic strategy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We analyzed the association of common and rare genetic variants in 2 genes that mediate nitric oxide signaling (Nitric Oxide Synthase 3 [<i>NOS3</i>] and Guanylate Cyclase 1, Soluble, Alpha 3 [<i>GUCY1A3</i>]) with a range of human phenotypes. We selected 2 common variants (rs3918226 in <i>NOS3</i> and rs7692387 in <i>GUCY1A3</i>) known to associate with increased <i>NOS3</i> and <i>GUCY1A3</i> expression and reduced mean arterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e, combined them into a genetic score, and standardized this exposure to a 5 mm Hg reduction in mean arterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e. Using individual-level data from 335 464 participants in the UK Biobank and summary association results from 7 large-scale genome-wide association studies, we examined the effect of this nitric oxide signaling score on cardiometabolic and other diseases. We also examined whether rare loss-of-function mutations in <i>NOS3</i> and <i>GUCY1A3</i> were associated with coronary heart disease using gene sequencing data from the Myocardial Infarction Genetics Consortium (n=27 815).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A genetic predisposition to enhanced nitric oxide signaling was associated with reduced risks of coronary heart disease (odds ratio, 0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31-0.45; <i>P</i>=5.5*10<sup>–26</sup>], peripheral arterial disease (odds ratio 0.42; 95% CI, 0.26-0.68; <i>P</i>=0.0005), and stroke (odds ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.37-0.76; <i>P</i>=0.0006). In a mediation analysis, the effect of the genetic score on decreased coronary heart disease risk extended beyond its effect on blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e. Conversely, rare variants that inactivate the <i>NOS3</i> or <i>GUCY1A3</i> genes were associated with a 23 mm Hg higher systolic blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e (95% CI, 12-34; <i>P</i>=5.6*10<sup>–5</sup>) and a 3-fold higher risk of coronary heart disease (odds ratio, 3.03; 95% CI, 1.29-7.12; <i>P</i>=0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>A genetic predisposition to enhanced nitric oxide signaling is associated with reduced risks of coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, and stroke.

Association Between Diastolic Blood Pressure During Pediatric In-Hospital Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Survival
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>On the basis of laboratory cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) investigations and limited adult data demonstrating that survival depends on attaining adequate arterial diastolic blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e (DBP) during CPR, the American Heart Association recommends using blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e to guide pediatric CPR. However, evidence-based blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e targets during pediatric CPR remain an important knowledge gap for CPR guidelines.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>All children ≥37 weeks’ gestation and <19 years old in Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network intensive care units with chest compressions for ≥1 minute and invasive arterial blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e monitoring before and during CPR between July 1, 2013, and June 31, 2016, were included. Mean DBP during CPR and Utstein-style standardized cardiac arrest data were collected. The hypothesis was that DBP ≥25 mm Hg during CPR in infants and ≥30 mm Hg in children ≥1 year old would be associated with survival. Primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. Secondary outcome was survival to hospital discharge with favorable neurological outcome, defined as Pediatric Cerebral Performance Categories 1 to 3 or no worse than prearrest baseline. Multivariable Poisson regression models with robust error estimates were used to estimate the relative risk of outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Blinded investigators analyzed blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e waveforms during CPR from 164 children, including 60% <1 year old, 60% with congenital heart disease, and 54% after cardiac surgery. The immediate cause of arrest was hypotension in 67%, respiratory decompensation in 44%, and arrhythmia in 19%. Median duration of CPR was 8 minutes (quartiles, 3 and 27 minutes). Ninety percent survived the event, 68% with return of spontaneous circulation and 22% by extracorporeal life support. Forty-seven percent survived to hospital discharge, and 43% survived to discharge with favorable neurological outcome. Maintaining mean DBP ≥25 mm Hg in infants and ≥30 mm Hg in children ≥1 year old occurred in 101 of 164 children (62%) and was associated with survival (adjusted relative risk, 1.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.2–2.6; <i>P</i>=0.007) and survival with favorable neurological outcome (adjusted relative risk, 1.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.1–2.5; <i>P</i>=0.02).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These data demonstrate that mean DBP ≥25 mm Hg during CPR in infants and ≥30 mm Hg in children ≥1 year old was associated with greater likelihood of survival to hospital discharge and survival with favorable neurological outcome.</p></sec>

J Curve in Patients Randomly Assigned to Different Systolic Blood Pressure Targets
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Low systolic blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e (SBP) values are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, giving rise to the so-called J-curve phenomenon. We assessed the association between on-treatment SBP levels, cardiovascular events, and all-cause mortality in patients randomized to different SBP targets.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data from 2 large randomized trials that randomly allocated hypertensive patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease to intensive (SBP<120 mm Hg) or conventional (SBP<140 mm Hg) treatment were pooled and harmonized for outcomes and follow-up duration. Using natural cubic splines, we plotted the hazard ratio for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events against the mean on-treatment SBP per treatment group.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The pooled data consisted of 194 875 on-treatment SBP measurements in 13 946 patients (98.9%). During a median follow-up of 3.3 years, cardiovascular events occurred in 1014 patients (7.3%), and 502 patients died (3.7%). For both blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e targets, an identical shape of the J curve was present, with a nadir for cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality just below the SBP target.

Association of Traditional Cardiovascular Risk Factors With Venous Thromboembolism

Definitions were harmonized across studies. Traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors were modeled categorically and continuously using restricted cubic splines. Estimates were obtained for overall VTE, provoked VTE (ie, VTE occurring in the presence of 1 or more established VTE risk factors), and unprovoked VTE, pulmonary embolism, and deep-vein thrombosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The studies included 244 865 participants with 4910 VTE events occurring during a mean follow-up of 4.7 to 19.7 years per study. Age, sex, and body mass index-adjusted hazard ratios for overall VTE were 0.98 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.89−1.07) for hypertension, 0.97 (95% CI: 0.88−1.08) for hyperlipidemia, 1.01 (95% CI: 0.89−1.15) for diabetes mellitus, and 1.19 (95% CI: 1.08−1.32) for current smoking. After full adjustment, these estimates were numerically similar. When modeled continuously, an inverse association was observed for systolic blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e (hazard ratio=0.79 [95% CI: 0.68−0.92] at systolic blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e 160 vs 110 mm Hg) but not for diastolic blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e or lipid measures with VTE. An important finding from VTE subtype analyses was that cigarette smoking was associated with provoked but not unprovoked VTE. Fully adjusted hazard ratios for the associations of current smoking with provoked and unprovoked VTE were 1.36 (95% CI: 1.22−1.52) and 1.08 (95% CI: 0.90−1.29), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Except for the association between cigarette smoking and provoked VTE, which is potentially mediated through comorbid conditions such as cancer, the modifiable traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors are not associated with increased VTE risk.

Detailed Echocardiographic Phenotyping in Breast Cancer Patients

The longitudinal effects of commonly used therapies, including doxorubicin and trastuzumab, on cardiac remodeling and function remain unknown in this population. We aimed to define the changes in echocardiographic parameters of structure, function, and ventricular-arterial coupling, and their associations with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and heart failure symptoms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a longitudinal prospective cohort study of 277 breast cancer participants receiving doxorubicin (Dox), trastuzumab (Tras), or both (Dox+Tras), we obtained 1249 echocardiograms over a median follow-up of 2.0 (interquartile range, 1.0–3.0) years. Left ventricular structure, diastolic and contractile function, and ventricular-arterial coupling measures were quantified in a core laboratory blinded to participant characteristics. We evaluated changes in echocardiographic parameters over time, and used repeated-measures regression models to define their association with LVEF decline and recovery. Linear regression models defined the association between early changes in these parameters and subsequent changes in LVEF and heart failure symptoms.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, 177 (64%) received Dox, 51 (18%) received Tras, and 49 (18%) received Dox+Tras. With Dox, there was a sustained, modest decrease in LVEF over the follow-up duration (1-year change in LVEF –3.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI], –4.4% to –2.8%; 3-year change –3.8%; 95% CI, –5.1% to –2.5%). With Tras, a similar LVEF decline was observed at 1 year (–4.5%; 95% CI, –6.0% to –2.9%) and 3 years (–2.8%; 95%CI, –5.3 to –0.4%). Participants receiving Dox+Tras demonstrated the greatest declines at 1 year (–6.6%; 95% CI, –8.2 to –5.0%), with partial recovery at 3 years (–2.8%; 95% CI, –4.8 to –0.8%). LVEF declines and recovery were associated primarily with changes in systolic volumes, longitudinal and circumferential strain, and ventricular-arterial coupling indices, effective arterial elastance (Ea) and the coupling ratio Ea/Ees<sub>sb</sub>, without evidence for effect modification across therapies. Early changes in volumes, strain, and Ea/Ees<sub>sb</sub> at 4 to 6 months were associated with 1- and 2-year LVEF changes. Similarly, early changes in strain and Ea were associated with worsening heart failure symptoms at 1 year.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Doxorubicin and trastuzumab resulted in modest, persistent declines in LVEF at 3 years. Changes in volumes, strain, and ventricular-arterial coupling were consistently associated with concurrent and subsequent LVEF declines and recovery across therapies.</p></sec>

Pulmonary Hyperinflation and Left Ventricular Mass

Synergistic Pectin Degradation and Guard Cell Pressurization Underlie Stomatal Pore Formation
<p>Stomatal pores are vital for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion of gasses into and out of land plants and are, therefore, gatekeepers for photosynthesis and transpiration. Although much published literature has described the intercellular signaling and transcriptional regulators involved in early stomatal development, little is known about the cellular details of the local separation between sister guard cells that give rise to the stomatal pore or how formation of this pore is achieved. Using three-dimensional (3D) time-lapse imaging, we found that stomatal pore formation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) is a highly dynamic process involving pore initiation and enlargement and traverses a set of morphological milestones in 3D. Confocal imaging data revealed an enrichment of exocytic machinery, de-methyl-esterified pectic homogalacturonan (HG), and an HG-degrading enzyme at future pore sites, suggesting that both localized HG deposition and degradation might function in pore formation. By manipulating HG modification via enzymatic, chemical, and genetic perturbations in seedling cotyledons, we found that augmenting HG modification promotes pore formation, whereas preventing HG de-methyl-esterification delays pore initiation and inhibits pore enlargement. Through mechanical modeling and experimentation, we tested whether pore formation is an outcome of sister guard cells being pulled away from each other upon turgor increase. Osmotic treatment to reduce turgor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e did not prevent pore initiation but did lessen pore enlargement. Together, these data provide evidence that HG delivery and modification, and guard cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>ization, make functional contributions to stomatal pore initiation and enlargement.</p>

Heat Shock Protein HSP101 Affects the Release of Ribosomal Protein mRNAs for Recovery after Heat Shock
<p>Heat shock (HS) is known to have a profound impact on gene expression at different levels, such as inhibition of protein synthesis, in which HS blocks translation initiation and induces the sequestration of mRNAs into stress granules (SGs) or P-bodies for storage and/or decay. SGs prevent the degradation of the stored mRNAs, which can be reengaged into translation in the recovery period. However, little is known on the mRNAs stored during the stress, how these mRNAs are released from SGs afterward, and what the functional importance is of this process. In this work, we report that Arabidopsis <i>HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN101</i> (<i>HSP101</i>) knockout mutant (<i>hsp101</i>) presented a defect in translation recovery and SG dissociation after HS. Using RNA sequencing and RNA immunoprecipitation approaches, we show that mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins (RPs) were preferentially stored during HS and that these mRNAs were released and translated in an HSP101-dependent manner during recovery. By <sup>15</sup>N incorporation and polysome profile analyses, we observed that these released mRNAs contributed to the production of new ribosomes to enhance translation. We propose that, after HS, HSP101 is required for the efficient release of RP mRNAs from SGs resulting in a rapid restoration of the translation machinery by producing new RPs.</p>

Bioorthogonal Noncanonical Amino Acid Tagging (BONCAT) Enables Time-Resolved Analysis of Protein Synthesis in Native Plant Tissue
<p>Proteomic plasticity undergirds stress responses in plants, and understanding such responses requires accurate measurement of the extent to which proteins levels are adjusted to counter external stimuli. Here, we adapt bioorthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) to interrogate protein synthesis in vegetative Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings. BONCAT relies on the translational incorporation of a noncanonical amino acid probe into cellular proteins. In this study, the probe is the Met surrogate azidohomoalanine (Aha), which carries a reactive azide moiety in its amino acid side chain. The azide handle in Aha can be selectively conjugated to dyes and functionalized beads to enable visualization and enrichment of newly synthesized proteins. We show that BONCAT is sensitive enough to detect Arabidopsis proteins synthesized within a 30-min interval defined by an Aha pulse and that the method can be used to detect proteins made under conditions of light stress, osmotic shock, salt stress, heat stress, and recovery from heat stress. We further establish that BONCAT can be coupled to tandem liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to identify and quantify proteins synthesized during heat stress and recovery from heat stress. Our results are consistent with a model in which, upon the onset of heat stress, translation is rapidly reprogrammed to enhance the synthesis of stress mitigators and is again altered during recovery. All experiments were carried out with commercially available reagents, highlighting the accessibility of the BONCAT method to researchers interested in stress responses as well as translational and posttranslational regulation in plants.</p>

Xylem Surfactants Introduce a New Element to the Cohesion-Tension Theory
<p>Vascular plants transport water under negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e without constantly creating gas bubbles that would disable their hydraulic systems. Attempts to replicate this feat in artificial systems almost invariably result in bubble formation, except under highly controlled conditions with pure water and only hydrophilic surfaces present. In theory, conditions in the xylem should favor bubble nucleation even more: there are millions of conduits with at least some hydrophobic surfaces, and xylem sap is saturated or sometimes supersaturated with atmospheric gas and may contain surface-active molecules that can lower surface tension. So how do plants transport water under negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e? Here, we show that angiosperm xylem contains abundant hydrophobic surfaces as well as insoluble lipid surfactants, including phospholipids, and proteins, a composition similar to pulmonary surfactants. Lipid surfactants were found in xylem sap and as nanoparticles under transmission electron microscopy in pores of intervessel pit membranes and deposited on vessel wall surfaces. Nanoparticles observed in xylem sap via nanoparticle-tracking analysis included surfactant-coated nanobubbles when examined by freeze-fracture electron microscopy. Based on their fracture behavior, this technique is able to distinguish between dense-core particles, liquid-filled, bilayer-coated vesicles/liposomes, and gas-filled bubbles. Xylem surfactants showed strong surface activity that reduces surface tension to low values when concentrated as they are in pit membrane pores. We hypothesize that xylem surfactants support water transport under negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e as explained by the cohesion-tension theory by coating hydrophobic surfaces and nanobubbles, thereby keeping the latter below the critical size at which bubbles would expand to form embolisms.</p>

Changes in protein expression in the salt marsh mussel <i>Geukensia demissa</i>: evidence for a shift from anaerobic to aerobic metabolism during prolonged aerial exposure
<p>During aerial exposure (emersion), most sessile intertidal invertebrates experience cellular stress caused by hypoxia, and the amount and types of hypoxia-induced stress will differ as exposure time increases, likely leading to altered metabolic responses. We examined proteomic responses to increasing emersion times and decreasing recovery (immersion) times in the mussel <i>Geukensia demissa</i>, which occurs in salt marshes along the east coast of North America. Individuals are found above mean tide level, and can be emersed for over 18 h during spring tides. We acclimated mussels to full immersion at 15°C for 4 weeks, and compared changes in gill protein expression between groups of mussels that were continually immersed (control), were emersed for 6 h and immersed during recovery for 18 h (6E/18R), were emersed for 12 h and recovered for 12 h (12E/12R), or were emersed for 18 h with a 6 h recovery (18E/6R). We found clear differences in protein expression patterns among the treatments. Proteins associated with anaerobic fermentation increased in abundance in 6E/18R but not in 12E/12R or 18E/6R. Increases in oxidative stress proteins were most apparent in 12E/12R, and in 18E/6R changes in cytoskeletal protein expression predominated. We conclude that <i>G. demissa</i> alters its strategy for coping with emersion stress over time, relying on anaerobic metabolism for short- to medium-duration exposure, but switching to an air-gaping strategy for long-term exposure, which reduces hypoxia stress but may cause structural damage to gill tissue.</p>

The limits of applicability of the sound exposure level (SEL) metric to temporal threshold shifts (TTS) in beluga whales, <i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>
<p>The influence of fatiguing sound level and duration on post-exposure temporary threshold shift (TTS) was investigated in two beluga whales (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>). The fatiguing sound was half-octave noise with a center frequency of 22.5 kHz. TTS was measured at a test frequency of 32 kHz. Thresholds were measured by recording rhythmic evoked potentials (the envelope following response) to a test series of short (eight cycles) tone pips with a pip rate of 1000 s<sup>−1</sup>. TTS increased approximately proportionally to the dB measure of both sound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e (sound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e level, SPL) and duration of the fatiguing noise, as a product of these two variables. In particular, when the noise parameters varied in a manner that maintained the product of squared sound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressur</span></strong>e and time (sound exposure level, SEL, which is equivalent to the overall noise energy) at a constant level, TTS was not constant. Keeping SEL constant, the highest TTS appeared at an intermediate ratio of SPL to sound duration and decreased at both higher and lower ratios. Multiplication (SPL multiplied by log duration) better described the experimental data than an equal-energy (equal SEL) model. The use of SEL as a sole universal metric may result in an implausible assessment of the impact of a fatiguing sound on hearing thresholds in odontocetes, including under-evaluation of potential risks.</p>

Rapid cold hardening improves recovery of ion homeostasis and chill coma recovery time in the migratory locust, <i>Locusta migratoria</i>
<p>Chill tolerance of insects is defined as the ability to tolerate low temperature under circumstances not involving freezing of intracellular or extracellular fluids. For many insects chill tolerance is crucial for their ability to persist in cold environments and mounting evidence indicates that chill tolerance is associated with the ability to maintain ion and water homeostasis, thereby ensuring muscular function and preventing chill injury at low temperature. The present study describes the relationship between muscle and haemolymph ion homeostasis and time to regain posture following cold shock (CS, 2 h at −4°C) in the chill-susceptible locust <i>Locusta migratoria</i>. This relationship was examined in animals with and without a prior rapid cold-hardening treatment (RCH, 2 h at 0°C) to investigate the physiological underpinnings of RCH. CS elicited a doubling of haemolymph [K<sup>+</sup>] and this disturbance was greater in locusts pre-exposed to RCH. Recovery of ion homeostasis was, however, markedly faster in RCH-treated animals, which correlated well with whole-organism performance as hardened individuals regained posture faster than non-hardened individuals following CS. The present study indicates that loss and recovery of muscular function are associated with the resting membrane potential of excitable membranes as attested by the changes in the equilibrium potential for K<sup>+</sup> (<i>E</i><sub>K</sub>) following CS. Both hardened and non-hardened animals regained movement once K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis had recovered to a fixed level (<i>E</i><sub>K</sub>≈−41 mV). RCH is therefore not associated with altered sensitivity to ion disturbance but instead is correlated to a faster recovery of haemolymph [K<sup>+</sup>].</p>

Precise control of miR-125b levels is required to create a regeneration-permissive environment after spinal cord injury: a cross-species comparison between salamander and rat
<p>Most spinal cord injuries lead to permanent paralysis in mammals. By contrast, the remarkable regenerative abilities of salamanders enable full functional recovery even from complete spinal cord transections. The molecular differences underlying this evolutionary divergence between mammals and amphibians are poorly understood. We focused on upstream regulators of gene expression as primary entry points into this question. We identified a group of microRNAs (miRNAs) that are conserved between the Mexican axolotl salamander (<i>Ambystoma mexicanum</i>) and mammals but show marked cross-species differences in regulation patterns following spinal cord injury. We found that precise post-injury levels of one of these miRNAs (miR-125b) is essential for functional recovery, and guides correct regeneration of axons through the lesion site in a process involving the direct downstream target <i>Sema4D</i> in axolotls. Translating these results to a mammalian model, we increased miR-125b levels in the rat through mimic treatments following spinal cord transection. These treatments downregulated <i>Sema4D</i> and other glial-scar-related genes, and enhanced the animal’s functional recovery. Our study identifies a key regulatory molecule conserved between salamander and mammal, and shows that the expression of <i>miR-125b</i> and <i>Sema4D</i> must be carefully controlled in the right cells at the correct level to promote regeneration. We also show that these molecular components of the salamander’s regeneration-permissive environment can be experimentally harnessed to improve treatment outcomes for mammalian spinal cord injuries.</p>

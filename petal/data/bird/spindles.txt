Multiplatform evaluation of global trends in wind speed and wave height
<p>In this study, global satellite data were analyzed to determine trends in oceanic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wind</span></strong> speed and significant wave height over the 33-year period from 1985 to 2018. The analysis uses an extensive database obtained from 31 satellite missions comprising three types of instruments—altimeters, radiometers, and scatterometers. The analysis shows small increases in mean <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wind</span></strong> speed and significant wave height over this period, with larger increases in extreme conditions (90th percentiles). The largest increases occur in the Southern Ocean. Confidence in the results is strengthened because the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wind</span></strong> speed trends are confirmed by all three satellite systems. An extensive set of sensitivity analyses confirms that both the mean and 90th percentile trends are robust, with only small impacts caused by satellite calibration and sampling patterns.</p>

Climate model shows large-scale wind and solar farms in the Sahara increase rain and vegetation
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wind</span></strong> and solar farms offer a major pathway to clean, renewable energies. However, these farms would significantly change land surface properties, and, if sufficiently large, the farms may lead to unintended climate consequences. In this study, we used a climate model with dynamic vegetation to show that large-scale installations of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wind</span></strong> and solar farms covering the Sahara lead to a local temperature increase and more than a twofold precipitation increase, especially in the Sahel, through increased surface friction and reduced albedo. The resulting increase in vegetation further enhances precipitation, creating a positive albedo–precipitation–vegetation feedback that contributes ~80% of the precipitation increase for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wind</span></strong> farms. This local enhancement is scale dependent and is particular to the Sahara, with small impacts in other deserts.</p>

Dunes on Pluto
<p>The surface of Pluto is more geologically diverse and dynamic than had been expected, but the role of its tenuous atmosphere in shaping the landscape remains unclear. We describe observations from the New Horizons spacecraft of regularly spaced, linear ridges whose morphology, distribution, and orientation are consistent with being transverse dunes. These are located close to mountainous regions and are orthogonal to nearby <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wind</span></strong> streaks. We demonstrate that the wavelength of the dunes (~0.4 to 1 kilometer) is best explained by the deposition of sand-sized (~200 to ~300 micrometer) particles of methane ice in moderate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wind</span></strong>s (<10 meters per second). The undisturbed morphology of the dunes, and relationships with the underlying convective glacial ice, imply that the dunes have formed in the very recent geological past.</p>

Structure, force balance, and topology of Earth’s magnetopause
<p>The magnetopause deflects the solar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wind</span></strong> plasma and confines Earth’s magnetic field. We combine measurements made by the four spacecraft of the Magnetospheric Multiscale mission to demonstrate how the plasma and magnetic forces at the boundary affect the interaction between the shocked solar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wind</span></strong> and Earth’s magnetosphere. We compare these forces with the plasma pressure and examine the electron distribution function. We find that the magnetopause has sublayers with thickness comparable to the ion scale. Small pockets of low magnetic field strength, small radius of curvature, and high electric current mark the electron diffusion region. The flow of electrons, parallel and antiparallel to the magnetic field, reveals a complex topology with the creation of magnetic ropes at the boundary.</p>

Measurement and implications of Saturn’s gravity field and ring mass
<p>The interior structure of Saturn, the depth of its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wind</span></strong>s, and the mass and age of its rings constrain its formation and evolution. In the final phase of the Cassini mission, the spacecraft dived between the planet and its innermost ring, at altitudes of 2600 to 3900 kilometers above the cloud tops. During six of these crossings, a radio link with Earth was monitored to determine the gravitational field of the planet and the mass of its rings. We find that Saturn’s gravity deviates from theoretical expectations and requires differential rotation of the atmosphere extending to a depth of at least 9000 kilometers. The total mass of the rings is (1.54 ± 0.49) × 10<sup>19</sup> kilograms (0.41 ± 0.13 times that of the moon Mimas), indicating that the rings may have formed 10<sup>7</sup> to 10<sup>8</sup> years ago.</p>

Spectrally resolved helium absorption from the extended atmosphere of a warm Neptune-mass exoplanet
<p>Stellar heating causes atmospheres of close-in exoplanets to expand and escape. These extended atmospheres are difficult to observe because their main spectral signature—neutral hydrogen at ultraviolet wavelengths—is strongly absorbed by interstellar medium. We report the detection of the near-infrared triplet of neutral helium in the transiting warm Neptune-mass exoplanet HAT-P-11b by using ground-based, high-resolution observations. The helium feature is repeatable over two independent transits, with an average absorption depth of 1.08 ± 0.05%. Interpreting absorption spectra with three-dimensional simulations of the planet’s upper atmosphere suggests that it extends beyond 5 planetary radii, with a large-scale height and a helium mass loss rate of ≲3 × 10<sup>5</sup> grams per second. A net blue-shift of the absorption might be explained by high-altitude <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wind</span></strong>s flowing at 3 kilometers per second from day to night-side.</p>

A continental system for forecasting bird migration
<p>Billions of animals cross the globe each year during seasonal migrations, but efforts to monitor them are hampered by the unpredictability of their movements. We developed a bird migration forecast system at a continental scale by leveraging 23 years of spring observations to identify associations between atmospheric conditions and bird migration intensity. Our models explained up to 81% of variation in migration intensity across the United States at altitudes of 0 to 3000 meters, and performance remained high in forecasting events 1 to 7 days in advance (62 to 76% of variation was explained). Avian migratory movements across the United States likely exceed 500 million individuals per night during peak passage. Bird migration forecasts will reduce collisions with buildings, airplanes, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wind</span></strong> turbines; inform a variety of monitoring efforts; and engage the public.</p>

Fast molecular outflow from a dusty star-forming galaxy in the early Universe
<p>Galaxies grow inefficiently, with only a small percentage of the available gas converted into stars each free-fall time. Feedback processes, such as outflowing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wind</span></strong>s driven by radiation pressure, supernovae, or supermassive black hole accretion, can act to halt star formation if they heat or expel the gas supply. We report a molecular outflow launched from a dust-rich star-forming galaxy at redshift 5.3, 1 billion years after the Big Bang. The outflow reaches velocities up to 800 kilometers per second relative to the galaxy, is resolved into multiple clumps, and carries mass at a rate within a factor of 2 of the star formation rate. Our results show that molecular outflows can remove a large fraction of the gas available for star formation from galaxies at high redshift.</p>

Sustained climate warming drives declining marine biological productivity
<p>Climate change projections to the year 2100 may miss physical-biogeochemical feedbacks that emerge later from the cumulative effects of climate warming. In a coupled climate simulation to the year 2300, the westerly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wind</span></strong>s strengthen and shift poleward, surface waters warm, and sea ice disappears, leading to intense nutrient trapping in the Southern Ocean. The trapping drives a global-scale nutrient redistribution, with net transfer to the deep ocean. Ensuing surface nutrient reductions north of 30°S drive steady declines in primary production and carbon export (decreases of 24 and 41%, respectively, by 2300). Potential fishery yields, constrained by lower–trophic-level productivity, decrease by more than 20% globally and by nearly 60% in the North Atlantic. Continued high levels of greenhouse gas emissions could suppress marine biological productivity for a millennium.</p>

A pathway for mitotic chromosome formation
<p>Mitotic chromosomes fold as compact arrays of chromatin loops. To identify the pathway of mitotic chromosome formation, we combined imaging and Hi-C analysis of synchronous DT40 cell cultures with polymer simulations. Here we show that in prophase, the interphase organization is rapidly lost in a condensin-dependent manner, and arrays of consecutive 60-kilobase (kb) loops are formed. During prometaphase, ~80-kb inner loops are nested within ~400-kb outer loops. The loop array acquires a helical arrangement with consecutive loops emanating from a central “spiral staircase” condensin scaffold. The size of helical turns progressively increases to ~12 megabases during prometaphase. Acute depletion of condensin I or II shows that nested loops form by differential action of the two condensins, whereas condensin II is required for helical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wind</span></strong>ing.</p>

<i>Swift</i> and <i>NuSTAR</i> observations of GW170817: Detection of a blue kilonova
<p>With the first direct detection of merging black holes in 2015, the era of gravitational wave (GW) astrophysics began. A complete picture of compact object mergers, however, requires the detection of an electromagnetic (EM) counterpart. We report ultraviolet (UV) and x-ray observations by <i>Swift</i> and the <i>Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array</i> of the EM counterpart of the binary neutron star merger GW170817. The bright, rapidly fading UV emission indicates a high mass (≈0.03 solar masses) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wind</span></strong>-driven outflow with moderate electron fraction (<i>Y</i><sub>e</sub> ≈ 0.27). Combined with the x-ray limits, we favor an observer viewing angle of ≈30° away from the orbital rotation axis, which avoids both obscuration from the heaviest elements in the orbital plane and a direct view of any ultrarelativistic, highly collimated ejecta (a γ-ray burst afterglow).</p>

Tunable excitons in bilayer graphene
<p>Excitons, the bound states of an electron and a hole in a solid material, play a key role in the optical properties of insulators and semiconductors. Here, we report the observation of excitons in bilayer graphene (BLG) using photocurrent spectroscopy of high-quality BLG encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride. We observed two prominent excitonic resonances with narrow line widths that are tunable from the mid-infrared to the terahertz range. These excitons obey optical selection rules distinct from those in conventional semiconductors and feature an electron pseudospin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wind</span></strong>ing number of 2. An external magnetic field induces a large splitting of the valley excitons, corresponding to a <i>g</i>-factor of about 20. These findings open up opportunities to explore exciton physics with pseudospin texture in electrically tunable graphene systems.</p>

Digital nature: Are field trips a thing of the past?
<p>I awoke in my cabin by the pond. Weighing my options for the day, I decided to do some bird watching, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wind</span></strong>ing between white pines and blackberries along the east shore of the pond. By their songs, I was able to identify a Mourning Dove, Blue Jays, an American Crow, and perhaps a Northern Cardinal. A mink, alarmed by my approach, dove into the pond and swam off. Unable to resist on such a sunny day, I waded into the pond and watched the sunlight play around me in the shallows. My mood that morning was appropriately reflected by my status indicators: moderately inspired, tired, and hungry. My hike took place in <i>Walden, a Game</i>, a video game recently launched on the 200th birthday of Henry David Thoreau (<i>1</i>). With a widening niche of such nature-themed video games and simulations and a rapidly growing audience of online/digital learners, the capacity to reach new audiences and carry environmental education beyond the confines of schools and universities may be a game changer, but one that perhaps comes with perils.</p>

Zones, spots, and planetary-scale waves beating in brown dwarf atmospheres
<p>Brown dwarfs are massive analogs of extrasolar giant planets and may host types of atmospheric circulation not seen in the solar system. We analyzed a long-term Spitzer Space Telescope infrared monitoring campaign of brown dwarfs to constrain cloud cover variations over a total of 192 rotations. The infrared brightness evolution is dominated by beat patterns caused by planetary-scale wave pairs and by a small number of bright spots. The beating waves have similar amplitudes but slightly different apparent periods because of differing velocities or directions. The power spectrum of intermediate-temperature brown dwarfs resembles that of Neptune, indicating the presence of zonal temperature and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wind</span></strong> speed variations. Our findings explain three previously puzzling behaviors seen in brown dwarf brightness variations.</p>

On the generation of solar spicules and Alfvénic waves
<p>In the lower solar atmosphere, the chromosphere is permeated by jets known as spicules, in which plasma is propelled at speeds of 50 to 150 kilometers per second into the corona. The origin of the spicules is poorly understood, although they are expected to play a role in heating the million-degree corona and are associated with Alfvéííénic waves that help drive the solar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wind</span></strong>. We compare magnetohydrodynamic simulations of spicules with observations from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph and the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope. Spicules are shown to occur when magnetic tension is amplified and transported upward through interactions between ions and neutrals or ambipolar diffusion. The tension is impulsively released to drive flows, heat plasma (through ambipolar diffusion), and generate Alfvéííéénic waves.</p>

An unexpected disruption of the atmospheric quasi-biennial oscillation
<p>One of the most repeatable phenomena seen in the atmosphere, the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) between prevailing eastward and westward <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wind</span></strong> jets in the equatorial stratosphere (approximately 16 to 50 kilometers altitude), was unexpectedly disrupted in February 2016. An unprecedented westward jet formed within the eastward phase in the lower stratosphere and cannot be accounted for by the standard QBO paradigm based on vertical momentum transport. Instead, the primary cause was waves transporting momentum from the Northern Hemisphere. Seasonal forecasts did not predict the disruption, but analogous QBO disruptions are seen very occasionally in some climate simulations. A return to more typical QBO behavior within the next year is forecast, although the possibility of more frequent occurrences of similar disruptions is projected for a warming climate.</p>

A Histone Acetylation Switch Regulates H2A.Z Deposition by the SWR-C Remodeling Enzyme
<sec><title>Variants and Regulation</title><p>Genomic DNA is packaged into nucleosomes by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spool</span></strong>ing around histone proteins. Histone variants and the composition of nucleosomes can influence gene expression, as well as other chromatin-mediated processes. For example, the H2A.Z histone variant flanks RNA polII promoters, and such nucleosomes show rapid turnover, as well as enrichment for histone H3 acetylated at lysine 56 (H3-K56Ac). <bold>Watanabe <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 195) show that H3-K56Ac alters the substrate specificity of the chromatin remodeling enzyme SWR-C, which normally evicts nucleosomal H2A.Z such that it now rapidly exchanges both canonical H2A and the variant H2A.Z, modulating nucleosome turnover and therefore influencing gene regulation. Pathways are dramatically simplified, promoting proper folding.</p></sec>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
The Impacts of Fluctuating Light on Crop Performance
<p>Rapidly changing light conditions can reduce carbon gain and productivity in field crops because photosynthetic responses to light fluctuations are not instantaneous. Plant responses to fluctuating light occur across levels of organizational complexity from entire canopies to the biochemistry of a single reaction and across orders of magnitude of time. Although light availability and variation at the top of the canopy are largely dependent on the solar angle and degree of cloudiness, lower crop canopies rely more heavily on light in the form of sunflecks, the quantity of which depends mostly on canopy structure but also may be affected by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wind</span></strong>. The ability of leaf photosynthesis to respond rapidly to these variations in light intensity is restricted by the relatively slow opening/closing of stomata, activation/deactivation of C<sub>3</sub> cycle enzymes, and up-regulation/down-regulation of photoprotective processes. The metabolic complexity of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis creates the apparently contradictory possibilities that C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis may be both more and less resilient than C<sub>3</sub> to dynamic light regimes, depending on the frequency at which these light fluctuations occur. We review the current understanding of the underlying mechanisms of these limitations to photosynthesis in fluctuating light that have shown promise in improving the response times of photosynthesis-related processes to changes in light intensity.</p>

Chirping and asymmetric jamming avoidance responses in the electric fish <i>Distocyclus conirostris</i>
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> An asymmetric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">jam</span></strong>ming avoidance response in a gregarious electric fish with a low-frequency electric organ discharge could function in communication as well as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">jam</span></strong>ming avoidance.</p>

Microresonator soliton dual-comb spectroscopy
<p>Measurement of optical and vibrational spectra with high resolution provides a way to identify chemical species in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clutter</span></strong>ed environments and is of general importance in many fields. Dual-comb spectroscopy has emerged as a powerful approach for acquiring nearly instantaneous Raman and optical spectra with unprecedented resolution. Spectra are generated directly in the electrical domain, without the need for bulky mechanical spectrometers. We demonstrate a miniature soliton-based dual-comb system that can potentially transfer the approach to a chip platform. These devices achieve high-coherence pulsed mode locking. They also feature broad, reproducible spectral envelopes, an essential feature for dual-comb spectroscopy. Our work shows the potential for integrated spectroscopy with high signal-to-noise ratios and fast acquisition rates.</p>

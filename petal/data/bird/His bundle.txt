Post-operative neuropathy after total hip arthroplasty
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e palsy is a well-described complication   following total hip arthroplasty, but is highly distressing and   disabling. A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e palsy may cause difficulty with the post-operative   rehabilitation, and overall mobility of the patient. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e palsy   may result from compression and tension to the affected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e(s)   during the course of the operation via surgical manipulation and   retractor placement, tension from limb lengthening or compression   from post-operative hematoma. In the literature, hip dysplasia,   lengthening of the leg, the use of an uncemented femoral component, and   female gender are associated with a greater risk of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e palsy.   We examined our experience at a high-volume, tertiary care referral   centre, and found an overall incidence of 0.3% out of 39 056 primary   hip arthroplasties. Risk factors found to be associated with the   incidence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e palsy at our institution included the presence   of spinal stenosis or lumbar disc disease, age younger than 50,   and smoking. If a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e palsy is diagnosed, imaging is mandatory   and surgical evacuation or compressive haematomas may be beneficial.   As palsies are slow to recover, supportive care such as bracing,   therapy, and reassurance are the mainstays of treatment.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B(1 Supple   A):46–9.</p>

Nerves switch on angiogenic metabolism
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>es release neurotransmitters to regulate most physiologic functions in the body. Recently, it has been recognized that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>es play dominant roles in organogenesis and tissue regeneration (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). In addition, growing evidence suggests that cancer development in a variety of tissues is controlled by an assortment of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e-mediated signals, including neurotransmitters and other molecules (<i>3</i>–<i>5</i>). The key molecules depend on the organ and the context, but the targets of neurotransmission appear to include both stem cells and the surrounding stromal cells. Both adrenergic and cholinergic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>es promote prostate cancer development, at least in part, by activating stromal cells (<i>4</i>). On page 321 of this issue, Zahalka <i>et al.</i> (<i>6</i>) expand on their previous findings (<i>3</i>) by elucidating the molecular mechanism of neurotransmission in prostate cancer, revealing that noradrenaline released from cancer-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>es triggers angiogenesis and thus cancer progression.</p>

A bioinspired flexible organic artificial afferent nerve
<p>The distributed network of receptors, neurons, and synapses in the somatosensory system efficiently processes complex tactile information. We used flexible organic electronics to mimic the functions of a sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e. Our artificial afferent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e collects pressure information (1 to 80 kilopascals) from clusters of pressure sensors, converts the pressure information into action potentials (0 to 100 hertz) by using ring oscillators, and integrates the action potentials from multiple ring oscillators with a synaptic transistor. Biomimetic hierarchical structures can detect movement of an object, combine simultaneous pressure inputs, and distinguish braille characters. Furthermore, we connected our artificial afferent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e to motor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>es to construct a hybrid bioelectronic reflex arc to actuate muscles. Our system has potential applications in neurorobotics and neuroprosthetics.</p>

Adrenergic nerves activate an angio-metabolic switch in prostate cancer
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>es closely associate with blood vessels and help to pattern the vasculature during development. Recent work suggests that newly formed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e fibers may regulate the tumor microenvironment, but their exact functions are unclear. Studying mouse models of prostate cancer, we show that endothelial β-adrenergic receptor signaling via adrenergic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e–derived noradrenaline in the prostate stroma is critical for activation of an angiogenic switch that fuels exponential tumor growth. Mechanistically, this occurs through alteration of endothelial cell metabolism. Endothelial cells typically rely on aerobic glycolysis for angiogenesis. We found that the loss of endothelial <i>Adrb2</i>, the gene encoding the β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor, leads to inhibition of angiogenesis through enhancement of endothelial oxidative phosphorylation. Codeletion of <i>Adrb2</i> and <i>Cox10</i>, a gene encoding a cytochrome IV oxidase assembly factor, prevented the metabolic shift induced by <i>Adrb2</i> deletion and rescued prostate cancer progression. This cross-talk between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>es and endothelial metabolism could potentially be targeted as an anticancer therapy.</p>

Multipotent peripheral glial cells generate neuroendocrine cells of the adrenal medulla
<p>Adrenaline is a fundamental circulating hormone for bodily responses to internal and external stressors. Chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla (AM) represent the main neuroendocrine adrenergic component and are believed to differentiate from neural crest cells. We demonstrate that large numbers of chromaffin cells arise from peripheral glial stem cells, termed Schwann cell precursors (SCPs). SCPs migrate along the visceral motor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e to the vicinity of the forming adrenal gland, where they detach from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e and form postsynaptic neuroendocrine chromaffin cells. An intricate molecular logic drives two sequential phases of gene expression, one unique for a distinct transient cellular state and another for cell type specification. Subsequently, these programs down-regulate SCP-gene and up-regulate chromaffin cell–gene networks. The AM forms through limited cell expansion and requires the recruitment of numerous SCPs. Thus, peripheral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>es serve as a stem cell niche for neuroendocrine system development.</p>

The sacral autonomic outflow is sympathetic
<p>A kinship between cranial and pelvic visceral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>es of vertebrates has been accepted for a century. Accordingly, sacral preganglionic neurons are considered parasympathetic, as are their targets in the pelvic ganglia that prominently control rectal, bladder, and genital functions. Here, we uncover 15 phenotypic and ontogenetic features that distinguish pre- and postganglionic neurons of the cranial parasympathetic outflow from those of the thoracolumbar sympathetic outflow in mice. By every single one, the sacral outflow is indistinguishable from the thoracolumbar outflow. Thus, the parasympathetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>ous system receives input from cranial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>es exclusively and the sympathetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>ous system from spinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>es, thoracic to sacral inclusively. This simplified, bipartite architecture offers a new framework to understand pelvic neurophysiology as well as development and evolution of the autonomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>ous system.</p>

Role of insulin signaling impairment, adiponectin and dyslipidemia in peripheral and central neuropathy in mice
<p>One of the tissues or organs affected by diabetes is the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>ous system, predominantly the peripheral system (peripheral polyneuropathy and/or painful peripheral neuropathy) but also the central system with impaired learning, memory and mental flexibility. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the pre-diabetic or diabetic condition caused by a high-fat diet (HFD) can damage both the peripheral and central <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>ous systems. Groups of C57BL6 and Swiss Webster mice were fed a diet containing 60% fat for 8 months and compared to control and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic groups that were fed a standard diet containing 10% fat. Aspects of peripheral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e function (conduction velocity, thermal sensitivity) and central <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>ous system function (learning ability, memory) were measured at assorted times during the study. Both strains of mice on HFD developed impaired glucose tolerance, indicative of insulin resistance, but only the C57BL6 mice showed statistically significant hyperglycemia. STZ-diabetic C57BL6 mice developed learning deficits in the Barnes maze after 8 weeks of diabetes, whereas neither C57BL6 nor Swiss Webster mice fed a HFD showed signs of defects at that time point. By 6 months on HFD, Swiss Webster mice developed learning and memory deficits in the Barnes maze test, whereas their peripheral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>ous system remained normal. In contrast, C57BL6 mice fed the HFD developed peripheral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e dysfunction, as indicated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e conduction slowing and thermal hyperalgesia, but showed normal learning and memory functions. Our data indicate that STZ-induced diabetes or a HFD can damage both peripheral and central <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>ous systems, but learning deficits develop more rapidly in insulin-deficient than in insulin-resistant conditions and only in Swiss Webster mice. In addition to insulin impairment, dyslipidemia or adiponectinemia might determine the neuropathy phenotype.</p>

The transcription factor C/EBPβ in the dorsal root ganglion contributes to peripheral nerve trauma–induced nociceptive hypersensitivity
<p>Changes in gene transcription in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e trauma contribute to the genesis of neuropathic pain. We report that peripheral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e trauma caused by chronic constriction injury (CCI) increased the abundance of the transcription factor C/EBPβ (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β) in the DRG. Blocking this increase mitigated the development and maintenance of CCI-induced mechanical, thermal, and cold pain hypersensitivities without affecting basal responses to acute pain and locomotor activity. Conversely, mimicking this increase produced hypersensitivity to mechanical, thermal, or cold pain. In the ipsilateral DRG, C/EBPβ promoted a decrease in the abundance of the voltage-gated potassium channel subunit Kv1.2 and μ opioid receptor (MOR) at the mRNA and protein levels, which would be predicted to increase excitability in the ipsilateral DRG neurons and reduce the efficacy of morphine analgesia. These effects required C/EPBβ-mediated transcriptional activation of <i>Ehmt2</i> (euchromatic histone-lysine <i>N</i>-methyltransferase 2), which encodes G9a, an epigenetic silencer of the genes encoding Kv1.2 and MOR. Blocking the increase in C/EBPβ in the DRG improved morphine analgesia after CCI. These results suggest that C/EBPβ is an endogenous initiator of neuropathic pain and could be a potential target for the prevention and treatment of this disorder.</p>

A gut feeling
<p>The anatomist Friedrich S. Merkel predicted in 1880 that sensory systems are composed of epithelial cells and sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>es, which together transform environmental cues into neural signals that trigger our rich sensory experiences (<i>1</i>). We now know that this hypothesis mostly holds true for the canonical senses of vision, hearing, taste, and touch. Perhaps surprisingly, the peripheral outposts of these classical sensory systems (eyes, ears, tongue, and skin) are dwarfed by the human body's largest sensory organ—the gut. Enteroendocrine cells, which are rare epithelial cells that decorate the gut lining, have long been suspected to be sensory receptor cells that inform the brain about ingested nutrients (<i>2</i>). Since their description, these cells were assumed to play a role in metabolism and gut physiology by releasing slow-acting peptide hormones that stimulate neurons throughout the gut and in the brain. On page 1219 of this issue, Kaelberer <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) challenge this view by demonstrating that gut enteroendocrine cells locally excite sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>es through release of the neurotransmitter glutamate. A recent study of enterochromaffin cells, a subset of enteroendocrine cells, also found that gut signals are transmitted at epithelial-neural synapses through release of the neurotransmitter serotonin (<i>4</i>). Together, these findings overturn a decades-old dogma that enteroendocrine cells signal exclusively through hormones.</p>

Locally translated mTOR controls axonal local translation in nerve injury
<p>How is protein synthesis initiated locally in neurons? We found that mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) was activated and then up-regulated in injured axons, owing to local translation of mTOR messenger RNA (mRNA). This mRNA was transported into axons by the cell size–regulating RNA-binding protein nucleolin. Furthermore, mTOR controlled local translation in injured axons. This included regulation of its own translation and that of retrograde injury signaling molecules such as importin β1 and STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3). Deletion of the mTOR 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) in mice reduced mTOR in axons and decreased local translation after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e injury. Both pharmacological inhibition of mTOR in axons and deletion of the mTOR 3′UTR decreased proprioceptive neuronal survival after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e injury. Thus, mRNA localization enables spatiotemporal control of mTOR pathways regulating local translation and long-range intracellular signaling.</p>

Cholesterol crystals impede nerve repair
<p>Damage to the myelin sheath that surrounds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e axons represents the pathological hallmark of the neurological disorder multiple sclerosis (MS) and is thought to contribute to a number of other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>ous system maladies (<i>1</i>). Remyelination, a regenerative process that forms new myelin sheaths around demyelinated axons, restores <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e function and reverses the clinical manifestations associated with demyelination (<i>2</i>). Although remyelination occurs efficiently in young individuals, this restorative process proceeds less well with age (<i>2</i>). Inefficient remyelination results in axonal loss and progressive worsening of neurological symptoms. On page 684 of this issue, Cantuti-Castelvetri <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) report that insufficient clearance (phagocytosis) of damaged myelin by aged macrophages results in the accumulation of cholesterol crystals in these cells, which elicits a maladaptive inflammatory response that is associated with impaired remyelination. Understanding this process may reveal new therapeutic opportunities for MS and other demyelinating disorders.</p>

A New Wrap for Neuronal Activity?
<p>As we learn and experience the world around us, our brains are remodeling neuronal pathways. Is this remodeling only a property of neurons, or are other brain cell types also adapting and contributing to learning? A substantial proportion of cells in the mammalian brain are oligodendrocytes and their precursors (collectively called oligodendroglia). Oligodendrocytes generate multiple myelin sheaths, lipid-rich extensions of specialized plasma membrane that spirally coat condensed layers around neurons. This insulation facilitates rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e conduction, increasing velocities of neuron signals 10-fold (<i>1</i>) by restricting current flow to the small gaps between sheaths—the nodes of Ranvier. More than half of the human brain is composed of myelinated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>es (“white matter”). With such extensive myelinated neural networks, it raises the questions: Do the myelin-producing oligodendrocytes in the brain also adapt as neural circuits are modified in response to activity, and does adaptation of oligodendrocytes then affect the underlying neural circuits? On page 487 of this issue, Gibson <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) provide new evidence to address how neuron activity may promote oligodendroglia changes.</p>

Anterior lateral line nerve encoding to tones and play-back vocalisations in free-swimming oyster toadfish, <i>Opsanus tau</i>
<p>In the underwater environment, sound propagates both as a pressure wave and as particle motion, with particle motion dominating close to the source. At the receptor level, the fish ear and the neuromast hair cells act as displacement detectors, and both are potentially stimulated by the particle motion component of sound. The encoding of the anterior lateral line <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e to acoustic stimuli in freely behaving oyster toadfish, <i>Opsanus tau</i>, was examined. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e sensitivity and directional responses were determined using spike rate and vector strength analysis, a measure of phase-locking of spike times to the stimulus waveform. All units showed greatest sensitivity to 100 Hz stimulus. While sensitivity was independent of stimuli orientation, the neuron's ability to phase-lock was correlated with stimuli origin. Two different types of units were classified, type 1 (tonic), and type 2 (phasic). The type 1 fibres were further classified into two sub-types based on their frequency response (type 1–1 and type 1–2), which was hypothesised to be related to canal (type 1–1) and superficial (type 1–2) neuromast in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>ation. Lateral line units also exhibited sensitivity and phase locking to boatwhistle vocalisations, with greatest spike rates exhibited at the onset of the call. These results provide direct evidence that oyster toadfish can use their lateral line to detect behaviourally relevant acoustic stimuli, which could provide a sensory pathway to aid in sound source localisation.</p>

Vocal production complexity correlates with neural instructions in the oyster toadfish (<i>Opsanus tau</i>)
<p>Sound communication is fundamental to many social interactions and essential to courtship and agonistic behaviours in many vertebrates. The swimbladder and associated muscles in batrachoidid fishes (midshipman and toadfish) is a unique vertebrate sound production system, wherein fundamental frequencies are determined directly by the firing rate of a vocal-acoustic neural network that drives the contraction frequency of superfast swimbladder muscles. The oyster toadfish boatwhistle call starts with an irregular sound waveform that could be an emergent property of the peripheral nonlinear sound-producing system or reflect complex encoding in the central <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>ous system. Here, we demonstrate that the start of the boatwhistle is indicative of a chaotic strange attractor, and tested whether its origin lies in the peripheral sound-producing system or in the vocal motor network. We recorded sound and swimbladder muscle activity in awake, freely behaving toadfish during motor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e stimulation, and recorded sound, motor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e and muscle activity during spontaneous grunts. The results show that rhythmic motor volleys do not cause complex sound signals. However, arrhythmic recruitment of swimbladder muscle during spontaneous grunts correlates with complex sounds. This supports the hypothesis that the irregular start of the boatwhistle is encoded in the vocal pre-motor neural network, and not caused by peripheral interactions with the sound-producing system. We suggest that sound production system demands across vocal tetrapods have selected for muscles and motorneurons adapted for speed, which can execute complex neural instructions into equivalently complex vocalisations.</p>

Is it safe to preserve the deltoid when resecting the proximal humerus for a primary malignant bone tumour?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Resection of the proximal humerus for the primary malignant bone   tumour sometimes requires <i>en bloc</i> resection of the   deltoid. However, there is no information in the literature which   helps a surgeon decide whether to preserve the deltoid or not. The   aim of this study was to determine whether retaining the deltoid   at the time of resection would increase the rate of local recurrence.   We also sought to identify the variables that persuade expert surgeons   to choose a deltoid sparing rather than deltoid resecting procedure.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We reviewed 45 patients who had undergone resection of a primary   malignant tumour of the proximal humerus. There were 29 in the deltoid   sparing group and 16 in the deltoid resecting group. Imaging studies   were reviewed to assess tumour extension and soft-tissue involvement.   The presence of a fat rim separating the tumour from the deltoid   on MRI was particularly noted.

Complications following arthroscopic surgery of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The number of patients undergoing arthroscopic surgery of the   hip has increased significantly during the past decade. It has now   become an established technique for the treatment of many intra-   and extra-articular conditions affecting the hip. However, it has   a steep learning curve and is not without the risk of complications.   The purpose of this systematic review was to determine the prevalence   of complications during and following this procedure.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses   guidelines were used in designing this study. Two reviewers systematically   searched the literature for complications related to arthroscopy   of the hip. The research question and eligibility criteria were   established <i>a priori</i>. Pertinent data were abstracted   and analysed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We found 276 relevant studies with a total of 36 761 arthroscopies   that met the inclusion criteria. The mean age of the patients was   36.7 years (1.7 to 70) and the mean body mass index was 25.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (20.2   to 29.2). Femoroacetabular impingement and labral tears were the   most common indications for the procedure. The total number of complications   was 1222 (3.3%). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e injury (0.9%), mainly involving the pudendal   and lateral femoral cutaneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>es, and iatrogenic chondral and   labral injury (0.7%), were the two most common complications. There   were 58 major complications (0.2%), the most common being intra-abdominal   extravasation of fluid, which was found in 13 cases (0.04%). There   were three deaths (0.008%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Arthroscopic surgery of the hip is a procedure with a relatively   low rate of complications, although some may be significant in this   young cohort of patients.

Disease Models & Mechanisms
A novel mouse model of Warburg Micro syndrome reveals roles for RAB18 in eye development and organisation of the neuronal cytoskeleton
<p>Mutations in <i>RAB18</i> have been shown to cause the heterogeneous autosomal recessive disorder Warburg Micro syndrome (WARBM). Individuals with WARBM present with a range of clinical symptoms, including ocular and neurological abnormalities. However, the underlying cellular and molecular pathogenesis of the disorder remains unclear, largely owing to the lack of any robust animal models that phenocopy both the ocular and neurological features of the disease. We report here the generation and characterisation of a novel <i>Rab18</i>-mutant mouse model of WARBM. <i>Rab18</i>-mutant mice are viable and fertile. They present with congenital nuclear cataracts and atonic pupils, recapitulating the characteristic ocular features that are associated with WARBM. Additionally, <i>Rab18</i>-mutant cells exhibit an increase in lipid droplet size following treatment with oleic acid. Lipid droplet abnormalities are a characteristic feature of cells taken from WARBM individuals, as well as cells taken from individuals with other neurodegenerative conditions. Neurological dysfunction is also apparent in <i>Rab18</i>-mutant mice, including progressive weakness of the hind limbs. We show that the neurological defects are, most likely, not caused by gross perturbations in synaptic vesicle recycling in the central or peripheral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>ous system. Rather, loss of <i>Rab18</i> is associated with widespread disruption of the neuronal cytoskeleton, including abnormal accumulations of neurofilament and microtubule proteins in synaptic terminals, and gross disorganisation of the cytoskeleton in peripheral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>es. Global proteomic profiling of peripheral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>es in <i>Rab18</i>-mutant mice reveals significant alterations in several core molecular pathways that regulate cytoskeletal dynamics in neurons. The apparent similarities between the WARBM phenotype and the phenotype that we describe here indicate that the <i>Rab18</i>-mutant mouse provides an important platform for investigation of the disease pathogenesis and therapeutic interventions.</p>

Mortality and Cerebrovascular Events After Heart Rhythm Disorder Management Procedures
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Recognition of rates and causes of hard, patient-centered outcomes of death and cerebrovascular events (CVEs) after heart rhythm disorder management (HRDM) procedures is an essential step for the development of quality improvement programs in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electrophysiolog</span></strong>y laboratories. Our primary aim was to assess and characterize death and CVEs (stroke or transient ischemic attack) after HRDM procedures over a 17-year period.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed a retrospective cohort study of all patients undergoing HRDM procedures between January 2000 and November 2016 at the Mayo Clinic. Patients from all 3 tertiary academic centers (Rochester, Phoenix, and Jacksonville) were included in the study. All in-hospital deaths and CVEs after HRDM procedures were identified and were further characterized as directly or indirectly related to the HRDM procedure. Subgroup analysis of death and CVE rates was performed for ablation, device implantation, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electrophysiolog</span></strong>y study, lead extraction, and defibrillation threshold testing procedures.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 48 913 patients (age, 65.7±6.6 years; 64% male) who underwent a total of 62 065 HRDM procedures were included in the study. The overall mortality and CVE rates in the cohort were 0.36% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31–0.42) and 0.12% (95% CI, 0.09–0.16), respectively. Patients undergoing lead extraction had the highest overall mortality rate at 1.9% (95% CI, 1.34–2.61) and CVE rate at 0.62% (95% CI, 0.32–1.07). Among patients undergoing HRDM procedures, 48% of deaths directly related to the HDRM procedure were among patients undergoing device implantation procedures. Overall, cardiac tamponade was the most frequent direct cause of death (40%), and infection was the most common indirect cause of death (29%). The overall 30-day mortality rate was 0.76%, with the highest being in lead extraction procedures (3.08%), followed by device implantation procedures (0.94%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Half of the deaths directly related to an HRDM procedure were among the patients undergoing device implantation procedures, with cardiac tamponade being the most common cause of death. This highlights the importance of the development of protocols for the quick identification and management of cardiac tamponade even in procedures typically believed to be lower risk such as device implantation.</p></sec>

Physical Activity and Heart Rate Variability in Older Adults
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Cardiac mortality and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electrophysiolog</span></strong>ical dysfunction both increase with age. Heart rate variability (HRV) provides indices of autonomic function and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electrophysiolog</span></strong>y that are associated with cardiac risk. How habitual physical activity among older adults prospectively relates to HRV, including nonlinear indices of erratic sinus patterns, is not established. We hypothesized that increasing the levels of both total leisure-time activity and walking would be prospectively associated with more favorable time-domain, frequency-domain, and nonlinear HRV measures in older adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We evaluated serial longitudinal measures of both physical activity and 24-hour Holter HRV over 5 years among 985 older US adults in the community-based Cardiovascular Health Study. After multivariable adjustment, greater total leisure-time activity, walking distance, and walking pace were each prospectively associated with specific, more favorable HRV indices, including higher 24-hour standard deviation of all normal-to-normal intervals (<i>P</i><sub>trend</sub>=0.009, 0.02, 0.06, respectively) and ultralow-frequency power (<i>P</i><sub>trend</sub>=0.02, 0.008, 0.16, respectively). Greater walking pace was also associated with a higher short-term fractal scaling exponent (<i>P</i><sub>trend</sub>=0.003) and lower Poincaré ratio (<i>P</i><sub>trend</sub>=0.02), markers of less erratic sinus patterns.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Greater total leisure-time activity, and walking alone, as well, were prospectively associated with more favorable and specific indices of autonomic function in older adults, including several suggestive of more normal circadian fluctuations and less erratic sinoatrial firing.

12-Oxo-Phytodienoic Acid Acts as a Regulator of Maize Defense against Corn Leaf Aphid
<p>The corn leaf aphid (CLA; <i>Rhopalosiphum maidis</i>) is a phloem sap-sucking insect that attacks many cereal crops, including maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). We previously showed that the maize inbred line Mp708, which was developed by classical plant breeding, provides enhanced resistance to CLA. Here, using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electrophysiolog</span></strong>ical monitoring of aphid feeding behavior, we demonstrate that Mp708 provides phloem-mediated resistance to CLA. Furthermore, feeding by CLA on Mp708 plants enhanced callose deposition, a potential defense mechanism utilized by plants to limit aphid feeding and subsequent colonization. In maize, benzoxazinoids (BX) or BX-derived metabolites contribute to enhanced callose deposition by providing heightened resistance to CLA. However, BX and BX-derived metabolites were not significantly altered in CLA-infested Mp708 plants, indicating BX-independent defense against CLA. Evidence presented here suggests that the constitutively higher levels of 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA) in Mp708 plants contributed to enhanced callose accumulation and heightened CLA resistance. OPDA enhanced the expression of ethylene biosynthesis and receptor genes, and the synergistic interactions of OPDA and CLA feeding significantly induced the expression of the transcripts encoding Maize insect resistance1-Cysteine Protease, a key defensive protein against insect pests, in Mp708 plants. Furthermore, exogenous application of OPDA on maize jasmonic acid-deficient plants caused enhanced callose accumulation and heightened resistance to CLA, suggesting that the OPDA-mediated resistance to CLA is independent of the jasmonic acid pathway. We further demonstrate that the signaling function of OPDA, rather than a direct toxic effect, contributes to enhanced CLA resistance in Mp708.</p>

Boron Alleviates Aluminum Toxicity by Promoting Root Alkalization in Transition Zone via Polar Auxin Transport
<p>Boron (B) alleviates aluminum (Al) toxicity in higher plants; however, the underlying mechanisms behind this phenomenon remain unknown. Here, we used bromocresol green pH indicator, noninvasive microtest, and microelectrode ion flux estimation techniques to demonstrate that B promotes root surface pH gradients in pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) roots, leading to alkalization in the root transition zone and acidification in the elongation zone, while Al inhibits these pH gradients. B significantly decreased Al accumulation in the transition zone (∼1.0–2.5 mm from the apex) of lateral roots, thereby alleviating Al-induced inhibition of root elongation. Net indole acetic acid (IAA) efflux detected by an IAA-sensitive platinum microelectrode showed that polar auxin transport, which peaked in the root transition zone, was inhibited by Al toxicity, while it was partially recovered by B. Electrophysiological experiments using the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) auxin transporter mutants (<i>auxin resistant1-7</i>; <i>pin-formed2</i> [<i>pin2</i>]) and the specific polar auxin transporter inhibitor1-naphthylphthalamic acid showed that PIN2-based polar auxin transport is involved in root surface alkalization in the transition zone. Our results suggest that B promotes polar auxin transport driven by the auxin efflux transporter PIN2 and leads to the downstream regulation of the plasma membrane-H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, resulting in elevated root surface pH, which is essential to decrease Al accumulation in this Al-targeted apical root zone. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the role of exogenous B in alleviation of Al accumulation and toxicity in plants.</p>

Vacuolar Transporters – Companions on a Longtime Journey
<p>Biochemical and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electrophysiolog</span></strong>ical studies on plant vacuolar transporters became feasible in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when methods to isolate large quantities of intact vacuoles and purified vacuolar membrane vesicles were established. However, with the exception of the H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase and H<sup>+</sup>-PPase, which could be followed due to their hydrolytic activities, attempts to purify tonoplast transporters were for a long time not successful. Heterologous complementation, T-DNA insertion mutants, and later proteomic studies allowed the next steps, starting from the 1990s. Nowadays, our knowledge about vacuolar transporters has increased greatly. Nevertheless, there are several transporters of central importance that have still to be identified at the molecular level or have even not been characterized biochemically. Furthermore, our knowledge about regulation of the vacuolar transporters is very limited, and much work is needed to get a holistic view about the interplay of the vacuolar transportome. The huge amount of information generated during the last 35 years cannot be summarized in such a review. Therefore, I decided to concentrate on some aspects where we were involved during my research on vacuolar transporters, for some our laboratories contributed more, while others contributed less.</p>

Physiological Characterization of a Plant Mitochondrial Calcium Uniporter in Vitro and in Vivo<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Over the recent years, several proteins that make up the mitochondrial calcium uniporter complex (MCUC) mediating Ca<sup>2+</sup>uptake into the mitochondrial matrix have been identified in mammals, including the channel-forming protein MCU. Although six <i>MCU</i> gene homologs are conserved in the model plant Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) in which mitochondria can accumulate Ca<sup>2+</sup>, a functional characterization of plant MCU homologs has been lacking. Using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electrophysiolog</span></strong>y, we show that one isoform, AtMCU1, gives rise to a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable channel activity that can be observed even in the absence of accessory proteins implicated in the formation of the active mammalian channel. Furthermore, we provide direct evidence that AtMCU1 activity is sensitive to the mitochondrial calcium uniporter inhibitors Ruthenium Red and Gd<sup>3+</sup>, as well as to the Arabidopsis protein MICU, a regulatory MCUC component. AtMCU1 is prevalently expressed in roots, localizes to mitochondria, and its absence causes mild changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics as assessed by in vivo measurements in Arabidopsis root tips. Plants either lacking or overexpressing AtMCU1 display root mitochondria with altered ultrastructure and show shorter primary roots under restrictive growth conditions. In summary, our work adds evolutionary depth to the investigation of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport, indicates that AtMCU1, together with MICU as a regulator, represents a functional configuration of the plant mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake complex with differences to the mammalian MCUC, and identifies a new player of the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation network in plants.</p>

Cell-Type-Specific H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase Activity in Root Tissues Enables K<sup>+</sup> Retention and Mediates Acclimation of Barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) to Salinity Stress
<p>While the importance of cell type specificity in plant adaptive responses is widely accepted, only a limited number of studies have addressed this issue at the functional level. We have combined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electrophysiolog</span></strong>ical, imaging, and biochemical techniques to reveal the physiological mechanisms conferring higher sensitivity of apical root cells to salinity in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>). We show that salinity application to the root apex arrests root growth in a highly tissue- and treatment-specific manner. Although salinity-induced transient net Na<sup>+</sup> uptake was about 4-fold higher in the root apex compared with the mature zone, mature root cells accumulated more cytosolic and vacuolar Na<sup>+</sup>, suggesting that the higher sensitivity of apical cells to salt is not related to either enhanced Na<sup>+</sup> exclusion or sequestration inside the root. Rather, the above differential sensitivity between the two zones originates from a 10-fold difference in K<sup>+</sup> efflux between the mature zone and the apical region (much poorer in the root apex) of the root. Major factors contributing to this poor K<sup>+</sup> retention ability are (1) an intrinsically lower H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity in the root apex, (2) greater salt-induced membrane depolarization, and (3) a higher reactive oxygen species production under NaCl and a larger density of reactive oxygen species-activated cation currents in the apex. Salinity treatment increased (2- to 5-fold) the content of 10 (out of 25 detected) amino acids in the root apex but not in the mature zone and changed the organic acid and sugar contents. The causal link between the observed changes in the root metabolic profile and the regulation of transporter activity is discussed.</p>

Sucrose Transporter <i>ZmSut1</i> Expression and Localization Uncover New Insights into Sucrose Phloem Loading
<p>Sucrose transporters (SUTs) translocate sucrose (Suc) across cellular membranes, and in eudicots, multiple SUTs are known to function in Suc phloem loading in leaves. In maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), the <i>Sucrose Transporter1</i> (<i>ZmSut1</i>) gene has been implicated in Suc phloem loading based upon RNA expression in leaves, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electrophysiolog</span></strong>ical experiments, and phenotypic analysis of <i>zmsut1</i> mutant plants. However, no previous studies have examined the cellular expression of <i>ZmSut1</i> RNA or the subcellular localization of the ZmSUT1 protein to assess the gene’s hypothesized function in Suc phloem loading or to evaluate its potential roles, such as phloem unloading, in nonphotosynthetic tissues. To this end, we performed RNA in situ hybridization experiments, promoter-reporter gene analyses, and ZmSUT1 localization studies to elucidate the cellular expression pattern of the <i>ZmSut1</i> transcript and protein. These data showed that <i>ZmSut1</i> was expressed in multiple cell types throughout the plant and indicated that it functions in phloem companion cells to load Suc and also in other cell types to retrieve Suc from the apoplasm to prevent its accumulation and loss to the transpiration stream. Additionally, by comparing a phloem-mobile tracer with <i>ZmSut1</i> expression, we determined that developing maize leaves dynamically switch from symplasmic to apoplasmic phloem unloading, reconciling previously conflicting reports, and suggest that <i>ZmSut1</i> does not have an apparent function in either unloading process. A model for the dual roles for <i>ZmSut1</i> function (phloem loading and apoplasmic recycling), <i>Sut1</i> evolution, and its possible use to enhance Suc export from leaves in engineering C<sub>3</sub> grasses for C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis is discussed.</p>

Throughout the 24-week follow-up, there were no significant differences   in the mean grip strength between the groups, whereas the mean Semmes-Weinstein   monofilament sensory index for the control group was significantly   higher than that of the Raynaud’s phenomenon group. The mean CISSs   were not significantly different between the groups at baseline   and at 24 weeks. After 24 weeks, 11 patients (32%) in the Raynaud’s   phenomenon group and 16 (15%) in the control group required carpal   tunnel decompression (p = 0.028). Multivariable analysis indicated   that concurrent Raynaud’s phenomenon (odds ratio (OR) 2.6) and severe   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electrophysiolog</span></strong>ical grade (OR 2.1) were independently associated with   a failure of treatment after a corticosteroid injection.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Although considerable improvements in symptoms will probably   occur in patients with Raynaud’s phenomenon who have CTS, they have   higher risk of poor functional outcomes and failure of treatment   than those without Raynaud’s phenomenon.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1637–42.</p></sec>

Long-term outcome of carpal tunnel release surgery in patients with severe carpal tunnel syndrome
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Few studies have examined the long-term outcome of carpal tunnel   release (CTR). The aim of this study was to evaluate the patient-reported   long-term outcome of CTR for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electrophysiolog</span></strong>ically severe carpal   tunnel syndrome (CTS).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We reviewed the long-term outcome of 40 patients with bilateral   severe CTS who underwent 80 CTRs (46 open, 34 endoscopic) between   2002 and 2012. The outcomes studied were patient-reported outcomes   of numbness resolution, the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ)   score, and patient satisfaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean follow-up was 9.3 years. Complete resolution of numbness   was reported by 93.8% of patients, persistent numbness by 3.8%,   and recurrent numbness by 2.5%. The mean BCTQ symptom score was   1.1 (<sc>sd</sc> 0.3; 1.0 to 2.55) and the mean Boston function   score was 1.15 (<sc>sd</sc> 0.46; 1.0 to 3.5). 72.5% of patients   were asymptomatic and had no functional impairment. Men had poorer   outcomes than women and patients < 55 years had poorer outcomes   than patients ≥ 55 years. All patients who had undergone endoscopic   CTR reported complete resolution of numbness compared with 89.1%   of those who had undergone open release (p = 0.047). There was no   significant difference in outcome between dominant and non-dominant   hands. Patient satisfaction rates were good. There were no adverse events.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>CTR has a favourable outcome and good rates of satisfaction,   even in patients with bilateral severe CTS at a mean of nine years   after surgery.

Supracondylar osteotomy for the treatment of cubitus varus in children
<p>Cubitus varus is the most frequent complication   following the treatment of supracondylar humeral fractures in children.   We investigated data from publications reporting on the surgical   management of cubitus varus found in electronic searches of Ovid/MEDLINE   and Cochrane Library databases. In 894 children from 40 included   studies, the mean age at initial injury was 5.7 years (3 to 8.6)   and 9.8 years (4 to 15.7) at the time of secondary correction. The four   osteotomy techniques were classified as lateral closing wedge, dome,   complex (multiplanar) and distraction osteogenesis. A mean angular   correction of 27.6º (18.5° to 37.0°) was achieved across all classes   of osteotomy. The meta-analytical summary estimate for overall rate   of good to excellent results was 87.8% (95% CI 84.4 to 91.2). No technique   was shown to significantly affect the surgical outcome, and the   risk of complications across all osteotomy classes was 14.5% (95%   CI 10.6 to 18.5). Nerve palsies occurred in 2.53% of cases (95%   CI 1.4 to 3.6), although 78.4% were transient. No one technique   was found to be statistically safer or more effective than any other.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014;96-B:691–700.</p>

Degenerative subtalar joints complicated by medial plantar intraneural cysts
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The pathogenesis of intraneural ganglion cysts is controversial.   Recent reports in the literature described medial plantar intraneural   ganglion cysts (mIGC) with articular branches to subtalar joints.   The aim of the current study was to provide further support for   the principles underlying the articular theory, and to explain the   successes and failures of treatment of mICGs.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between 2006 and 2017, five patients with five mICGs were retrospectively   reviewed. There were five men with a mean age of 50.2 years (33   to 68) and a mean follow-up of 3.8 years (0.8 to 6). Case history,   physical examination, imaging, and intraoperative findings were   reviewed. The outcomes of interest were ultrasound and/or MRI features   of mICG, as well as the clinical outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The five intraneural cysts followed the principles of the unifying   articular theory. Connection to the posterior subtalar joint (pSTJ)   was identified or suspected in four patients. Re-evaluation of preoperative   MRI demonstrated a degenerative pSTJ and de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>ation changes in   the abductor hallucis in all patients. Cyst excision with resection   of the articular branch (four), cyst incision and drainage (one),   and percutaneous aspiration/steroid injection (two) were performed.   Removing the connection to the pSTJ prevented recurrence of mIGC,   whereas medial plantar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>es remained cystic and symptomatic when   resection of the communicating articular branch was not performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our findings support a standardized treatment algorithm for mIGC   in the presence of degenerative disease at the pSTJ. By understanding   the pathoanatomic mechanism for every cyst, we can improve treatment   that must address the articular branch to avoid the recurrence of   intraneural ganglion cysts, as well as the degenerative pSTJ to   avoid extraneural cyst formation or recurrence.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:183–9.</p></sec>

Cost-effective peri-operative pain management
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to determine the optimal regimen for   the management of pain following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) by   comparing the outcomes and cost-effectiveness of different protocols   implemented at a large, urban, academic medical centre.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between September 2013 and September 2015, we used a series of   modifications to our standard regimen for the management of pain   after TKA. In May 2014, there was a department-wide transition from   protocols focused on femoral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e blocks (FNB) to periarticular   injections of liposomal bupivacaine. In February 2015, patient-controlled analgesia   (PCA) was removed from the protocol while continuing liposomal bupivacaine   injections. Quality measures and hospital costs were compared between   the three protocols.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The cohort being treated with PCA-less liposomal bupivacaine   injections had a significantly higher percentage of patients who   were discharged to their home (p = 0.010) and a significantly shorter   length of stay (p < 0.001). Patient-reported Hospital Consumer   Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) scores relating   to pain being “well-controlled” and “overall pain management” also   favoured this cohort (p = 0.214 and p = 0.463, respectively), in   which cost was significantly lower compared with the other two cohorts   (p = 0.005).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The replacement of FNBs injections and the removal of PCAs, both   of which are known to be associated with high rates of adverse outcomes,   and the addition of liposomal bupivacaine periarticular injections   to a multimodal pain regimen, led to improvements in many quality   measures, HCAHPS pain scores, and cost-effectiveness.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B(1   Supple A):55–61.</p></sec>

An atrial-fibrillation-linked connexin40 mutant is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and impairs the function of atrial gap-junction channels
<p>Connexin40 (Cx40)-containing gap-junction channels are expressed in the atrial myocardium and provide a low-resistance passage for rapid impulse propagation. A germline mutation in the <i>GJA5</i> gene, which encodes Cx40, resulting in a truncated Cx40 (Q49X) was identified in a large Chinese family with lone (idiopathic) atrial fibrillation (AF). This mutation co-segregated with seven AF probands in an autosomal-dominant way over generations. To test the hypothesis that this Cx40 mutant affects the distribution and function of atrial gap junctions, we studied the Q49X mutant in gap-junction-deficient HeLa and N2A cells. The Q49X mutant, unlike wild-type Cx40, was typically localized in the cytoplasm and failed to form gap-junction plaques at cell-cell interfaces. When the Q49X mutant was co-expressed with Cx40 or Cx43, the mutant substantially reduced the gap-junction plaque formation of Cx40 and Cx43. Electrophysiological studies revealed no electrical coupling of cell pairs expressing the mutant alone and a significant decrease in the coupling conductance when the mutant was co-expressed with Cx40 or Cx43. Further colocalization experiments with the organelle residential proteins indicate that Q49X was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. These findings provide evidence that the Q49X mutant is capable of impairing gap-junction distribution and function of key atrial connexins, which might play a role in the predisposition to and onset of AF.</p>

Functional and histopathological identification of the respiratory failure in a DMSXL transgenic mouse model of myotonic dystrophy
<p>Acute and chronic respiratory failure is one of the major and potentially life-threatening features in individuals with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). Despite several clinical demonstrations showing respiratory problems in DM1 patients, the mechanisms are still not completely understood. This study was designed to investigate whether the DMSXL transgenic mouse model for DM1 exhibits respiratory disorders and, if so, to identify the pathological changes underlying these respiratory problems. Using pressure plethysmography, we assessed the breathing function in control mice and DMSXL mice generated after large expansions of the CTG repeat in successive generations of DM1 transgenic mice. Statistical analysis of breathing function measurements revealed a significant decrease in the most relevant respiratory parameters in DMSXL mice, indicating impaired respiratory function. Histological and morphometric analysis showed pathological changes in diaphragmatic muscle of DMSXL mice, characterized by an increase in the percentage of type I muscle fibers, the presence of central nuclei, partial de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>ation of end-plates (EPs) and a significant reduction in their size, shape complexity and density of acetylcholine receptors, all of which reflect a possible breakdown in communication between the diaphragmatic muscles fibers and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e terminals. Diaphragm muscle abnormalities were accompanied by an accumulation of mutant DMPK RNA foci in muscle fiber nuclei. Moreover, in DMSXL mice, the unmyelinated phrenic afferents are significantly lower. Also in these mice, significant neuronopathy was not detected in either cervical phrenic motor neurons or brainstem respiratory neurons. Because EPs are involved in the transmission of action potentials and the unmyelinated phrenic afferents exert a modulating influence on the respiratory drive, the pathological alterations affecting these structures might underlie the respiratory impairment detected in DMSXL mice. Understanding mechanisms of respiratory deficiency should guide pharmaceutical and clinical research towards better therapy for the respiratory deficits associated with DM1.</p>

Carbon dynamics of <i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i> seedlings under drought and complete darkness
<p>Carbon (C) storage is considered a key component to plant survival under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> and shade, although the combined effects of these factors on survival remain poorly understood. We investigated how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> and shade alter the C dynamics and survival of tree seedlings, and whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> limits the access to or usage of stored C. We experimentally applied two levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> humidity (well-watered versus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>, the latter induced by dry-down) and light availability (light versus complete darkness) on 1-year-old seedlings of <i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i> L. for 3 months. We quantified the survival, biomass, growth rate and non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) of seedlings at their time of death or at the end of the experiment for those that survived. We found that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> dried out faster when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> was combined with light than when it was combined with complete darkness. Seedlings subjected to both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> and light showed reduced growth and reached 100% mortality earlier than any other treatment, with the highest NSC concentrations at the time of death. Seedlings exposed to both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> and complete darkness died significantly earlier than seedlings exposed to complete darkness only, but had similar NSC concentrations at time of their death, suggesting that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> accelerated the use of stored C under complete darkness. Complete darkness significantly reduced seedling growth and whole-plant NSC concentrations regardless of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> humidity, while root NSC concentrations were significantly more reduced when complete darkness was combined with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> conditions. Thus, the C dynamics in <i>A. pseudoplatanus</i> seedlings under complete darkness was not hindered by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>, i.e., the access and use of stored C was not limited by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>. The contrasting growth and C storage responses driven by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> under light versus complete darkness are consistent with a key role of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> progression in the C dynamics of trees.</p>

Root Tip Shape Governs Root Elongation Rate under Increased Soil Strength
<p>Increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> strength due to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> compaction or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> drying is a major limitation to root growth and crop productivity. Roots need to exert higher penetration force, resulting in increased penetration stress when elongating in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s of greater strength. This study aimed to quantify how the genotypic diversity of root tip geometry and root diameter influences root elongation under different levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> strength and to determine the extent to which roots adjust to increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> strength. Fourteen wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) varieties were grown in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> columns packed to three bulk densities representing low, moderate, and high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> strength. Under moderate and high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> strength, smaller root tip radius-to-length ratio was correlated with higher genotypic root elongation rate, whereas root diameter was not related to genotypic root elongation. Based on cavity expansion theory, it was found that smaller root tip radius-to-length ratio reduced penetration stress, thus enabling higher root elongation rates in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s with greater strength. Furthermore, it was observed that roots could only partially adjust to increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> strength. Root thickening was bounded by a maximum diameter, and root tips did not become more acute in response to increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> strength. The obtained results demonstrated that root tip geometry is a pivotal trait governing root penetration stress and root elongation rate in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s of greater strength. Hence, root tip shape needs to be taken into account when selecting for crop varieties that may tolerate high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> strength.</p>

Differential radial growth patterns between beech (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i> L.) and oak (<i>Quercus robur</i> L.) on periodically waterlogged soils
<p>Climate scenarios for northern Central Europe project rising temperatures and increasing frequency and intensity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>s but also a shift in precipitation pattern with more humid winters. This in turn may result in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> waterlogging during the following spring, leading to increasing stress for trees growing on hydric sites. The influence of waterlogging on growth of common beech and pedunculate oak has been studied intensively on seedlings under experimental conditions. However, the question remains whether results of these studies can be transferred to mature trees growing under natural conditions. To test this, we investigated general growth patterns and climate–growth relationships in four mature stands of beech and oak growing on hydromorphic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s (Stagnosols) in northeast Germany using dendrochronological methods. Our results confirmed the expected tolerance of oak to strong water-level fluctuations. Neither extremely wet conditions during spring nor summer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>s significantly affected its radial growth. Oak growth responded positively to warmer temperatures during previous year October and March of the current year of ring formation. Contrary to our expectations, also beech showed relatively low sensitivity to periods of high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> water saturation. Instead, summer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> turned out to be the main climatic factor influencing ring width of beech even under the specific periodically wet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> conditions of our study. This became evident from general climate–growth correlations over the last century as well as from discontinuous (pointer year) analysis with summer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> being significantly correlated to the occurrence of growth depressions. As ring width of the two species is affected by differing climate parameters, species-specific chronologies show no coherence in high-frequency variations even for trees growing in close proximity. We assume differences in rooting depth as the main reason for the differing growth patterns and climate correlations of the two species under study. Our results indicate that under the projected future climate scenarios, beech may suffer from increasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress even on hydromorphic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s. Oak might be able to maintain a sufficient hydraulic status during summer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>s by reaching water in deeper <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> strata with its root system. Wet phases with waterlogged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> conditions during spring or summer appear to have only a little direct influence on radial growth of both species.</p>

The Arabidopsis DNA Methylome Is Stable under Transgenerational Drought Stress
<p>Improving the responsiveness, acclimation, and memory of plants to abiotic stress holds substantive potential for improving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">agricultur</span></strong>e. An unresolved question is the involvement of chromatin marks in the memory of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">agricultur</span></strong>ally relevant stresses. Such potential has spurred numerous investigations yielding both promising and conflicting results. Consequently, it remains unclear to what extent robust stress-induced DNA methylation variation can underpin stress memory. Using a slow-onset water deprivation treatment in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), we investigated the malleability of the DNA methylome to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress within a generation and under repeated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress over five successive generations. While <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-associated epi-alleles in the methylome were detected within a generation, they did not correlate with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-responsive gene expression. Six traits were analyzed for transgenerational stress memory, and the descendants of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-stressed lineages showed one case of memory in the form of increased seed dormancy, and that persisted one generation removed from stress. With respect to transgenerational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress, there were negligible conserved differentially methylated regions in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-exposed lineages compared with unstressed lineages. Instead, the majority of observed variation was tied to stochastic or preexisting differences in the epigenome occurring at repetitive regions of the Arabidopsis genome. Furthermore, the experience of repeated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress was not observed to influence transgenerational epi-allele accumulation. Our findings demonstrate that, while transgenerational memory is observed in one of six traits examined, they are not associated with causative changes in the DNA methylome, which appears relatively impervious to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress.</p>

Tree Physiology
Temperate tree species show identical response in tree water deficit but different sensitivities in sap flow to summer soil drying
<p>Temperate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>s are expected to be particularly vulnerable to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> drying because they are not adapted to such conditions and perform best in mesic environments. Here we ask (i) how sensitively four common temperate tree species (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i>, <i>Picea abies</i>, <i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i> and <i>Fraxinus excelsior</i>) respond in their water relations to summer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> drying and seek to determine (ii) if species-specific responses to summer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> drying are related to the onset of declining water status across the four species. Throughout 2012 and 2013 we determined tree water deficit (TWD) as a proxy for tree water status from recorded stem radius changes and monitored sap flow rates with sensors on 16 mature trees studied in the field at Lageren, Switzerland. All tree species responded equally in their relative maximum TWD to the onset of declining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> moisture. This implies that the water supply of all tree species was affected by declining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> moisture and that none of the four species was able to fully maintain its water status, e.g., by access to alternative water sources in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>. In contrast we found strong and highly species-specific responses of sap flow to declining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> moisture with the strongest decline in <i>P. abies</i> (92%), followed by <i>F. sylvatica</i> (53%) and <i>A. pseudoplatanus</i> (48%). <i>F. excelsior</i> did not significantly reduce sap flow. We hypothesize the species-specific responses in sap flow to declining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> moisture that occur despite a simultaneous increase in relative TWD in all species reflect how fast these species approach critical levels of their water status, which is most likely influenced by species-specific traits determining the hydraulic properties of the species tree.</p>

Classifying drivers of global forest loss
<p>Global maps of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> loss depict the scale and magnitude of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> disturbance, yet companies, governments, and nongovernmental organizations need to distinguish permanent conversion (i.e., <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong></span></strong>ation) from temporary loss from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>ry or wildfire. Using satellite imagery, we developed a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> loss classification model to determine a spatial attribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> disturbance to the dominant drivers of land cover and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land us</span></strong>e change over the period 2001 to 2015. Our results indicate that 27% of global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> loss can be attributed to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong></span></strong>ation through permanent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land us</span></strong>e change for commodity production.

Natural Variation in <i>OsLG3</i> Increases Drought Tolerance in Rice by Inducing ROS Scavenging
<p>Improving the performance of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress has the potential to significantly affect rice productivity. Here, we report that the ERF family transcription factor OsLG3 positively regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> tolerance in rice. In our previous work, we found that <i>OsLG3</i> has a positive effect on rice grain length without affecting grain quality. In this study, we found that <i>OsLG3</i> was more strongly expressed in upland rice than in lowland rice under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress conditions. By performing candidate gene association analysis, we found that natural variation in the promoter of <i>OsLG3</i> is associated with tolerance to osmotic stress in germinating rice seeds. Overexpression of <i>OsLG3</i> significantly improved the tolerance of rice plants to simulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>, whereas suppression of <i>OsLG3</i> resulted in greater susceptibility. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the tolerant allele of <i>OsLG3</i> may improve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> tolerance in cultivated <i>japonica</i> rice. Introgression lines and complementation transgenic lines containing the elite allele of <i>OsLG3</i><sup>IRAT109</sup> showed increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> tolerance, demonstrating that natural variation in <i>OsLG3</i> contributes to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> tolerance in rice. Further investigation suggested that <i>OsLG3</i> plays a positive role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress tolerance in rice by inducing reactive oxygen species scavenging. Collectively, our findings reveal that natural variation in <i>OsLG3</i> contributes to rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> tolerance and that the elite allele of <i>OsLG3</i> is a promising genetic resource for the development of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-tolerant rice varieties.</p>

Dead or Alive? Using Membrane Failure and Chlorophyll <i>a</i> Fluorescence to Predict Plant Mortality from Drought
<p>Climate models predict widespread increases in both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> intensity and duration in the next decades. Although water deficiency is a significant determinant of plant survival, limited understanding of plant responses to extreme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> impedes forecasts of both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> and crop productivity under increasing aridity. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> induces a suite of physiological responses; however, we lack an accurate mechanistic description of plant response to lethal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> that would improve predictive understanding of mortality under altered climate conditions. Here, proxies for leaf cellular damage, chlorophyll <i>a</i> fluorescence, and electrolyte leakage were directly associated with failure to recover from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> upon rewatering in <i>Brassica</i> <i>rapa</i> (genotype R500) and thus define the exact timing of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-induced death. We validated our results using a second genotype (imb211) that differs substantially in life history traits. Our study demonstrates that whereas changes in carbon dynamics and water transport are critical indicators of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress, they can be unrelated to visible metrics of mortality, i.e. lack of meristematic activity and regrowth. In contrast, membrane failure at the cellular scale is the most proximate cause of death. This hypothesis was corroborated in two gymnosperms (<i>Picea engelmannii</i> and <i>Pinus contorta</i>) that experienced lethal water stress in the field and in laboratory conditions. We suggest that measurement of chlorophyll <i>a</i> fluorescence can be used to operationally define plant death arising from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>, and improved plant characterization can enhance surface model predictions of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> mortality and its consequences to ecosystem services at a global scale.</p>

Above- and belowground controls on water use by trees of different wood types in an eastern US deciduous forest
<p>Stomata control tree transpiration by sensing and integrating environmental signals originating in the atmosphere and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>, and co-occurring species may differ in inherent stomatal sensitivity to these above- and belowground signals and in the types of signals to which they respond. Stomatal responsiveness to environmental signals is likely to differ across species having different types of wood (e.g., ring-porous, diffuse-porous and coniferous) because each wood type differs in the structure, size and spatial distribution of its xylem conduits as well as in the scaling of hydraulic properties with stem diameter. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of variation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> water availability and atmospheric evaporative demand on stomatal regulation of transpiration in seven co-occurring temperate deciduous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> species representing three wood types. We measured whole-tree sap flux and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> and atmospheric variables in a mixed deciduous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> in central Pennsylvania over the course of a growing season characterized by severe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> and large fluctuations in atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (<i>D</i>). The relative sensitivity of sap flux to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> drying was ∼2.2–2.3 times greater in the diffuse-porous and coniferous species than in the ring-porous species. Stomata of the ring-porous oaks were only about half as responsive to increased <i>D</i> as those of trees of the other two wood types. These differences in responsiveness to changes in the below- and aboveground environment implied that regulation of leaf water potential in the ring-porous oaks was less stringent than that in the diffuse-porous angiosperms or the conifers. The results suggest that increases in the frequency or intensity of summer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>s in the study region could have multiple consequences for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> function, including altered successional time courses or climax species composition and cumulative effects on whole-tree architecture, resulting in a structural and physiological legacy that would restrict the ability of trees to respond rapidly to more favorable growth conditions.</p>

The Accumulation of miRNAs Differentially Modulated by Drought Stress Is Affected by Grafting in Grapevine
<p>Grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) is routinely grafted, and rootstocks inducing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> tolerance represent a source for adapting vineyards to climate change in temperate areas. Our goal was to investigate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress effects on microRNA (miRNA) abundance in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-resistant grapevine rootstock, M4 (<i>Vitis vinifera</i> × <i>Vitis berlandieri</i>), compared with a commercial cultivar, Cabernet Sauvignon, using their autografts and reciprocal grafts. RNA extracted from roots and leaves of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>ed and irrigated plants of different graft combinations was used to prepare cDNA libraries for small RNA sequencing and to analyze miRNAs by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Measurements of leaf water potential, leaf gas exchange, and root hydraulic conductance attested that, under irrigation, M4 reduced water loss in comparison with cultivar Cabernet Sauvignon mostly through nonhydraulic, root-specific mechanisms. Under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>, stomatal conductance decreased at similar levels in the two genotypes. Small RNA sequencing allowed the identification of 70 conserved miRNAs and the prediction of 28 novel miRNAs. Different accumulation trends of miRNAs, observed upon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> and in different genotypes and organs, were confirmed by RT-qPCR. Corresponding target transcripts, predicted in silico and validated by RT-qPCR, often showed opposite expression profiles than the related miRNAs. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> effects on miRNA abundance differed between the two genotypes. Furthermore, the concentration of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-responsive miRNAs in each genotype was affected by reciprocal grafting, suggesting either the movement of signals inducing miRNA expression in the graft partner or, possibly, miRNA transport between scion and rootstock. These results open new perspectives in the selection of rootstocks for improving grapevine adaptation to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>.</p>

Mechanical Failure of Fine Root Cortical Cells Initiates Plant Hydraulic Decline during Drought
<p>Root systems perform the crucial task of absorbing water from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> to meet the demands of a transpiring canopy. Roots are thought to operate like electrical fuses, which break when carrying an excessive load under conditions of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress. Yet the exact site and sequence of this dysfunction in roots remain elusive. Using in vivo x-ray computed microtomography, we found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-induced mechanical failure (i.e. lacunae formation) in fine root cortical cells is the initial and primary driver of reduced fine root hydraulic conductivity (Lp<sub>r</sub>) under mild to moderate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress. Cortical lacunae started forming under mild <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress (−0.6 MPa Ψ<sub>stem</sub>), coincided with a dramatic reduction in Lp<sub>r</sub>, and preceded root shrinkage or significant xylem embolism. Only under increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress was embolism formation observed in the root xylem, and it appeared first in the fine roots (50% loss of hydraulic conductivity [P<sub>50</sub>] reached at −1.8 MPa) and then in older, coarse roots (P<sub>50</sub> = −3.5 MPa). These results suggest that cortical cells in fine roots function like hydraulic fuses that decouple plants from drying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>, thus preserving the hydraulic integrity of the plant’s vascular system under early stages of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress. Cortical lacunae formation led to permanent structural damage of the root cortex and nonrecoverable Lp<sub>r</sub>, pointing to a role in fine root mortality and turnover under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress.</p>

Termites mitigate the effects of drought in tropical rainforest
<p>Termites perform key ecological functions in tropical ecosystems, are strongly affected by variation in rainfall, and respond negatively to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">habitat</span></strong> disturbance. However, it is not known how the projected increase in frequency and severity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>s in tropical rain<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>s will alter termite communities and the maintenance of ecosystem processes. Using a large-scale termite suppression experiment, we found that termite activity and abundance increased during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> in a Bornean <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>.

Long-term pattern and magnitude of soil carbon feedback to the climate system in a warming world
<p>In a 26-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> warming experiment in a mid-latitude hardwood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>, we documented changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> carbon cycling to investigate the potential consequences for the climate system. We found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> warming results in a four-phase pattern of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> organic matter decay and carbon dioxide fluxes to the atmosphere, with phases of substantial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> carbon loss alternating with phases of no detectable loss. Several factors combine to affect the timing, magnitude, and thermal acclimation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> carbon loss. These include depletion of microbially accessible carbon pools, reductions in microbial biomass, a shift in microbial carbon use efficiency, and changes in microbial community composition. Our results support projections of a long-term, self-reinforcing carbon feedback from mid-latitude <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>s to the climate system as the world warms.</p>

The whole-soil carbon flux in response to warming

Due to the difficulties associated with visualization and data analysis, there is currently a poor understanding of the genetic players and molecular mechanisms involved in the root architecture of apple trees under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> conditions. We previously observed that MdMYB88 and its paralog MdMYB124 regulate apple tree root morphology. In this study, we found that MdMYB88 and MdMYB124 play important roles in maintaining root hydraulic conductivity under long-term <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> conditions and therefore contribute toward adaptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> tolerance. Further investigation revealed that MdMYB88 and MdMYB124 regulate root xylem development by directly binding <i>MdVND6</i> and <i>MdMYB46</i> promoters and thus influence expression of their target genes under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> conditions. In addition, MdMYB88 and MdMYB124 were shown to regulate the deposition of cellulose and lignin root cell walls in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>. Taken together, our results provide novel insights into the importance of MdMYB88 and MdMYB124 in root architecture, root xylem development, and secondary cell wall deposition in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> in apple trees.</p>

Limited acclimation in leaf anatomy to experimental drought in tropical rainforest trees
<p>Dry periods are predicted to become more frequent and severe in the future in some parts of the tropics, including Amazonia, potentially causing reduced productivity, higher tree mortality and increased emissions of stored carbon. Using a long-term (12 year) through-fall exclusion (TFE) experiment in the tropics, we test the hypothesis that trees produce leaves adapted to cope with higher levels of water stress, by examining the following leaf characteristics: area, thickness, leaf mass per area, vein density, stomatal density, the thickness of palisade mesophyll, spongy mesophyll and both of the epidermal layers, internal cavity volume and the average cell sizes of the palisade and spongy mesophyll. We also test whether differences in leaf anatomy are consistent with observed differential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-induced mortality responses among taxa, and look for relationships between leaf anatomy, and leaf water relations and gas exchange parameters. Our data show that trees do not produce leaves that are more xeromorphic in response to 12 years of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> moisture deficit. However, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> treatment did result in increases in the thickness of the adaxial epidermis (TFE: 20.5 ± 1.5 µm, control: 16.7 ± 1.0 µm) and the internal cavity volume (TFE: 2.43 ± 0.50 mm<sup>3</sup> cm<sup>−2</sup>, control: 1.77 ± 0.30 mm<sup>3 </sup>cm<sup>−2</sup>). No consistent differences were detected between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-resistant and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-sensitive taxa, although interactions occurred between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-sensitivity status and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> treatment for the palisade mesophyll thickness (<i>P</i> = 0.034) and the cavity volume of the leaves (<i>P</i> = 0.025). The limited response to water deficit probably reflects a tight co-ordination between leaf morphology, water relations and photosynthetic properties. This suggests that there is little plasticity in these aspects of plant anatomy in these taxa, and that phenotypic plasticity in leaf traits may not facilitate the acclimation of Amazonian trees to the predicted future reductions in dry season water availability.</p>

Winter drought impairs xylem phenology, anatomy and growth in Mediterranean Scots pine forests
<p>Continental Mediterranean <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>s face <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> but also cold spells and both climate extremes can impair the resilience capacity of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>s. Climate warming could amplify the negative effects of cold spells by inducing premature dehardening. Here we capitalize on a winter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-induced dieback triggered by a cold spell which occurred in December 2001 affecting Scots pine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>s in eastern Spain. We assessed post-dieback recovery by quantifying and comparing radial growth and xylem anatomy of non-declining (ND, crown cover >50%) and declining (D, crown cover ≤50%) trees in two sites (VP, Villarroya de los Pinares; TO, Torrijas). We also characterized xylogenesis in both sites and aboveground productivity in site VP. Dieback caused legacy effects since needle loss, a 60% reduction in litter fall and radial-growth decline characterized D-trees 3 years after dieback symptoms started appearing in spring 2002. D-trees formed collapsed tracheids in the 2002-ring, particularly in the most affected VP site where xylogenesis differences between ND and D trees were most noticeable. The lower growth rates of D-trees were caused by a shorter duration of their major xylogenesis phases. In site VP the radial-enlargement and wall-thickening of tracheids were significantly reduced in D-trees as compared to ND-trees because these xylogenesis phases tended to start earlier and end later in ND-trees. Gompertz models fitted to tracheid production predicted that maximum growth rates occurred 11–12 days earlier in ND than in D-trees. The formation of radially-enlarging tracheids was enhanced by longer days in both study sites and also by wetter conditions in the driest TO site, but xylogenesis sensitivity to climate was reduced in D-trees. Winter-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> dieback impairs xylem anatomy and phenology, aboveground productivity, xylogenesis and growth in Mediterranean Scots pine populations. Affected stands show a costly post-dieback recovery challenging their resilience ability.</p>

Impact of summer drought on isoprenoid emissions and carbon sink of three Scots pine provenances
<p>Scots pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i> L.) provenances cover broad ecological amplitudes. In a greenhouse study, we investigated the impact of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress and rewetting on gas exchange for three provenances (Italy: Emilia Romagna; Spain: Alto Ebro; Germany: East-German lowlands) of 2-year old Scots pine seedlings. CO<sub>2</sub>, water vapour and isoprenoid exchange of stressed and control trees were quantified with a four-chamber dynamic-enclosure system in the controlled environment of a climate chamber. The three provenances showed distinct isoprenoid emission patterns and were classified into a non-Δ<sup>3</sup>-carene, with either high α-/β-pinene or β-myrcene fraction, and a Δ<sup>3</sup>-carene dominated type. Isoprenoid emission rates, net-photosynthesis and transpiration were reduced during summer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress and significantly recovered after rewetting. A seasonal increase of isoprenoid emission rates towards autumn was observed for all control groups. Compared with the German provenance, the Spanish and Italian provenances revealed higher isoprenoid emission rates and more plastic responses to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress and seasonal development, which points to a local adaptation to climate. As a result of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>, net carbon uptake and transpiration of trees was reduced, but recovered after rewetting. We conclude from our study that Scots pine isoprenoid emission is more variable than expected and sensitive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> periods, likely impacting regional air chemistry. Thus, a provenance-specific emission assessment accounting for reduced emission during prolonged (summer) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> is recommend for setting up biogenic volatile organic compound emission inventories used in air quality models.</p>

Acclimation of <i>Betula alleghaniensis</i> Britton to moderate soil water deficit: small morphological changes make for important consequences in crown display
<p>In the context of the predicted increasing frequency of summer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>s in the northeastern deciduous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> of North America due to climate change, we investigated the acclimation capacity of yellow birch, an economically important native tree species, to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> water deficit. We carried out an integrated examination of allocation of biomass, leaf physiology, branching pattern and in situ 3D crown display. Potted seedlings were subjected to moderate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> water deficit for four consecutive months during their second growing season. Individuals under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> water deficit showed a 40% decrease in biomass accumulation but no change in the relative allocation of biomass to the different plant compartments. Net CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rates at leaf level decreased under water deficit (~15%) but could not alone explain the total reduction in growth, excluding the carbon starvation hypothesis. The observed reduction in net CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rates was related to a decrease in stomatal conductance and chlorophyll content. <i>STAR</i><sub>zen</sub> (in situ silhouette to total leaf area ratio; a proxy for light interception efficiency) decreased under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> water deficit due to shifts in biomass allocation within the branch compartment from long upper axes to short bottom axes. Despite the fact that the understanding of the processes involved in growth reduction and branching pattern alteration will need more attention in future research, we conclude that under water deficit yellow birch at young stages will: (i) experience a substantial loss of growth and biomass; and (ii) acclimate through architectural plasticity rather than through changes in the relative allocation of root biomass to enhance its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water manag</span></strong>ement.</p>

A global atlas of the dominant bacteria found in soil
<p>The immense diversity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> bacterial communities has stymied efforts to characterize individual taxa and document their global distributions.

Plant-soil feedbacks and mycorrhizal type influence temperate forest population dynamics
<p>Feedback with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> biota is an important determinant of terrestrial plant diversity. However, the factors regulating plant-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> feedback, which varies from positive to negative among plant species, remain uncertain. In a large-scale study involving 55 species and 550 populations of North American trees, the type of mycorrhizal association explained much of the variation in plant-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> feedbacks. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> collected beneath conspecifics, arbuscular mycorrhizal trees experienced negative feedback, whereas ectomycorrhizal trees displayed positive feedback. Additionally, arbuscular mycorrhizal trees exhibited strong conspecific inhibition at multiple spatial scales, whereas ectomycorrhizal trees exhibited conspecific facilitation locally and less severe conspecific inhibition regionally. These results suggest that mycorrhizal type, through effects on plant-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> feedbacks, could be an important contributor to population regulation and community structure in temperate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>s.</p>

Plant-soil feedback and the maintenance of diversity in Mediterranean-climate shrublands

Plant responses to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> biota varied according to their nutrient-acquisition strategy, including positive feedback for ectomycorrhizal plants and negative feedback for nitrogen-fixing and nonmycorrhizal plants.

BES/BZR Transcription Factor TaBZR2 Positively Regulates Drought Responses by Activation of <i>TaGST1</i>
<p>BRI1-EMS suppressor (BES)/brassinazole-resistant (BZR) family transcription factors are involved in a variety of physiological processes, but the biological functions of some BES/BZR transcription factors remain unknown; moreover, it is not clear if any of these proteins function in the regulation of plant stress responses. Here, wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) brassinazole-resistant 2 (<i>TaBZR2</i>)-overexpressing plants exhibited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> tolerant phenotypes, whereas downregulation of <i>TaBZR2</i> in wheat by RNA interference resulted in elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> sensitivity. electrophoretic mobility shift assay and luciferase reporter analysis illustrate that TaBZR2 directly interacts with the gene promoter to activate the expression of <i>T. aestivum</i> glutathione s-transferase-1 (<i>TaGST1</i>), which functions positively in scavenging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-induced superoxide anions (O<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>). Moreover, TaBZR2 acts as a positive regulator in brassinosteroid (BR) signaling. Exogenous BR treatment enhanced TaBZR2-mediated O<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> scavenging and antioxidant enzyme gene expression. Taken together, we demonstrate that a BES/BZR family transcription factor, TaBZR2, functions positively in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> responses by activating <i>TaGST1</i> and mediates the crosstalk between BR and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> signaling pathways. Our results thus provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying how BES/BZR family transcription factors contribute to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> tolerance in wheat.</p>

Spatiotemporal Coupling of Vessel Cavitation and Discharge of Stored Xylem Water in a Tree Sapling
<p>Water discharge from stem internal storage compartments is thought to minimize the risk of vessel cavitation. Based on this concept, one would expect that water storage compartments involved in the buffering of xylem tensions empty before the onset of vessel cavitation under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress, and potentially refill after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> saturation. However, scant in vivo data exist that elucidate this localized spatiotemporal coupling. In this study on intact saplings of American chestnut (<i>Castanea dentata</i>), x-ray computed microtomography (microCT) showed that the xylem matrix surrounding vessels releases stored water and becomes air-filled either concurrent to or after vessel cavitation under progressive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress. Among annual growth rings, the xylem matrix of the current year remained largely water-filled even under severe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress. In comparison, microtomography images collected on excised stems showed that applied pressures of much greater than 0 MPa were required to induce water release from the xylem matrix. Viability staining highlighted that water release from the xylem matrix was associated primarily with emptying of dead fibers. Refilling of the xylem matrix and vessels was detected in intact saplings when the canopy was bagged and stem water potential was close to 0 MPa, and in leafless saplings over the winter period. In conclusion, this study indicates that the bulk of water stored in the xylem matrix is released after the onset of vessel cavitation, and suggests that capillary water contributes to overall stem water storage under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> but is not used primarily for the prevention of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-induced vessel cavitation in this species.</p>

VAMP711 Is Required for Abscisic Acid-Mediated Inhibition of Plasma Membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase Activity
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress is a limiting environmental factor that affects plant growth and development. The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays an important role in plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> responses. Previous studies have indicated that ABA inhibits plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase) activity, and the decrease in PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity promotes stomatal closure under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress, thereby reducing water loss. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not well understood. In this study, we found that in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), ABA induces an <i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor protein, namely, VESICLE-ASSOCIATED MEMBRANE PROTEIN 711 (VAMP711), to interact with the Arabidopsis PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases AHA1 and AHA2. The interaction occurs at their C-termini and inhibits PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity. Deletion of <i>VAMP711</i> in Arabidopsis results in a higher PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity and slower stomatal closure in response to ABA and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> treatments. In addition, overexpression of <i>VAMP711</i> partially rescues the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-sensitive phenotype of <i>ost2-2D</i>, a mutation in <i>AHA1</i> resulting in a constitutive activated PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase. Our results demonstrate that VAMP711 is involved in regulating ABA-mediated inhibition of PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity and stomatal closure in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress.</p>

An Ancestral Allele of <i>Pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase1</i> Promotes Proline Accumulation and Drought Adaptation in Cultivated Barley
<p>Water scarcity is a critical threat to global crop production. Here, we used the natural diversity of barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) to dissect the genetic control of proline (Pro) mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress adaptation. Genetic mapping and positional cloning of a major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-inducible quantitative trait locus (<i>QPro.S42-1H</i>) revealed unique allelic variation in <i>pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase</i> (<i>P5cs1</i>) between the cultivated cultivar Scarlett (ssp. <i>vulgare</i>) and the wild barley accession ISR42-8 (ssp. <i>spontaneum</i>). The putative causative mutations were located in the promoter of <i>P5cs1</i> across the DNA binding motifs for abscisic acid-responsive element binding transcription factors. Introgression line (IL) S42IL-143 carrying the wild allele of <i>P5cs1</i> showed significant up-regulation of <i>P5cs1</i> expression compared to Scarlett, which was consistent with variation in Pro accumulation under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>. Next, we transiently expressed promoter::reporter constructs of ISR42-8 and Scarlett alleles in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mesophyll protoplasts. GUS expression analysis showed a significantly higher activation of the ISR42-8 promoter compared to Scarlett upon abscisic acid treatment. Notably, the ISR42-8 promoter activity was impaired in protoplasts isolated from the loss-of-function <i>abf1abf2abf3abf4</i> quadruple mutant. A series of phenotypic evaluations demonstrated that S42IL-143 maintained leaf water content and photosynthetic activity longer than Scarlett under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>. These findings suggest that the ancestral variant of <i>P5cs1</i> has the potential for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> tolerance and understanding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> physiology of barley and related crops.</p>

SIAMESE-RELATED1 Is Regulated Posttranslationally and Participates in Repression of Leaf Growth under Moderate Drought
<p>The plant cell cycle is tightly regulated by factors that integrate endogenous cues and environmental signals to adapt plant growth to changing conditions. Under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>, cell division in young leaves is blocked by an active mechanism, reducing the evaporative surface and conserving energy resources. The molecular function of cyclin-dependent kinase-inhibitory proteins (CKIs) in regulating the cell cycle has already been well studied, but little is known about their involvement in cell cycle regulation under adverse growth conditions. In this study, we show that the transcript of the CKI gene <i>SIAMESE-RELATED1</i> (<i>SMR1</i>) is quickly induced under moderate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> in young Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves. Functional characterization further revealed that SMR1 inhibits cell division and affects meristem activity, thereby restricting the growth of leaves and roots. Moreover, we demonstrate that SMR1 is a short-lived protein that is degraded by the 26S proteasome after being ubiquitinated by a Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase. Consequently, overexpression of a more stable variant of the SMR1 protein leads to a much stronger phenotype than overexpression of the native SMR1. Under moderate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>, both the <i>SMR1</i> transcript and SMR1 protein accumulate. Despite this induction, <i>smr1</i> mutants do not show overall tolerance to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress but do show less growth inhibition of young leaves under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>. Surprisingly, the growth-repressive hormone ethylene promotes <i>SMR1</i> induction, but the classical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> hormone abscisic acid does not.</p>

The E3 Ligase TaSAP5 Alters Drought Stress Responses by Promoting the Degradation of DRIP Proteins
<p>In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants growing under normal conditions, DEHYDRATION-RESPONSIVE ELEMENT BINDING PROTEIN2A (DREB2A) is present at low levels because it is ubiquitinated and destabilized by DREB2A INTERACTING PROTEIN1 (DRIP1) and DRIP2 through 26S proteasome-mediated proteolysis. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress counteracts the ubiquitination and proteolysis of DREB2A, thus allowing the accumulation of sufficient amounts of DREB2A protein to activate downstream gene expression. The mechanisms leading to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress-mediated DREB2A accumulation are still unclear. Here, we report that the wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) TaSAP5 protein, which contains an A20/AN1 domain, acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to mediate DRIP degradation and thus increase DREB2A protein levels. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> induces <i>TaSAP5</i> expression in wheat, and <i>TaSAP5</i> overexpression in Arabidopsis and wheat seedlings increased their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> tolerance, as measured by survival rate and grain yield under severe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress. TaSAP5 can interact with and ubiquitinate TaDRIP, as well as AtDRIP1 and AtDRIP2, leading to their subsequent degradation through the 26S proteasome pathway. Consistent with this, <i>TaSAP5</i> overexpression enhances DRIP degradation and increases the levels of DREB2A protein and its downstream targets. These results suggest that TaSAP5 acts to link <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> with DREB2A accumulation and illustrate the molecular mechanisms involved in this process.</p>

Two Chloroplast Proteins Suppress Drought Resistance by Affecting ROS Production in Guard Cells
<p>Chloroplast as the site for photosynthesis is an essential organelle in plants, but little is known about its role in stomatal regulation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> resistance. In this study, we show that two chloroplastic proteins essential for thylakoid formation negatively regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> resistance in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). By screening a mutant pool with T-DNA insertions in nuclear genes encoding chloroplastic proteins, we identified an <i>HCF106</i> knockdown mutant exhibiting increased resistance to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress. The <i>hcf106</i> mutant displayed elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in guard cells, improved stomatal closure, and reduced water loss under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> conditions. The HCF106 protein was found to physically interact with THF1, a previously identified chloroplastic protein crucial for thylakoid formation. The <i>thf1</i> mutant phenotypically resembled the <i>hcf106</i> mutant and displayed more ROS accumulation in guard cells, increased stomatal closure, reduced water loss, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> resistant phenotypes compared to the wild type. The <i>hcf106thf1</i> double mutant behaved similarly as the <i>thf1</i> single mutant. These results suggest that HCF106 and THF1 form a complex to modulate chloroplast function and that the complex is important for ROS production in guard cells and stomatal control in response to environmental stresses. Our results also suggest that modulating chloroplastic proteins could be a way for improving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> resistance in crops.</p>

A NAC Transcription Factor Represses Putrescine Biosynthesis and Affects Drought Tolerance
<p>Arginine decarboxylase (ADC)-mediated putrescine biosynthesis plays an important role in plant stress responses, but the transcriptional regulation of <i>ADC</i> in response to abiotic stress is not well understood. We isolated a NAM, ATAF1/2, and CUC (NAC) domain-containing transcription factor, PtrNAC72, from trifoliate orange (<i>Poncirus trifoliata</i>) by yeast one-hybrid screening. PtrNAC72, localized to the nucleus, binds specifically to the promoter of <i>PtADC</i> and acts as a transcriptional repressor. <i>PtrNAC72</i> expression was induced by cold, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>, and abscisic acid. <i>ADC</i> messenger RNA abundance and putrescine levels were decreased in transgenic tobacco (<i>Nicotiana nudicaulis</i>) plants overexpressing <i>PtrNAC72</i> but increased, compared with the wild type, in an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) transfer DNA insertion mutant, <i>nac72</i>.

The extent of forest in dryland biomes
<p>Dryland biomes cover two-fifths of Earth’s land surface, but their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> area is poorly known. Here, we report an estimate of global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> extent in dryland biomes, based on analyzing more than 210,000 0.5-hectare sample plots through a photo-interpretation approach using large databases of satellite imagery at (i) very high spatial resolution and (ii) very high temporal resolution, which are available through the Google Earth platform. We show that in 2015, 1327 million hectares of drylands had more than 10% tree-cover, and 1079 million hectares comprised <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>. Our estimate is 40 to 47% higher than previous estimates, corresponding to 467 million hectares of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> that have never been reported before. This increases current estimates of global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> cover by at least 9%.</p>

Radiocarbon constraints imply reduced carbon uptake by soils during the 21st century
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> is the largest terrestrial carbon reservoir and may influence the sign and magnitude of carbon cycle–climate feedbacks. Many Earth system models (ESMs) estimate a significant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> carbon sink by 2100, yet the underlying carbon dynamics determining this response have not been systematically tested against observations. We used <sup>14</sup>C data from 157 globally distributed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> profiles sampled to 1-meter depth to show that ESMs underestimated the mean age of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> carbon by a factor of more than six (430 ± 50 years versus 3100 ± 1800 years). Consequently, ESMs overestimated the carbon sequestration potential of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s by a factor of nearly two (40 ± 27%). These inconsistencies suggest that ESMs must better represent carbon stabilization processes and the turnover time of slow and passive reservoirs when simulating future atmospheric carbon dioxide dynamics.</p>

Faster Decomposition Under Increased Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> Limits Soil Carbon Storage

Root Engineering in Barley: Increasing Cytokinin Degradation Produces a Larger Root System, Mineral Enrichment in the Shoot and Improved Drought Tolerance
<p>Root size and architecture are important crop plant traits, as they determine access to water and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> nutrients. The plant hormone cytokinin is a negative regulator of root growth and branching. Here, we generated transgenic barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) plants with an enlarged root system by enhancing cytokinin degradation in roots to explore the potential of cytokinin modulations in improving root functions. This was achieved through root-specific expression of a <i>CYTOKININ OXIDASE/DEHYDROGENASE</i> gene. Enhanced biomass allocation to roots did not penalize shoot growth or seed yield, indicating that these plants were not source limited. In leaves of transgenic lines, the concentrations of several macroelements and microelements were increased, particularly those with low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> mobility (phosphorus, manganese, and zinc). Importantly, seeds contained up to 44% more zinc, which is beneficial for human nutrition. Transgenic lines also demonstrated dampened stress responses to long-term <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> conditions, indicating lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> sensitivity. Taken together, this work demonstrates that root engineering of cereals is a promising strategy to improve nutrient efficiency, biofortification, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> tolerance.</p>

Overexpression of RING Domain E3 Ligase ZmXerico1 Confers Drought Tolerance through Regulation of ABA Homeostasis
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress is one of the main environmental problems encountered by crop growers. Reduction in arable land area and reduced water availability make it paramount to identify and develop strategies to allow crops to be more resilient in water-limiting environments. The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays an important role in the plants’ response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress through its control of stomatal aperture and water transpiration, and transgenic modulation of ABA levels therefore represents an attractive avenue to improve the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> tolerance of crops. Several steps in the ABA-signaling pathway are controlled by ubiquitination involving really interesting new genes (RING) domain-containing proteins. We characterized the maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) RING protein family and identified two novel RING-H2 genes called <i>ZmXerico1</i> and <i>ZmXerico2</i>. Expression of <i>ZmXerico</i> genes is induced by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress, and we show that overexpression of <i>ZmXerico1</i> and <i>ZmXerico2</i> in Arabidopsis and maize confers ABA hypersensitivity and improved water use efficiency, which can lead to enhanced maize yield performance in a controlled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-stress environment. Overexpression of <i>ZmXerico1</i> and <i>ZmXerico2</i> in maize results in increased ABA levels and decreased levels of ABA degradation products diphaseic acid and phaseic acid. We show that ZmXerico1 is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, where ABA 8′-hydroxylases have been shown to be localized, and that it functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. We demonstrate that ZmXerico1 plays a role in the control of ABA homeostasis through regulation of ABA 8′-hydroxylase protein stability, representing a novel control point in the regulation of the ABA pathway.</p>

A Nucleus-Localized Long Non-Coding RNA Enhances Drought and Salt Stress Tolerance
<p>Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) affect gene expression through a wide range of mechanisms and are considered as important regulators in many essential biological processes. A large number of lncRNA transcripts have been predicted or identified in plants in recent years. However, the biological functions for most of them are still unknown. In this study, we identified an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) lncRNA, <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> INDUCED lncRNA</i> (<i>DRIR</i>), as a novel positive regulator of the plant response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> and salt stress. <i>DRIR</i> was expressed at a low level under nonstress conditions but can be significantly activated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> and salt stress as well as by abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. We identified a T-DNA insertion mutant, <i>drir<sup>D</sup></i>, which had higher expression of the <i>DRIR</i> gene than the wild-type plants. The <i>drir<sup>D</sup></i> mutant exhibits increased tolerance to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> and salt stress. Overexpressing <i>DRIR</i> in Arabidopsis also increased tolerance to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> and salt stress of the transgenic plants. The <i>drir<sup>D</sup></i> mutant and the overexpressing seedlings are more sensitive to ABA than the wild type in stomata closure and seedling growth. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis demonstrated that the expression of a large number of genes was altered in <i>drir<sup>D</sup></i> and the overexpressing plants. These include genes involved in ABA signaling, water transport, and other stress-relief processes. Our study reveals a mechanism whereby <i>DRIR</i> regulates the plant response to abiotic stress by modulating the expression of a series of genes involved in the stress response.</p>

Quantifying Wheat Sensitivities to Environmental Constraints to Dissect Genotype × Environment Interactions in the Field
<p>Yield is subject to strong genotype-by-environment (G × E) interactions in the field, especially under abiotic constraints such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> water deficit (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> [D]) and high temperature (heat [H]). Since environmental conditions show strong fluctuations during the whole crop cycle, geneticists usually do not consider environmental measures as quantitative variables but rather as factors in multienvironment analyses. Based on 11 experiments in a field platform with contrasting temperature and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> water deficit, we determined the periods of sensitivity to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> and heat constraints in wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) and determined the average sensitivities for major yield components. G × E interactions were separated into their underlying components, constitutive genotypic effect (G), G × D, G × H, and G × H × D, and were analyzed for two genotypes, highlighting contrasting responses to heat and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> constraints. We then tested the constitutive and responsive behaviors of two strong quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated previously with yield components. This analysis confirmed the constitutive effect of the chromosome 1B QTL and explained the G × E interaction of the chromosome 3B QTL by a benefit of one allele when temperature rises. In addition to the method itself, which can be applied to other data sets and populations, this study will support the cloning of a major yield QTL on chromosome 3B that is highly dependent on environmental conditions and for which the climatic interaction is now quantified.</p>

SENSITIVE TO FREEZING2 Aides in Resilience to Salt and Drought in Freezing-Sensitive Tomato
<p>SENSITIVE TO FREEZING2 (SFR2) is crucial for protecting chloroplast membranes following freezing in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). It has been shown that SFR2 homologs are present in all land plants, including freezing-sensitive species, raising the question of SFR2 function beyond freezing tolerance. Similar to freezing, salt and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> can cause dehydration. Thus, it is hypothesized that in freezing-sensitive plants SFR2 may play roles in their resilience to salt or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>. To test this hypothesis, <i>SlSFR2</i> RNAi lines were generated in the cold/freezing-sensitive species tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i> [M82 <i>cv</i>]). Hypersensitivity to salt and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> of <i>SlSFR2</i>-RNAi lines was observed. Higher tolerance of wild-type tomatoes was correlated with the production of trigalactosyldiacylglycerol, a product of SFR2 activity. Tomato SFR2 in vitro activity is Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and its optimal pH is 7.5, similar to that of Arabidopsis SFR2, but the specific activity of tomato SFR2 in vitro is almost double that of Arabidopsis SFR2. When salt and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress were applied to Arabidopsis, no conditions could be identified at which SFR2 was induced prior to irreversibly impacting plant growth, suggesting that SFR2 protects Arabidopsis primarily against freezing. Discovery of tomato SFR2 function in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> and salt resilience provides further insights into general membrane lipid remodeling-based stress tolerance mechanisms and together with protection against freezing in freezing-resistant plants such as Arabidopsis, it adds lipid remodeling as a possible target for the engineering of abiotic stress-resilient crops.</p>

Combined effects of defoliation and water stress on pine growth and non-structural carbohydrates
<p>Climate change is expected to increase both pest insect damage and the occurrence of severe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>. There is therefore a need to better understand the combined effects of biotic and abiotic damage on tree growth in order to predict the multi-factorial effect of climate change on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> ecosystem productivity. Indeed, the effect of stress interactions on tree growth is an increasingly important topic that greatly lacks experiments and data, and it is unlikely that the impact of combined stresses can be extrapolated from the outcomes of studies that focused on a single stress. We developed an original manipulative study under real field conditions where we applied artificial defoliation and induced water stress on 10-year-old (∼10 m high) maritime pine trees (<i>Pinus pinaster</i> Ait.). Tree response to combined stresses was quantitatively assessed following tree secondary growth and carbohydrate pools. Such a design allowed us to address the crucial question of combined stresses on trees under stand conditions, sharing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> supplies with neighboring trees. Our initial hypotheses were that (i) moderate defoliation can limit the impact of water stress on tree growth through reduced transpiration demand by a tree canopy partly defoliated and that (ii) defoliation results in reduced non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) pools, affecting tree tolerance to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>. Our results showed additive effects of defoliation and water stress on tree growth and contradict our initial hypothesis. Indeed, under stand conditions, we found that partial defoliation does not limit the impact of water stress through reduced transpiration. Our study also highlighted that, even if NSC in all organs were affected by defoliation, tree response to water stress was not triggered. We found that stem NSC were maintained or increased during the entire growing season, supporting literature-based hypotheses such as an active maintenance of the hydraulic system or another limiting resource for tree growth under defoliation. We also observed a significant decrease in root carbohydrates, which suggests a shift in the root carbon balance under defoliation. The decrease in carbohydrate supply under defoliation may not counterbalance the carbon use for mineral and water uptakes or a translocation to other tissues.</p>

Observation of parity-time symmetry breaking in a single-spin system
<p>Steering the evolution of single spin systems is crucial for quantum computing and quantum sensing. The dynamics of quantum systems has been theoretically investigated with parity-time–symmetric Hamiltonians exhibiting exotic properties. Although parity-time symmetry has been explored in classical systems, its observation in a single quantum system remains elusive. We developed a method to dilate a general parity-time–symmetric Hamiltonian into a Hermitian one. The quantum state evolutions ranging from regions of unbroken to broken [Formula] symmetry have been observed with a single nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. Owing to the universality of the dilation method, our result provides a route for further exploiting and understanding the exotic properties of parity-time symmetric Hamiltonian in quantum systems.</p>

Anti–parity-time symmetry in diffusive systems
<p>Various concepts related to parity-time symmetry, including anti–parity-time symmetry, have found broad applications in wave physics. Wave systems are fundamentally described by Hermitian operators, whereas their unusual properties are introduced by incorporation of gain and loss. We propose that the related physics need not be restricted to wave dynamics, and we consider systems described by diffusive dynamics. We study the heat transfer in two countermoving media and show that this system exhibits anti–parity-time symmetry. The spontaneous symmetry breaking results in a phase transition from motionless temperature profiles, despite the mechanical motion of the background, to moving temperature profiles. Our results extend the concepts of parity-time symmetry beyond wave physics and may offer opportunities to manipulate heat and mass transport.</p>

Retrotransposon Insertion and DNA Methylation Regulate Aluminum Tolerance in European Barley Accessions
<p>Aluminum (Al) toxicity is a major stress factor limiting crop productivity in acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>. Although there is great genotypic variation in tolerance to Al toxicity, the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we report that, in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), the fourth largest cereal crop produced in the world, both retrotransposon insertion and DNA methylation are involved in regulating differential Al tolerance. <i>HvAACT1</i> is a major gene responsible for citrate secretion from the roots for external detoxification of Al. A multiretrotransposon-like (MRL) sequence insertion at least 15.3 kb in length was detected in the upstream genomic region of <i>HvAACT1</i> that displayed promoter activity and significantly enhanced <i>HvAACT1</i> expression, especially in the root tips of Al-tolerant accessions. Furthermore, in a number of accessions with low levels of <i>HvAACT1</i> expression, this MRL insertion was present but highly methylated. Geographical analysis showed that accessions with this MRL insertion are distributed mainly in European areas with acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s. Two wild barley accessions were found to possess this MRL insertion, but with a high degree of methylation. These results indicate that the MRL insertion and its degree of DNA methylation influence <i>HvAACT1</i> expression and that demethylation of this MRL insertion, which facilitates adaptation to acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s, occurred following barley domestication. Moreover, our results indicate that barley accessions in East Asia and Europe have developed independent but equivalent strategies to withstand Al toxicity in acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s.</p>

Low Vulnerability to Xylem Embolism in Leaves and Stems of North American Oaks
<p>Although recent findings suggest that xylem embolism represents a significant, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-induced damaging process in land plants, substantial debate surrounds the capacity of long-vesseled, ring-porous species to resist embolism. We investigated whether recent methodological developments could help resolve this controversy within <i>Quercus</i>, a long-vesseled, ring-porous temperate angiosperm genus, and shed further light on the importance of xylem vulnerability to embolism as an indicator of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> tolerance. We used the optical technique to quantify leaf and stem xylem vulnerability to embolism of eight <i>Quercus</i> species from the Mediterranean-type climate region of California to examine absolute measures of resistance to embolism as well as any potential hydraulic segmentation between tissue types. We demonstrated that our optical assessment reflected flow impairment for a subset of our sample species by quantifying changes in leaf hydraulic conductance in dehydrating branches. Air-entry water potential varied 2-fold in leaves, ranging from −1.7 ± 0.25 MPa to −3.74 ± 0.23 MPa, and 4-fold in stems, ranging from −1.17 ± 0.04 MPa to −4.91 ± 0.3 MPa. Embolism occurred earlier in leaves than in stems in only one out of eight sample species, and plants always lost turgor before experiencing stem embolism. Our results show that long-vesseled North American <i>Quercus</i> species are more resistant to embolism than previously thought and support the hypothesis that avoiding stem embolism is a critical component of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> tolerance in woody trees. Accurately quantifying xylem vulnerability to embolism is essential for understanding species distributions along aridity gradients and predicting plant mortality during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>.</p>

Knockdown of Rice MicroRNA166 Confers Drought Resistance by Causing Leaf Rolling and Altering Stem Xylem Development
<p>MicroRNAs are 19- to 22-nucleotide small noncoding RNAs that have been implicated in abiotic stress responses. In this study, we found that knockdown of microRNA166, using the Short Tandem Target Mimic (STTM) system, resulted in morphological changes that confer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> resistance in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). From a large-scale screen for miRNA knockdown lines in rice, we identified miR166 knockdown lines (STTM166); these plants exhibit a rolled-leaf phenotype, which is normally displayed by rice plants under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress. The leaves of STTM166 rice plants had smaller bulliform cells and abnormal sclerenchymatous cells, likely causing the rolled-leaf phenotype. The STTM166 plants had reduced stomatal conductance and showed decreased transpiration rates. The STTM166 lines also exhibited altered stem xylem and decreased hydraulic conductivity, likely due to the reduced diameter of the xylem vessels. Molecular analyses identified rice <i>HOMEODOMAIN CONTAINING PROTEIN4</i> (<i>OsHB4</i>), a member of HD-Zip III gene family, as a major target of miR166; moreover, rice plants overexpressing a miR166-resistant form of <i>OsHB4</i> resembled the STTM166 plants, including leaf rolling and higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> resistance. The genes downstream of miR166-<i>OsHB4</i> consisted of polysaccharide synthesis-related genes that may contribute to cell wall formation and vascular development. Our results suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> resistance in rice can be increased by manipulating miRNAs, which leads to developmental changes, such as leaf rolling and reduced diameter of the xylem, that mimic plants’ natural responses to water-deficit stress.</p>

Drought-Enhanced Xylem Sap Sulfate Closes Stomata by Affecting ALMT12 and Guard Cell ABA Synthesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Water limitation of plants causes stomatal closure to prevent water loss by transpiration. For this purpose, progressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> water deficit is communicated from roots to shoots. Abscisic acid (ABA) is the key signal in stress-induced stomatal closure, but ABA as an early xylem-delivered signal is still a matter of debate. In this study, poplar plants (<i>Populus × canescens</i>) were exposed to water stress to investigate xylem sap sulfate and ABA, stomatal conductance, and sulfate transporter (<i>SULTR</i>) expression. In addition, stomatal behavior and expression of ABA receptors, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-responsive genes, transcription factors, and <i>NCED3</i> were studied after feeding sulfate and ABA to detached poplar leaves and epidermal peels of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The results show that increased xylem sap sulfate is achieved upon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> by reduced xylem unloading by PtaSULTR3;3a and PtaSULTR1;1, and by enhanced loading from parenchyma cells into the xylem via PtaALMT3b. Sulfate application caused stomatal closure in excised leaves and peeled epidermis. In the loss of sulfate-channel function mutant, At<i>almt12</i>, sulfate-triggered stomatal closure was impaired. The QUAC1/ALMT12 anion channel heterologous expressed in oocytes was gated open by extracellular sulfate. Sulfate up-regulated the expression of <i>NCED3</i>, a key step of ABA synthesis, in guard cells. In conclusion, xylem-derived sulfate seems to be a chemical signal of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> that induces stomatal closure via QUAC1/ALMT12 and/or guard cell ABA synthesis.</p>

Outside-Xylem Vulnerability, Not Xylem Embolism, Controls Leaf Hydraulic Decline during Dehydration<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[CC-BY]</sup></xref>
<p>Leaf hydraulic supply is crucial to maintaining open stomata for CO<sub>2</sub> capture and plant growth. During <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-induced dehydration, the leaf hydraulic conductance (<i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub>) declines, which contributes to stomatal closure and, eventually, to leaf death. Previous studies have tended to attribute the decline of <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> to embolism in the leaf vein xylem. We visualized at high resolution and quantified experimentally the hydraulic vulnerability of xylem and outside-xylem pathways and modeled their respective influences on plant water transport. Evidence from all approaches indicated that the decline of <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> during dehydration arose first and foremost due to the vulnerability of outside-xylem tissues. In vivo x-ray microcomputed tomography of dehydrating leaves of four diverse angiosperm species showed that, at the turgor loss point, only small fractions of leaf vein xylem conduits were embolized, and substantial xylem embolism arose only under severe dehydration. Experiments on an expanded set of eight angiosperm species showed that outside-xylem hydraulic vulnerability explained 75% to 100% of <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> decline across the range of dehydration from mild water stress to beyond turgor loss point. Spatially explicit modeling of leaf water transport pointed to a role for reduced membrane conductivity consistent with published data for cells and tissues. Plant-scale modeling suggested that outside-xylem hydraulic vulnerability can protect the xylem from tensions that would induce embolism and disruption of water transport under mild to moderate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> and atmospheric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>s. These findings pinpoint outside-xylem tissues as a central locus for the control of leaf and plant water transport during progressive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>.</p>

Thermal tolerance breadths among groundwater crustaceans living in a thermally constant environment
<p>The climate variability hypothesis assumes that the thermal tolerance breadth of a species is primarily determined by temperature variations experienced in its environment. If so, aquatic invertebrates living in thermally buffered environments would be expected to exhibit narrow thermal tolerance breadths (stenothermy). We tested this prediction by studying the thermal physiology of three isopods (Asellidae, <i>Proasellus</i>) colonizing groundwater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">habitat</span></strong>s characterized by an annual temperature amplitude of less than 1°C. The species responses to temperature variation were assessed in the laboratory using five physiological variables: survival, locomotor activity, aerobic respiration, immune defense and concentrations of total free amino acids and sugars. The three species exhibited contrasted thermal physiologies, although all variables were not equally informative. In accordance with the climate variability hypothesis, two species were extremely sensitive even to moderate changes in temperature (2°C) below and above their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">habitat</span></strong> temperature. In contrast, the third species exhibited a surprisingly high thermal tolerance breadth (11°C). Differences in response to temperature variation among <i>Proasellus</i> species indicated that their thermal physiology was not solely shaped by the current temperature seasonality in their natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">habitat</span></strong>s. More particularly, recent gene flow among populations living in thermally constant yet contrasted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">habitat</span></strong>s might explain the occurrence of eurytherm species in thermally buffered environments.</p>

Microbial oxidation of lithospheric organic carbon in rapidly eroding tropical mountain soils
<p>Lithospheric organic carbon (“petrogenic”; OC<sub>petro</sub>) is oxidized during exhumation and subsequent erosion of mountain ranges. This process is a considerable source of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) to the atmosphere over geologic time scales, but the mechanisms that govern oxidation rates in mountain landscapes are poorly constrained. We demonstrate that, on average, 67 ± 11% of the OC<sub>petro</sub> initially present in bedrock exhumed from the tropical, rapidly eroding Central Range of Taiwan is oxidized in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s, leading to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of 6.1 to 18.6 metric tons of carbon per square kilometer per year. The molecular and isotopic evolution of bulk OC and lipid biomarkers during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> formation reveals that OC<sub>petro</sub> remineralization is microbially mediated. Rapid oxidation in mountain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s drives CO<sub>2</sub> emission fluxes that increase with erosion rate, thereby counteracting CO<sub>2</sub> drawdown by silicate weathering and biospheric OC burial.</p>

Selective control of up-regulated and down-regulated genes by temporal patterns and doses of insulin
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong> transiently increases after eating, resulting in a high circulating concentration. Fasting limits <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion, resulting in a low concentration of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong> in the circulation. We analyzed transcriptional responses to different temporal patterns and doses of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong> in the hepatoma FAO cells and identified 13 up-regulated and 16 down-regulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong>-responsive genes (IRGs). The up-regulated IRGs responded more rapidly than did the down-regulated IRGs to transient stepwise or pulsatile increases in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong> concentration, whereas the down-regulated IRGs were repressed at lower concentrations of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong> than those required to stimulate the up-regulated IRGs. Mathematical modeling of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong> response as two stages—(i) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong> signaling to transcription and (ii)transcription and mRNA stability—indicated that the first stage was the more rapid stage for the down-regulated IRGs, whereas the second stage of transcription was the more rapid stage for the up-regulated IRGs. A subset of the IRGs that were up-regulated or down-regulated in the FAO cells was similarly regulated in the livers of rats injected with a single dose of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong>. Thus, not only can cells respond to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong> but they can also interpret the intensity and pattern of signal to produce distinct transcriptional responses. These results provide insight that may be useful in treating obesity and type 2 diabetes associated with aberrant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong> production or tissue responsiveness.</p>

Patients With Long-QT Syndrome Caused by Impaired <i>hERG</i>-Encoded K<sub>v</sub>11.1 Potassium Channel Have Exaggerated Endocrine Pancreatic and Incretin Function Associated With Reactive Hypoglycemia
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Loss-of-function mutations in <i>hERG</i> (encoding the K<sub>v</sub>11.1 voltage-gated potassium channel) cause long-QT syndrome type 2 (LQT2) because of prolonged cardiac repolarization.

Dynamic GLUT4 sorting through a syntaxin-6 compartment in muscle cells is derailed by insulin resistance-causing ceramide
<p>GLUT4 constitutively recycles between the plasma membrane and intracellular depots. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong> shifts this dynamic equilibrium towards the plasma membrane by recruiting GLUT4 to the plasma membrane from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong>-responsive vesicles. Muscle is the primary site for dietary glucose deposition; however, how GLUT4 sorts into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong>-responsive vesicles, and if and how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong> resistance affects this process, is unknown. In L6 myoblasts stably expressing myc-tagged GLUT4, we analyzed the intracellular itinerary of GLUT4 as it internalizes from the cell surface and examined if such sorting is perturbed by C2-ceramide, a lipid metabolite causing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong> resistance. Surface-labeled GLUT4<i>myc</i> that internalized for 30 min accumulated in a Syntaxin-6 (Stx6)- and Stx16-positive perinuclear sub-compartment devoid of furin or internalized transferrin, and displayed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong>-responsive re-exocytosis. C2-ceramide dispersed the Stx6-positive sub-compartment and prevented <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong>-responsive re-exocytosis of internalized GLUT4<i>myc</i>, even under conditions not affecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong>-stimulated signaling towards Akt. Microtubule disruption with nocodazole prevented pre-internalized GLUT4<i>myc</i> from reaching the Stx6-positive perinuclear sub-compartment and from undergoing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong>-responsive exocytosis. Removing nocodazole allowed both parameters to recover, suggesting that the Stx6-positive perinuclear sub-compartment was required for GLUT4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong>-responsiveness. Accordingly, Stx6 knockdown inhibited by ∼50% the ability of internalized GLUT4<i>myc</i> to undergo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong>-responsive re-exocytosis without altering its overall perinuclear accumulation. We propose that Stx6 defines the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong>-responsive compartment in muscle cells. Our data are consistent with a model where ceramide could cause <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong> resistance by altering intracellular GLUT4 sorting.</p>

Abl and Arg mediate cysteine cathepsin secretion to facilitate melanoma invasion and metastasis
<p>The incidence of melanoma is increasing, particularly in young women, and the disease remains incurable for many because of its aggressive, metastatic nature and its high rate of resistance to conventional, targeted, and immunological agents. Cathepsins are proteases that are critical for melanoma progression and therapeutic resistance. Intracellular cathepsins cleave or degrade proteins that restrict cancer progression, whereas extracellular cathepsins directly cleave the extracellular matrix and activate proinvasive proteases in the tumor microenvironment. Cathepsin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion is markedly increased in cancer cells. We investigated the signaling pathways leading to increased cathepsin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion in melanoma cells. We found that the nonreceptor tyrosine kinases Abl and Arg (Abl/Arg) promoted the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion of cathepsin B and cathepsin L by activating transcription factors (namely, Ets1, Sp1, and NF-κB/p65) that have key roles in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), invasion, and therapeutic resistance. In some melanoma cell lines, Abl/Arg promoted the Ets1/p65-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion of cathepsin B and cathepsin L in a kinase-independent manner, whereas in other melanoma lines, Abl/Arg promoted the kinase-dependent, Sp1/Ets1/p65–mediated induction of cathepsin L <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion and the Sp1/p65-mediated induction of cathepsin B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion. As an indication of clinical relevance, the abundance of mRNAs encoding Abl/Arg, Sp1, Ets1, and cathepsins was positively correlated in primary melanomas, and Abl/Arg-driven invasion in culture and metastasis in vivo required cathepsin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion. These data suggest that drugs targeting Abl kinases, many of which are FDA-approved, might inhibit cathepsin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion in some melanomas and potentially other aggressive cancers harboring activated Abl kinases.</p>

Direct Proteomic Quantification of the Secretome of Activated Immune Cells
<sec><title>Tracking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ed Proteins</title><p>The proteins <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ed by cells provide a flow of information within tissues and are thus of particular interest.

<i>Drosophila</i> insulin release is triggered by adipose Stunted ligand to brain Methuselah receptor
<p>Animals adapt their growth rate and body size to available nutrients by a general modulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong>–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong>-like growth factor signaling. In <i>Drosophila</i>, dietary amino acids promote the release in the hemolymph of brain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong>-like peptides (Dilps), which in turn activate systemic organ growth. Dilp <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong>-producing cells involves a relay through unknown cytokines produced by fat cells. Here, we identify Methuselah (Mth) as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>in-incretin receptor subfamily member required in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong>-producing cells for proper nutrient coupling. We further show, using genetic and ex vivo organ culture experiments, that the Mth ligand Stunted (Sun) is a circulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong>otropic peptide produced by fat cells. Therefore, Sun and Mth define a new cross-organ circuitry that modulates physiological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong> levels in response to nutrients.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
F-Actin Mediated Focusing of Vesicles at the Cell Tip Is Essential for Polarized Growth
<p>F-actin has been shown to be essential for tip growth in an array of plant models, including <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. One hypothesis is that diffusion can transport <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ory vesicles, while actin plays a regulatory role during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion. Alternatively, it is possible that actin-based transport is necessary to overcome vesicle transport limitations to sustain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion. Therefore, a quantitative analysis of diffusion, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion kinetics, and cell geometry is necessary to clarify the role of actin in polarized growth. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis, we first show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ory vesicles move toward and accumulate at the tip in an actin-dependent manner. We then depolymerized F-actin to decouple vesicle diffusion from actin-mediated transport and measured the diffusion coefficient and concentration of vesicles. Using these values, we constructed a theoretical diffusion-based model for growth, demonstrating that with fast-enough vesicle fusion kinetics, diffusion could support normal cell growth rates. We further refined our model to explore how experimentally extrapolated vesicle fusion kinetics and the size of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion zone limit diffusion-based growth. This model predicts that diffusion-mediated growth is dependent on the size of the region of exocytosis at the tip and that diffusion-based growth would be significantly slower than normal cell growth. To further explore the size of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion zone, we used a cell wall degradation enzyme cocktail and determined that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion zone is smaller than 6 μm in diameter at the tip. Taken together, our results highlight the requirement for active transport in polarized growth and provide important insight into vesicle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion during tip growth.</p>

Endocrine regulation of carbonate precipitate formation in marine fish intestine by stanniocalcin and PTHrP
<p>In marine fish, high epithelial bicarbonate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion by the intestine generates luminal carbonate precipitates of divalent cations that play a key role in water and ion homeostasis. <i>In vitro</i> studies highlight the involvement of the calciotropic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>es PTHrP (parathyroid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>e-related protein) and stanniocalcin (STC) in the regulation of epithelial bicarbonate transport. The present study tested the hypothesis that calciotropic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>es have a regulatory role in carbonate precipitate formation <i>in vivo</i>. Sea bream (<i>Sparus aurata</i>) juveniles received single intraperitoneal injections of piscine PTHrP(1–34), the PTH/PTHrP receptor antagonist PTHrP(7–34) or purified sea bream STC, or were passively immunized with polyclonal rabbit antisera raised against sea bream STC (STC-Ab). Endocrine effects on the expression of the basolateral sodium bicarbonate co-transporter (Slc4a4.A), the apical anion exchangers Slc26a6.A and Slc26a3.B, and the V-type proton pump β-subunit (Atp6v1b) in the anterior intestine were evaluated. In keeping with their calciotropic nature, the hypocalcaemic factors PTHrP(7–34) and STC up-regulated gene expression of all transporters. In contrast, the hypercalcaemic factor PTHrP(1–34) and STC antibodies down-regulated transporters involved in the bicarbonate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion cascade. Changes in intestine luminal precipitate contents provoked by calcaemic endocrine factors validated these results: 24 h post-injection either PTHrP(1–34) or immunization with STC-Ab reduced the carbonate precipitate content in the sea bream intestine. In contrast, the PTH/PTHrP receptor antagonist PTHrP(7–34) increased not only the precipitated fraction but also the concentration of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> equivalents in the intestinal fluid. These results confirm the hypothesis that calciotropic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>es have a regulatory role in carbonate precipitate formation <i>in vivo</i> in the intestine of marine fish. Furthermore, they illustrate for the first time in fish the counteracting effect of PTHrP and STC, and reveal an unexpected contribution of calcaemic factors to acid–base balance.</p>

Phosphorylation of the exocyst protein Exo84 by TBK1 promotes insulin-stimulated GLUT4 trafficking
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong> stimulates glucose uptake through the translocation of the glucose transporter GLUT4 to the plasma membrane. The exocyst complex tethers GLUT4-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane, a process that requires the binding of the G protein (heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide–binding protein) RalA to the exocyst complex. We report that upon activation of RalA, the protein kinase TBK1 phosphorylated the exocyst subunit Exo84. Knockdown of TBK1 blocked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong>-stimulated glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation; knockout of TBK1 in adipocytes blocked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong>-stimulated glucose uptake; and ectopic overexpression of a kinase-inactive mutant of TBK1 reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong>-stimulated glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The phosphorylation of Exo84 by TBK1 reduced its affinity for RalA and enabled its release from the exocyst. Overexpression of a kinase-inactive mutant of TBK1 blocked the dissociation of the TBK1/RalA/exocyst complex, and treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with specific inhibitors of TBK1 reduced the rate of complex dissociation. Introduction of phosphorylation-mimicking or nonphosphorylatable mutant forms of Exo84 blocked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong>-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. Thus, these data indicate that TBK1 controls GLUT4 vesicle engagement and disengagement from the exocyst, suggesting that exocyst components not only constitute a tethering complex for the GLUT4 vesicle but also act as “gatekeepers” controlling vesicle fusion at the plasma membrane.</p>

Transcriptional activation of lipogenesis by insulin requires phosphorylation of MED17 by CK2
<p>De novo lipogenesis is precisely regulated by nutritional and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>al conditions. The genes encoding various enzymes involved in this process, such as fatty acid synthase (FASN), are transcriptionally activated in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong>. We showed that USF1, a key transcription factor for <i>FASN</i> activation, directly interacted with the Mediator subunit MED17 at the <i>FASN</i> promoter. This interaction recruited Mediator, which can bring POL II and other general transcription machinery to the complex. Moreover, we showed that MED17 was phosphorylated at Ser<sup>53</sup> by casein kinase 2 (CK2) in the livers of fed mice or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong>-stimulated hepatocytes, but not in the livers of fasted mice or untreated hepatocytes. Furthermore, activation of the <i>FASN</i> promoter in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong> required this CK2-mediated phosphorylation event, which occurred only in the absence of p38 MAPK–mediated phosphorylation at Thr<sup>570</sup>. Overexpression of a nonphosphorylatable S53A MED17 mutant or knockdown of MED17, as well as CK2 knockdown or inhibition, impaired hepatic de novo fatty acid synthesis and decreased triglyceride content in mice. These results demonstrate that CK2-mediated phosphorylation of Ser<sup>53</sup> in MED17 is required for the transcriptional activation of lipogenic genes in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong>.</p>

Targeting an energy sensor to treat diabetes
<p>Obesity occurs when whole-body energy intake exceeds energy expenditure for prolonged periods. This is a major public health issue because obesity increases the risk of disorders such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The liver and muscle store excess energy in the form of fat, leading to resistance to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>e <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong>. Released when blood glucose rises after meals, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong> normally promotes glucose uptake by muscle and represses glucose production by the liver, thus rapidly returning blood glucose to normal. However, this process is impaired in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong>-resistant individuals, who may eventually develop persistently elevated blood glucose (i.e., T2DM), which can cause debilitating or life-threatening complications. Because the energy sensor AMPK (adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase) promotes muscle glucose uptake by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong>-independent mechanisms, it was proposed in 1999 that AMPK-activating drugs might represent a novel approach to treating T2DM (<i>1</i>). Representing the culmination of more than 15 years of developing this concept, a study by Myers <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) on page 507 of this issue and a study by Cokorinos <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) show that compounds that bind to a unique site on AMPK can promote glucose uptake by muscle, and hence reverse elevated blood glucose in animal models of T2DM.</p>

Stromal <i>Gli2</i> activity coordinates a niche signaling program for mammary epithelial stem cells
<p>The stem cell niche is a complex local signaling microenvironment that sustains stem cell activity during organ maintenance and regeneration. The mammary gland niche must support its associated stem cells while also responding to systemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>al regulation that triggers pubertal changes. We find that <i>Gli2</i>, the major Hedgehog pathway transcriptional effector, acts within mouse mammary stromal cells to direct a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>e-responsive niche signaling program by activating expression of factors that regulate epithelial stem cells as well as receptors for the mammatrophic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>es estrogen and growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>e. Whereas prior studies implicate stem cell defects in human disease, this work shows that niche dysfunction may also cause disease, with possible relevance for human disorders and in particular the breast growth pathogenesis associated with combined pituitary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>e deficiency.</p>

β-cell–mimetic designer cells provide closed-loop glycemic control
<p>Chronically deregulated blood-glucose concentrations in diabetes mellitus result from a loss of pancreatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong>-producing β cells (type 1 diabetes, T1D) or from impaired <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong> sensitivity of body cells and glucose-stimulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong> release (type 2 diabetes, T2D). Here, we show that therapeutically applicable β-cell–mimetic designer cells can be established by minimal engineering of human cells. We achieved glucose responsiveness by a synthetic circuit that couples glycolysis-mediated calcium entry to an excitation-transcription system controlling therapeutic transgene expression. Implanted circuit-carrying cells corrected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong> deficiency and self-sufficiently abolished persistent hyperglycemia in T1D mice. Similarly, glucose-inducible glucagon-like peptide 1 transcription improved endogenous glucose-stimulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong> release and glucose tolerance in T2D mice. These systems may enable a combination of diagnosis and treatment for diabetes mellitus therapy.</p>

IL-33 and ST2 mediate FAK-dependent antitumor immune evasion through transcriptional networks
<p>Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) mediates tumor cell–intrinsic behaviors that promote tumor growth and metastasis. We previously showed that FAK also induces the expression of inflammatory genes that inhibit antitumor immunity in the microenvironment. We identified a crucial, previously unknown role for the dual-function cytokine interleukin-33 (IL-33) in FAK-dependent immune evasion. In murine squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells, specifically nuclear FAK enhanced the expression of the genes encoding IL-33, the chemokine CCL5, and the soluble, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ed form of the IL-33 receptor, called soluble ST2 (sST2). The abundance of IL-33 and CCL5 was increased in FAK-positive SCC cells but not in normal keratinocytes. IL-33 associated with FAK in the nucleus, and the FAK–IL-33 complex interacted with a network of chromatin modifiers and transcriptional regulators, including TAF9, WDR82, and BRD4, which promote the activity of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and its induction of genes encoding chemokines, including CCL5. We did not detect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion of IL-33 from FAK-positive SCC cells; thus, we propose that the increased production and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion of sST2 likely sequesters IL-33 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ed by other cell types within the tumor environment, thus blocking its stimulatory effects on infiltrating host immune cells. Depleting FAK, IL-33, or sST2 from SCC cells before implantation induced tumor regression in syngeneic mice, except when CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were co-depleted. Our data provide mechanistic insight into how FAK controls the tumor immune environment, namely, through a transcriptional regulatory network mediated by nuclear IL-33. Targeting this axis may boost antitumor immunity in patients.</p>

The glucocorticoid-Angptl4-ceramide axis induces insulin resistance through PP2A and PKCζ
<p>Chronic glucocorticoid exposure is associated with the development of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong> resistance. We showed that glucocorticoid-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong> resistance was attenuated upon ablation of <i>Angptl4</i>, a glucocorticoid target gene encoding the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ed protein angiopoietin-like 4, which mediates glucocorticoid-induced lipolysis in white adipose tissue. Through metabolomic profiling, we revealed that glucocorticoid treatment increased hepatic ceramide concentrations by inducing enzymes in the ceramide synthetic pathway in an Angptl4-dependent manner. Angptl4 was also required for glucocorticoids to stimulate the activities of the downstream effectors of ceramide, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and protein kinase Cζ (PKCζ). We further showed that knockdown of PP2A or inhibition of PKCζ or ceramide synthesis prevented glucocorticoid-induced glucose intolerance in wild-type mice. Moreover, the inhibition of PKCζ or ceramide synthesis did not further improve glucose tolerance in <i>Angptl4</i><sup><i>−/−</i></sup> mice, suggesting that these molecules were major downstream effectors of Angptl4. Overall, our study demonstrates the key role of Angptl4 in glucocorticoid-augmented hepatic ceramide production that induces whole-body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong> resistance.</p>

The glycosylation pathway is required for the secretion of Slit and for the maintenance of the Slit receptor Robo on axons
<p>Slit proteins act as repulsive axon guidance cues by activating receptors of the Roundabout (Robo) family. During early neurogenesis in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, Slit prevents the growth cones of longitudinal tract neurons from inappropriately crossing the midline, thus restricting these cells to trajectories parallel to the midline. Slit is expressed in midline glial cells, and Robo is present in longitudinal axon tracts and growth cones. We showed that the enzyme Mummy (Mmy) controlled Slit-Robo signaling through mechanisms that affected both the ligand and the receptor. Mmy was required for the glycosylation of Slit, which was essential for Slit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion. Mmy was also required for maintaining the abundance and spatial distribution of Robo through an indirect mechanism that was independent of Slit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion. Moreover, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion of Slit was required to maintain the fasciculation and position of longitudinal axon tracts, thus maintaining the hardwiring of the nervous system.

Lipid transport by TMEM24 at ER–plasma membrane contacts regulates pulsatile insulin secretion
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong> is released by β cells in pulses regulated by calcium and phosphoinositide signaling. Here, we describe how transmembrane protein 24 (TMEM24) helps coordinate these signaling events. We showed that TMEM24 is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–anchored membrane protein whose reversible localization to ER-plasma membrane (PM) contacts is governed by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in response to oscillations in cytosolic calcium. A lipid-binding module in TMEM24 transports the phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>] precursor phosphatidylinositol between bilayers, allowing replenishment of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> hydrolyzed during signaling. In the absence of TMEM24, calcium oscillations are abolished, leading to a defect in triggered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong> release. Our findings implicate direct lipid transport between the ER and the PM in the control of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion, a process impaired in patients with type II diabetes.</p>

Wounding Triggers Callus Formation via Dynamic Hormonal and Transcriptional Changes
<p>Wounding is a primary trigger of organ regeneration, but how wound stress reactivates cell proliferation and promotes cellular reprogramming remains elusive. In this study, we combined transcriptome analysis with quantitative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>al analysis to investigate how wounding induces callus formation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Our time course RNA-seq analysis revealed that wounding induces dynamic transcriptional changes, starting from rapid stress responses followed by the activation of metabolic processes and protein synthesis and subsequent activation of cell cycle regulators. Gene ontology analyses further uncovered that wounding modifies the expression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>e biosynthesis and response genes, and quantitative analysis of endogenous plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>es revealed accumulation of cytokinin prior to callus formation. Mutants defective in cytokinin synthesis and signaling display reduced efficiency in callus formation, indicating that de novo synthesis of cytokinin is critical for wound-induced callus formation. We further demonstrate that type-B ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR-mediated cytokinin signaling regulates the expression of <i>CYCLIN D3;1</i> (<i>CYCD3;1</i>) and that mutations in <i>CYCD3;1</i> and its homologs <i>CYCD3;2</i> and <i>3</i> cause defects in callus formation. In addition to these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>e-mediated changes, our transcriptome data uncovered that wounding activates multiple developmental regulators, and we found novel roles of ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR 115 and PLETHORA3 (PLT3), PLT5, and PLT7 in callus generation. All together, these results provide novel mechanistic insights into how wounding reactivates cell proliferation during callus formation.</p>

Expansion of Secretin-Like G Protein-Coupled Receptors and Their Peptide Ligands via Local Duplications Before and After Two Rounds of Whole-Genome Duplication
<p>In humans, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>in-like G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family comprises 15 members with 18 corresponding peptide ligand genes. Although members have been identified in a large variety of vertebrate and nonvertebrate species, the origin and relationship of these proteins remain unresolved. To address this issue, we employed large-scale genome comparisons to identify genome fragments with conserved synteny and matched these fragments to linkage groups in reconstructed early gnathostome ancestral chromosomes (<i>GAC</i>). This genome comparison revealed that most receptor and peptide genes were clustered in three <i>GAC</i> linkage groups and suggested that the ancestral forms of five peptide subfamilies (corticotropin-releasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>e-like, calcitonin-like, parathyroid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>e-like, glucagon-like, and growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>e-releasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>e-like) and their cognate receptor families emerged through tandem local gene duplications before two rounds (2R) of whole-genome duplication. These subfamily genes have, then, been amplified by 2R whole-genome duplication, followed by additional local duplications and gene loss prior to the divergence of land vertebrates and teleosts. This study delineates a possible evolutionary scenario for whole <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>in-like peptide and receptor family members and may shed light on evolutionary mechanisms for expansion of a gene family with a large number of paralogs.</p>

Role of insulin signaling impairment, adiponectin and dyslipidemia in peripheral and central neuropathy in mice
<p>One of the tissues or organs affected by diabetes is the nervous system, predominantly the peripheral system (peripheral polyneuropathy and/or painful peripheral neuropathy) but also the central system with impaired learning, memory and mental flexibility. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the pre-diabetic or diabetic condition caused by a high-fat diet (HFD) can damage both the peripheral and central nervous systems. Groups of C57BL6 and Swiss Webster mice were fed a diet containing 60% fat for 8 months and compared to control and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic groups that were fed a standard diet containing 10% fat. Aspects of peripheral nerve function (conduction velocity, thermal sensitivity) and central nervous system function (learning ability, memory) were measured at assorted times during the study. Both strains of mice on HFD developed impaired glucose tolerance, indicative of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong> resistance, but only the C57BL6 mice showed statistically significant hyperglycemia. STZ-diabetic C57BL6 mice developed learning deficits in the Barnes maze after 8 weeks of diabetes, whereas neither C57BL6 nor Swiss Webster mice fed a HFD showed signs of defects at that time point. By 6 months on HFD, Swiss Webster mice developed learning and memory deficits in the Barnes maze test, whereas their peripheral nervous system remained normal. In contrast, C57BL6 mice fed the HFD developed peripheral nerve dysfunction, as indicated by nerve conduction slowing and thermal hyperalgesia, but showed normal learning and memory functions. Our data indicate that STZ-induced diabetes or a HFD can damage both peripheral and central nervous systems, but learning deficits develop more rapidly in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong>-deficient than in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong>-resistant conditions and only in Swiss Webster mice. In addition to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong> impairment, dyslipidemia or adiponectinemia might determine the neuropathy phenotype.</p>

PI3Kγ activity in leukocytes promotes adipose tissue inflammation and early-onset insulin resistance during obesity
<p>The phosphoinositide 3-kinase γ (PI3Kγ) plays a major role in leukocyte recruitment during acute inflammation and has been proposed to inhibit classical macrophage activation by driving immunosuppressive gene expression. PI3Kγ plays an important role in diet-induced obesity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insulin</span></strong> resistance.

Extracellular ATP Shapes a Defense-Related Transcriptome Both Independently and along with Other Defense Signaling Pathways
<p>ATP is not only an essential metabolite of cellular biochemistry but also acts as a signal in the extracellular milieu. In plants, extracellular ATP is monitored by the purinergic receptor P2K1. Recent studies have revealed that extracellular ATP acts as a damage-associated molecular pattern in plants, and its signaling through P2K1 is important for mounting an effective defense response against various pathogenic microorganisms. Biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens attack plants using different strategies, to which plants respond accordingly with salicylate-based or jasmonate/ethylene-based defensive signaling, respectively. Interestingly, defense mediated by P2K1 is effective against pathogens of both lifestyles, raising the question of the level of interplay between extracellular ATP signaling and that of jasmonate, ethylene, and salicylate. To address this issue, we analyzed ATP-induced transcriptomes in wild-type Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings and mutant seedlings defective in essential components in the signaling pathways of jasmonate, ethylene, and salicylate (classic defense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>es) as well as a mutant and an overexpression line of the P2K1 receptor. We found that P2K1 function is crucial for faithful ATP-induced transcriptional changes and that a subset of genes is more responsive in the P2K1 overexpression line. We also found that more than half of the ATP-responsive genes required signaling by one or more of the pathways for the classical defense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>es, with the jasmonate-based signaling being more critical than others. By contrast, the other ATP-responsive genes were unaffected by deficiencies in signaling for any of the classical defense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>es. These ATP-responsive genes were highly enriched for defense-related Gene Ontology terms. We further tested the ATP-induced genes in knockout mutants of transcription factors, demonstrating that MYCs acting downstream of the jasmonate receptor complex and calmodulin-binding transcription activators are nuclear transducers of P2K1-mediated extracellular ATP signaling.</p>

A Cycloheximide-Sensitive Step in Transverse Microtubule Array Patterning
<p>The growth properties of individual cells within a tissue determine plant morphology, and the organization of the cytoskeleton, particularly the microtubule arrays, determines cellular growth properties. We investigated the mechanisms governing the formation of transverse microtubule array patterns in axially growing Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) epidermal hypocotyl cells. Using quantitative imaging approaches, we mapped the transition of the cortical microtubule arrays into a transverse coaligned pattern after induction with auxin and gibberellic acid. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>e induction led to an early loss of microtubule plus end density and a rotation toward oblique patterns. Beginning 30 min after induction, transverse microtubules appeared at the cell’s midzone concurrently with the loss of longitudinal polymers, eventually progressing apically and basally to remodel the array pattern. Based on the timing and known <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>e-signaling pathways, we tested the hypothesis that the later events require de novo gene expression and, thus, constitute a level of genetic control over transverse patterning. We found that the presence of the translation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) resulted in a selective and reversible loss of transverse patterns that were replaced with radial-like pinwheel arrays exhibiting a split bipolar architecture centered at the cell’s midzone. Experiments using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>e induction and CHX revealed that pinwheel arrays occur when transverse microtubules increase at the midzone but longitudinal microtubules in the split bipolar architecture are not suppressed. We propose that a key regulatory mechanism for creating the transverse microtubule coalignment in axially growing hypocotyls involves the expression of a CHX-sensitive factor that acts to suppress the nucleation of the longitudinally oriented polymers.</p>

Scopoletin 8-Hydroxylase-Mediated Fraxetin Production Is Crucial for Iron Mobilization
<p>Iron (Fe) is an essential mineral nutrient and an important factor for the composition of natural plant communities. Low Fe availability in aerated soils with neutral or alkaline pH has led to the evolution of elaborate mechanisms that extract Fe from the soil solution. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), Fe is acquired by an orchestrated strategy that comprises mobilization, chelation, and reduction of Fe<sup>3+</sup> prior to its uptake. Here, we show that At3g12900, previously annotated as scopoletin 8-hydroxylase (S8H), participates in Fe acquisition by mediating the biosynthesis of fraxetin (7,8-dihydroxy-6-methoxycoumarin), a coumarin derived from the scopoletin pathway. S8H is highly induced in roots of Fe-deficient plants both at the transcript and protein levels. Mutants defective in the expression of <i>S8H</i> showed increased sensitivity to growth on pH 7.0 media supplemented with an immobile source of Fe and reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion of fraxetin. Transgenic lines overexpressing <i>S8H</i> exhibited an opposite phenotype. Homozygous <i>s8h</i> mutants grown on media with immobilized Fe accumulated significantly more scopolin, the storage form of scopoletin, supporting the designated function of S8H in scopoletin hydroxylation. Fraxetin exhibited Fe-reducing properties in vitro with higher rates being observed at neutral relative to acidic pH. Supplementing the media containing immobile Fe with fraxetin partially rescued the <i>s8h</i> mutants. In natural Arabidopsis accessions differing in their performance on media containing immobilized Fe, the amount of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ed fraxetin was highly correlated with growth and Fe and chlorophyll content, indicating that fraxetin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion is a decisive factor for calcicole-calcifuge behavior (i.e. the ability/inability to thrive on alkaline soils) of plants.</p>

A Mucin-Like Protein of Planthopper Is Required for Feeding and Induces Immunity Response in Plants

While feeding on rice plants, planthoppers <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>e saliva, which plays crucial roles in nutrient ingestion and modulating plant defense responses, although the specific functions of salivary proteins remain largely unknown. We identified an <i>N. lugens</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ed mucin-like protein (NlMLP) by transcriptome and proteome analyses and characterized its function, both in brown planthopper and in plants. <i>NlMLP</i> is highly expressed in salivary glands and is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ed into rice during feeding. Inhibition of <i>NlMLP</i> expression in planthoppers disturbs the formation of salivary sheaths, thereby reducing their performance. In plants, NlMLP induces cell death, the expression of defense-related genes, and callose deposition. These defense responses are related to Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization and the MEK2 MAP kinase and jasmonic acid signaling pathways. The active region of NlMLP that elicits plant responses is located in its carboxyl terminus. Our work provides a detailed characterization of a salivary protein from a piercing-sucking insect other than aphids.

Clathrin Heavy Chain Subunits Coordinate Endo- and Exocytic Traffic and Affect Stomatal Movement
<p>The current model for vesicular traffic to and from the plasma membrane is accepted, but the molecular requirements for this coordination are not well defined. We have identified the <i>hot ABA-deficiency suppressor1</i> mutant, which has a stomatal function defect, as a <i>clathrin heavy chain1</i> (<i>CHC1</i>) mutant allele and show that it has a decreased rate of endocytosis and growth defects that are shared with other <i>chc1</i> mutant alleles. We used <i>chc1</i> alleles and the related <i>chc2</i> mutant as tools to investigate the effects that clathrin defects have on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion pathways and plant growth. We show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion and endocytosis at the plasma membrane are sensitive to CHC1 and CHC2 function in seedling roots and that <i>chc</i> mutants have physiological defects in stomatal function and plant growth that have not been described previously. These findings suggest that clathrin supports specific functions in multiple cell types. Stomata movement and gas exchange are altered in <i>chc</i> mutants, indicating that clathrin is important for stomatal regulation. The aberrant function of <i>chc</i> mutant stomata is consistent with the growth phenotypes observed under different water and light conditions, which also are similar to those of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ory SNARE mutant, <i>syp121</i>. The <i>syp121</i> and <i>chc</i> mutants have impaired endocytosis and exocytosis compared with the wild type, indicating a link between SYP121-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion and clathrin-dependent endocytosis at the plasma membrane. Our findings provide evidence that clathrin and SYP121 functions are important for the coordination of endocytosis and exocytosis and have an impact on stomatal function, gas exchange, and vegetative growth in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>).</p>

Dynamic Cytology and Transcriptional Regulation of Rice Lamina Joint Development
<p>Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) leaf angle is determined by lamina joint and is an important agricultural trait determining leaf erectness and, hence, the photosynthesis efficiency and grain yield. Genetic studies reveal a complex regulatory network of lamina joint development; however, the morphological changes, cytological transitions, and underlying transcriptional programming remain to be elucidated. A systemic morphological and cytological study reveals a dynamic developmental process and suggests a common but distinct regulation of the lamina joint. Successive and sequential cell division and expansion, cell wall thickening, and programmed cell death at the adaxial or abaxial sides form the cytological basis of the lamina joint, and the increased leaf angle results from the asymmetric cell proliferation and elongation. Analysis of the gene expression profiles at four distinct developmental stages ranging from initiation to senescence showed that genes related to cell division and growth, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>e synthesis and signaling, transcription (transcription factors), and protein phosphorylation (protein kinases) exhibit distinct spatiotemporal patterns during lamina joint development. Phyto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>es play crucial roles by promoting cell differentiation and growth at early stages or regulating the maturation and senescence at later stages, which is consistent with the quantitative analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>es at different stages. Further comparison with the gene expression profile of <i>leaf inclination1</i>, a mutant with decreased auxin and increased leaf angle, indicates the coordinated effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>es in regulating lamina joint. These results reveal a dynamic cytology of rice lamina joint that is fine-regulated by multiple factors, providing informative clues for illustrating the regulatory mechanisms of leaf angle and plant architecture.</p>

Bacterial Biosensors for in Vivo Spatiotemporal Mapping of Root Secretion
<p>Plants engineer the rhizosphere to their advantage by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ing various nutrients and secondary metabolites. Coupling transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses of the pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) rhizosphere, a suite of bioreporters has been developed in <i>Rhizobium leguminosarum</i> bv <i>viciae</i> strain 3841, and these detect metabolites <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ed by roots in space and time. Fourteen bacterial <i>lux</i> fusion bioreporters, specific for sugars, polyols, amino acids, organic acids, or flavonoids, have been validated in vitro and in vivo. Using different bacterial mutants (<i>nodC</i> and <i>nifH</i>), the process of colonization and symbiosis has been analyzed, revealing compounds important in the different steps of the rhizobium-legume association. Dicarboxylates and sucrose are the main carbon sources within the nodules; in ineffective (<i>nifH</i>) nodules, particularly low levels of sucrose were observed, suggesting that plant sanctions affect carbon supply to nodules. In contrast, high <i>myo</i>-inositol levels were observed prior to nodule formation and also in <i>nifH</i> senescent nodules. Amino acid biosensors showed different patterns: a γ-aminobutyrate biosensor was active only inside nodules, whereas the phenylalanine bioreporter showed a high signal also in the rhizosphere. The bioreporters were further validated in vetch (<i>Vicia hirsuta</i>), producing similar results. In addition, vetch exhibited a local increase of <i>nod</i> gene-inducing flavonoids at sites where nodules developed subsequently. These bioreporters will be particularly helpful in understanding the dynamics of root exudation and the role of different molecules <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ed into the rhizosphere.</p>

Regulation of Strigolactone Biosynthesis by Gibberellin Signaling
<p>Strigolactones (SLs) are a class of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>es that regulate diverse physiological processes, including shoot branching and root development. They also act as rhizosphere signaling molecules to stimulate the germination of root parasitic weeds and the branching of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Although various types of cross talk between SLs and other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>es have been reported in physiological analyses, the cross talk between gibberellin (GA) and SLs is poorly understood. We screened for chemicals that regulate the level of SLs in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) and identified GA as, to our knowledge, a novel SL-regulating molecule. The regulation of SL biosynthesis by GA is dependent on the GA receptor GID1 and F-box protein GID2. GA treatment also reduced the infection of rice plants by the parasitic plant witchers weed (<i>Striga hermonthica</i>). These data not only demonstrate, to our knowledge, the novel plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>e cross talk between SL and GA, but also suggest that GA can be used to control parasitic weed infections.</p>

An Ethylene-Induced Regulatory Module Delays Flower Senescence by Regulating Cytokinin Content
<p>In many plant species, including rose (<i>Rosa hybrida</i>), flower senescence is promoted by the gaseous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>e ethylene and inhibited by the cytokinin (CTK) class of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>es. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these antagonistic effects are not well understood. In this study, we characterized the association between a pathogenesis-related PR-10 family gene from rose (<i>RhPR10.1</i>) and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>al regulation of flower senescence. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR analysis showed that <i>RhPR10.1</i> was expressed at high levels during senescence in different floral organs, including petal, sepal, receptacle, stamen, and pistil, and that expression was induced by ethylene treatment. Silencing of <i>RhPR10.1</i> expression in rose plants by virus-induced gene silencing accelerated flower senescence, which was accompanied by a higher ion leakage rate in the petals, as well as increased expression of the senescence marker gene <i>RhSAG12</i>. CTK content and the expression of three CTK signaling pathway genes were reduced in <i>RhPR10.1</i>-silenced plants, and the accelerated rate of petal senescence that was apparent in the <i>RhPR10.1</i>-silenced plants was restored to normal levels by CTK treatment. Finally, RhHB6, a homeodomain-Leu zipper I transcription factor, was observed to bind to the <i>RhPR10.1</i> promoter, and silencing of its expression also promoted flower senescence. Our results reveal an ethylene-induced RhHB6-RhPR10.1 regulatory module that functions as a brake of ethylene-promoted senescence through increasing the CTK content.</p>

The secreted <i>AdamTS-A</i> metalloprotease is required for collective cell migration
<p>Members of the ADAMTS family of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ed metalloproteases play crucial roles in modulating the extracellular matrix (ECM) in development and disease. Here, we show that ADAMTS-A, the <i>Drosophila</i> ortholog of human ADAMTS 9 and ADAMTS 20, and of <i>C. elegans</i> GON-1, is required for cell migration during embryogenesis. <i>AdamTS-A</i> is expressed in multiple migratory cell types, including hemocytes, caudal visceral mesoderm (CVM), the visceral branch of the trachea (VBs) and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ory portion of the salivary gland (SG). Loss of <i>AdamTS-A</i> causes defects in germ cell, CVM and VB migration and, depending on the tissue, <i>AdamTS-A</i> functions both autonomously and non-autonomously. In the highly polarized collective of the SG epithelium, loss of <i>AdamTS-A</i> causes apical surface irregularities and cell elongation defects. We provide evidence that ADAMTS-A is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ed into the SG lumen where it functions to release cells from the apical ECM, consistent with the defects observed in <i>AdamTS-A</i> mutant SGs. We show that loss of the apically localized protocadherin <i>Cad99C</i> rescues the SG defects, suggesting that Cad99C serves as a link between the SG apical membrane and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ed apical ECM component(s) cleaved by ADAMTS-A. Our analysis of <i>AdamTS-A</i> function in the SG suggests a novel role for ADAMTS proteins in detaching cells from the apical ECM, facilitating tube elongation during collective cell migration.</p>

To test the hypothesis that toll-like receptor 4 (<i>TLR4</i>) mediates proinflammatory polarization of MSCs, we characterized cardiac MSCs from <i>TLR4</i><sup>-/-</sup> and wild-type (WT) mice after inflammatory stimulation in vitro.

Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 Induces Aortic Valve Calcification by Inhibiting Insulin-Like Growth Factor-1 Signaling in Valvular Interstitial Cells
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Calcification of the aortic valve leads to increased leaflet stiffness and consequently to the development of calcific aortic valve disease. However, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms of calcification remain unclear.

We also induced calcific aortic stenosis in male New Zealand rabbits (weight, 2.5–3.0 kg) by a cholesterol-enriched diet+vitamin D2 (25 000 IU, daily). Echocardiography was performed to assess the aortic valve area and the maximal and mean transaortic pressure gradients at baseline and 3-week intervals thereafter. After 12 weeks, we harvested the heart and evaluated the aortic valve tissue using immunohistochemistry.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We found that nitric oxide depletion in human valvular endothelial cells activates NF-κB in human VICs.

The inhibition of DPP-4 enzymatic activity blocked the osteogenic changes in VICs in vitro and reduced the aortic valve calcification in vivo in a mouse model.

Abscisic Acid Down-Regulates Hydraulic Conductance of Grapevine Leaves in Isohydric Genotypes Only<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plants evolved different strategies to cope with water stress. While isohydric species maintain their midday leaf water potential (Ψ<sub>M</sub>) under soil water deficit by closing their stomata, anisohydric species maintain higher stomatal aperture and exhibit substantial reductions in Ψ<sub>M</sub>. It was hypothesized that isohydry is related to a locally higher sensitivity of stomata to the drought-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>e abscisic acid (ABA). Interestingly, recent lines of evidence in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) suggested that stomatal responsiveness is also controlled by an ABA action on leaf water supply upstream from stomata. Here, we tested the possibility in grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) that different genotypes ranging from near isohydric to more anisohydric may have different sensitivities in these ABA responses. Measurements on whole plants in drought conditions were combined with assays on detached leaves fed with ABA. Two different methods consistently showed that leaf hydraulic conductance (K<sub>leaf</sub>) was down-regulated by exogenous ABA, with strong variations depending on the genotype. Importantly, variation between isohydry and anisohydry correlated with K<sub>leaf</sub> sensitivity to ABA, with K<sub>leaf</sub> in the most anisohydric genotypes being unresponsive to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>e. We propose that the observed response of K<sub>leaf</sub> to ABA may be part of the overall ABA regulation of leaf water status.</p>

Plant Glandular Trichomes: Natural Cell Factories of High Biotechnological Interest
<p>Multicellular glandular trichomes are epidermal outgrowths characterized by the presence of a head made of cells that have the ability to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>e or store large quantities of specialized metabolites. Our understanding of the transcriptional control of glandular trichome initiation and development is still in its infancy. This review points to some central questions that need to be addressed to better understand how such specialized cell structures arise from the plant protodermis. A key and unique feature of glandular trichomes is their ability to synthesize and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>e large amounts, relative to their size, of a limited number of metabolites. As such, they qualify as true cell factories, making them interesting targets for metabolic engineering. In this review, recent advances regarding terpene metabolic engineering are highlighted, with a special focus on tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>). In particular, the choice of transcriptional promoters to drive transgene expression and the best ways to sink existing pools of terpene precursors are discussed. The bioavailability of existing pools of natural precursor molecules is a key parameter and is controlled by so-called cross talk between different biosynthetic pathways. As highlighted in this review, the exact nature and extent of such cross talk are only partially understood at present. In the future, awareness of, and detailed knowledge on, the biology of plant glandular trichome development and metabolism will generate new leads to tap the largely unexploited potential of glandular trichomes in plant resistance to pests and lead to the improved production of specialized metabolites with high industrial or pharmacological value.</p>

Analysis of the ZAR1 Immune Complex Reveals Determinants for Immunity and Molecular Interactions<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plants depend on innate immunity to prevent disease. Plant pathogenic bacteria, like <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> and <i>Xanthomonas campestris</i>, use the type III <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion system as a molecular syringe to inject type III <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ed effector (T3SE) proteins in plants. The primary function of most T3SEs is to suppress immunity; however, the plant can evolve nucleotide-binding domain-leucine-rich repeat domain-containing proteins to recognize specific T3SEs. The AtZAR1 NLR induces strong defense responses against <i>P. syringae</i> and <i>X. campestris</i>. The <i>P. syringae</i> T3SE HopZ1a is an acetyltransferase that acetylates the pseudokinase AtZED1 and triggers recognition by AtZAR1. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that lead to AtZAR1-induced immunity in response to HopZ1a. We established a transient expression system in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> to study detailed interactions among HopZ1a, AtZED1, and AtZAR1. We show that the AtZAR1 immune pathway is conserved in <i>N. benthamiana</i> and identify AtZAR1 domains, and residues in AtZAR1 and AtZED1, that are important for immunity and protein-protein interactions in planta and in yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>). We show that the coiled-coil domain of AtZAR1 oligomerizes, and this domain acts as a signal to induce immunity. This detailed analysis of the AtZAR1-AtZED1 protein complex provides a better understanding of the immune signaling hub controlled by AtZAR1.</p>

An R2R3-MYB Transcription Factor Regulates Capsaicinoid Biosynthesis
<p>Capsaicinoids are responsible for the hot taste of chili peppers. They are restricted to the genus <i>Capsicum</i> and are synthesized by the acylation of the aromatic compound vanillylamine (derived from the phenylpropanoid pathway) with a branched-chain fatty acid by the catalysis of the putative enzyme capsaicinoid synthase. R2R3-MYB transcription factors have been reported in different species of plants as regulators of structural genes of the phenylpropanoid pathway; therefore, we hypothesized that MYB genes might be involved in the regulation of the biosynthesis of pungent compounds. In this study, an <i>R2R3-MYB</i> transcription factor gene, designated <i>CaMYB31</i>, was isolated and characterized in <i>Capsicum annuum</i> ‘Tampiqueíííéóéííóéíño 74’. Bioinformatic analysis suggested that <i>CaMYB31</i> could be involved in secondary metabolism, stress and plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>e responses, and development. <i>CaMYB31</i> expression analysis from placental tissue of pungent and nonpungent chili pepper fruits showed a positive correlation with the structural genes <i>Ca4H</i>, <i>Comt</i>, <i>Kas</i>, <i>pAmt</i>, and <i>AT3</i> expression and also with the content of capsaicin and dihydrocapsacin during fruit development. However, <i>CaMYB31</i> also was expressed in vegetative tissues (leaves, roots, and stems). Moreover, <i>CaMYB31</i> silencing significantly reduced the expression of capsaicinoid biosynthetic genes and the capsaicinoid content. Additionally, <i>CaMYB31</i> expression was affected by the plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>es indoleacetic acid, jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, and gibberellic acid or by wounding, temperature, and light, factors known to affect the production of capsaicinoids. These findings indicate that <i>CaMYB31</i> is indeed involved in the regulation of structural genes of the capsaicinoid biosynthetic pathway.</p>

Cuticle Biosynthesis in Tomato Leaves Is Developmentally Regulated by Abscisic Acid
<p>The expansion of aerial organs in plants is coupled with the synthesis and deposition of a hydrophobic cuticle, composed of cutin and waxes, which is critically important in limiting water loss. While the abiotic stress-related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>e abscisic acid (ABA) is known to up-regulate wax accumulation in response to drought, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>al regulation of cuticle biosynthesis during organ ontogeny is poorly understood. To address the hypothesis that ABA also mediates cuticle formation during organ development, we assessed the effect of ABA deficiency on cuticle formation in three ABA biosynthesis-impaired tomato mutants. The mutant leaf cuticles were thinner, had structural abnormalities, and had a substantial reduction in levels of cutin. ABA deficiency also consistently resulted in differences in the composition of leaf cutin and cuticular waxes. Exogenous application of ABA partially rescued these phenotypes, confirming that they were a consequence of reduced ABA levels. The ABA mutants also showed reduced expression of genes involved in cutin or wax formation. This difference was again countered by exogenous ABA, further indicating regulation of cuticle biosynthesis by ABA. The fruit cuticles were affected differently by the ABA-associated mutations, but in general were thicker. However, no structural abnormalities were observed, and the cutin and wax compositions were less affected than in leaf cuticles, suggesting that ABA action influences cuticle formation in an organ-dependent manner. These results suggest dual roles for ABA in regulating leaf cuticle formation: one that is fundamentally associated with leaf expansion, independent of abiotic stress, and another that is drought induced.</p>

RXLR Effector AVR2 Up-Regulates a Brassinosteroid-Responsive bHLH Transcription Factor to Suppress Immunity
<p>An emerging area in plant research focuses on antagonism between regulatory systems governing growth and immunity. Such cross talk represents a point of vulnerability for pathogens to exploit. AVR2, an RXLR effector <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ed by the potato blight pathogen <i>Phytophthora infestans</i>, interacts with potato BSL1, a putative phosphatase implicated in growth-promoting brassinosteroid (BR) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>e signaling. Transgenic potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>) plants expressing the effector exhibit transcriptional and phenotypic hallmarks of overactive BR signaling and show enhanced susceptibility to <i>P. infestans</i>. Microarray analysis was used to identify a set of BR-responsive marker genes in potato, all of which are constitutively expressed to BR-induced levels in AVR2 transgenic lines. One of these genes was a bHLH transcription factor, designated <i>StCHL1</i>, homologous to <i>AtCIB1</i> and <i>AtHBI1</i>, which are known to facilitate antagonism between BR and immune responses. Transient expression of either AVR2 or CHL1 enhanced leaf colonization by <i>P. infestans</i> and compromised immune cell death activated by perception of the elicitin Infestin1 (INF1). Knockdown of <i>CHL1</i> transcript using Virus-Induced Gene Silencing (VIGS) reduced colonization of <i>P. infestans</i> on <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. Moreover, the ability of AVR2 to suppress INF1-triggered cell death was attenuated in <i>NbCHL1</i>-silenced plants, indicating that NbCHL1 was important for this effector activity. Thus, AVR2 exploits cross talk between BR signaling and innate immunity in <i>Solanum</i> species, representing a novel, indirect mode of innate immune suppression by a filamentous pathogen effector.</p>

The Transcription Factor MYB29 Is a Regulator of <i>ALTERNATIVE OXIDASE1a</i>
<p>Plants sense and integrate a variety of signals from the environment through different interacting signal transduction pathways that involve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>es and signaling molecules. Using <i>ALTERNATIVE OXIDASE1a</i> (<i>AOX1a</i>) gene expression as a model system of retrograde or stress signaling between mitochondria and the nucleus, MYB DOMAIN PROTEIN29 (MYB29) was identified as a negative regulator (<i>regulator of alternative oxidase1a 7</i> [<i>rao7</i>] mutant) in a genetic screen of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). <i>rao7/myb29</i> mutants have increased levels of AOX1a transcript and protein compared to wild type after induction with antimycin A. A variety of genes previously associated with the mitochondrial stress response also display enhanced transcript abundance, indicating that RAO7/MYB29 negatively regulates mitochondrial stress responses in general. Meta-analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hormon</span></strong>e-responsive marker genes and identification of downstream transcription factor networks revealed that MYB29 functions in the complex interplay of ethylene, jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, and reactive oxygen species signaling by regulating the expression of various ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR and WRKY transcription factors. Despite an enhanced induction of mitochondrial stress response genes, <i>rao7</i>/<i>myb29</i> mutants displayed an increased sensitivity to combined moderate light and drought stress. These results uncover interactions between mitochondrial retrograde signaling and the regulation of glucosinolate biosynthesis, both regulated by RAO7/MYB29. This common regulator can explain why perturbation of the mitochondrial function leads to transcriptomic responses overlapping with responses to biotic stress.</p>

Stress conditioning also increased SERCA2 (Sarco/Endoplasmic Reticulum Calcium ATPase 2) expression, which correlated with a less negative force-frequency relationship. When electric pacing was combined with static stress conditioning, the tissues showed an additional increase in force production (1.34±0.19 mN/mm<sup>2</sup>), with no change in construct alignment or cell size, suggesting maturation of excitation-contraction coupling.

Selective targeting of engineered T cells using orthogonal IL-2 cytokine-receptor complexes
<p>Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a cytokine required for effector T cell expansion, survival, and function, especially for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eered T cells in adoptive cell immunotherapy, but its pleiotropy leads to simultaneous stimulation and suppression of immune responses as well as systemic toxicity, limiting its therapeutic use. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eered IL-2 cytokine-receptor orthogonal (<i>ortho</i>) pairs that interact with one another, transmitting native IL-2 signals, but do not interact with their natural cytokine and receptor counterparts. Introduction of <i>ortho</i>IL-2Rβ into T cells enabled the selective cellular targeting of <i>ortho</i>IL-2 to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eered CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in vitro and in vivo, with limited off-target effects and negligible toxicity. <i>Ortho</i>IL-2 pairs were efficacious in a preclinical mouse cancer model of adoptive cell therapy and may therefore represent a synthetic approach to achieving selective potentiation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eered cells.</p>

Programmable protein circuits in living cells
<p>Synthetic protein-level circuits could enable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering of powerful new cellular behaviors. Rational protein circuit design would be facilitated by a composable protein-protein regulation system in which individual protein components can regulate one another to create a variety of different circuit architectures. In this study, we show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eered viral proteases can function as composable protein components, which can together implement a broad variety of circuit-level functions in mammalian cells. In this system, termed CHOMP (circuits of hacked orthogonal modular proteases), input proteases dock with and cleave target proteases to inhibit their function. These components can be connected to generate regulatory cascades, binary logic gates, and dynamic analog signal-processing functions. To demonstrate the utility of this system, we rationally designed a circuit that induces cell death in response to upstream activators of the Ras oncogene. Because CHOMP circuits can perform complex functions yet be encoded as single transcripts and delivered without genomic integration, they offer a scalable platform to facilitate protein circuit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering for biotechnological applications.</p>

Hepatic thrombopoietin is required for bone marrow hematopoietic stem cell maintenance
<p>Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance depends on extrinsic cues. Currently, only local signals arising from the bone marrow niche have been shown to maintain HSCs. However, it is not known whether systemic factors also sustain HSCs. We assessed the physiological source of thrombopoietin (TPO), a key cytokine required for maintaining HSCs. Using <i>Tpo<sup>DsRed-CreER</sup></i> knock-in mice, we showed that TPO is expressed by hepatocytes but not by bone marrow cells. Deletion of <i>Tpo</i> from hematopoietic cells, osteoblasts, or bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells does not affect HSC number or function. However, when <i>Tpo</i> is deleted from hepatocytes, bone marrow HSCs are depleted. Thus, a cross-organ factor, circulating TPO made in the liver by hepatocytes, is required for bone marrow HSC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance. Our results demonstrate that systemic factors, in addition to the local niche, are a critical extrinsic component for HSC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance.</p>

Nuclear Prohibitin3 Maintains Genome Integrity and Cell Proliferation in the Root Meristem through Minichromosome Maintenance 2
<p>The nucleo-mitochondrial dual-localized proteins can act as gene expression regulators; however, few instances of these proteins have been described in plants. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) PROHIBITIN 3 (PHB3) is involved in stress responses and developmental processes, but it is unknown how these roles are achieved at the molecular level in the nucleus. In this study, we show that nucleo-mitochondrial PHB3 plays an essential role in regulating genome stability and cell proliferation. <i>PHB3</i> is up-regulated by DNA damage agents, and the stress-induced PHB3 proteins accumulate in the nucleus. Loss of function of <i>PHB3</i> results in DNA damage and defective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance of the root stem cell niche. Subsequently, the expression patterns and levels of the root stem cell regulators are altered and down-regulated, respectively. In addition, the <i>phb3</i> mutant shows aberrant cell division and altered expression of cell cycle–related genes, such as <i>CycB1</i> and <i>Cyclin dependent kinase 1</i>. Moreover, the minichromosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance (MCM) genes, e.g. <i>MCM2</i>, <i>MCM3</i>, <i>MCM4</i>, <i>MCM5</i>, <i>MCM6</i>, and <i>MCM7</i>, are up-regulated in the <i>phb3</i> mutant. Reducing the <i>MCM2</i> expression level substantially recovers the DNA damage in the <i>phb3</i> mutant and partially rescues the altered cell proliferation and root deficiency of <i>phb3</i> seedlings. PHB3 acts as a transcriptional coregulator that represses <i>MCM2</i> expression by competitively binding to the promoter E2F–cis-acting elements with E2Fa so as to modulate primary root growth. Collectively, these findings indicate that nuclear-localized PHB3 acts as a transcriptional coregulator that suppresses <i>MCM2</i> expression to sustain genome integrity and cell proliferation for stem cell niche <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance in Arabidopsis.</p>

MoChlo: A Versatile, Modular Cloning Toolbox for Chloroplast Biotechnology
<p>Plant synthetic biology is a rapidly evolving field with new tools constantly emerging to drive innovation. Of particular interest is the application of synthetic biology to chloroplast biotechnology to generate plants capable of producing new metabolites, vaccines, biofuels, and high-value chemicals. Progress made in the assembly of large DNA molecules, composing multiple transcriptional units, has significantly aided in the ability to rapidly construct novel vectors for genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering. In particular, Golden Gate assembly has provided a facile molecular tool for standardized assembly of synthetic genetic elements into larger DNA constructs. In this work, a complete modular chloroplast cloning system, MoChlo, was developed and validated for fast and flexible chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering in plants. A library of 128 standardized chloroplast-specific parts (47 promoters, 38 5′ untranslated regions [5′UTRs], nine promoter:5′UTR fusions, 10 3′UTRs, 14 genes of interest, and 10 chloroplast-specific destination vectors) were mined from the literature and modified for use in MoChlo assembly, along with chloroplast-specific destination vectors. The strategy was validated by assembling synthetic operons of various sizes and determining the efficiency of assembly. This method was successfully used to generate chloroplast transformation vectors containing up to seven transcriptional units in a single vector (∼10.6-kb synthetic operon). To enable researchers with limited resources to engage in chloroplast biotechnology, and to accelerate progress in the field, the entire kit, as described, is available through Addgene at minimal cost. Thus, the MoChlo kit represents a valuable tool for fast and flexible design of heterologous metabolic pathways for plastid metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering.</p>

<i>N</i>-Glycoproteomic Characterization of Mannosidase and Xylosyltransferase Mutant Strains of <i>Chlamydomonas</i> <i>reinhardtii</i>
<p>At present, only little is known about the enzymatic machinery required for <i>N</i>-glycosylation in <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, leading to the formation of <i>N</i>-glycans harboring Xyl and methylated Man. This machinery possesses new enzymatic features, as <i>C. reinhardtii N</i>-glycans are independent of β1,2-<i>N</i>-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I. Here we have performed comparative <i>N</i>-glycoproteomic analyses of insertional mutants of mannosidase 1A (IM<i><sub>Man1A</sub></i>) and xylosyltransferase 1A (IM<i><sub>XylT1A</sub></i>). The disruption of <i>man1A</i> affected methylation of Man and the addition of terminal Xyl. The absence of XylT1A led to shorter <i>N</i>-glycans compared to the wild type. The use of a IM<i><sub>Man1A</sub></i>xIM<i><sub>XylT1A</sub></i> double mutant revealed that the absence of Man1A suppressed the IM<i><sub>XylT1A</sub></i> phenotype, indicating that the increased <i>N</i>-glycan trimming is regulated by core β1,2-Xyl and is dependent on Man1A activity. These data point toward an enzymatic cascade in the <i>N</i>-glycosylation pathway of <i>C. reinhardtii</i> with interlinked roles of Man1A and XylT1A. The results described herein represent the first step toward a functional characterization of the enzymatic <i>N</i>-glycosylation machinery in <i>C. reinhardtii</i>.</p>

A Connection between Lysine and Serotonin Metabolism in Rice Endosperm
<p>Cereal endosperms produce a vast array of metabolites, including the essential amino acid lysine (Lys). Enhanced accumulation of Lys has been achieved via metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering in cereals, but the potential connection between metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering and Lys fortification is unclear. In mature seeds of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eered High Free Lysine (HFL) rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), the endosperm takes on a characteristic dark-brown appearance. In this study, we use an integrated metabolomic and transcriptomic approach combined with functional validation to elucidate the key metabolites responsible for the dark-brown phenotype. Importantly, we found that serotonin biosynthesis was elevated dramatically and closely linked with dark-brown endosperm color in HFL rice. A functional connection between serotonin and endosperm color was confirmed via overexpression of TDC3, a key enzyme of serotonin biosynthesis. Furthermore, we show that both the jasmonate signaling pathway and <i>TDC</i> expression were strongly induced in the late stage of endosperm development of HFL rice, coinciding with serotonin accumulation and dark-brown pigmentation. We propose a model for the metabolic connection between Lys and serotonin metabolism in which elevated 2-aminoadipate from Lys catabolism may play a key role in the connection between the jasmonate signaling pathway, serotonin accumulation, and the brown phenotype in rice endosperm. Our data provide a deeper understanding of amino acid metabolism in rice. In addition, the finding that both Lys and serotonin accumulate in HFL rice grains should promote efforts to create a nutritionally favorable crop.</p>

A Light Harvesting Complex-Like Protein in Maintenance of Photosynthetic Components in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>
<p>Using a genetic approach, we have identified and characterized a novel protein, named Msf1 (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance factor for photosystem I), that is required for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance of specific components of the photosynthetic apparatus in the green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>. Msf1 belongs to the superfamily of light-harvesting complex proteins with three transmembrane domains and consensus chlorophyll-binding sites. Loss of Msf1 leads to reduced accumulation of photosystem I and chlorophyll-binding proteins/complexes. Msf1is a component of a thylakoid complex containing key enzymes of the tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway, thus revealing a possible link between Msf1 and chlorophyll biosynthesis. Protein interaction assays and greening experiments demonstrate that Msf1 interacts with Copper target homolog1 (CHL27B) and accumulates concomitantly with chlorophyll in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>, implying that chlorophyll stabilizes Msf1. Contrary to other light-harvesting complex-like genes, the expression of <i>Msf1</i> is not stimulated by high-light stress, but its protein level increases significantly under heat shock, iron and copper limitation, as well as in stationary cells. Based on these results, we propose that Msf1 is required for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance of photosystem I and specific protein-chlorophyll complexes especially under certain stress conditions.</p>

Saltational evolution of the heterotrimeric G protein signaling mechanisms in the plant kingdom
<p>Signaling proteins evolved diverse interactions to provide specificity for distinct stimuli. Signaling complexity in the G protein (heterotrimeric guanosine triphosphate–binding protein) network was achieved in animals through subunit duplication and incremental evolution. By combining comprehensive and quantitative phenotypic profiles of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> with protein evolution informatics, we found that plant heterotrimeric G protein machinery evolved by a saltational (jumping) process. Sequence similarity scores mapped onto tertiary structures, and biochemical validation showed that the extra-large Gα (XLG) subunit evolved extensively in the charophycean algae (an aquatic green plant) by gene duplication and gene fusion. In terrestrial plants, further evolution uncoupled XLG from its negative regulator, regulator of G protein signaling, but preserved an α-helix region that enables interaction with its partner Gβγ. The ancestral gene evolved slowly due to the molecular constraints imposed by the need for the protein to maintain interactions with various partners, whereas the genes encoding XLG proteins evolved rapidly to produce three highly divergent members. Analysis of <i>A. thaliana</i> mutants indicated that these Gα and XLG proteins all function with Gβγ and evolved to operate both independently and cooperatively. The XLG-Gβγ machinery specialized in environmental stress responses, whereas the canonical Gα-Gβγ retained developmental roles. Some developmental processes, such as shoot development, involve both Gα and XLG acting cooperatively or antagonistically. These extensive and rapid evolutionary changes in XLG structure compared to those of the canonical Gα subunit contrast with the accepted notion of how pathway diversification occurs through gene duplication with subsequent incremental coevolution of residues among interacting proteins.</p>

Design and evaluation of engineered protein biosensors for live-cell imaging of EGFR phosphorylation
<p>Live-cell fluorescence microscopy is broadly applied to study the dynamics of receptor-mediated cell signaling, but the availability of intracellular biosensors is limited. A biosensor based on the tandem SH2 domains from phospholipase C–γ1 (PLCγ1), tSH2-WT, has been used to measure phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Here, we found that tSH2-WT lacked specificity for phosphorylated EGFR, consistent with the known promiscuity of SH2 domains. Further, EGF-stimulated membrane recruitment of tSH2-WT differed qualitatively from the expected kinetics of EGFR phosphorylation. Analysis of a mathematical model suggested, and experiments confirmed, that the high avidity of tSH2-WT resulted in saturation of its target and interference with EGFR endocytosis. To overcome the apparent target specificity and saturation issues, we implemented two protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering strategies. In the first approach, we screened a combinatorial library generated by random mutagenesis of the C-terminal SH2 domain (cSH2) of PLCγ1 and isolated a mutant form (mSH2) with enhanced specificity for phosphorylated Tyr<sup>992</sup> (pTyr<sup>992</sup>) of EGFR. A biosensor based on mSH2 closely reported the kinetics of EGFR phosphorylation but retained cross-reactivity similar to tSH2-WT. In the second approach, we isolated a pTyr<sup>992</sup>-binding protein (SPY992) from a combinatorial library generated by mutagenesis of the Sso7d protein scaffold. Compared to tSH2-WT and mSH2, SPY992 exhibited superior performance as a specific, moderate-affinity biosensor. We extended this approach to isolate a biosensor for EGFR pTyr<sup>1148</sup> (SPY1148). This approach of integrating theoretical considerations with protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering strategies can be generalized to design and evaluate suitable biosensors for various phospho-specific targets.</p>

The plant cell wall integrity maintenance and immune signaling systems cooperate to control stress responses in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>Cell walls surround all plant cells, and their composition and structure are modified in a tightly controlled, adaptive manner to meet sometimes opposing functional requirements during growth and development. The plant cell wall integrity (CWI) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance mechanism controls these functional modifications, as well as responses to cell wall damage (CWD). We investigated how the CWI system mediates responses to CWD in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. CWD induced by cell wall–degrading enzymes or an inhibitor of cellulose biosynthesis elicited similar, turgor-sensitive stress responses. Phenotypic clustering with 27 genotypes identified a core group of receptor-like kinases (RLKs) and ion channels required for the activation of CWD responses. A genetic analysis showed that the RLK FEI2 and the plasma membrane–localized mechanosensitive Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel MCA1 functioned downstream of the RLK THE1 in CWD perception. In contrast, pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) signaling components, including the receptors for plant elicitor peptides (<i>At</i>Peps) PEPR1 and PEPR2, repressed responses to CWD. CWD induced the expression of <i>PROPEP1</i> and <i>PROPEP3</i>, which encode the precursors of <i>At</i>Pep1 and <i>At</i>Pep3, and the release of PROPEP3 into the growth medium. Application of <i>At</i>Pep1 and <i>At</i>Pep3 repressed CWD-induced phytohormone accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner. These results suggest that <i>At</i>Pep-mediated signaling suppresses CWD-induced defense responses controlled by the CWI mechanism. This suppression was alleviated when PTI signaling downstream of PEPR1 and PEPR2 was impaired. Defense responses controlled by the CWI <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance mechanism might thus compensate to some extent for the loss of PTI signaling elements.</p>

Termites mitigate the effects of drought in tropical rainforest

The ability of these networks to drive complex structure formation illustrates the power of interlinking cell signaling with cell sorting: Signal-induced spatial reorganization alters the local signals received by each cell, resulting in iterative cycles of cell fate branching.

Anatomy of STEM teaching in North American universities
<p>A large body of evidence demonstrates that strategies that promote student interactions and cognitively engage students with content (<i>1</i>) lead to gains in learning and attitudinal outcomes for students in science, technology, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering, and mathematics (STEM) courses (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). Many educational and governmental bodies have called for and supported adoption of these student-centered strategies throughout the undergraduate STEM curriculum. But to the extent that we have pictures of the STEM undergraduate instructional landscape, it has mostly been provided through self-report surveys of faculty members, within a particular STEM discipline [e.g., (<i>3</i>–<i>6</i>)]. Such surveys are prone to reliability threats and can underestimate the complexity of classroom environments, and few are implemented nationally to provide valid and reliable data (<i>7</i>). Reflecting the limited state of these data, a report from the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering, and Medicine called for improved data collection to understand the use of evidence-based instructional practices (<i>8</i>). We report here a major step toward a characterization of STEM teaching practices in North American universities based on classroom observations from over 2000 classes taught by more than 500 STEM faculty members across 25 institutions.</p>

Nascent DNA methylome mapping reveals inheritance of hemimethylation at CTCF/cohesin sites
<p>The faithful inheritance of the epigenome is critical for cells to maintain gene expression programs and cellular identity across cell divisions. We mapped strand-specific DNA methylation after replication forks and show <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance of the vast majority of the DNA methylome within 20 minutes of replication and inheritance of some hemimethylated CpG dinucleotides (hemiCpGs). Mapping the nascent DNA methylome targeted by each of the three DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) reveals interactions between DNMTs and substrate daughter cytosines en route to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance methylation or hemimethylation. Finally, we show the inheritance of hemiCpGs at short regions flanking CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF)/cohesin binding sites in pluripotent cells. Elimination of hemimethylation causes reduced frequency of chromatin interactions emanating from these sites, suggesting a role for hemimethylation as a stable epigenetic mark regulating CTCF-mediated chromatin interactions.</p>

Activation of surface lattice oxygen in single-atom Pt/CeO<sub>2</sub> for low-temperature CO oxidation
<p>To improve fuel efficiency, advanced combustion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>es are being designed to minimize the amount of heat wasted in the exhaust.

In this study, we demonstrate how atomically dispersed ionic platinum (Pt<sup>2+</sup>) on ceria (CeO<sub>2</sub>), which is already thermally stable, can be activated via steam treatment (at 750°C) to simultaneously achieve the goals of low-temperature carbon monoxide (CO) oxidation activity while providing outstanding hydrothermal stability. A new type of active site is created on CeO<sub>2</sub> in the vicinity of Pt<sup>2+</sup>, which provides the improved reactivity. These active sites are stable up to 800°C in oxidizing environments.</p>

RNA editing with CRISPR-Cas13
<p>Nucleic acid editing holds promise for treating genetic disease, particularly at the RNA level, where disease-relevant sequences can be rescued to yield functional protein products.

We profiled type VI systems in order to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eer a Cas13 ortholog capable of robust knockdown and demonstrated RNA editing by using catalytically inactive Cas13 (dCas13) to direct adenosine-to-inosine deaminase activity by ADAR2 (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA type 2) to transcripts in mammalian cells. This system, referred to as RNA Editing for Programmable A to I Replacement (REPAIR), which has no strict sequence constraints, can be used to edit full-length transcripts containing pathogenic mutations. We further <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eered this system to create a high-specificity variant and minimized the system to facilitate viral delivery.

GTPase activity–coupled treadmilling of the bacterial tubulin FtsZ organizes septal cell wall synthesis
<p>The bacterial tubulin FtsZ is the central component of the cell division machinery, coordinating an ensemble of proteins involved in septal cell wall synthesis to ensure successful constriction. How cells achieve this coordination is unknown. We found that in <i>Escherichia coli</i> cells, FtsZ exhibits dynamic treadmilling predominantly determined by its guanosine triphosphatase activity. The treadmilling dynamics direct the processive movement of the septal cell wall synthesis machinery but do not limit the rate of septal synthesis. In FtsZ mutants with severely reduced treadmilling, the spatial distribution of septal synthesis and the molecular composition and ultrastructure of the septal cell wall were substantially altered. Thus, FtsZ treadmilling provides a mechanism for achieving uniform septal cell wall synthesis to enable correct polar morphology.</p>

Experimental measurement of binding energy, selectivity, and allostery using fluctuation theorems
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thermodynam</span></strong>ic bulk measurements of binding reactions rely on the validity of the law of mass action and the assumption of a dilute solution. Yet, important biological systems such as allosteric ligand-receptor binding, macromolecular crowding, or misfolded molecules may not follow these assumptions and may require a particular reaction model. Here we introduce a fluctuation theorem for ligand binding and an experimental approach using single-molecule force spectroscopy to determine binding energies, selectivity, and allostery of nucleic acids and peptides in a model-independent fashion. A similar approach could be used for proteins.

Depleting dietary valine permits nonmyeloablative mouse hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
<p>A specialized bone marrow microenvironment (niche) regulates hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal and commitment. For successful donor-HSC engraftment, the niche must be emptied via myeloablative irradiation or chemotherapy. However, myeloablation can cause severe complications and even mortality. Here we report that the essential amino acid valine is indispensable for the proliferation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance of HSCs. Both mouse and human HSCs failed to proliferate when cultured in valine-depleted conditions. In mice fed a valine-restricted diet, HSC frequency fell dramatically within 1 week. Furthermore, dietary valine restriction emptied the mouse bone marrow niche and afforded donor-HSC engraftment without chemoirradiative myeloablation. These findings indicate a critical role for valine in HSC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance and suggest that dietary valine restriction may reduce iatrogenic complications in HSC transplantation.</p>

A Synthetic Oxygen Sensor for Plants Based on Animal Hypoxia Signaling
<p>Due to the involvement of oxygen in many essential metabolic reactions, all living organisms have developed molecular systems that allow adaptive physiological and metabolic transitions depending on oxygen availability. In mammals, the expression of hypoxia-response genes is controlled by the heterodimeric Hypoxia-Inducible Factor. The activity of this transcriptional regulator is linked mainly to the oxygen-dependent hydroxylation of conserved proline residues in its α-subunit, carried out by prolyl-hydroxylases, and subsequent ubiquitination via the E3 ligase von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor, which targets Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-α to the proteasome. By exploiting bio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eered versions of this mammalian oxygen sensor, we designed and optimized a synthetic device that drives gene expression in an oxygen-dependent fashion in plants. Transient assays in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mesophyll protoplasts indicated that a combination of the yeast Gal4/upstream activating sequence system and the mammalian oxygen sensor machinery can be used effectively to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eer a modular, oxygen-inducible transcriptional regulator. This synthetic device also was shown to be selectively controlled by oxygen in whole plants when its components were expressed stably in Arabidopsis seedlings. We envision the exploitation of our genetically encoded controllers to generate plants able to switch gene expression selectively depending on oxygen availability, thereby providing a proof of concept for the potential of synthetic biology to assist agricultural practices in environments with variable oxygen provision.</p>

Modulation of Auxin Signaling and Development by Polyadenylation Machinery
<p>Polyadenylation influences gene expression by affecting mRNA stability, transport, and translatability. Here, we report that Cleavage stimulation Factor 77 (AtCstF77), a component of the pre-mRNA 3′-end polyadenylation machinery, affects polyadenylation site (PAS) selection in transcripts of some auxin signaling genes in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Disruption of <i>AtCstF77</i> reduced auxin sensitivity and decreased the expression of the auxin reporter <i>DR5</i>-<i>GFP</i>. Null mutations of <i>cstf77</i> caused severe developmental defects, but were not lethal as previously reported. <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> genetically interacted with <i>transport inhibitor response 1 auxin signaling f</i>-<i>box 2</i> auxin receptor double mutants, further supporting that polyadenylation affects auxin signaling. <i>AtCstF77</i> was ubiquitously expressed in embryos, seedlings, and adult plants. The AtCstF77 protein was localized in the nucleus, which is consistent with its function in pre-mRNA processing. We observed that PASs in transcripts from approximately 2,400 genes were shifted in the <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> mutant. Moreover, most of the PAS shifts were from proximal to distal sites. Auxin treatment also caused PAS shifts in transcripts from a small number of genes. Several auxin signaling or homeostasis genes had different PASs in their transcripts in the <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> mutant. The expression levels of <i>AUXIN RESISTANT 2</i>/<i>INDOLE</i>-<i>3</i>-<i>ACETIC ACID 7</i> were significantly increased in the <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> mutant, which can partially account for the auxin resistance phenotype of this mutant. Our results demonstrate that AtCstF77 plays pleiotropic and critical roles in Arabidopsis development. Moreover, disruption of AtCstF64, another component of the polyadenylation machinery, led to developmental defects and reduced auxin response, similar to those of the <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> mutant. We conclude that AtCstF77 affects auxin responses, likely by controlling PAS selection of transcripts of some auxin signaling components.</p>

Elongator Is Required for Root Stem Cell Maintenance by Regulating <i>SHORTROOT</i> Transcription
<p><i>SHORTROOT</i> (<i>SHR</i>) is essential for stem cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance and radial patterning in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) roots, but how its expression is regulated is unknown. Here, we report that the Elongator complex, which consists of six subunits (ELP1 to ELP6), regulates the transcription of <i>SHR</i>. Depletion of Elongator drastically reduced <i>SHR</i> expression and led to defective root stem cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance and radial patterning. The importance of the nuclear localization of Elongator for its functioning, together with the insensitivity of the <i>elp1</i> mutant to the transcription elongation inhibitor 6-azauracil, and the direct interaction of the ELP4 subunit with the carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, support the notion that Elongator plays important roles in transcription elongation. Indeed, we found that ELP3 associates with the premessenger RNA of <i>SHR</i> and that mutation of Elongator reduces the enrichment of RNA polymerase II on the <i>SHR</i> gene body. Moreover, Elongator interacted in vivo with SUPPRESSOR OF Ty4, a well-established transcription elongation factor that is recruited to the <i>SHR</i> locus. Together, these results demonstrate that Elongator acts in concert with SUPPRESSOR OF Ty4 to regulate the transcription of <i>SHR</i>.</p>

The Impacts of Phosphorus Deficiency on the Photosynthetic Electron Transport Chain
<p>Phosphorus (P) is an essential macronutrient, and P deficiency limits plant productivity. Recent work showed that P deficiency affects electron transport to photosystem I (PSI), but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here, we present a comprehensive biological model describing how P deficiency disrupts the photosynthetic machinery and the electron transport chain through a series of sequential events in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>). P deficiency reduces the orthophosphate concentration in the chloroplast stroma to levels that inhibit ATP synthase activity. Consequently, protons accumulate in the thylakoids and cause lumen acidification, which inhibits linear electron flow. Limited plastoquinol oxidation retards electron transport to the cytochrome <i>b<sub>6</sub>f</i> complex, yet the electron transfer rate of PSI is increased under steady-state growth light and is limited under high-light conditions. Under P deficiency, the enhanced electron flow through PSI increases the levels of NADPH, whereas ATP production remains restricted and, hence, reduces CO<sub>2</sub> fixation. In parallel, lumen acidification activates the energy-dependent quenching component of the nonphotochemical quenching mechanism and prevents the overexcitation of photosystem II and damage to the leaf tissue. Consequently, plants can be severely affected by P deficiency for weeks without displaying any visual leaf symptoms. All of the processes in the photosynthetic machinery influenced by P deficiency appear to be fully reversible and can be restored in less than 60 min after resupply of orthophosphate to the leaf tissue.</p>

Laccase GhLac1 Modulates Broad-Spectrum Biotic Stress Tolerance via Manipulating Phenylpropanoid Pathway and Jasmonic Acid Synthesis
<p>Plants are constantly challenged by a multitude of pathogens and pests, which causes massive yield and quality losses annually. A promising approach to reduce such losses is to enhance the immune system of plants through genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering. Previous work has shown that laccases (p-diphenol:dioxygen oxidoreductase, EC 1.10.3.2) function as lignin polymerization enzymes. Here we demonstrate that transgenic manipulation of the expression of the laccase gene <i>GhLac1</i> in cotton (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>) can confer an enhanced defense response to both pathogens and pests. Overexpression of <i>GhLac1</i> leads to increased lignification, associated with increased tolerance to the fungal pathogen <i>Verticillium dahliae</i> and to the insect pests cotton bollworm (<i>Helicoverpa armigera</i>) and cotton aphid (<i>Aphis gosypii</i>). Suppression of <i>GhLac1</i> expression leads to a redirection of metabolic flux in the phenylpropanoid pathway, causing the accumulation of JA and secondary metabolites that confer resistance to <i>V. dahliae</i> and cotton bollworm; it also leads to increased susceptibility to cotton aphid. Plant laccases therefore provide a new molecular tool to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eer pest and pathogen resistance in crops.</p>

Biochemical and Structural Analysis of Substrate Specificity of a Phenylalanine Ammonia-Lyase
<p>Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) is the first enzyme of the general phenylpropanoid pathway catalyzing the nonoxidative elimination of ammonia from <sc>l</sc>-phenylalanine to give <i>trans</i>-cinnamate. In monocots, PAL also displays tyrosine ammonia lyase (TAL) activity, leading to the formation of <i>p</i>-coumaric acid. The catalytic mechanism and substrate specificity of a major PAL from sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>; SbPAL1), a strategic plant for bioenergy production, were deduced from crystal structures, molecular docking, site-directed mutagenesis, and kinetic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thermodynam</span></strong>ic analyses. This first crystal structure of a monocotyledonous PAL displayed a unique conformation in its flexible inner loop of the 4-methylidene-imidazole-5-one (MIO) domain compared with that of dicotyledonous plants. The side chain of histidine-123 in the MIO domain dictated the distance between the catalytic MIO prosthetic group created from <sup>189</sup>Ala-Ser-Gly<sup>191</sup> residues and the bound <sc>l</sc>-phenylalanine and <sc>l</sc>-tyrosine, conferring the deamination reaction through either the Friedel-Crafts or E<sub>2</sub> reaction mechanism. Several recombinant mutant SbPAL1 enzymes were generated via structure-guided mutagenesis, one of which, H123F-SbPAL1, has 6.2 times greater PAL activity without significant TAL activity. Additional PAL isozymes of sorghum were characterized and categorized into three groups.

Vessel-Specific Reintroduction of CINNAMOYL-COA REDUCTASE1 (CCR1) in Dwarfed <i>ccr1</i> Mutants Restores Vessel and Xylary Fiber Integrity and Increases Biomass
<p>Lignocellulosic biomass is recalcitrant toward deconstruction into simple sugars due to the presence of lignin. To render lignocellulosic biomass a suitable feedstock for the bio-based economy, plants can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eered to have decreased amounts of lignin. However, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eered plants with the lowest amounts of lignin exhibit collapsed vessels and yield penalties. Previous efforts were not able to fully overcome this phenotype without settling in sugar yield upon saccharification. Here, we reintroduced <i>CINNAMOYL-COENZYME A REDUCTASE1</i> (<i>CCR1</i>) expression specifically in the protoxylem and metaxylem vessel cells of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>ccr1</i> mutants. The resulting <i>ccr1 ProSNBE</i>:<i>CCR1</i> lines had overcome the vascular collapse and had a total stem biomass yield that was increased up to 59% as compared with the wild type. Raman analysis showed that monolignols synthesized in the vessels also contribute to the lignification of neighboring xylary fibers. The cell wall composition and metabolome of <i>ccr1 ProSNBE</i>:<i>CCR1</i> still exhibited many similarities to those of <i>ccr1</i> mutants, regardless of their yield increase. In contrast to a recent report, the yield penalty of <i>ccr1</i> mutants was not caused by ferulic acid accumulation but was (largely) the consequence of collapsed vessels. Finally, <i>ccr1 ProSNBE</i>:<i>CCR1</i> plants had a 4-fold increase in total sugar yield when compared with wild-type plants.</p>

Different Routes for Conifer- and Sinapaldehyde and Higher Saccharification upon Deficiency in the Dehydrogenase CAD1
<p>In the search for renewable energy sources, genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering is a promising strategy to improve plant cell wall composition for biofuel and bioproducts generation. Lignin is a major factor determining saccharification efficiency and, therefore, is a prime target to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eer. Here, lignin content and composition were modified in poplar (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus alba</i>) by specifically down-regulating <i>CINNAMYL ALCOHOL DEHYDROGENASE1</i> (<i>CAD1</i>) by a hairpin-RNA-mediated silencing approach, which resulted in only 5% residual <i>CAD1</i> transcript abundance. These transgenic lines showed no biomass penalty despite a 10% reduction in Klason lignin content and severe shifts in lignin composition. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and thioacidolysis revealed a strong increase (up to 20-fold) in sinapaldehyde incorporation into lignin, whereas coniferaldehyde was not increased markedly. Accordingly, ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based phenolic profiling revealed a more than 24,000-fold accumulation of a newly identified compound made from 8-8 coupling of two sinapaldehyde radicals. However, no additional cinnamaldehyde coupling products could be detected in the CAD1-deficient poplars. Instead, the transgenic lines accumulated a range of hydroxycinnamate-derived metabolites, of which the most prominent accumulation (over 8,500-fold) was observed for a compound that was identified by purification and nuclear magnetic resonance as syringyl lactic acid hexoside. Our data suggest that, upon down-regulation of <i>CAD1</i>, coniferaldehyde is converted into ferulic acid and derivatives, whereas sinapaldehyde is either oxidatively coupled into S′(8-8)S′ and lignin or converted to sinapic acid and derivatives. The most prominent sink of the increased flux to hydroxycinnamates is syringyl lactic acid hexoside. Furthermore, low-extent saccharification assays, under different pretreatment conditions, showed strongly increased glucose (up to +81%) and xylose (up to +153%) release, suggesting that down-regulating <i>CAD1</i> is a promising strategy for improving lignocellulosic biomass for the sugar platform industry.</p>

Plant Glandular Trichomes: Natural Cell Factories of High Biotechnological Interest
<p>Multicellular glandular trichomes are epidermal outgrowths characterized by the presence of a head made of cells that have the ability to secrete or store large quantities of specialized metabolites. Our understanding of the transcriptional control of glandular trichome initiation and development is still in its infancy. This review points to some central questions that need to be addressed to better understand how such specialized cell structures arise from the plant protodermis. A key and unique feature of glandular trichomes is their ability to synthesize and secrete large amounts, relative to their size, of a limited number of metabolites. As such, they qualify as true cell factories, making them interesting targets for metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering. In this review, recent advances regarding terpene metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering are highlighted, with a special focus on tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>). In particular, the choice of transcriptional promoters to drive transgene expression and the best ways to sink existing pools of terpene precursors are discussed. The bioavailability of existing pools of natural precursor molecules is a key parameter and is controlled by so-called cross talk between different biosynthetic pathways. As highlighted in this review, the exact nature and extent of such cross talk are only partially understood at present. In the future, awareness of, and detailed knowledge on, the biology of plant glandular trichome development and metabolism will generate new leads to tap the largely unexploited potential of glandular trichomes in plant resistance to pests and lead to the improved production of specialized metabolites with high industrial or pharmacological value.</p>

Improving Plant Nitrogen Use Efficiency through Alteration of Amino Acid Transport Processes
<p>Improving the efficiency of nitrogen (N) uptake and utilization in plants could potentially increase crop yields while reducing N fertilization and, subsequently, environmental pollution. Within most plants, N is transported primarily as amino acids. In this study, pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) plants overexpressing <i>AMINO ACID PERMEASE1</i> (<i>AAP1</i>) were used to determine if and how genetic manipulation of amino acid transport from source to sink affects plant N use efficiency. The modified plants were grown under low, moderate, or high N fertilization regimes. The results showed that, independent of the N nutrition, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eered plants allocate more N via the vasculature to the shoot and seeds and produce more biomass and higher seed yields than wild-type plants. Dependent on the amount of N supplied, the <i>AAP1</i>-overexpressing plants displayed improved N uptake or utilization efficiency, or a combination of the two. They also showed significantly increased N use efficiency in N-deficient as well as in N-rich soils and, impressively, required half the amount of N to produce as many fruits and seeds as control plants. Together, these data support that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering N allocation from source to sink presents an effective strategy to produce crop plants with improved productivity as well as N use efficiency in a range of N environments.</p>

The Auxin Biosynthetic <i>TRYPTOPHAN AMINOTRANSFERASE RELATED TaTAR2.1-3A</i> Increases Grain Yield of Wheat
<p>Controlling the major auxin biosynthetic pathway to manipulate auxin content could be a target for genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering of crops with desired traits, but little progress had been made because low or high auxin contents often cause developmental inhibition. Here, we performed a genome-wide analysis of bread wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) to identify the Tryptophan Aminotransferase of Arabidopsis1/Tryptophan Aminotransferase-Related (TAA1/TAR) genes that function in the tryptophan-dependent pathway of auxin biosynthesis. Sequence mining together with gene cloning identified 15 <i>TaTAR</i> genes, among which 12 and three genes were phylogenetically close to Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) AtTAR2 and AtTAR3, respectively. <i>TaTAR2.1</i> had the most abundant transcripts in the <i>TaTAR2</i> genes and was expressed mainly in roots and up-regulated by low nitrogen (N) availability. Knockdown of <i>TaTAR2.1</i> caused vegetative and reproductive deficiencies and impaired lateral root (LR) growth under both high- and low-N conditions. Overexpressing <i>TaTAR2.1-3A</i> in wheat enhanced LR branching, plant height, spike number, grain yield, and aerial N accumulation under different N supply levels. In addition, overexpressing <i>TaTAR2.1-3A</i> in Arabidopsis elevated auxin accumulation in the primary root tip, LR tip, LR primordia, and cotyledon and hypocotyl and increased primary root length, visible LR number, and shoot fresh weight under high- and low-N conditions. Our results indicate that <i>TaTAR2.1</i> is critical for wheat growth and also shows potential for genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering to reach the aim of improving the grain yield of wheat.</p>

Dynamic Interplay between Nucleoid Segregation and Genome Integrity in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> Chloroplasts
<p>The chloroplast (cp) genome is organized as nucleoids that are dispersed throughout the cp stroma. Previously, a cp homolog of bacterial recombinase RecA (cpRECA) was shown to be involved in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance of cp genome integrity by repairing damaged chloroplast DNA and by suppressing aberrant recombination between short dispersed repeats in the moss <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. Here, overexpression and knockdown analysis of cpRECA in the green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> revealed that cpRECA was involved in cp nucleoid dynamics as well as having a role in maintaining cp genome integrity. Overexpression of <i>cpRECA</i> tagged with yellow fluorescent protein or hemagglutinin resulted in the formation of giant filamentous structures that colocalized exclusively to chloroplast DNA and cpRECA localized to cp nucleoids in a heterogenous manner. Knockdown of <i>cpRECA</i> led to a significant reduction in cp nucleoid number that was accompanied by nucleoid enlargement. This phenotype resembled those of gyrase inhibitor-treated cells and <i>monokaryotic chloroplast</i> mutant cells and suggested that cpRECA was involved in organizing cp nucleoid dynamics. The cp genome also was destabilized by induced recombination between short dispersed repeats in <i>cpRECA-</i>knockdown cells and gyrase inhibitor-treated cells. Taken together, these results suggest that cpRECA and gyrase are both involved in nucleoid dynamics and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance of genome integrity and that the mechanisms underlying these processes may be intimately related in <i>C. reinhardtii</i> cps.</p>

Differential Codon Adaptation between dsDNA and ssDNA Phages in <i>Escherichia coli</i>
<p>Because phages use their host translation machinery, their codon usage should evolve toward that of highly expressed host genes. We used two indices to measure codon adaptation of phages to their host, <i>r</i><sub>RSCU</sub> (the correlation in relative synonymous codon usage [RSCU] between phages and their host) and Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) computed with highly expressed host genes as the reference set (because phage translation depends on host translation machinery). These indices used for this purpose are appropriate only when hosts exhibit little mutation bias, so only phages parasitizing <i>Escherichia coli</i> were included in the analysis. For double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) phages, both <i>r</i><sub>RSCU</sub> and CAI decrease with increasing number of transfer RNA genes encoded by the phage genome. <i>r</i><sub>RSCU</sub> is greater for dsDNA phages than for single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) phages, and the low <i>r</i><sub>RSCU</sub> values are mainly due to poor concordance in RSCU values for Y-ending codons between ssDNA phages and the <i>E. coli</i> host, consistent with the predicted effect of C→T mutation bias in the ssDNA phages. Strong C→T mutation bias would improve codon adaptation in codon families (e.g., Gly) where U-ending codons are favored over C-ending codons (“U-friendly” codon families) by highly expressed host genes but decrease codon adaptation in other codon families where highly expressed host genes favor C-ending codons against U-ending codons (“U-hostile” codon families). It is remarkable that ssDNA phages with increasing C→T mutation bias also increased the usage of codons in the “U-friendly” codon families, thereby achieving CAI values almost as large as those of dsDNA phages. This represents a new type of codon adaptation.</p>

Differential effects of vitamins E and C and carotenoids on growth, resistance to oxidative stress, fledging success and plumage colouration in wild great tits
<p>Oxidative stress is the imbalance between the production of reactive species and antioxidants, which causes damage to lipids, proteins and DNA. Antioxidants, like vitamins and carotenoids, can limit oxidative damage and can therefore regulate the trade-off between growth, which is a period of high reactive species production, and self-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance. However, the role of carotenoids as antioxidants <i>in vivo</i> has been debated, and it has been suggested that carotenoid-based signals indicate the availability of non-pigmentary antioxidants (e.g. vitamins) that protect carotenoids from oxidation, known as the ‘protection hypothesis’. To evaluate the importance of vitamins versus carotenoids as antioxidants during growth and to test the protection hypothesis, we supplemented nestling great tits, <i>Parus major</i>, 3, 5 and 7 days after hatching with a single dose of carotenoids and/or vitamins in a 2×2 full-factorial design. We subsequently measured body condition, antioxidant capacity, oxidative damage, fledging success and plumage reflectance. Vitamins enhanced antioxidant capacity, but did not affect oxidative damage. Vitamin-treated nestlings had higher growth rates and higher probability of fledging. In contrast, carotenoids did not affect any of these traits. Furthermore, carotenoid-based colouration increased over the breeding season in nestlings that received vitamins only. This study shows that vitamins are limiting for growth rate and fledging success, and suggests that vitamins could regulate the trade-off between growth and self-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance in favour of the former. Moreover, our results are consistent with the idea that carotenoids are minor antioxidants in birds, but they do not support the protection hypothesis.</p>

Tight junction protein gene expression patterns and changes in transcript abundance during development of model fish gill epithelia
<p>In vertebrates, tight junction (TJ) proteins play an important role in epithelium formation and development, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance of tissue integrity and regulation of TJ permeability. In this study, primary cultured model gill epithelia composed of pavement cells (PVCs) were used to examine TJ protein transcript abundance during the development of epithelium confluence and epithelium resistive properties. Differences in TJ protein expression patterns and transcript abundance between gill models composed of PVCs and models composed of PVCs and mitochondrion-rich cells (MRCs) were also examined. Marked alterations in TJ protein transcript abundance were observed as cells developed to confluence in flask-cultured model gill epithelia. In contrast, during the formation of tissue resistance in insert-cultured epithelia (i.e. epithelia cultured on a permeable substrate), changes in TJ protein mRNA abundance were conservative, despite paracellular marker flux decreasing by orders of magnitude. In both cases significant changes in <i>claudin-8b, -8d, -27b, -28b</i> and -<i>32a</i> transcript abundance were observed, suggesting that temporal alterations in the abundance of these genes are important end points of model gill epithelium integrity. When MRCs were present in cultured gill models, the mRNA abundance of several TJ proteins significantly altered and <i>claudin-10c, -10d</i> and -<i>33b</i> were only detected in preparations that included MRCs. These data provide insight into the role of select TJ proteins in the formation and development of gill epithelia and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance of gill barrier properties. In addition, observations reveal a heterogeneous distribution of claudin TJ proteins in the gill epithelial cells of rainbow trout.</p>

<i>chaoptin</i>, <i>prominin</i>, <i>eyes shut</i> and <i>crumbs</i> form a genetic network controlling the apical compartment of <i>Drosophila</i> photoreceptor cells
<p>The apical surface of epithelial cells is often highly specialised to fulfil cell type-specific functions. Many epithelial cells expand their apical surface by forming microvilli, actin-based, finger-like membrane protrusions. The apical surface of <i>Drosophila</i> photoreceptor cells (PRCs) forms tightly packed microvilli, which are organised into the photosensitive rhabdomeres. As previously shown, the GPI-anchored adhesion protein Chaoptin is required for the stability of the microvilli, whereas the transmembrane protein Crumbs is essential for proper rhabdomere morphogenesis. Here we show that <i>chaoptin</i> synergises with <i>crumbs</i> to ensure optimal rhabdomere width. In addition, reduction of <i>crumbs</i> ameliorates morphogenetic defects observed in PRCs mutant for <i>prominin</i> and <i>eyes shut</i>, known antagonists of <i>chaoptin</i>. These results suggest that these four genes provide a balance of adhesion and anti-adhesion to maintain microvilli development and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance. Similar to <i>crumbs</i> mutant PRCs, PRCs devoid of <i>prominin</i> or <i>eyes shut</i> undergo light-dependent retinal degeneration. Given the observation that human orthologues of <i>crumbs</i>, <i>prominin</i> and <i>eyes shut</i> result in progressive retinal degeneration and blindness, the <i>Drosophila</i> eye is ideally suited to unravel the genetic and cellular mechanisms that ensure morphogenesis of PRCs and their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance under light-mediated stress.</p>

Myosin IIA deficient cells migrate efficiently despite reduced traction forces at cell periphery
<p>Cell motility is a cornerstone of embryogenesis, tissue remodeling and repair, and cancer cell invasion. It is generally thought that migrating cells grab and exert traction force onto the extracellular matrix in order to pull the cell body forward. While previous studies have shown that myosin II deficient cells migrate efficiently, whether these cells exert traction forces during cell migration in the absence of the major contractile machinery is currently unknown. Using an array of micron-sized pillars as a force sensor and shRNA specific to each myosin II isoform (A and B), we analyzed how myosin IIA and IIB individually regulate cell migration and traction force generation. Myosin IIA and IIB localized preferentially to the leading edge where traction force was greatest, and the trailing edge, respectively. When individual myosin II isoforms were depleted by shRNA, myosin IIA deficient cells lost actin stress fibers and focal adhesions, whereas myosin IIB deficient cells maintained similar actin organization and focal adhesions as wild-type cells. Interestingly, myosin IIA deficient cells migrated faster than wild-type or myosin IIB deficient cells on both a rigid surface and a pillar array, yet myosin IIA deficient cells exerted significantly less traction force at the leading edge than wild-type or myosin IIB deficient cells. These results suggest that, in the absence of myosin IIA mediated force-generating machinery, cells move with minimal traction forces at the cell periphery, thus demonstrating the remarkable ability of cells to adapt and migrate.</p>

An excess of massive stars in the local 30 Doradus starburst
<p>The 30 Doradus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>-forming region in the Large Magellanic Cloud is a nearby analog of large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>-formation events in the distant universe. We determined the recent formation history and the initial mass function (IMF) of massive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>s in 30 Doradus on the basis of spectroscopic observations of 247 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>s more massive than 15 solar masses ([Formula]). The main episode of massive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> formation began about 8 million years (My) ago, and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>-formation rate seems to have declined in the last 1 My. The IMF is densely sampled up to 200 [Formula] and contains 32 ± 12% more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>s above 30 [Formula] than predicted by a standard Salpeter IMF. In the mass range of 15 to 200 [Formula], the IMF power-law exponent is [Formula], shallower than the Salpeter value of 2.35.</p>

Fast molecular outflow from a dusty star-forming galaxy in the early Universe
<p>Galaxies grow inefficiently, with only a small percentage of the available gas converted into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>s each free-fall time. Feedback processes, such as outflowing winds driven by radiation pressure, supernovae, or supermassive black hole accretion, can act to halt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> formation if they heat or expel the gas supply. We report a molecular outflow launched from a dust-rich <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>-forming galaxy at redshift 5.3, 1 billion years after the Big Bang. The outflow reaches velocities up to 800 kilometers per second relative to the galaxy, is resolved into multiple clumps, and carries mass at a rate within a factor of 2 of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> formation rate. Our results show that molecular outflows can remove a large fraction of the gas available for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> formation from galaxies at high redshift.</p>

Reconciling solar and stellar magnetic cycles with nonlinear dynamo simulations
<p>The magnetic fields of solar-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>s are observed to cycle over decadal periods—11 years in the case of the Sun. The fields originate in the turbulent convective layers of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>s and have a complex dependency upon stellar rotation rate. We have performed a set of turbulent global simulations that exhibit magnetic cycles varying systematically with stellar rotation and luminosity. We find that the magnetic cycle period is inversely proportional to the Rossby number, which quantifies the influence of rotation on turbulent convection. The trend relies on a fundamentally nonlinear dynamo process and is compatible with the Sun’s cycle and those of other solar-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>s.</p>

Relativistic deflection of background starlight measures the mass of a nearby white dwarf star
<p>Gravitational deflection of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>light around the Sun during the 1919 total solar eclipse provided measurements that confirmed Einstein’s general theory of relativity. We have used the Hubble Space Telescope to measure the analogous process of astrometric microlensing caused by a nearby <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>, the white dwarf Stein 2051 B. As Stein 2051 B passed closely in front of a background <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>, the background <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>’s position was deflected. Measurement of this deflection at multiple epochs allowed us to determine the mass of Stein 2051 B—the sixth-nearest white dwarf to the Sun—as 0.675 ± 0.051 solar masses. This mass determination provides confirmation of the physics of degenerate matter and lends support to white dwarf evolutionary theory.</p>

Asteroseismic detection of latitudinal differential rotation in 13 Sun-like stars

For the most significant detections, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>s’ equators rotate approximately twice as fast as their midlatitudes.

Illuminating gravitational waves: A concordant picture of photons from a neutron star merger
<p>Merging neutron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>s offer an excellent laboratory for simultaneously studying strong-field gravity and matter in extreme environments. We establish the physical association of an electromagnetic counterpart (EM170817) with gravitational waves (GW170817) detected from merging neutron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>s. By synthesizing a panchromatic data set, we demonstrate that merging neutron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>s are a long-sought production site forging heavy elements by r-process nucleosynthesis. The weak gamma rays seen in EM170817 are dissimilar to classical short gamma-ray bursts with ultrarelativistic jets. Instead, we suggest that breakout of a wide-angle, mildly relativistic cocoon engulfing the jet explains the low-luminosity gamma rays, the high-luminosity ultraviolet-optical-infrared, and the delayed radio and x-ray emission. We posit that all neutron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> mergers may lead to a wide-angle cocoon breakout, sometimes accompanied by a successful jet and sometimes by a choked jet.</p>

Medicago LINC Complexes Function in Nuclear Morphology, Nuclear Movement, and Root Nodule Symbiosis
<p>Nuclear movement is involved in cellular and developmental processes across eukaryotic life, often driven by Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton (LINC) complexes, which bridge the nuclear envelope (NE) via the interaction of Klarsicht/ANC-1/Syne-1 Homology (KASH) and Sad1/UNC-84 (SUN) proteins. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) LINC complexes are involved in nuclear movement and positioning in several cell types. Observations since the 1950s have described targeted nuclear movement and positioning during symbiosis initiation between legumes and rhizobia, but it has not been established whether these movements are functional or incidental. Here, we identify and characterize LINC complexes in the model legume <i>Medicago truncatula</i>. We show that LINC complex characteristics such as NE localization, dependence of KASH proteins on SUN protein binding for NE enrichment, and direct SUN-KASH binding are conserved between plant species. Using a SUN dominant-negative strategy, we demonstrate that LINC complexes are necessary for proper nuclear shaping and movement in <i>Medicago</i> root hairs, and are important for infection thread initiation and nodulation.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Excess Diffuse Light Absorption in Upper Mesophyll Limits CO<sub>2</sub> Drawdown and Depresses Photosynthesis
<p>In agricultural and natural systems, diffuse light can enhance plant primary productivity due to deeper penetration into and greater irradiance of the entire canopy. However, for individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sun</span></strong>-grown leaves from three species, photosynthesis is actually less efficient under diffuse compared with direct light. Despite its potential impact on canopy-level productivity, the mechanism for this leaf-level diffuse light photosynthetic depression effect is unknown. Here, we investigate if the spatial distribution of light absorption relative to electron transport capacity in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sun</span></strong>- and shade-grown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sun</span></strong>flower (<i>Helianthus annuus</i>) leaves underlies its previously observed diffuse light photosynthetic depression. Using a new one-dimensional porous medium finite element gas-exchange model parameterized with light absorption profiles, we found that weaker penetration of diffuse versus direct light into the mesophyll of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sun</span></strong>-grown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sun</span></strong>flower leaves led to a more heterogenous saturation of electron transport capacity and lowered its CO<sub>2</sub> concentration drawdown capacity in the intercellular airspace and chloroplast stroma. This decoupling of light availability from photosynthetic capacity under diffuse light is sufficient to generate an 11% decline in photosynthesis in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sun</span></strong>-grown but not shade-grown leaves, primarily because thin shade-grown leaves similarly distribute diffuse and direct light throughout the mesophyll. Finally, we illustrate how diffuse light photosynthetic depression could overcome enhancement in canopies with low light extinction coefficients and/or leaf area, pointing toward a novel direction for future research.</p>

Intertidal sea stars (<i>Pisaster ochraceus</i>) alter body shape in response to wave action
<p>Sea <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>s are some of the largest mobile animals able to live in the harsh flow environment of wave-exposed, rocky intertidal shores. In addition, some species, such as the northeastern Pacific <i>Pisaster ochraceus</i>, are ecologically significant predators in a broad range of environments, from sheltered lagoons to the most wave-exposed shorelines. How they function and survive under such an extreme range of wave exposures remains a puzzle. Here we examine the ability of <i>P. ochraceus</i> to alter body form in response to variation in flow conditions. We found that sea <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>s in wave-exposed sites had narrower arms and were lighter per unit arm length than those from sheltered sites. Body form was tightly correlated with maximum velocity of breaking waves across four sites and also varied over time. In addition, field transplant experiments showed that these differences in shape were due primarily to phenotypic plasticity. Sea <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>s transplanted from a sheltered site to a more wave-exposed site became lighter per unit arm length, and developed narrower arms, after 3 months. The tight correlation between water flow and morphology suggests that wave force must be a significant selective factor acting on body shape. On exposed shores, narrower arms probably reduce both lift and drag in breaking waves. On protected shores, fatter arms may provide more thermal inertia to resist overheating, or more body volume for gametes. Such plastic changes in body shape represent a unique method by which sea <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>s adapt to spatial, seasonal and possibly short-term variation in flow conditions.</p>

A precise measurement of the magnetic field in the corona of the black hole binary V404 Cygni
<p>Observations of binary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>s containing an accreting black hole or neutron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> often show x-ray emission extending to high energies (>10 kilo­–electron volts), which is ascribed to an accretion disk corona of energetic particles akin to those seen in the solar corona. Despite their ubiquity, the physical conditions in accretion disk coronae remain poorly constrained. Using simultaneous infrared, optical, x-ray, and radio observations of the Galactic black hole system V404 Cygni, showing a rapid synchrotron cooling event in its 2015 outburst, we present a precise 461 ± 12 gauss magnetic field measurement in the corona. This measurement is substantially lower than previous estimates for such systems, providing constraints on physical models of accretion physics in black hole and neutron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> binary systems.</p>

Spiral density waves in a young protoplanetary disk
<p>Gravitational forces are expected to excite spiral density waves in protoplanetary disks, disks of gas and dust orbiting young <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>s. However, previous observations that showed spiral structure were not able to probe disk midplanes, where most of the mass is concentrated and where planet formation takes place. Using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, we detected a pair of trailing symmetric spiral arms in the protoplanetary disk surrounding the young <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> Elias 2-27. The arms extend to the disk outer regions and can be traced down to the midplane. These millimeter-wave observations also reveal an emission gap closer to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> than the spiral arms. We argue that the observed spirals trace shocks of spiral density waves in the midplane of this young disk.</p>

Compact radio emission indicates a structured jet was produced by a binary neutron star merger
<p>The binary neutron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> merger event GW170817 was detected through both electromagnetic radiation and gravitational waves. Its afterglow emission may have been produced by either a narrow relativistic jet or an isotropic outflow. High-spatial-resolution measurements of the source size and displacement can discriminate between these scenarios. We present very-long-baseline interferometry observations, performed 207.4 days after the merger by using a global network of 32 radio telescopes. The apparent source size is constrained to be smaller than 2.5 milli–arc seconds at the 90% confidence level. This excludes the isotropic outflow scenario, which would have produced a larger apparent size, indicating that GW170817 produced a structured relativistic jet. Our rate calculations show that at least 10% of neutron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> mergers produce such a jet.</p>

Early spectra of the gravitational wave source GW170817: Evolution of a neutron star merger
<p>On 17 August 2017, Swope Supernova Survey 2017a (SSS17a) was discovered as the optical counterpart of the binary neutron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> gravitational wave event GW170817. We report time-series spectroscopy of SSS17a from 11.75 hours until 8.5 days after the merger. Over the first hour of observations, the ejecta rapidly expanded and cooled. Applying blackbody fits to the spectra, we measured the photosphere cooling from [Formula] to [Formula] kelvin, and determined a photospheric velocity of roughly 30% of the speed of light. The spectra of SSS17a began displaying broad features after 1.46 days and evolved qualitatively over each subsequent day, with distinct blue (early-time) and red (late-time) components. The late-time component is consistent with theoretical models of r-process–enriched neutron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> ejecta, whereas the blue component requires high-velocity, lanthanide-free material.</p>

Light curves of the neutron star merger GW170817/SSS17a: Implications for r-process nucleosynthesis
<p>On 17 August 2017, gravitational waves (GWs) were detected from a binary neutron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> merger, GW170817, along with a coincident short gamma-ray burst, GRB 170817A. An optical transient source, Swope Supernova Survey 17a (SSS17a), was subsequently identified as the counterpart of this event. We present ultraviolet, optical, and infrared light curves of SSS17a extending from 10.9 hours to 18 days postmerger. We constrain the radioactively powered transient resulting from the ejection of neutron-rich material. The fast rise of the light curves, subsequent decay, and rapid color evolution are consistent with multiple ejecta components of differing lanthanide abundance. The late-time light curve indicates that SSS17a produced at least ~0.05 solar masses of heavy elements, demonstrating that neutron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> mergers play a role in rapid neutron capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis in the universe.</p>

<i>Drosophila</i> insulin release is triggered by adipose Stunted ligand to brain Methuselah receptor
<p>Animals adapt their growth rate and body size to available nutrients by a general modulation of insulin–insulin-like growth factor signaling. In <i>Drosophila</i>, dietary amino acids promote the release in the hemolymph of brain insulin-like peptides (Dilps), which in turn activate systemic organ growth. Dilp secretion by insulin-producing cells involves a relay through unknown cytokines produced by fat cells. Here, we identify Methuselah (Mth) as a secretin-incretin receptor subfamily member required in the insulin-producing cells for proper nutrient coupling. We further show, using genetic and ex vivo organ culture experiments, that the Mth ligand Stunted (Sun) is a circulating insulinotropic peptide produced by fat cells. Therefore, Sun and Mth define a new cross-organ circuitry that modulates physiological insulin levels in response to nutrients.</p>

Observation and stabilization of photonic Fock states in a hot radio-frequency resonator
<p>Detecting weak radio-frequency electromagnetic fields plays a crucial role in a wide range of fields, from radio astronomy to nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. In quantum optics, the ultimate limit of a weak field is a single photon. Detecting and manipulating single photons at megahertz frequencies presents a challenge because, even at cryogenic temperatures, thermal fluctuations are appreciable. Using a gigahertz superconducting qubit, we observed the quantization of a megahertz radio-frequency resonator, cooled it to the ground state, and stabilized Fock states. Releasing the resonator from our control, we observed its rethermalization with nanosecond resolution. Extending circuit quantum electrodynamics to the megahertz regime, we have enabled the exploration of thermodynamics at the quantum scale and allowed interfacing quantum circuits with megahertz systems such as spin systems or macroscopic mechanical oscillators.</p>

A loud quasi-periodic oscillation after a star is disrupted by a massive black hole

Assuming the black hole mass indicated by host galaxy scaling relations, these observations imply that the periodicity originates from close to the event horizon and that the black hole is rapidly spinning. Our findings demonstrate that tidal disruption events can generate quasi-periodic oscillations that encode information about the physical properties of their black holes.</p>

In 2016, an aerial lidar survey across 2144 square kilometers of northern Guatemala mapped natural terrain and archaeological features over several distinct areas. We present results from these data, revealing interconnected urban settlement and landscapes with extensive infrastructural development. Studied through a joint international effort of interdisciplinary teams sharing protocols, this lidar survey compels a reevaluation of Maya demography, agriculture, and political economy and suggests future avenues of field research.</p>

High-performance perovskite/Cu(In,Ga)Se<sub>2</sub> monolithic tandem solar cells

A dust-enshrouded tidal disruption event with a resolved radio jet in a galaxy merger
<p>Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are transient flares produced when a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> is ripped apart by the gravitational field of a supermassive black hole (SMBH). We have observed a transient source in the western nucleus of the merging galaxy pair Arp 299 that radiated >1.5 × 10<sup>52</sup> erg at infrared and radio wavelengths but was not luminous at optical or x-ray wavelengths. We interpret this as a TDE with much of its emission reradiated at infrared wavelengths by dust. Efficient reprocessing by dense gas and dust may explain the difference between theoretical predictions and observed luminosities of TDEs. The radio observations resolve an expanding and decelerating jet, probing the jet formation and evolution around a SMBH.</p>

Its arrival direction was consistent with the location of a known γ-ray blazar, TXS 0506+056, observed to be in a flaring state. An extensive multiwavelength campaign followed, ranging from radio frequencies to γ-rays. These observations characterize the variability and energetics of the blazar and include the detection of TXS 0506+056 in very-high-energy γ-rays. This observation of a neutrino in spatial coincidence with a γ-ray–emitting blazar during an active phase suggests that blazars may be a source of high-energy neutrinos.</p>

Magnetic seismology of interstellar gas clouds: Unveiling a hidden dimension
<p>Stars and planets are formed inside dense interstellar molecular clouds by processes imprinted on the three-dimensional (3D) morphology of the clouds. Determining the 3D structure of interstellar clouds remains challenging because of projection effects and difficulties measuring the extent of the clouds along the line of sight. We report the detection of normal vibrational modes in the isolated interstellar cloud Musca, allowing determination of the 3D physical dimensions of the cloud. We found that Musca is vibrating globally, with the characteristic modes of a sheet viewed edge on, not the characteristics of a filament as previously supposed. We reconstructed the physical properties of Musca through 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations, reproducing the observed normal modes and confirming a sheetlike morphology.</p>

Light-induced lattice expansion leads to high-efficiency perovskite solar cells
<p>Light-induced structural dynamics plays a vital role in the physical properties, device performance, and stability of hybrid perovskite–based optoelectronic devices. We report that continuous light illumination leads to a uniform lattice expansion in hybrid perovskite thin films, which is critical for obtaining high-efficiency photovoltaic devices. Correlated, in situ structural and device characterizations reveal that light-induced lattice expansion benefits the performances of a mixed-cation pure-halide planar device, boosting the power conversion efficiency from 18.5 to 20.5%. The lattice expansion leads to the relaxation of local lattice strain, which lowers the energetic barriers at the perovskite-contact interfaces, thus improving the open circuit voltage and fill factor. The light-induced lattice expansion did not compromise the stability of these high-efficiency photovoltaic devices under continuous operation at full-spectrum 1-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sun</span></strong> (100 milliwatts per square centimeter) illumination for more than 1500 hours.</p>

Electromagnetic evidence that SSS17a is the result of a binary neutron star merger
<p>Eleven hours after the detection of gravitational wave source GW170817 by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory and Virgo Interferometers, an associated optical transient, SSS17a, was identified in the galaxy NGC 4993. Although the gravitational wave data indicate that GW170817 is consistent with the merger of two compact objects, the electromagnetic observations provide independent constraints on the nature of that system. We synthesize the optical to near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy of SSS17a collected by the One-Meter Two-Hemisphere collaboration, finding that SSS17a is unlike other known transients. The source is best described by theoretical models of a kilonova consisting of radioactive elements produced by rapid neutron capture (the r-process). We conclude that SSS17a was the result of a binary neutron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> merger, reinforcing the gravitational wave result.</p>

A radio counterpart to a neutron star merger
<p>Gravitational waves have been detected from a binary neutron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> merger event, GW170817. The detection of electromagnetic radiation from the same source has shown that the merger occurred in the outskirts of the galaxy NGC 4993, at a distance of 40 megaparsecs from Earth. We report the detection of a counterpart radio source that appears 16 days after the event, allowing us to diagnose the energetics and environment of the merger. The observed radio emission can be explained by either a collimated ultrarelativistic jet, viewed off-axis, or a cocoon of mildly relativistic ejecta. Within 100 days of the merger, the radio light curves will enable observers to distinguish between these models, and the angular velocity and geometry of the debris will be directly measurable by very long baseline interferometry.</p>

<i>Swift</i> and <i>NuSTAR</i> observations of GW170817: Detection of a blue kilonova
<p>With the first direct detection of merging black holes in 2015, the era of gravitational wave (GW) astrophysics began. A complete picture of compact object mergers, however, requires the detection of an electromagnetic (EM) counterpart. We report ultraviolet (UV) and x-ray observations by <i>Swift</i> and the <i>Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array</i> of the EM counterpart of the binary neutron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> merger GW170817. The bright, rapidly fading UV emission indicates a high mass (≈0.03 solar masses) wind-driven outflow with moderate electron fraction (<i>Y</i><sub>e</sub> ≈ 0.27). Combined with the x-ray limits, we favor an observer viewing angle of ≈30° away from the orbital rotation axis, which avoids both obscuration from the heaviest elements in the orbital plane and a direct view of any ultrarelativistic, highly collimated ejecta (a γ-ray burst afterglow).</p>

Nearly simultaneously, the Fermi and INTEGRAL (INTErnational Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory) telescopes detected a gamma-ray transient, GRB 170817A. At 10.9 hours after the GW trigger, we discovered a transient and fading optical source, Swope Supernova Survey 2017a (SSS17a), coincident with GW170817. SSS17a is located in NGC 4993, an S0 galaxy at a distance of 40 megaparsecs. The precise location of GW170817 provides an opportunity to probe the nature of these cataclysmic events by combining electromagnetic and GW observations.</p>

Perovskite solar cells with CuSCN hole extraction layers yield stabilized efficiencies greater than 20%
<p>Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with efficiencies greater than 20% have been realized only with expensive organic hole-transporting materials. We demonstrate PSCs that achieve stabilized efficiencies exceeding 20% with copper(I) thiocyanate (CuSCN) as the hole extraction layer. A fast solvent removal method enabled the creation of compact, highly conformal CuSCN layers that facilitate rapid carrier extraction and collection. The PSCs showed high thermal stability under long-term heating, although their operational stability was poor. This instability originated from potential-induced degradation of the CuSCN/Au contact. The addition of a conductive reduced graphene oxide spacer layer between CuSCN and gold allowed PSCs to retain >95% of their initial efficiency after aging at a maximum power point for 1000 hours under full solar intensity at 60°C. Under both continuous full-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sun</span></strong> illumination and thermal stress, CuSCN-based devices surpassed the stability of spiro-OMeTAD–based PSCs.</p>

Supersonic gas streams enhance the formation of massive black holes in the early universe
<p>The origin of super-massive black holes in the early universe remains poorly understood. Gravitational collapse of a massive primordial gas cloud is a promising initial process, but theoretical studies have difficulty growing the black hole fast enough. We report numerical simulations of early black hole formation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>ting from realistic cosmological conditions. Supersonic gas motions left over from the Big Bang prevent early gas cloud formation until rapid gas condensation is triggered in a protogalactic halo. A proto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> is formed in the dense, turbulent gas cloud, and it grows by sporadic mass accretion until it acquires 34,000 solar masses. The massive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> ends its life with a catastrophic collapse to leave a black hole—a promising seed for the formation of a monstrous black hole.</p>

An unusual white dwarf star may be a surviving remnant of a subluminous Type Ia supernova
<p>Subluminous Type Ia supernovae, such as the Type Iax–class prototype SN 2002cx, are described by a variety of models such as the failed detonation and partial deflagration of an accreting carbon-oxygen white dwarf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> or the explosion of an accreting, hybrid carbon-oxygen-neon core. These models predict that bound remnants survive such events with, according to some simulations, a high kick velocity. We report the discovery of a high proper motion, low-mass white dwarf (LP 40-365) that travels at a velocity greater than the Galactic escape velocity and whose peculiar atmosphere is dominated by intermediate-mass elements. Strong evidence indicates that this partially burnt remnant was ejected following a subluminous Type Ia supernova event. This supports the viability of single-degenerate supernova progenitors.</p>

Water harvesting from air with metal-organic frameworks powered by natural sunlight

Colloidally prepared La-doped BaSnO<sub>3</sub> electrodes for efficient, photostable perovskite solar cells
<p>Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) exceeding a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20% have mainly been demonstrated by using mesoporous titanium dioxide (mp-TiO<sub>2</sub>) as an electron-transporting layer. However, TiO<sub>2</sub> can reduce the stability of PSCs under illumination (including ultraviolet light). Lanthanum (La)–doped BaSnO<sub>3</sub> (LBSO) perovskite would be an ideal replacement given its electron mobility and electronic structure, but LBSO cannot be synthesized as well-dispersible fine particles or crystallized below 500°C. We report a superoxide colloidal solution route for preparing a LBSO electrode under very mild conditions (below 300°C). The PSCs fabricated with LBSO and methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI<sub>3</sub>) show a steady-state power conversion efficiency of 21.2%, versus 19.7% for a mp-TiO<sub>2</sub> device. The LBSO-based PSCs could retain 93% of their initial performance after 1000 hours of full-Sun illumination.</p>

Surface changes on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko suggest a more active past
<p>The Rosetta spacecraft spent ~2 years orbiting comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, most of it at distances that allowed surface characterization and monitoring at submeter scales. From December 2014 to June 2016, numerous localized changes were observed, which we attribute to cometary-specific weathering, erosion, and transient events driven by exposure to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sun</span></strong>light and other processes. While the localized changes suggest compositional or physical heterogeneity, their scale has not resulted in substantial alterations to the comet’s landscape. This suggests that most of the major landforms were created early in the comet’s current orbital configuration. They may even date from earlier if the comet had a larger volatile inventory, particularly of CO or CO<sub>2</sub> ices, or contained amorphous ice, which could have triggered activity at greater distances from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sun</span></strong>.</p>

An accreting pulsar with extreme properties drives an ultraluminous x-ray source in NGC 5907
<p>Ultraluminous x-ray sources (ULXs) in nearby galaxies shine brighter than any x-ray source in our Galaxy. ULXs are usually modeled as stellar-mass black holes (BHs) accreting at very high rates or intermediate-mass BHs. We present observations showing that NGC 5907 ULX is instead an x-ray accreting neutron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> (NS) with a spin period evolving from 1.43 seconds in 2003 to 1.13 seconds in 2014. It has an isotropic peak luminosity of [Formula]1000 times the Eddington limit for a NS at 17.1 megaparsec. Standard accretion models fail to explain its luminosity, even assuming beamed emission, but a strong multipolar magnetic field can describe its properties. These findings suggest that other extreme ULXs (x-ray luminosity [Formula] 10<sup>41 </sup>erg second[Formula]) might harbor NSs.</p>

Molecular gas in the halo fuels the growth of a massive cluster galaxy at high redshift
<p>The largest galaxies in the universe reside in galaxy clusters. Using sensitive observations of carbon monoxide, we show that the Spiderweb galaxy—a massive galaxy in a distant protocluster—is forming from a large reservoir of molecular gas. Most of this molecular gas lies between the protocluster galaxies and has low velocity dispersion, indicating that it is part of an enriched intergalactic medium. This may constitute the reservoir of gas that fuels the widespread <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> formation seen in earlier ultraviolet observations of the Spiderweb galaxy. Our results support the notion that giant galaxies in clusters formed from extended regions of recycled gas at high redshift.</p>

Wide Variation in Reported Rates of Stroke Across Cohorts of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Oral anticoagulants decrease ischemic stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) but increase the risk of bleeding. For the average patient with AF, the threshold of annual ischemic stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> where the benefit of anticoagulation outweighs the bleeding risk (net clinical benefit) has been shown to be ≈1% to 2%. Guideline recommendations for oral anticoagulants in AF are based on the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc stroke risk point scores, assuming that those scores translate to fixed stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s. However, the relationship between stroke point scores and annual stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s may vary substantially across populations. We sought to comprehensively assess the reported <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of stroke in patients with AF and the relationship of stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s to stroke risk point scores.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A systematic review of cohort studies and randomized controlled trials enrolled patients with nonvalvular AF not treated with oral anticoagulants.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of the 3552 studies screened, we identified 34 studies eligible for analysis. Overall stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s in cohort studies were highly heterogeneous (Q=5706.54, <i>P</i><0.001; I<sup>2</sup> = 99.6%) and ranged from 0.45% to 9.28% per year, despite being of similar objective study quality. The mean North American stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> was less than one-third that of the mean European stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> (<i>P</i><0.0001). However, a random effects regression indicated that between-study variability was not significantly accounted for by cohort region, prospective versus retrospective design, calendar year of study, or outcome event cluster. At a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score of 1, 76% of cohorts reported ischemic stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s <1% per year and only 18% of cohorts reported a stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> >2% per year. At a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score of 2, 27% of cohorts reported stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s below 1% per year, 40% reported stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s between 1 and 2% per year, and 33% reported stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s >2% per year.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Substantial variation exists across cohorts in overall stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s corresponding to CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc point scores.

Direct Determination of the Mutation Rate in the Bumblebee Reveals Evidence for Weak Recombination-Associated Mutation and an Approximate Rate Constancy in Insects
<p>Accu<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> knowledge of the mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> provides a base line for inferring expected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of evolution, for testing evolutionary hypotheses and for estimation of key parameters. Advances in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ing technology now permit direct estimates of the mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ing of close relatives. Within insects there have been three prior such estimates, two in nonsocial insects (<i>Drosophila</i>: 2.8 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> per bp per haploid genome per generation; <i>Heliconius</i>: 2.9 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>) and one in a social species, the honeybee (3.4 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>). Might the honeybee’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> be ∼20% higher because it has an exceptionally high recombination <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> and recombination may be directly or indirectly mutagenic? To address this possibility, we provide a direct estimate of the mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> in the bumblebee (<i>Bombus terrestris</i>), this being a close relative of the honeybee but with a much lower recombination <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>. We confirm that the crossover <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> of the bumblebee is indeed much lower than honeybees (8.7 cM/Mb vs. 37 cM/Mb). Importantly, we find no significant difference in the mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s: we estimate for bumblebees a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> of 3.6 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> per haploid genome per generation (95% confidence intervals 2.38 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> and 5.37 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>) which is just 5% higher than the estimate that of honeybees. Both genomes have approximately one new mutation per haploid genome per generation. While we find evidence for a direct coupling between recombination and mutation (also seen in honeybees), the effect is so weak as to leave almost no footprint on any between-species differences. The similarity in mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s suggests an approximate constancy of the mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> in insects.</p>

Hospital Variation in Time to Epinephrine for Nonshockable In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>For patients with in-hospital cardiac arrests attributable to nonshockable rhythms, delays in epinephrine administration beyond 5 minutes is associated with worse survival.

We constructed 2-level hierarchical regression models to quantify hospital variation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of delayed epinephrine administration (>5 minutes) and its association with hospital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of survival to discharge and survival with functional recovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, 13 213 (12.7%) patients had delays to epinephrine, and this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> varied markedly across hospitals (range, 0%–53.8%).

The median risk-standardized survival <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> was 12.0% (range, 5.4%–31.9%), and the risk-standardized survival with functional recovery was 7.4% (range, 0.9%–30.8%).

Spontaneous Mutation Accumulation in <i>Daphnia pulex</i> in Selection-Free vs. Competitive Environments
<p>Understanding the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s, spectra, and fitness effects of spontaneous mutations is fundamental to answering key questions in evolution, molecular biology, disease genetics, and conservation biology. To estimate mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong></span></strong>ate the effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion on new mutations, we propagated mutation accumulation (MA) lines of <i>Daphnia pulex</i> for more than 82 generations and maintained a non-MA population under conditions where <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion could act. Both experiments were started with the same obligate asexual progenitor clone. By <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ing 30 genomes and implementing a series of validation steps that informed the bioinformatic analyses, we identified a total of 477 single nucleotide mutations (SNMs) in the MA lines, corresponding to a mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> of 2.30 × 10<sup>−9</sup> (95% CI 1.90–2.70 × 10<sup>−9</sup>) per nucleotide per generation. The high overall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of 4.82 × 10<sup>−5</sup> per site per generation was due to a large ameiotic recombination event spanning an entire arm of a chromosome (∼6 Mb) and several hemizygous deletion events spanning ∼2 kb each. In the non-MA population, we found significantly fewer mutations than expected based on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> derived from the MA experiment, indicating purifying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion was likely acting to remove new deleterious mutations. We observed a surprisingly high level of genetic variability in the non-MA population, which we propose to be driven by balancing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion. Our findings suggest that both positive and negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion on new mutations is powerful and effective in a strictly clonal population.</p>

Natural Selection in the Great Apes
<p>Natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion is crucial for the adaptation of populations to their environments. Here, we present the first global study of natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion in the <i>Hominidae</i> (humans and great apes) based on genome-wide information from population samples representing all extant species (including most subspecies). Combining several neutrality tests we create a multi-species map of signatures of natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion covering all major types of natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion. We find that the estimated efficiency of both purifying and positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion varies between species and is significantly correlated with their long-term effective population size. Thus, even the modest differences in population size among the closely related <i>Hominidae</i> lineages have resulted in differences in their ability to remove deleterious alleles and to adapt to changing environments. Most signatures of balancing and positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion are species-specific, with signatures of balancing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion more often being shared among species. We also identify loci with evidence of positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion across several lineages. Notably, we detect signatures of positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion in several genes related to brain function, anatomy, diet and immune processes. Our results contribute to a better understanding of human evolution by putting the evidence of natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion in humans within its larger evolutionary context.

Genome-Wide Analysis of Selection on the Malaria Parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> in West African Populations of Differing Infection Endemicity
<p>Locally varying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion on pathogens may be due to differences in drug pressure, host immunity, transmission opportunities between hosts, or the intensity of between-genotype competition within hosts. Highly recombining populations of the human malaria parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> throughout West Africa are closely related, as gene flow is relatively unrestricted in this endemic region, but markedly varying ecology and transmission intensity should cause distinct local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ive pressures. Genome-wide analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e variation was undertaken on a sample of 100 <i>P. falciparum</i> clinical isolates from a highly endemic region of the Republic of Guinea where transmission occurs for most of each year and compared with data from 52 clinical isolates from a previously sampled population from The Gambia, where there is relatively limited seasonal malaria transmission. Paired-end short-read <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es were mapped against the 3D7 <i>P. falciparum</i> reference genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e, and data on 136,144 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were obtained. Within-population analyses identifying loci showing evidence of recent positive directional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion and balancing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion confirm that antimalarial drugs and host immunity have been major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ive agents. Many of the signatures of recent directional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion reflected by standardized integ<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>d haplotype scores were population specific, including differences at drug resistance loci due to historically different antimalarial use between the countries. In contrast, both populations showed a similar set of loci likely to be under balancing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion as indicated by very high Tajima’s <i>D</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es, including a significant overrepresentation of genes expressed at the merozoite stage that invades erythrocytes and several previously validated targets of acquired immunity. Between-population <i>F</i><sub>ST</sub> analysis identified exceptional differentiation of allele frequencies at a small number of loci, most markedly for five SNPs covering a 15-kb region within and flanking the <i>gdv1</i> gene that regulates the early stages of gametocyte development, which is likely related to the extreme differences in mosquito vector abundance and seasonality that determine the transmission opportunities for the sexual stage of the parasite.</p>

Detecting Adaptation in Protein-Coding Genes Using a Bayesian Site-Heterogeneous Mutation-Selection Codon Substitution Model
<p>Codon substitution models have traditionally attempted to uncover signatures of adaptation within protein-coding genes by contrasting the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions. Another modeling approach, known as the mutation–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion framework, attempts to explicitly account for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ive patterns at the amino acid level, with some approaches allowing for heterogeneity in these patterns across codon sites. Under such a model, substitutions at a given position occur at the neutral or nearly neutral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> when they are synonymous, or when they correspond to replacements between amino acids of similar fitness; substitutions from high to low (low to high) fitness amino acids have comparatively low (high) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s. Here, we study the use of such a mutation–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion framework as a null model for the detection of adaptation. Following previous works in this direction, we include a deviation parameter that has the effect of capturing the surplus, or deficit, in non-synonymous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s, relative to what would be expected under a mutation–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion modeling framework that includes a Dirichlet process approach to account for across-codon-site variation in amino acid fitness profiles. We use simulations, along with a few real data sets, to study the behavior of the approach, and find it to have good power with a low false-positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>. Altogether, we emphasize the potential of recent mutation–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion models in the detection of adaptation, calling for further model refinements as well as large-scale applications.</p>

The Roles of Mutation, Selection, and Expression in Determining Relative Rates of Evolution in Mitochondrial versus Nuclear Genomes
<p>Eukaryotes rely on proteins encoded by the nuclear and mitochondrial (mt) genomes, which interact within multisubunit complexes such as oxidative-phosphorylation enzymes. Although <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion is thought to be less efficient on the asexual mt genome, in bilaterian animals the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions (<i>ω</i>) is lower in mt- compared with nuclear-encoded OXPHOS subunits, suggesting <i>stronger</i> effects of purifying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion in the mt genome. Because high levels of gene expression constrain protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e evolution, one proposed resolution to this paradox is that mt genes are expressed more highly than nuclear genes. To test this hypothesis, we investigated expression and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e evolution of mt and nuclear genes from 84 diverse eukaryotes that vary in mt gene content and mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>. We found that the relationship between mt and nuclear <i>ω</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es varied dramatically across eukaryotes. In contrast, transcript abundance is consistently higher for mt genes than nuclear genes, regardless of which genes happen to be in the mt genome. Consequently, expression levels cannot be responsible for the differences in <i>ω</i>. Rather, 84% of the variance in the ratio of <i>ω</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es between mt and nuclear genes could be explained by differences in mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> between the two genomes. We relate these findings to the hypothesis that high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of mt mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong> for compensatory changes in the nuclear genome. We also propose an explanation for why mt transcripts consistently outnumber their nuclear counterparts, with implications for mitonuclear protein imbalance and aging.</p>

Resolving Ambiguity of Species Limits and Concatenation in Multilocus Sequence Data for the Construction of Phylogenetic Supermatrices
<p>Public DNA databases are becoming too large and too complex for manual methods to gene<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> phylogenetic supermatrices from multiple gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es. Delineating the terminals based on taxonomic labels is no longer practical because species identifications are frequently incomplete and gene trees are incongruent with Linnaean binomials, which results in uncertainty about how to combine species units among unlinked loci. We developed a procedure that minimizes the problem of forming multilocus species units in a large phylogenetic data set using algorithms from graph theory. An initial step established <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e clusters for each locus that broadly correspond to the species level. These clusters frequently include <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es labeled with various binomials and specimen identifiers that create multiple alternatives for concatenation. To choose among these possibilities, we minimize taxonomic conflict among the species units globally in the data set using a multipartite heuristic algorithm. The procedure was applied to all available GenBank data for Coleoptera (beetles) including > 10 500 taxon labels and > 23 500 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es of 4 loci, which were grouped into 11 241 clusters or divergent singletons by the BlastClust software. Within each cluster, unidentified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es could be assigned to a species name through the association with fully identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es, resulting in 510 new identifications (13.9% of total unidentified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es) of which nearly half were “trans-locus” identifications by clustering of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es at a secondary locus. The limits of DNA-based clusters were inconsistent with the Linnaean binomials for 1518 clusters (13.5%) that contained more than one binomial or split a single binomial among multiple clusters. By applying a scoring scheme for full and partial name matches in pairs of clusters, a maximum weight set of 7366 global species units was produced. Varying the match weights for partial matches had little effect on the number of units, although if partial matches were disallowed, the number increased greatly. Trees from the resulting supermatrices generally produced tree topologies in good agreement with the higher taxonomy of Coleoptera, with fewer terminals compared with trees gene<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>d according to standard filtering of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es using species labels.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Microtubule Array Patterns Have a Common Underlying Architecture in Hypocotyl Cells
<p>Microtubules at the plant cell cortex influence cell shape by patterning the deposition of cell wall materials. The elongated cells of the hypocotyl create a variety of microtubule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong> patterns with differing degrees of polymer coalignment and orientation to the cell’s growth axis. To gain insight into the mechanisms driving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong> organization, we investigated the underlying microtubule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong> architecture in light-grown epidermal cells with explicit reference to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong> pattern. We discovered that all nontransverse patterns share a common underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong> architecture, having a core unimodal peak of coaligned microtubules in a split bipolarized arrangement. The growing microtubule plus ends extend toward the cell’s apex and base with a region of antiparallel microtubule overlap at the cell’s midzone. This core coalignment continuously shifts between ±30° from the cell’s longitudinal growth axis, forming a continuum of longitudinal and oblique <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong>s. Transverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong>s exhibit the same unimodal core coalignment but form local domains of microtubules polymerizing in the same direction rather than a split bipolarized architecture. Quantitative imaging experiments and analysis of <i>katanin</i> mutants showed that the longitudinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong>s are created from microtubules originating on the outer periclinal cell face, pointing to a cell-directed, rather than self-organizing, mechanism for specifying the major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong> pattern classes in the hypocotyl cell.</p>

Crohn's Disease Loci Are Common Targets of Protozoa-Driven Selection

Analysis of <i>P</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and meta-analyses indicated that protozoan-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ed SNPs display significantly stronger association with CD compared with non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ed variants. This same behavior was not observed for GWASs of other autoimmune diseases. Thus, we integ<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>d <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion signatures and meta-analysis results to prioritize five genic SNPs for replication in an Italian cohort. Three SNPs were significantly associated with CD risk, and combination with meta-analysis results yielded <i>P</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es < 4 × 10<sup>−6</sup>. The bona fide risk alleles are located in <i>ARHGEF2</i>, an interactor of <i>NOD2, NSF</i>, a gene involved in autophagy, and <i>HEBP1</i>, encoding a possible mediator of inflammation. Pathway analysis indicated that <i>ARHGEF2</i> and <i>NSF</i> participate in a molecular network, which also contains <i>VAMP3</i> (previously associated to CD) and is centered around miR-31 (known to be disregulated in CD). Thus, we show that protozoa-driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ive pressure had a major role in shaping predisposition to CD. We next used this information for the identification of three bona fide novel susceptibility loci.</p>

Molecular Evolution of α-Latrotoxin, the Exceptionally Potent Vertebrate Neurotoxin in Black Widow Spider Venom
<p>Black widow spiders (members of the genus <i>Latrodectus</i>) are widely feared because of their potent neurotoxic venom. α-Latrotoxin is the verteb<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>-specific toxin responsible for the dramatic effects of black widow envenomation. The evolution of this toxin is enigmatic because only two α-latrotoxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es are known. In this study, ∼4 kb α-latrotoxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es and their homologs were characterized from a diversity of <i>Latrodectus</i> species, and representatives of <i>Steatoda</i> and <i>Parasteatoda</i>, establishing the wide distribution of latrotoxins across the mega-diverse spider family Theridiidae. Across black widow species, α-latrotoxin shows ≥94% nucleotide identity and variability consistent with purifying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion. Multiple codon and branch-specific estimates of the nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> ratio also suggest a long history of purifying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion has acted on α-latrotoxin across <i>Latrodectus</i> and <i>Steatoda</i>. However, α-latrotoxin is highly divergent in amino acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e between these genera, with 68.7% of protein differences involving non-conservative substitutions, evidence for positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion on its physiochemical properties and particular codons, and an elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> of nonsynonymous substitutions along α-latrotoxin’s <i>Latrodectus</i> branch. Such variation likely explains the efficacy of red-back spider, <i>L. hasselti</i>, antivenom in treating bites from other <i>Latrodectus</i> species, and the weaker neurotoxic symptoms associated with <i>Steatoda</i> and <i>Parasteatoda</i> bites. Long-term purifying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion on α-latrotoxin indicates its functional importance in black widow venom, even though verteb<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s are a small fraction of their diet. The greater differences between <i>Latrodectus</i> and <i>Steatoda</i> α-latrotoxin, and their relationships to inverteb<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>-specific latrotoxins, suggest a shift in α-latrotoxin toward increased verteb<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> toxicity coincident with the evolution of widow spiders.</p>

CLASP Facilitates Transitions between Cortical Microtubule Array Patterns
<p>Acentrosomal plant microtubule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong>s form patterns at the cell cortex that influence cellular morphogenesis by templating the deposition of cell wall materials, but the molecular basis by which the microtubules form the cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong> patterns remains largely unknown. Loss of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) microtubule-associated protein, CYTOPLASMIC LINKER ASSOCIATED PROTEIN (AtCLASP), results in cellular growth anisotropy defects in hypocotyl cells. We examined the microtubule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong> patterning in <i>atclasp-1</i> null mutants and discovered a significant defect in the timing of transitions between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong> patterns but no substantive defect in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong> patterns per se. Detailed analysis and computational modeling of the microtubule dynamics in two <i>atclasp-1</i> fluorescent tubulin marker lines revealed marker-dependent effects on depolymerization and catastrophe frequency predicted to alter the steady-state microtubule population. Quantitative in vivo analysis of the underlying microtubule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong> architecture showed that AtCLASP is required to maintain the number of growing microtubule plus ends during transitions between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong> patterns. We propose that AtCLASP plays a critical role in cellular morphogenesis through actions on new microtubules that facilitate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong> transitions.</p>

Genome-Wide Biases in the Rate and Molecular Spectrum of Spontaneous Mutations in <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> and <i>Vibrio fischeri</i>
<p>The vast diversity in nucleotide composition and architecture among bacterial genomes may be partly explained by inherent biases in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s and spectra of spontaneous mutations. Bacterial genomes with multiple chromosomes are relatively unusual but some are relevant to human health, none more so than the causative agent of cholera, <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>. Here, we present the genome-wide mutation spectra in wild-type and mismatch repair (MMR) defective backgrounds of two <i>Vibrio</i> species, the low-%GC squid symbiont <i>V. fischeri</i> and the pathogen <i>V. cholerae</i>, collected under conditions that greatly minimize the efficiency of natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion. In apparent contrast to their high diversity in nature, both wild-type <i>V. fischeri</i> and <i>V. cholerae</i> have among the lowest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s for base-substitution mutations (bpsms) and insertion–deletion mutations (indels) that have been measured, below 10<sup>−</sup><sup>3</sup>/genome/generation. <i>Vibrio fischeri</i> and <i>V. cholerae</i> have distinct mutation spectra, but both are AT-biased and produce a surprising number of multi-nucleotide indels. Furthermore, the loss of a functional MMR system caused the mutation spectra of these species to converge, implying that the MMR system itself contributes to species-specific mutation patterns. Bpsm and indel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s varied among genome regions, but do not explain the more rapid evolutionary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of genes on chromosome 2, which likely result from weaker purifying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion. More generally, the very low mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of <i>Vibrio</i> species correlate inversely with their immense population sizes and suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion may not only have maximized replication fidelity but also optimized other polygenic traits relative to the constraints of genetic drift.</p>

Evidence for Selection on Gene Expression in Cultivated Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>)
<p>Artificial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion has been used throughout plant domestication and breeding to develop crops that are adapted to diverse environments. Here, we investigate whether gene regulatory changes have been widespread targets of lineage-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion in cultivated lines Minghui 63 and Zhenshan 97 of rice, <i>Oryza sativa</i>. A line experiencing positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion for either an increase or a decrease in genes' transcript abundances is expected to have an overabundance of expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) alleles that increase or decrease those genes' expression, respectively. Results indicate that several genes that share Gene Ontology terms or are members of the same coexpression module have eQTL alleles from one parent that consistently increase gene expression relative to the second parent. A second line of evidence for lineage-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion is an overabundance of <i>cis–trans</i> pairs of eQTL alleles that affect gene expression in the same direction (are reinforcing). Across all <i>cis–trans</i> pairs of eQTL, including pairs that both weakly and strongly affect gene expression, there is no evidence for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion. However, the frequency of genes with reinforcing eQTL increases with eQTL strength. Therefore, there is evidence that eQTL with strong effects were positively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ed during rice cultivation. Among 41 <i>cis–trans</i> pairs with strong <i>trans</i> eQTL, 31 have reinforcing eQTL. Several of the candidate genes under positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion accu<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>ly predict phenotypic differences between Minghui 63 and Zhenshan 97. Overall, our results suggest that positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion for regulatory alleles may be a key factor in plant improvement.</p>

A subgroup analysis of risk in CAC categories was performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We observed 85 (2.6%) hard coronary, 161 (4.9%) hard cardiovascular, and 241 (7.3%) total cardiovascular events. Absolute CAC progression was higher with versus without subsequent coronary events (median, 115 [Q1–Q3, 23–360] versus 8 [0–83], <i>P</i><0.0001; similar for hard/total cardiovascular events). Some progression algorithms added to the predictive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e of baseline CT and risk assessment in terms of C-statistic or integ<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>d discrimination index, especially for total cardiovascular events. However, CAC progression did not improve models including CAC<sub>5y</sub> and 5-year risk factors. An excellent prognosis was found for 921 participants with double-zero CAC<sub>b</sub>=CAC<sub>5y</sub>=0 (10-year coronary and hard/total cardiovascular risk: 1.4%, 2.0%, and 2.8%), which was for participants with incident CAC 1.8%, 3.8%, and 6.6%, respectively.

The primary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke.

Human mutation rate a legacy from our past
<p>Humans should be more like paramecia. That's because their mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> is orders of magnitude lower than a human's. Those <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s increase when genes involved in copying or repairing DNA stop working correctly. Although some mutations are good for generating variety that allows organisms to adapt to changing environments, too many can cause disease and birth defects. At a meeting in Tempe, Arizona, researchers documented mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s in dozens of species and found that the species's specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> is inversely related to the so-called "effective population" size. Small populations are less able to get rid of or compensate for genetic changes that increase mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>. In the past, mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s were thought to be so stable that they were "molecular clocks" useful for dating species' divergences. But researchers are now recognizing that mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s vary from species to species.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
A Cycloheximide-Sensitive Step in Transverse Microtubule Array Patterning
<p>The growth properties of individual cells within a tissue determine plant morphology, and the organization of the cytoskeleton, particularly the microtubule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong>s, determines cellular growth properties. We investigated the mechanisms governing the formation of transverse microtubule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong> patterns in axially growing Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) epidermal hypocotyl cells. Using quantitative imaging approaches, we mapped the transition of the cortical microtubule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong>s into a transverse coaligned pattern after induction with auxin and gibberellic acid. Hormone induction led to an early loss of microtubule plus end density and a rotation toward oblique patterns. Beginning 30 min after induction, transverse microtubules appeared at the cell’s midzone concurrently with the loss of longitudinal polymers, eventually progressing apically and basally to remodel the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong> pattern. Based on the timing and known hormone-signaling pathways, we tested the hypothesis that the later events require de novo gene expression and, thus, constitute a level of genetic control over transverse patterning. We found that the presence of the translation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) resulted in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ive and reversible loss of transverse patterns that were replaced with radial-like pinwheel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong>s exhibiting a split bipolar architecture centered at the cell’s midzone. Experiments using hormone induction and CHX revealed that pinwheel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong>s occur when transverse microtubules increase at the midzone but longitudinal microtubules in the split bipolar architecture are not suppressed. We propose that a key regulatory mechanism for creating the transverse microtubule coalignment in axially growing hypocotyls involves the expression of a CHX-sensitive factor that acts to suppress the nucleation of the longitudinally oriented polymers.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
A Novel Mechanism, Linked to Cell Density, Largely Controls Cell Division in <i>Synechocystis</i>
<p>Many studies have investigated the various genetic and environmental factors regulating cyanobacterial growth. Here, we investigated the growth and metabolism of <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 under different nitrogen sources, light intensities, and CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. Cells grown on urea showed the highest growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s. However, for all conditions tested, the daily growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s in batch cultures decreased steadily over time, and stationary phase was obtained with similar cell densities. Unexpectedly, metabolic and physiological analyses showed that growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s during log phase were not controlled primarily by the availability of photoassimilates. Further physiological investigations indicated that nutrient limitation, quorum sensing, light quality, and light intensity (self-shading) were not the main factors responsible for the decrease in the growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> and the onset of the stationary phase. Moreover, cell division <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s in fed-batch cultures were positively correlated with the dilution <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s. Hence, not only light, CO<sub>2</sub>, and nutrients can affect growth but also a cell-cell interaction. Accordingly, we propose that cell-cell interaction may be a factor responsible for the gradual decrease of growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s in batch cultures during log phase, culminating with the onset of stationary phase.</p>

Population Parameters Underlying an Ongoing Soft Sweep in Southeast Asian Malaria Parasites
<p>Multiple <i>kelch13</i> alleles conferring artemisinin resistance (ART-R) are currently spreading through Southeast Asian malaria parasite populations, providing a unique opportunity to observe an ongoing soft <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ive sweep, investigate why resistance alleles have evolved multiple times and determine fundamental population genetic parameters for <i>Plasmodium</i>. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ed <i>kelch13</i> (<i>n</i> = 1,876), genotyped 75 flanking SNPs, and measured clearance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> (<i>n</i> = 3,552) in parasite infections from Western Thailand (2001–2014). We describe 32 independent coding mutations including common mutations outside the <i>kelch13</i> propeller associated with significant reductions in clearance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>. Mutations were first observed in 2003 and rose to 90% by 2014, consistent with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion coefficient of ∼0.079. ART-R allele diversity rose until 2012 and then dropped as one allele (C580Y) spread to high frequency. The frequency with which adaptive alleles arise is determined by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> of mutation and the population size. Two factors drive this soft sweep: (1) multiple <i>kelch13</i> amino-acid mutations confer resistance providing a large mutational target—we estimate the target is 87–163 bp. (2) The population mutation parameter (<i>Θ</i> = 2<i>N</i><sub>e</sub><i>μ</i>) can be estimated from the frequency distribution of ART-R alleles and is ∼5.69, suggesting that short term effective population size is 88 thousand to 1.2 million. This is 52–705 times greater than <i>N</i><sub>e</sub> estimated from fluctuation in allele frequencies, suggesting that we have previously underestimated the capacity for adaptive evolution in <i>Plasmodium</i>. Our central conclusions are that retrospective studies may underestimate the complexity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ive events and the <i>N</i><sub>e</sub> relevant for adaptation for malaria is considerably higher than previously estimated.</p>

To facilitate the characterization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion targets, we propose a new approach that reconstructs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ed haplotypes from replicated time series, using Pool-Seq data. We identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ed haplotypes through the correlated frequencies of alleles carried by them. Computer simulations indicate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ed haplotype-blocks of several Mb can be reconstructed with high confidence and low error <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s, even when allele frequencies change only by 20% across three replicates. Applying this method to real data from <i>D. melanogaster</i> populations adapting to a hot environment, we identify a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ed haplotype-block of 6.93 Mb. We confirm the presence of this haplotype-block in evolved populations by experimental haplotyping, demonstrating the power and accuracy of our haplotype reconstruction from Pool-Seq data. We propose that the combination of allele frequency estimates with haplotype information will provide the key to understanding the dynamics of adaptive alleles.</p>

Building Phylogenetic Trees from Molecular Data with MEGA
<p>Phylogenetic analysis is sometimes regarded as being an intimidating, complex process that requires expertise and years of experience. In fact, it is a fairly straightforward process that can be learned quickly and applied effectively. This Protocol describes the several steps required to produce a phylogenetic tree from molecular data for novices. In the example illust<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>d here, the program MEGA is used to implement all those steps, thereby eliminating the need to learn several programs, and to deal with multiple file formats from one step to another (Tamura K, Peterson D, Peterson N, Stecher G, Nei M, Kumar S. 2011. MEGA5: molecular evolutionary genetics analysis using maximum likelihood, evolutionary distance, and maximum parsimony methods. <i>Mol Biol Evol</i>. 28:2731–2739). The first step, identification of a set of homologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es and downloading those <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es, is implemented by MEGA's own browser built on top of the Google Chrome toolkit. For the second step, alignment of those <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es, MEGA offers two different algorithms: ClustalW and MUSCLE. For the third step, construction of a phylogenetic tree from the aligned <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es, MEGA offers many different methods. Here we illust<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> the maximum likelihood method, beginning with MEGA's Models feature, which permits <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ing the most suitable substitution model. Finally, MEGA provides a powerful and flexible interface for the final step, actually drawing the tree for publication. Here a step-by-step protocol is presented in sufficient detail to allow a novice to start with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e of interest and to build a publication-quality tree illustrating the evolution of an appropriate set of homologs of that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e. MEGA is available for use on PCs and Macs from <ext-link>www.megasoftware.net</ext-link>.</p>

Skeletal muscle fuel selection occurs at the mitochondrial level
<p>Mammals exponentially increase the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> of carbohyd<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> oxidation as exercise intensity rises, while birds combust lipid almost exclusively while flying at high percentages of aerobic capacity. The fuel oxidized by contracting muscle depends on many factors: whole-body fuel storage mass, mobilization, blood transport, cellular uptake, and subst<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion at the level of the mitochondrion. We examined the fuel preferences of mitochondria isolated from mammalian and avian locomotory muscles using two approaches. First, the influence of subst<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s on the kinetics of respiration (<i>K</i><sub>m,ADP</sub> and <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>) was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong></span></strong>ated. For all subst<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s and combinations, <i>K</i><sub>m,ADP</sub> was generally twofold higher in avian mitochondria. Second, fuel competition between pyruvate, glutamate and/or palmitoyl-<sc>l</sc>-carnitine at three levels of ATP free energy was determined using the principle of mass balance and the measured <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s of O<sub>2</sub> consumption and metabolite accumulation/utilization. Avian mitochondria strongly spared pyruvate from oxidation when another subst<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> was available and fatty acid was the dominant subst<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>, regardless of energy state. Mammalian mitochondria exhibited some preference for fatty acid over pyruvate at lower flux (higher energy state), but exhibited a much greater tendency to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong> pyruvate and glutamate when available. Studies in sonicated mitochondria revealed twofold higher electron transport chain electron conductance in avian mitochondria. We conclude that substantial fuel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion occurs at the level of the mitochondrial matrix and that avian flight muscle mitochondria are particularly biased toward the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion of fatty acid, possibly by facilitating high β-oxidation flux by maintaining a more oxidized matrix.</p>

Gene Capture Coupled to High-Throughput Sequencing as a Strategy for Targeted Metagenome Exploration
<p>Next-generation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ing (NGS) allows faster acquisition of metagenomic data, but complete exploration of complex ecosystems is hindered by the extraordinary diversity of microorganisms. To reduce the environmental complexity, we created an innovative solution hybrid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion (SHS) method that is combined with NGS to characterize large DNA fragments harbouring biomarkers of interest. The quality of enrichment was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong></span></strong>ated after fragments containing the methyl coenzyme M reductase subunit A gene (<i>mcrA</i>), the biomarker of methanogenesis, were captured from a <i>Methanosarcina</i> strain and a metagenomic sample from a meromictic lake. The methanogen diversity was compared with direct metagenome and <i>mcrA</i>-based amplicon pyro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ing st<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>gies<i>.</i> The SHS approach resulted in the capture of DNA fragments up to 2.5 kb with an enrichment efficiency between 41 and 100%, depending on the sample complexity. Compared with direct metagenome and amplicons <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ing, SHS detected broader <i>mcrA</i> diversity, and it allowed efficient sampling of the rare biosphere and unknown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es. In contrast to amplicon-based st<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>gies, SHS is less biased and GC independent, and it recovered complete biomarker <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es in addition to conserved regions.

Age-Specific Trends in Incidence, Mortality, and Comorbidities of Heart Failure in Denmark, 1995 to 2012
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The cumulative burden and importance of cardiovascular risk factors have changed over the past decades.

After linking to Medicare claims data, long-term outcomes of CABG (up to 18 years after surgery) were examined by use of cumulative incidence curves. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard analysis was used to identify factors associated with 1- and 5-year repeat revascularization trends and variability.

Reconfiguration of DNA molecular arrays driven by information relay

Comparative Transcriptomic Analysis Provides Insight into the Domestication and Improvement of Pear (<i>P. pyrifolia</i>) Fruit
<p>Knowledge of the genetic changes that occurred during the domestication and improvement of perennial trees at the RNA level is limited. Here, we used RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ing analysis to compare representative sets of wild, landrace, and improved accessions of pear (<i>Pyrus pyrifolia</i>) to gain insight into the genetic changes associated with domestication and improvement. A close population relationship and similar nucleotide diversity was observed between the wild and landrace groups, whereas the improved group had substantially reduced nucleotide diversity. A total of 11.13 Mb of genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e was identified as bearing the signature of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ive sweeps that occurred during pear domestication, whereas a distinct and smaller set of genomic regions (4.04 Mb) was identified as being associated with subsequent improvement efforts. The expression diversity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ed genes exhibited a 20.89% reduction from the wild group to the landrace group, but a 23.13% recovery was observed from the landrace to the improved group, showing a distinctly different pattern with variation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e diversity. Module-trait association analysis identified 16 distinct coexpression modules, six of which were highly associated with important fruit traits. The candidate trait-linked differentially expressed genes associated with stone cell formation, fruit size, and sugar content were identified in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ed regions, and many of these could also be mapped to the previously reported quantitative trait loci. Thus, our study reveals the specific pattern of domestication and improvement of perennial trees at the transcriptome level, and provides <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>able genetic sources of fruit traits that could contribute to pear breeding and improvement.</p>

Variable Mesophyll Conductance among Soybean Cultivars Sets a Tradeoff between Photosynthesis and Water-Use-Efficiency
<p>Photosynthetic efficiency is a critical determinant of crop yield potential, although it remains below the theoretical optimum in modern crop varieties. Enhancing mesophyll conductance (i.e. the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> of carbon dioxide diffusion from substomatal cavities to the sites of carboxylation) may increase photosynthetic and water use efficiencies. To improve water use efficiency, mesophyll conductance should be increased without concomitantly increasing stomatal conductance. Here, we partition the variance in mesophyll conductance to within- and among-cultivar components across soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) grown under both controlled and field conditions and examine the covariation of mesophyll conductance with photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>, stomatal conductance, water use efficiency, and leaf mass per area. We demonst<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> that mesophyll conductance varies more than 2-fold and that 38% of this variation is due to cultivar identity. As expected, mesophyll conductance is positively correlated with photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s. However, a strong positive correlation between mesophyll and stomatal conductance among cultivars apparently impedes positive scaling between mesophyll conductance and water use efficiency in soybean. Contrary to expectations, photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s and mesophyll conductance both increased with increasing leaf mass per area. The presence of genetic variation for mesophyll conductance suggests that there is potential to increase photosynthesis and mesophyll conductance by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ing for greater leaf mass per area. Increasing water use efficiency, though, is unlikely unless there is simultaneous stabilizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion on stomatal conductance.</p>

The Genomes of Two Bat Species with Long Constant Frequency Echolocation Calls
<p>Bats can perceive the world by using a wide range of sensory systems, and some of the systems have become highly specialized, such as auditory sensory perception. Among bat species, the Old World leaf-nosed bats and horseshoe bats (rhinolophoid bats) possess the most sophisticated echolocation systems. Here, we reported the whole-genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ing and <i>de novo</i> assembles of two rhinolophoid bats—the great leaf-nosed bat (<i>Hipposideros armiger</i>) and the Chinese rufous horseshoe bat (<i>Rhinolophus sinicus</i>). Comparative genomic analyses revealed the adaptation of auditory sensory perception in the rhinolophoid bat lineages, probably resulting from the extreme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ivity used in the auditory processing by these bats. Pseudogenization of some vision-related genes in rhinolophoid bats was observed, suggesting that these genes have undergone relaxed natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion. An extensive contraction of olfactory receptor gene repertoires was observed in the lineage leading to the common ancestor of bats. Further extensive gene contractions can be observed in the branch leading to the rhinolophoid bats. Such concordance suggested that molecular changes at one sensory gene might have direct con<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es for genes controlling for other sensory modalities. To characterize the population genetic structure and patterns of evolution, we re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ed the genome of 20 great leaf-nosed bats from four different geographical locations of China. The result showed similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e diversity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es and little differentiation among populations. Moreover, evidence of genetic adaptations to high altitudes in the great leaf-nosed bats was observed. Taken together, our work provided a useful resource for future research on the evolution of bats.</p>

Rapid Functional and Sequence Differentiation of a Tandemly Repeated Species-Specific Multigene Family in <i>Drosophila</i>
<p>Gene clusters of recently duplicated genes are hotbeds for evolutionary change. However, our understanding of how mutational mechanisms and evolutionary forces shape the structural and functional evolution of these clusters is hindered by the high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e identity among the copies, which typically results in their inaccu<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> representation in genome assemblies. The presumed testis-specific, chimeric gene <i>Sdic</i> originated, and tandemly expanded in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, contributing to increased male-male competition. Using various types of massively parallel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ing data, we studied the organization, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e evolution, and functional attributes of the different <i>Sdic</i> copies. By leveraging long-read <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ing data, we uncovered both copy number and order differences from the currently accepted annotation for the <i>Sdic</i> region. Despite evidence for pervasive gene conversion affecting the <i>Sdic</i> copies, we also detected signatures of two episodes of diversifying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion, which have contributed to the evolution of a variety of C-termini and miRNA binding site compositions. Expression analyses involving RNA-seq datasets from 59 different biological conditions revealed distinctive expression breadths among the copies, with three copies being transcribed in females, opening the possibility to a sexually antagonistic effect. Phenotypic assays using <i>Sdic</i> knock-out strains indicated that should this antagonistic effect exist, it does not compromise female fertility. Our results strongly suggest that the genome consolidation of the <i>Sdic</i> gene cluster is more the result of a quick exploration of different paths of molecular tinkering by different copies than a mere dosage increase, which could be a recurrent evolutionary outcome in the presence of persistent sexual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion.</p>

Dynamic Convergent Evolution Drives the Passage Adaptation across 48 Years’ History of H3N2 Influenza Evolution
<p>Influenza viruses are often propagated in a diverse set of culturing media and additional substitutions known as passage adaptation can cause extra evolution in the target strain, leading to ineffective vaccines. Using 25,482 H3N2 HA1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es cu<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>d from Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data and National Center for Biotechnology Information databases, we found that passage adaptation is a very dynamic process that changes over time and evolves in a seesaw like pattern. After crossing the species boundary from bird to human in 1968, the influenza H3N2 virus evolves to be better adapted to the human environment and passaging them in embryonated eggs (i.e., an avian environment) leads to increasingly stronger positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion. On the contrary, passage adaptation to the mammalian cell lines changes from positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion to negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion. Using two statistical tests, we identified 19 codon positions around the receptor binding domain strongly contributing to passage adaptation in the embryonated egg. These sites show strong convergent evolution and overlap extensively with positively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ed sites identified in humans, suggesting that passage adaptation can confound many of the earlier studies on influenza evolution. Interestingly, passage adaptation in recent years seems to target a few codon positions in antigenic surface epitopes, which makes it difficult to produce antigenically unaltered vaccines using embryonic eggs. Our study outlines another interesting scenario whereby both convergent and adaptive evolution are working in synchrony driving viral adaptation. Future studies from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e analysis to vaccine production need to take careful consideration of passage adaptation.</p>

Evidence from a House Finch (<i>Haemorhous mexicanus</i>) Spleen Transcriptome for Adaptive Evolution and Biased Gene Conversion in Passerine Birds

An analysis of 4,398 orthologous genes revealed a significantly higher ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions and significantly higher GC content in passerines than in galliforms, an observation deviating from strictly neutral expectations but consistent with an effect of biased gene conversion on the evolutionary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> in passerines. These data also showed that genes exhibiting signs of positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion and fast evolution in passerines have functional roles related to fat metabolism, neurodevelopment, and ion binding.</p>

Forcing each site to belong to one of these classes places unrealistic constraints on the distribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion parameters, which can result in misleading inference due to model misspecification. We present an approximate hierarchical Bayesian method using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) routine that ensures robustness against model misspecification by averaging over a large number of predefined site classes. This leaves the distribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion parameters essentially unconstrained, and also allows sites experiencing positive and purifying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion to be identified orders of magnitude faster than by existing methods. We demonst<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> that popular random effects likelihood methods can produce misleading results when sites assigned to the same site class experience different levels of positive or purifying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion—an unavoidable scenario when using a small number of site classes. Our Fast Unconstrained Bayesian AppRoximation (FUBAR) is unaffected by this problem, while achieving higher power than existing unconstrained (fixed effects likelihood) methods. The speed advantage of FUBAR allows us to analyze larger data sets than other methods: We illust<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> this on a large influenza hemagglutinin data set (3,142 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es). FUBAR is available as a batch file within the latest HyPhy distribution (<ext-link>http://www.hyphy.org</ext-link>), as well as on the Datamonkey web server (<ext-link>http://www.datamonkey.org/</ext-link>).</p>

Inference of Natural Selection from Interspersed Genomic Elements Based on Polymorphism and Divergence
<p>Complete genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es contain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>able information about natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion, but this information is difficult to access for short, widely scattered noncoding elements such as transcription factor binding sites or small noncoding RNAs. Here, we introduce a new computational method, called <i>I</i>nference of <i>N</i>atural <i>S</i>election from <i>I</i>nterspersed <i>G</i>enomically co<i>H</i>erent elemen<i>T</i>s (INSIGHT), for measuring the influence of natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion on such elements. INSIGHT uses a generative probabilistic model to contrast patterns of polymorphism and divergence in the elements of interest with those in flanking neutral sites, pooling weak information from many short elements in a manner that accounts for variation among loci in mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s and coalescent times. The method is able to disentangle the contributions of weak negative, strong negative, and positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion based on their distinct effects on patterns of polymorphism and divergence. It obtains information about divergence from multiple outgroup genomes using a general statistical phylogenetic approach. The INSIGHT model is efficiently fitted to genome-wide data using an approximate expectation maximization algorithm. Using simulations, we show that the method can accu<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>ly estimate the parameters of interest even in complex demographic scenarios, and that it significantly improves on methods based on summary statistics describing polymorphism and divergence. To demonst<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> the usefulness of INSIGHT, we apply it to several classes of human noncoding RNAs and to GATA2-binding sites in the human genome.</p>

Molecular Adaptation during a Rapid Adaptive Radiation
<p>“Explosive” adaptive radiations on islands remain one of the most puzzling evolutionary phenomena and the evolutionary genetic processes behind such radiations remain unclear. Rapid morphological and ecological evolution during island radiations suggests that many genes may be under fairly strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion, although this remains untested. Here, we report that during a rapid recent diversification in the Hawaiian endemic plant genus <i>Schiedea</i> (<i>Caryophyllaceae</i>), 5 in 36 studied genes evolved under positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion. Positively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ed genes are involved in defence mechanisms, photosynthesis, and reproduction. Comparison with eight mainland plant groups demonst<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s both the relaxation of purifying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion and more widespread positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion in Hawaiian <i>Schiedea</i>. This provides compelling evidence that adaptive evolution of protein-coding genes may play a significant role during island adaptive radiations.</p>

Elevated carboxyhemoglobin in a marine mammal, the northern elephant seal
<p>Low concentrations of endogenous carbon monoxide (CO), gene<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>d primarily through degradation of heme from heme-proteins, have been shown to maintain physiological function of organs and to exert cytoprotective effects. However, high concentrations of carboxyhemoglobin (COHb), formed by CO binding to hemoglobin, potentially prevent adequate O<sub>2</sub> delivery to tissues by lowering arterial O<sub>2</sub> content. Elevated heme-protein concentrations, as found in marine mammals, are likely associated with greater heme degradation, more endogenous CO production and, consequently, elevated COHb concentrations. Therefore, we measured COHb in elephant seals, a species with large blood volumes and elevated hemoglobin and myoglobin concentrations. The levels of COHb were positively related to the total hemoglobin concentration. The maximum COHb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e was 10.4% of total hemoglobin concentration. The mean (±s.e.m.) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e in adult seals was 8.7±0.3% (<i>N</i>=6), while juveniles and pups (with lower heme-protein contents) had lower mean COHb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es of 7.6±0.2% and 7.1±0.3%, respectively (<i>N</i>=9 and <i>N</i>=9, respectively). Serial samples over several hours revealed little to no fluctuation in COHb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es. This consistent elevation in COHb suggests that the magnitude and/or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> of heme-protein turnover is much higher than in terrestrial mammals. The maximum COHb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es from this study decrease total body O<sub>2</sub> stores by 7%, thereby reducing the calculated aerobic dive limit for this species. However, the constant presence of elevated CO in blood may also protect against potential ischemia–reperfusion injury associated with the extreme breath-holds of elephant seals. We suggest the elephant seal represents an ideal model for understanding the potential cytoprotective effects, mechanisms of action and evolutionary adaptation associated with chronically elevated concentrations of endogenously produced CO.</p>

Draft genome sequence of an elite <i>Dura</i> palm and whole-genome patterns of DNA variation in oil palm
<p>Oil palm is the world’s leading source of vegetable oil and fat. <i>Dura, Pisifera</i> and <i>Tenera</i> are three forms of oil palm. The genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e of <i>Pisifera</i> is available whereas the <i>Dura</i> form has not been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ed yet. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ed the genome of one elite <i>Dura</i> palm, and re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ed 17 palm genomes. The assemble genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e of the elite <i>Dura</i> tree contained 10,971 scaffolds and was 1.701 Gb in length, covering 94.49% of the oil palm genome. 36,105 genes were predicted. Re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ing of 17 additional palm trees identified 18.1 million SNPs. We found high genetic variation among palms from different geographical regions, but lower variation among Southeast Asian <i>Dura</i> and <i>Pisifera</i> palms. We mapped 10,000 SNPs on the linkage map of oil palm. In addition, high linkage disequilibrium (LD) was detected in the oil palms used in breeding populations of Southeast Asia, suggesting that LD mapping is likely to be practical in this important oil crop. Our data provide a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>able resource for accelerating genetic improvement and studying the mechanism underlying phenotypic variations of important oil palm traits.</p>

Correlation between genome reduction and bacterial growth
<p>Genome reduction by removing dispensable genomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es in bacteria is commonly used in both fundamental and applied studies to determine the minimal genetic requirements for a living system or to develop highly efficient bioreactors. Nevertheless, whether and how the accumulative loss of dispensable genomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es disturbs bacterial growth remains unclear. To investigate the relationship between genome reduction and growth, a series of <i>Escherichia coli</i> strains carrying genomes reduced in a stepwise manner were used. Intensive growth analyses revealed that the accumulation of multiple genomic deletions caused decreases in the exponential growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> and the satu<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>d cell density in a deletion-length-dependent manner as well as gradual changes in the patterns of growth dynamics, regardless of the growth media. Accordingly, a perspective growth model linking genome evolution to genome engineering was proposed. This study provides the first demonstration of a quantitative connection between genomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e and bacterial growth, indicating that growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong> is potentially associated with dispensable genomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es.</p>

<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Recognition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s and causes of hard, patient-centered outcomes of death and cerebrovascular events (CVEs) after heart rhythm disorder management (HRDM) procedures is an essential step for the development of quality improvement programs in electrophysiology laboratories. Our primary aim was to assess and characterize death and CVEs (stroke or transient ischemic attack) after HRDM procedures over a 17-year period.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed a retrospective cohort study of all patients undergoing HRDM procedures between January 2000 and November 2016 at the Mayo Clinic. Patients from all 3 tertiary academic centers (Rochester, Phoenix, and Jacksonville) were included in the study. All in-hospital deaths and CVEs after HRDM procedures were identified and were further characterized as directly or indirectly related to the HRDM procedure. Subgroup analysis of death and CVE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s was performed for ablation, device implantation, electrophysiology study, lead extraction, and defibrillation threshold testing procedures.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 48 913 patients (age, 65.7±6.6 years; 64% male) who underwent a total of 62 065 HRDM procedures were included in the study. The overall mortality and CVE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s in the cohort were 0.36% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31–0.42) and 0.12% (95% CI, 0.09–0.16), respectively.

Among patients undergoing HRDM procedures, 48% of deaths directly related to the HDRM procedure were among patients undergoing device implantation procedures. Overall, cardiac tamponade was the most frequent direct cause of death (40%), and infection was the most common indirect cause of death (29%).

Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor Type I Controls Cardiomyocyte Transforming Growth Factor-β and Cardiac Fibrosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Fibrosis is the pathological con<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e of stress-induced tissue remodeling and matrix accumulation. Increased levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor type I (PAI-1) have been shown to promote fibrosis in multiple organ systems. Paradoxically, homozygous genetic deficiency of PAI-1 is associated with spontaneous age-dependent, cardiac-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ive fibrosis in mice. We have identified a novel PAI-1-dependent mechanism that regulates cardiomyocyte-derived fibrogenic signals and cardiac transcriptional pathways during injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Cardiac fibrosis in subjects with homozygous mutation in <i>SERPINE-1</i> was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong></span></strong>ated with late gadolinium-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.

We further <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong></span></strong>ated fibrotic signaling in isolated murine primary ventricular myocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Cardiac fibrosis was detected in 2 otherwise healthy humans with complete PAI-1 deficiency because of a homozygous frameshift mutation in <i>SERPINE-1</i>. In addition to its suppressive role during spontaneous cardiac fibrosis in multiple species, we hypothesized that PAI-1 also regulates fibrosis during cardiac injury. Treatment of young PAI-1<sup>−/−</sup> mice with Angiotensin II induced extensive hypertrophy and fibrotic cardiomyopathy, with increased cardiac apoptosis and both reactive and replacement fibrosis. Although Angiotensin II-induced hypertension was blunted in PAI-1<sup>−/−</sup> mice, cardiac hypertrophy was accele<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>d. Furthermore, ventricular myocytes were found to be an important source of cardiac transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and PAI-1 regulated TGF-β synthesis by cardiomyocytes in vitro as well as in vivo during cardiac injury. Transcriptome analysis of ventricular RNA after Angiotensin II treatment confirmed that PAI-1 deficiency significantly enhanced multiple TGF-β signaling elements and transcriptional targets, including genes for extracellular matrix components, mediators of extracellular matrix remodeling, matricellular proteins, and cardiac integrins compared with wild-type mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>PAI-1 is an essential repressor of cardiac fibrosis in mammals. We define a novel cardiomyocyte-specific regulatory mechanism for TGF-β production by PAI-1, which explains the paradoxical effect of PAI-1 deficiency in promoting cardiac-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ive fibrosis. Thus, PAI-1 is a molecular switch that controls the cardiac TGF-β axis and its early transcriptional effects that lead to myocardial fibrosis.</p></sec>

This study aimed to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong></span></strong>ate associations of SBP with all-cause mortality by frailty category >80 years of age and to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong></span></strong>ate SBP trajectories before death.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A population-based cohort study was conducted using electronic health records of 144 403 participants ≥80 years of age registered with family practices in the United Kingdom from 2001 to 2014. Participants were followed for ≤5 years. Clinical records of SBP were analyzed. Frailty status was classified using the e-Frailty Index into the categories of fit, mild, mode<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>, and severe. All-cause mortality was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong></span></strong>ated by frailty status and mean SBP in Cox proportional-hazards models. SBP trajectories were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong></span></strong>ated using person months as observations, with mean SBP and antihypertensive treatment status estimated for each person month. Fractional polynomial models were used to estimate SBP trajectories over 5 years before death.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>During follow-up, 51 808 deaths occurred. Mortality <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s increased with frailty level and were greatest at SBP <110 mm Hg. In fit women, mortality was 7.7 per 100 person years at SBP 120 to 139 mm Hg, 15.2 at SBP 110 to 119 mm Hg, and 22.7 at SBP <110 mm Hg. For women with severe frailty, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>s were 16.8, 25.2, and 39.6, respectively. SBP trajectories showed an accele<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rate</span></strong>d decline in the last 2 years of life. The relative odds of SBP <120 mm Hg were higher in the last 3 months of life than 5 years previously in both treated (odds ratio, 6.06; 95% confidence interval, 5.40–6.81) and untreated (odds ratio, 6.31; 95% confidence interval, 5.30–7.52) patients. There was no evidence of intensification of antihypertensive therapy in the final 2 years of life.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>A terminal decline of SBP in the final 2 years of life suggests that nonrandomized epidemiological associations of low SBP with higher mortality may be accounted for by reverse causation if participants with lower blood pressure <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es are closer, on average, to the end of life.</p></sec>

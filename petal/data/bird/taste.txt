New electroantennography method on a marine shrimp in water
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> Electroantennography allows the recording of the global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chemoreceptor</span></strong> response from the antennal appendages, and is developed here for studies on marine shrimp in aqueous conditions.</p>

Intracellular regulation of the insect chemoreceptor complex impacts odour localization in flying insects
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> The unique signal transduction of the OR complex contributes to insectsâ€™ sensitive and efficient olfactory capabilities, supporting the hypothesis that insects evolved a unique <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chemoreceptor</span></strong> family to accommodate the high-speed demands of flight.</p>

Ligand- and voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels differentially regulate the mode of vesicular neuropeptide release in mammalian sensory neurons
<p>Neuropeptides <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>ed from dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons play essential roles in the neurotransmission of sensory inputs, including those underlying nociception and pathological pain. Neuropeptides are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>ed from intracellular vesicles through two modes: a partial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e mode called “kiss-and-run” (KAR) and a full <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e mode called “full fusion–like” (FFL). Using total internal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ion fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, we traced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e of pH-sensitive green fluorescent protein–tagged neuropeptide Y (pHluorin-NPY) from individual dense-core vesicles in the soma and axon of single DRG neurons after Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through either voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VGCCs) or ligand-gated transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channels. We found that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through VGCCs stimulated FFL and a greater single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e of neuropeptides. In contrast, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through TRPV1 channels stimulated KAR and a pulsed but prolonged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e of neuropeptides that was partially mediated by Dynamin 1, which limits fusion pore expansion. Suppressing the Ca<sup>2+</sup> gradient to an extent similar to that seen after TRPV1 activation abolished the VGCC preference for FFL. The findings suggest that by generating a steeper Ca<sup>2+</sup> gradient, VGCCs promote a more robust fusion pore opening that facilitates FFL. Thus, KAR and FFL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e modes are differentially regulated by the two principal types of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable channels in DRG neurons.</p>

F-Actin Mediated Focusing of Vesicles at the Cell Tip Is Essential for Polarized Growth
<p>F-actin has been shown to be essential for tip growth in an array of plant models, including <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. One hypothesis is that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion can transport secretory vesicles, while actin plays a regulatory role during secretion. Alternatively, it is possible that actin-based transport is necessary to overcome vesicle transport limitations to sustain secretion. Therefore, a quantitative analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion, secretion kinetics, and cell geometry is necessary to clarify the role of actin in polarized growth. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis, we first show that secretory vesicles move toward and accumulate at the tip in an actin-dependent manner. We then depolymerized F-actin to decouple vesicle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion from actin-mediated transport and measured the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion coefficient and concentration of vesicles. Using these values, we constructed a theoretical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-based model for growth, demonstrating that with fast-enough vesicle fusion kinetics, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion could support normal cell growth rates. We further refined our model to explore how experimentally extrapolated vesicle fusion kinetics and the size of the secretion zone limit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-based growth. This model predicts that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-mediated growth is dependent on the size of the region of exocytosis at the tip and that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-based growth would be significantly slower than normal cell growth. To further explore the size of the secretion zone, we used a cell wall degradation enzyme cocktail and determined that the secretion zone is smaller than 6 μm in diameter at the tip. Taken together, our results highlight the requirement for active transport in polarized growth and provide important insight into vesicle secretion during tip growth.</p>

Excess Diffuse Light Absorption in Upper Mesophyll Limits CO<sub>2</sub> Drawdown and Depresses Photosynthesis
<p>In agricultural and natural systems, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e light can enhance plant primary productivity due to deeper penetration into and greater irradiance of the entire canopy. However, for individual sun-grown leaves from three species, photosynthesis is actually less efficient under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e compared with direct light. Despite its potential impact on canopy-level productivity, the mechanism for this leaf-level <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e light photosynthetic depression effect is unknown. Here, we investigate if the spatial distribution of light absorption relative to electron transport capacity in sun- and shade-grown sunflower (<i>Helianthus annuus</i>) leaves underlies its previously observed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e light photosynthetic depression. Using a new one-dimensional porous medium finite element gas-exchange model parameterized with light absorption profiles, we found that weaker penetration of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e versus direct light into the mesophyll of sun-grown sunflower leaves led to a more heterogenous saturation of electron transport capacity and lowered its CO<sub>2</sub> concentration drawdown capacity in the intercellular airspace and chloroplast stroma. This decoupling of light availability from photosynthetic capacity under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e light is sufficient to generate an 11% decline in photosynthesis in sun-grown but not shade-grown leaves, primarily because thin shade-grown leaves similarly distribute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e and direct light throughout the mesophyll. Finally, we illustrate how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e light photosynthetic depression could overcome enhancement in canopies with low light extinction coefficients and/or leaf area, pointing toward a novel direction for future research.</p>

Single-molecule diffusion-based estimation of ligand effects on G protein–coupled receptors
<p>G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) are major drug targets. Developing a method to measure the activities of GPCRs is essential for pharmacology and drug screening. However, it is difficult to measure the effects of a drug by monitoring the receptor on the cell surface; thus, changes in the concentrations of downstream signaling molecules, which depend on the signaling pathway selectivity of the receptor, are often used as an index of receptor activity. We show that single-molecule imaging analysis provides an alternative method for assessing the effects of ligands on GPCRs. Using total internal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ion fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM), we monitored the dynamics of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion of metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 (mGluR3), a class C GPCR, under various ligand conditions. Our single-molecule tracking analysis demonstrated that increases and decreases in the average <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion coefficient of mGluR3 quantitatively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ed the ligand-dependent inactivation and activation of receptors, respectively. Through experiments with inhibitors and dual-color single-molecule imaging analysis, we found that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion of receptor molecules was altered by common physiological events associated with GPCRs, including G protein binding, and receptor accumulation in clathrin-coated pits. We also confirmed that agonist also decreased the average <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion coefficient for class A and B GPCRs, demonstrating that this parameter is a good index for estimating ligand effects on many GPCRs regardless of their phylogenetic groups, the chemical properties of the ligands, or G protein–coupling selectivity.</p>

Chemical synapses without synaptic vesicles: Purinergic neurotransmission through a CALHM1 channel-mitochondrial signaling complex
<p>Conventional chemical synapses in the nervous system involve a presynaptic accumulation of neuro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmitt</span></strong>er-containing vesicles, which fuse with the plasma membrane to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e neuro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmitt</span></strong>ers that activate postsynaptic receptors. In taste buds, type II receptor cells do not have conventional synaptic features but nonetheless show regulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e of their afferent neuro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmitt</span></strong>er, ATP, through a large-pore, voltage-gated channel, CALHM1. Immunohistochemistry revealed that CALHM1 was localized to points of contact between the receptor cells and sensory nerve fibers. Ultrastructural and super-resolution light microscopy showed that the CALHM1 channels were consistently associated with distinctive, large (1- to 2-μm) mitochondria spaced 20 to 40 nm from the presynaptic membrane. Pharmacological disruption of the mitochondrial respiratory chain limited the ability of taste cells to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e ATP, suggesting that the immediate source of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>ed ATP was the mitochondrion rather than a cytoplasmic pool of ATP. These large mitochondria may serve as both a reservoir of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>able ATP and the site of synthesis. The juxtaposition of the large mitochondria to areas of membrane displaying CALHM1 also defines a restricted compartment that limits the influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> upon opening of the nonselective CALHM1 channels. These findings reveal a distinctive organelle signature and functional organization for regulated, focal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e of purinergic signals in the absence of synaptic vesicles.</p>

Transcriptome and Degradome Sequencing Reveals Dormancy Mechanisms of <i>Cunninghamia lanceolata</i> Seeds<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Seeds with physiological dormancy usually experience primary and secondary dormancy in the nature; however, little is known about the differential regulation of primary and secondary dormancy. We combined multiple approaches to investigate cytological changes, hormonal levels, and gene expression dynamics in <i>Cunninghamia lanceolata</i> seeds during primary dormancy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e and secondary dormancy induction. Light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy revealed that protein bodies in the embryo cells coalesced during primary dormancy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e and then separated during secondary dormancy induction. Transcriptomic profiling demonstrated that expression of genes negatively regulating gibberellic acid (GA) sensitivity reduced specifically during primary dormancy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e, whereas the expression of genes positively regulating abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis increased during secondary dormancy induction. Parallel analysis of RNA ends revealed uncapped transcripts for ∼55% of all unigenes. A negative correlation between fold changes in expression levels of uncapped versus capped mRNAs was observed during primary dormancy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e. However, this correlation was loose during secondary dormancy induction. Our analyses suggest that the reversible changes in cytology and gene expression during dormancy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e and induction are related to ABA/GA balance. Moreover, mRNA degradation functions as a critical posttranscriptional regulator during primary dormancy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e. These findings provide a mechanistic framework for understanding physiological dormancy in seeds.</p>

Hindered cytoplasmic diffusion of inositol trisphosphate restricts its cellular range of action
<p>The range of action of intracellular messengers is determined by their rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion and degradation. Previous measurements in oocyte cytoplasmic extracts indicated that the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-liberating second messenger inositol trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>es with a coefficient (~280 μm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) similar to that in water, corresponding to a range of action of ~25 μm. Consequently, IP<sub>3</sub> is generally considered a “global” cellular messenger. We reexamined this issue by measuring local IP<sub>3</sub>-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> puffs to monitor IP<sub>3</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ing from spot photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e in neuroblastoma cells. Fitting these data by numerical simulations yielded a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion coefficient (≤10 μm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) about 30-fold slower than that previously reported. We propose that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion of IP<sub>3</sub> in mammalian cells is hindered by binding to immobile, functionally inactive receptors that were diluted in oocyte extracts. The predicted range of action of IP<sub>3</sub> (<5 μm) is thus smaller than the size of typical mammalian cells, indicating that IP<sub>3</sub> should better be considered as a local rather than a global cellular messenger.</p>

HD (<i>v </i>= 1, <i>j </i>= 2) was prepared by Stark-induced adiabatic Raman passage, with its bond axis aligned preferentially parallel or perpendicular to the lab-fixed relative velocity.

PAF1 regulation of promoter-proximal pause release via enhancer activation
<p>Gene expression in metazoans is regulated by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) promoter-proximal pausing and its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e. Previously, we showed that Pol II–associated factor 1 (PAF1) modulates the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e of paused Pol II into productive elongation. Here, we found that PAF1 occupies transcriptional enhancers and restrains hyperactivation of a subset of these enhancers. Enhancer activation as the result of PAF1 loss <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>es Pol II from paused promoters of nearby PAF1 target genes. Knockout of PAF1-regulated enhancers attenuates the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e of paused Pol II on PAF1 target genes without major interference in the establishment of pausing at their cognate promoters. Thus, a subset of enhancers can primarily modulate gene expression by controlling the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e of paused Pol II in a PAF1-dependent manner.</p>

Plasticity in the Neurotransmitter Repertoire

At the same time, it was deeply mysterious why so many signaling molecules were used in nervous systems. Subsequently, it became clear that many, if not most, neurons (including those in mammals) make and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e two or more neuro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmitt</span></strong>ers including small-molecules and neuropeptides (<i>2</i>–<i>4</i>). As the list of these potential co<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmitt</span></strong>ers and their receptors has increased, we are faced with understanding the functional relevance of this embarrassment of riches for neural circuits and behavior. Neuro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmitt</span></strong>ers and neuromodulators (substances often <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>ed with small-molecule neuro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmitt</span></strong>ers) can elicit a variety of different actions on their neuron targets, including directly opening ion channels or acting through signal transduction pathways to alter neuronal excitability or synaptic transmission. Thus, characterizing the mixture of co<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmitt</span></strong>ers <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>ed by a neuron is important for understanding how neuronal circuits operate. The mechanisms that change the profile of neuro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmitt</span></strong>er <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e provide opportunities for plastic changes in circuit function, and consequently in organism behavior. On page 449 of this issue, Dulcis <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) report changes in the neuro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmitt</span></strong>er profile of neurons that underlie photoperiod-triggered changes in animal behavior.

An in Vivo Imaging Assay Detects Spatial Variability in Glucose Release from Plant Roots

Plants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e considerable amounts of photosynthetically fixed carbon into the rhizosphere; hence, it is important to understand how carbon moves from the roots into the rhizosphere. Approaches used previously to address this question involved radioactive tracers, fluorescent probes, and biosensors to study sugar movement in the roots and into the rhizosphere. Although quite effective for studying sugar movement, it has been challenging to obtain data on spatial and temporal variability in sugar exudation using these techniques. In this study, we developed a gel-based enzyme-coupled colorimetric and fluorometric assay to image glucose (Glc) in vivo and used this assay to show that there is spatial variability in Glc <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e from plant roots.

These findings were confirmed independently by quantifying Glc <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e in well-watered and water-stressed maize primary roots using high-performance anion-exchange chromatography. Additionally, we demonstrated differential patterns of Glc exudation in different monocot and eudicot plant species.

Evolutionary and Functional Analysis of Membrane-Bound NAC Transcription Factor Genes in Soybean
<p>Functional divergence is thought to be an important evolutionary driving force for the retention of duplicate genes. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) membrane-bound NAC transcription factor (NTL) genes. NTLs are thought to be components of stress signaling and unique in their requirement for proteolytic cleavage to free them from the membrane. Most of the 15 <i>GmNTL</i> genes appear to have evolved under strong purifying selection. By analyzing the phylogenetic tree and gene synteny, we identified seven duplicate gene pairs generated by the latest whole-genome duplication. The members of each pair were shown to have variously diverged at the transcriptional (organ specificity and responsiveness to stress), posttranscriptional (alternative splicing), and protein (proteolysis-mediated membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e and transactivation activity) levels. The dormant (full-length protein) and active (protein without a transmembrane motif) forms of one pair of duplicated gene products (GmNTL1/GmNLT11) were each separately constitutively expressed in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The heteroexpression of active but not dormant forms of these proteins caused improved tolerance to abiotic stresses, suggesting that membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e was required for their functionality. Arabidopsis carrying the dormant form of GmNTL1 was more tolerant to hydrogen peroxide, which induces its membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e. Tolerance was not increased in the line carrying dormant GmNTL11, which was not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>ed by hydrogen peroxide treatment. Thus, NTL-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e pattern changes may cause phenotypic divergence. It was concluded that a variety of functional divergences contributed to the retention of these <i>GmNTL</i> duplicates.</p>

Photoperiod and temperature responses of bud swelling and bud burst in four temperate forest tree species
<p>Spring phenology of temperate forest trees is optimized to maximize the length of the growing season while minimizing the risk of freezing damage. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e from winter dormancy is environmentally mediated by species-specific responses to temperature and photoperiod. We investigated the response of early spring phenology to temperature and photoperiod at different stages of dormancy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e in cuttings from four temperate tree species in controlled environments. By tracking bud development, we were able to identify the onset of bud swelling and bud growth in <i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i> L., <i>Fagus sylvatica</i> L., <i>Quercus petraea</i> (Mattuschka) Liebl. and <i>Picea abies</i> (L.) H. Karst. At a given early stage of dormancy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e, the onset and duration of the bud swelling prior to bud burst are driven by concurrent temperature and photoperiod, while the maximum growth rate is temperature dependent only, except for <i>Fagus</i>, where long photoperiods also increased bud growth rates. Similarly, the later bud burst was controlled by temperature and photoperiod (in the photoperiod sensitive species <i>Fagus, Quercus</i> and <i>Picea</i>). We conclude that photoperiod is involved in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e of dormancy during the ecodormancy phase and may influence bud burst in trees that have experienced sufficient chilling. This study explored and documented the early bud swelling period that precedes and defines later phenological stages such as canopy greening in conventional phenological works. It is the early bud growth resumption that needs to be understood in order to arrive at a causal interpretation and modelling of tree phenology at a large scale. Classic spring phenology events mark visible endpoints of a cascade of processes as evidenced here.</p>

CRAC channels regulate astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and gliotransmitter release to modulate hippocampal GABAergic transmission
<p>Astrocytes are the major glial subtype in the brain and mediate numerous functions ranging from metabolic support to glio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmitt</span></strong>er <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e through signaling mechanisms controlled by Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Despite intense interest, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx pathways in astrocytes remain obscure, hindering mechanistic insights into how Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling is coupled to downstream astrocyte-mediated effector functions. Here, we identified store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e–activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> (CRAC) channels encoded by Orai1 and STIM1 as a major route of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry for driving sustained and oscillatory Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in astrocytes after stimulation of metabotropic purinergic and protease-activated receptors. Using synaptopHluorin as an optical reporter, we showed that the opening of astrocyte CRAC channels stimulated vesicular exocytosis to mediate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e of glio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmitt</span></strong>ers, including ATP. Furthermore, slice electrophysiological recordings showed that activation of astrocytes by protease-activated receptors stimulated interneurons in the CA1 hippocampus to increase inhibitory postsynaptic currents on CA1 pyramidal cells. These results reveal a central role for CRAC channels as regulators of astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, glio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmitt</span></strong>er <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e, and astrocyte-mediated tonic inhibition of CA1 pyramidal neurons.</p>

Mitotic phosphorylation regulates Hsp72 spindle localization by uncoupling ATP binding from substrate release
<p>Hsp72 is a member of the 70-kDa heat shock family of molecular chaperones (Hsp70s) that comprise a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and a substrate-binding domain (SBD) connected by a linker that couples the exchange of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e of the protein substrate. Mitotic phosphorylation of Hsp72 by the kinase NEK6 at Thr<sup>66</sup> located in the NBD promotes the localization of Hsp72 to the mitotic spindle and is required for efficient spindle assembly and chromosome congression and segregation. We determined the crystal structure of the Hsp72 NBD containing a genetically encoded phosphoserine at position 66. This revealed structural changes that stabilized interactions between subdomains within the NBD. ATP binding to the NBD of unmodified Hsp72 resulted in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e of substrate from the SBD, but phosphorylated Hsp72 retained substrate in the presence of ATP. Mutations that prevented phosphorylation-dependent subdomain interactions restored the connection between ATP binding and substrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e. Thus, phosphorylation of Thr<sup>66</sup> is a reversible mechanism that decouples the allosteric connection between nucleotide binding and substrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e, providing further insight into the regulation of the Hsp70 family. We propose that phosphorylation of Hsp72 on Thr<sup>66</sup> by NEK6 during mitosis promotes its localization to the spindle by stabilizing its interactions with components of the mitotic spindle.</p>

Arc-continent collisions in the tropics set Earth’s climate state
<p>On multimillion-year time scales, Earth has experienced warm ice-free and cold glacial climates, but it is unknown whether transitions between these background climate states were the result of changes in carbon dioxide sources or sinks. Low-latitude arc-continent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collis</span></strong>ions are hypothesized to drive cooling by exhuming and eroding mafic and ultramafic rocks in the warm, wet tropics, thereby increasing Earth’s potential to sequester carbon through chemical weathering. To better constrain global weatherability through time, the paleogeographic position of all major Phanerozoic arc-continent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collis</span></strong>ions was reconstructed and compared to the latitudinal distribution of ice sheets. This analysis reveals a strong correlation between the extent of glaciation and arc-continent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collis</span></strong>ions in the tropics. Earth’s climate state is set primarily by global weatherability, which changes with the latitudinal distribution of arc-continent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collis</span></strong>ions.</p>

The sleep-wake cycle regulates brain interstitial fluid tau in mice and CSF tau in humans
<p>The sleep-wake cycle regulates interstitial fluid (ISF) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of β-amyloid (Aβ) that accumulates in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Furthermore, chronic sleep deprivation (SD) increases Aβ plaques. However, tau, not Aβ, accumulation appears to drive AD neurodegeneration. We tested whether ISF/CSF tau and tau seeding and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spread</span></strong>ing were influenced by the sleep-wake cycle and SD. Mouse ISF tau was increased ~90% during normal wakefulness versus sleep and ~100% during SD. Human CSF tau also increased more than 50% during SD. In a tau seeding-and-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spread</span></strong>ing model, chronic SD increased tau pathology <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spread</span></strong>ing. Chemogenetically driven wakefulness in mice also significantly increased both ISF Aβ and tau. Thus, the sleep-wake cycle regulates ISF tau, and SD increases ISF and CSF tau as well as tau pathology <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spread</span></strong>ing.</p>

Understanding Lassa fever
<p>Lassa fever is a viral hemorrhagic fever prevalent in West Africa that has been gaining international attention as an emerging infectious disease with the potential to cause epidemics (<i>1</i>). Confirmed and suspected cases of Lassa fever have been steadily rising in Nigeria over the past 3 years. Laboratory-confirmed cases have increased from 106 in 2016 to 143 in 2017 and had already reached 562 by November 2018 (<i>2</i>). Part of defining the scope of the problem is trying to assess whether this is a true increase in the number of people afflicted by the infection, due to either changes in the virus itself or the geographical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spread</span></strong> of the vector (rodents of the <i>Mastomys</i> spp.), or a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ion of higher rates of detection and diagnosis secondary to the increased attention and interest of clinicians and laboratorians (<i>1</i>). Lassa fever outbreaks illustrate the issues associated with the response and management of emerging infectious diseases: How do you plan the public health, clinical, and community responses to a disease while you are still learning about the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and the ecological factors contributing to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spread</span></strong> of the pathogen? On page 74 of this issue, Kafetzopoulou <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) present the results of a rapid genomic study of Lassa virus (LASV) from the cases of 2018, which have improved understanding of how the disease has been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spread</span></strong>ing in Nigeria and have led to informed and targeted disease-control strategies. The study also further describes the use of a new and compact genomic sequencing device, which may start playing a larger role in defining other emerging infectious disease outbreaks in real time.</p>

‘Frightening’ typhoid fever outbreak spreads in Pakistan
<p>A strain of the bacterium that causes typhoid fever has become resistant to most every drug and is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spread</span></strong>ing through Pakistan, causing at least 2000 confirmed cases. The so-called extensively drug resistant (XDR) strain of <i>Salmonella typhi</i> remains susceptible to one oral antibiotic, azithromycin, but the only other options are expensive intravenous drugs that most people in Pakistan and other resource-strapped countries cannot afford. The fear is that if <i>S. typhi</i> develops resistance to azithromycin, many people will die from the disease, which leads to bowl perforation and other life-threatening complications in about 15% of untreated people. A new vaccine that for the first time works in young children and has long-lasting immunity is now being rolled out in Pakistan. But antibiotic resistance and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spread</span></strong> are a result of poor sanitation and contaminated water supplies, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong> the serious infrastructure problems in Hyderabad and Karachi, the two main cities affected by XDR <i>S. typhi. </i>Public health officials worry that the XDR <i>S. typhi</i> will also jump borders and soon start <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spread</span></strong>ing outside of Pakistan.</p>

When early adopters don't adopt
<p>Individuals who naturally adopt a new technology early are important for influencing whether and how the technology <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>es more broadly among later users (<i>1</i>–<i>7</i>). Such natural early adopters (NEAs) may influence the difference between successful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion of new technology and failure. Yet the factors that most influence how and why NEAs engage with new technologies are not entirely understood. We asked, “What if natural early adopters are not able to adopt early?” This paper is the first to measure the counterfactual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion curve that occurs when NEAs are not allowed to adopt early. The results suggest that NEAs can stifle broader <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion of a technology if their usual ability to be first—and to derive value from being first—is compromised. Small changes in the initial availability of a technology among different types of users can have a lasting effect on its potential.</p>

Translational termination without a stop codon
<p>Ribosomes stall when they <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">encount</span></strong>er the end of messenger RNA (mRNA) without an in-frame stop codon. In bacteria, these “nonstop” complexes can be rescued by alternative ribosome-rescue factor A (ArfA). We used electron cryomicroscopy to determine structures of ArfA bound to the ribosome with 3′-truncated mRNA, at resolutions ranging from 3.0 to 3.4 angstroms. ArfA binds within the ribosomal mRNA channel and substitutes for the absent stop codon in the A site by specifically recruiting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e factor 2 (RF2), initially in a compact preaccommodated state. A similar conformation of RF2 may occur on stop codons, suggesting a general mechanism for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e-factor–mediated translational termination in which a conformational switch leads to peptide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e only when the appropriate signal is present in the A site.</p>

Spatiotemporal Coupling of Vessel Cavitation and Discharge of Stored Xylem Water in a Tree Sapling
<p>Water discharge from stem internal storage compartments is thought to minimize the risk of vessel cavitation. Based on this concept, one would expect that water storage compartments involved in the buffering of xylem tensions empty before the onset of vessel cavitation under drought stress, and potentially refill after soil saturation. However, scant in vivo data exist that elucidate this localized spatiotemporal coupling. In this study on intact saplings of American chestnut (<i>Castanea dentata</i>), x-ray computed microtomography (microCT) showed that the xylem matrix surrounding vessels <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>es stored water and becomes air-filled either concurrent to or after vessel cavitation under progressive drought stress. Among annual growth rings, the xylem matrix of the current year remained largely water-filled even under severe drought stress. In comparison, microtomography images collected on excised stems showed that applied pressures of much greater than 0 MPa were required to induce water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e from the xylem matrix. Viability staining highlighted that water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e from the xylem matrix was associated primarily with emptying of dead fibers. Refilling of the xylem matrix and vessels was detected in intact saplings when the canopy was bagged and stem water potential was close to 0 MPa, and in leafless saplings over the winter period. In conclusion, this study indicates that the bulk of water stored in the xylem matrix is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>ed after the onset of vessel cavitation, and suggests that capillary water contributes to overall stem water storage under drought but is not used primarily for the prevention of drought-induced vessel cavitation in this species.</p>

Heat Shock Protein HSP101 Affects the Release of Ribosomal Protein mRNAs for Recovery after Heat Shock
<p>Heat shock (HS) is known to have a profound impact on gene expression at different levels, such as inhibition of protein synthesis, in which HS blocks translation initiation and induces the sequestration of mRNAs into stress granules (SGs) or P-bodies for storage and/or decay. SGs prevent the degradation of the stored mRNAs, which can be reengaged into translation in the recovery period. However, little is known on the mRNAs stored during the stress, how these mRNAs are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>ed from SGs afterward, and what the functional importance is of this process. In this work, we report that Arabidopsis <i>HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN101</i> (<i>HSP101</i>) knockout mutant (<i>hsp101</i>) presented a defect in translation recovery and SG dissociation after HS. Using RNA sequencing and RNA immunoprecipitation approaches, we show that mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins (RPs) were preferentially stored during HS and that these mRNAs were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>ed and translated in an HSP101-dependent manner during recovery. By <sup>15</sup>N incorporation and polysome profile analyses, we observed that these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>ed mRNAs contributed to the production of new ribosomes to enhance translation. We propose that, after HS, HSP101 is required for the efficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e of RP mRNAs from SGs resulting in a rapid restoration of the translation machinery by producing new RPs.</p>

High-Throughput Phenotyping of Maize Leaf Physiological and Biochemical Traits Using Hyperspectral Reflectance
<p>High-throughput, noninvasive field phenotyping has revealed genetic variation in crop morphological, developmental, and agronomic traits, but rapid measurements of the underlying physiological and biochemical traits are needed to fully understand genetic variation in plant-environment interactions. This study tested the application of leaf hyperspectral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ance (λ = 500–2,400 nm) as a high-throughput phenotyping approach for rapid and accurate assessment of leaf photosynthetic and biochemical traits in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). Leaf traits were measured with standard wet-laboratory and gas-exchange approaches alongside measurements of leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ance. Partial least-squares regression was used to develop a measure of leaf chlorophyll content, nitrogen content, sucrose content, specific leaf area, maximum rate of phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate carboxylation, [CO<sub>2</sub>]-saturated rate of photosynthesis, and leaf oxygen radical absorbance capacity from leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ance spectra. Partial least-squares regression models accurately predicted five out of seven traits and were more accurate than previously used simple spectral indices for leaf chlorophyll, nitrogen content, and specific leaf area. Correlations among leaf traits and statistical inferences about differences among genotypes and treatments were similar for measured and modeled data. The hyperspectral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ance approach to phenotyping was dramatically faster than traditional measurements, enabling over 1,000 rows to be phenotyped during midday hours over just 2 to 4 d, and offers a nondestructive method to accurately assess physiological and biochemical trait responses to environmental stress.</p>

Periodic heartbeat reversals cause cardiogenic inspiration and expiration with coupled spiracle leakage in resting blowflies, <i>Calliphora vicina</i>
<p>Respiration in insects is thought to be independent of the circulatory system because insects typically lack respiratory pigments and because oxygen transport occurs in the gaseous phase through a ramified tracheal system by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion and convection directly to the tissues. In the blowfly, as in other insects with periodic heartbeat reversal, the haemolymph is periodically shifted between the anterior body and abdomen, exerting alternating pressure changes on the compliant tracheae in the thorax and in the abdomen. Simultaneous pressure and O<sub>2</sub> optode measurements show that, during negative pressure periods, the tracheal partial pressure of oxygen (<i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>) increases by 0.5 kPa. In the quiescent fly, tracheal <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> is rather high (17.5–18.9 kPa), although the thoracic spiracles remain constricted. Microscopic video recordings and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ance measurements revealed that the dorsal soft edges of the valve lips of the second spiracle leave a very small leak, which is passively widened during backward pulses of the heart. Thus, negative pressure, combined with increased leakage of the spiracle Sp2 valve enable inspiration in the thorax. The positive pressure periods are correlated with a new type of convective CO<sub>2</sub> micro-bursts as shown in flow-through measurements. The bulk of the CO<sub>2</sub> is, however, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>ed after longer interbursts in macro-bursts with actively opening valves reminiscent of the open phase in a cyclic gas exchange. When the valves open, the <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> in the thoracic air sacs unexpectedly drops by a mean of 2.75±1.09 kPa, suggesting a displacement of O<sub>2</sub> by the transient accumulation of CO<sub>2</sub> in the tracheal system before its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e.</p>

Unusual transcription factor protects against heart failure
<p>The heart pumps blood to the rest of the body in a coordinated and steadfast manner. This pumping function is achieved through synchronous contraction of billions of cardiomyocytes (heart muscle cells), which is governed by phasic increases in intracellular calcium. As such, cardiomyocytes have evolved intricate cellular structures that tightly couple external electrical impulses to the triggering of calcium ion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e from intracellular stores and subsequent activation of force-producing proteins, a process termed excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling. A key component of this molecular ultrastructure is the cardiac dyad, a microdomain that juxtaposes the plasma membrane L-type calcium channel with the calcium-sensitive ryanodine receptor (RyR) channel complex, the molecular gatekeeper for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e of calcium ions from sarcoplasmic reticulum stores in cardiomyocytes. The cardiac dyad is physically stabilized by a membrane-associated scaffold protein called junctophilin-2 (JP2), which facilitates physiologic calcium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e during E-C coupling. Excessive stress or injury to cardiomyocytes results in defective E-C coupling, reduced pumping capacity, and the clinical syndrome of heart failure, a leading cause of death worldwide. On page 1375 of this issue, Guo <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) report the surprising discovery that during cardiac stress, a proteolytically cleaved fragment of JP2 can translocate to the cardiomyocyte nucleus and function as a transcription factor that can protect against heart failure pathogenesis. Thus, in addition to its “day job” as a structural protein, this suggest that JP2 can “moonlight” in the nucleus as part of a homeostatic feedback response to cardiac stress.</p>

A gut feeling
<p>The anatomist Friedrich S. Merkel predicted in 1880 that sensory systems are composed of epithelial cells and sensory nerves, which together transform environmental cues into neural signals that trigger our rich sensory experiences (<i>1</i>). We now know that this hypothesis mostly holds true for the canonical senses of vision, hearing, taste, and touch. Perhaps surprisingly, the peripheral outposts of these classical sensory systems (eyes, ears, tongue, and skin) are dwarfed by the human body's largest sensory organ—the gut. Enteroendocrine cells, which are rare epithelial cells that decorate the gut lining, have long been suspected to be sensory receptor cells that inform the brain about ingested nutrients (<i>2</i>). Since their description, these cells were assumed to play a role in metabolism and gut physiology by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>ing slow-acting peptide hormones that stimulate neurons throughout the gut and in the brain. On page 1219 of this issue, Kaelberer <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) challenge this view by demonstrating that gut enteroendocrine cells locally excite sensory nerves through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e of the neuro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmitt</span></strong>er glutamate. A recent study of enterochromaffin cells, a subset of enteroendocrine cells, also found that gut signals are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmitt</span></strong>ed at epithelial-neural synapses through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e of the neuro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmitt</span></strong>er serotonin (<i>4</i>). Together, these findings overturn a decades-old dogma that enteroendocrine cells signal exclusively through hormones.</p>

Apoptosis propagates through the cytoplasm as trigger waves
<p>Apoptosis is an evolutionarily conserved form of programmed cell death critical for development and tissue homeostasis in animals. The apoptotic control network includes several positive feedback loops that may allow apoptosis to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spread</span></strong> through the cytoplasm in self-regenerating trigger waves. We tested this possibility in cell-free <i>Xenopus laevis</i> egg extracts and observed apoptotic trigger waves with speeds of ~30 micrometers per minute. Fractionation and inhibitor studies implicated multiple feedback loops in generating the waves. Apoptotic oocytes and eggs exhibited surface waves with speeds of ~30 micrometers per minute, which were tightly correlated with caspase activation. Thus, apoptosis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spread</span></strong>s through trigger waves in both extracts and intact cells. Our findings show how apoptosis can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spread</span></strong> over large distances within a cell and emphasize the general importance of trigger waves in cell signaling.</p>

Congo rapidly curtails Ebola
<p>An outbreak of Ebola that surfaced in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) on 8 May has petered out and, for the first time, a vaccine may have had a role in containing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spread</span></strong>. To date, Ebola has struck 53 people in the DRC's Équateur province, killing 29. Most everyone lived in remote, difficult-to-reach villages, although four cases surfaced in the heavily populated city of Mbandaka, triggering serious concerns of an epidemic exploding. A vigorous, rapid effort to contain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spread</span></strong> began immediately, with the DRC's Ministry of Public Health working with international partners to build treatment facilities, conduct surveillance, and trace contacts of cases. On 21 May, a vaccine effort began that focused on creating a "ring" around cases by vaccinating people they may have come in contact with directly or indirectly. Some 3300 people received the vaccine, which is still experimental and was given in a clinical trial. But the trial did not have a control group, so it will not be possible to assess the precise role, if any, it played in stopping <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spread</span></strong>. Then again, no one who received the vaccine developed the disease as of yet, and researchers noted that simply providing it helped with Ebola education.</p>

Adaptive infrared-reflecting systems inspired by cephalopods
<p>Materials and systems that statically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong> radiation in the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum underpin the performance of many entrenched technologies, including building insulation, energy-conserving windows, spacecraft components, electronics shielding, container packaging, protective clothing, and camouflage platforms. The development of their adaptive variants, in which the infrared-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ing properties dynamically change in response to external stimuli, has emerged as an important unmet scientific challenge. By drawing inspiration from cephalopod skin, we developed adaptive infrared-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ing platforms that feature a simple actuation mechanism, low working temperature, tunable spectral range, weak angular dependence, fast response, stability to repeated cycling, amenability to patterning and multiplexing, autonomous operation, robust mechanical properties, and straightforward manufacturability. Our findings may open opportunities for infrared camouflage and other technologies that regulate infrared radiation.</p>

Structure of the yeast spliceosomal postcatalytic P complex
<p>The spliceosome undergoes dramatic changes in a splicing cycle. Structures of B, B<sup>act</sup>, C, C*, and intron lariat spliceosome complexes revealed mechanisms of 5′–splice site (ss) recognition, branching, and intron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e, but lacked information on 3′-ss recognition, exon ligation, and exon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e. Here we report a cryo–electron microscopy structure of the postcatalytic P complex at 3.3-angstrom resolution, revealing that the 3′ ss is mainly recognized through non–Watson-Crick base pairing with the 5′ ss and branch point. Furthermore, one or more unidentified proteins become stably associated with the P complex, securing the 3′ exon and potentially regulating activity of the helicase Prp22. Prp22 binds nucleotides 15 to 21 in the 3′ exon, enabling it to pull the intron-exon or ligated exons in a 3′ to 5′ direction to achieve 3′-ss proofreading or exon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e, respectively.</p>

Observation of mean path length invariance in light-scattering media
<p>The microstructure of a medium strongly influences how light propagates through it. The amount of disorder it contains determines whether the medium is transparent or opaque. Theory predicts that exciting such a medium homogeneously and isotropically makes some of its optical properties depend only on the medium’s outer geometry. Here, we report an optical experiment demonstrating that the mean path length of light is invariant with respect to the microstructure of the medium it <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scatter</span></strong>s through. Using colloidal solutions with varying concentration and particle size, the invariance of the mean path length is observed over nearly two orders of magnitude in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scatter</span></strong>ing strength. Our results can be extended to a wide range of systems—however ordered, correlated, or disordered—and apply to all wave-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scatter</span></strong>ing problems.</p>

Where has all the Zika gone?
<p>Only one case of locally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmitt</span></strong>ed Zika virus has been documented in the United States this year, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ion of the fact that cases have plummeted in Latin America and the Caribbean. Experts say the cause of the drop has nothing to do with efforts to control the mosquitoes that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spread</span></strong> the disease or the impact of climate on their populations. Rather, the rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spread</span></strong> of the virus through the Americas—which had its first reported case in Brazil in April 2015—left large swaths of the population immune. This so-called "herd immunity" has made it increasingly difficult for the Zika virus to find susceptible people, breaking the cycle of transmission between humans and mosquitoes. The drop in cases has not lessened the push to develop a vaccine against Zika, which caused wide<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spread</span></strong> alarm after thousands of babies in Brazil were born with brain deformities that studies have shown are linked to the mothers being infected by the virus while they were pregnant. But with transmission in the region becoming scarce, it does complicate efforts of clinical trials that hope to show lower rates of transmission and disease in vaccinated people. One such trial is underway right now.</p>

Nanoscale nuclear magnetic resonance with chemical resolution
<p>Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a key analytical technique in chemistry, biology, and medicine. However, conventional NMR spectroscopy requires an at least nanoliter-sized sample volume to achieve sufficient signal. We combined the use of a quantum memory and high magnetic fields with a dedicated quantum sensor based on nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond to achieve chemical shift resolution in <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>19</sup>F NMR spectroscopy of 20-zeptoliter sample volumes. We demonstrate the application of NMR pulse sequences to achieve homonuclear decoupling and spin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion measurements. The best measured NMR linewidth of a liquid sample was ~1 part per million, mainly limited by molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion. To mitigate the influence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion, we performed high-resolution solid-state NMR by applying homonuclear decoupling and achieved a 20-fold narrowing of the NMR linewidth.</p>

Cancer bypasses the lymph nodes

Even in the age of molecular medicine, the absence or presence of colon cancer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spread</span></strong> to regional lymph nodes remains the strongest predictor of whether surgery has cured the cancer, or whether an individual may harbor occult metastatic disease and thus require adjuvant chemotherapy to reduce the risk of lethal cancer metastases recurring in distant organs (<i>1</i>–<i>3</i>).

On the generation of solar spicules and Alfvénic waves
<p>In the lower solar atmosphere, the chromosphere is permeated by jets known as spicules, in which plasma is propelled at speeds of 50 to 150 kilometers per second into the corona. The origin of the spicules is poorly understood, although they are expected to play a role in heating the million-degree corona and are associated with Alfvéííénic waves that help drive the solar wind. We compare magnetohydrodynamic simulations of spicules with observations from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph and the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope. Spicules are shown to occur when magnetic tension is amplified and transported upward through interactions between ions and neutrals or ambipolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion. The tension is impulsively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>ed to drive flows, heat plasma (through ambipolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion), and generate Alfvéííéénic waves.</p>

Neutron scattering in the proximate quantum spin liquid α-RuCl<sub>3</sub>
<p>The Kitaev quantum spin liquid (KQSL) is an exotic emergent state of matter exhibiting Majorana fermion and gauge flux excitations. The magnetic insulator α-RuCl<sub>3</sub> is thought to realize a proximate KQSL. We used neutron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scatter</span></strong>ing on single crystals of α-RuCl<sub>3</sub> to reconstruct dynamical correlations in energy-momentum space. We discovered highly unusual signals, including a column of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scatter</span></strong>ing over a large energy interval around the Brillouin zone center, which is very stable with temperature. This finding is consistent with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scatter</span></strong>ing from the Majorana excitations of a KQSL. Other, more delicate experimental features can be transparently associated with perturbations to an ideal model. Our results encourage further study of this prototypical material and may open a window into investigating emergent magnetic Majorana fermions in correlated materials.</p>

Relativistic deflection of background starlight measures the mass of a nearby white dwarf star
<p>Gravitational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deflect</span></strong>ion of starlight around the Sun during the 1919 total solar eclipse provided measurements that confirmed Einstein’s general theory of relativity. We have used the Hubble Space Telescope to measure the analogous process of astrometric microlensing caused by a nearby star, the white dwarf Stein 2051 B. As Stein 2051 B passed closely in front of a background star, the background star’s position was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deflect</span></strong>ed. Measurement of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deflect</span></strong>ion at multiple epochs allowed us to determine the mass of Stein 2051 B—the sixth-nearest white dwarf to the Sun—as 0.675 ± 0.051 solar masses. This mass determination provides confirmation of the physics of degenerate matter and lends support to white dwarf evolutionary theory.</p>

Bloch oscillations in the absence of a lattice
<p>The interplay of strong quantum correlations and far-from-equilibrium conditions can give rise to striking dynamical phenomena. We experimentally investigated the quantum motion of an impurity atom immersed in a strongly interacting one-dimensional Bose liquid and subject to an external force. We found that the momentum distribution of the impurity exhibits characteristic Bragg <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ions at the edge of an emergent Brillouin zone. Although Bragg <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ions are typically associated with lattice structures, in our strongly correlated quantum liquid they result from the interplay of short-range crystalline order and kinematic constraints on the many-body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scatter</span></strong>ing processes in the one-dimensional system. As a consequence, the impurity exhibits periodic dynamics, reminiscent of Bloch oscillations, although the quantum liquid is translationally invariant. Our observations are supported by large-scale numerical simulations.</p>

Observation of the Wigner-Huntington transition to metallic hydrogen

Metallic hydrogen may be a room-temperature superconductor and metastable when the pressure is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>ed and could have an important impact on energy and rocketry. We have studied solid molecular hydrogen under pressure at low temperatures. At a pressure of 495 gigapascals, hydrogen becomes metallic, with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ivity as high as 0.91. We fit the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ance using a Drude free-electron model to determine the plasma frequency of 32.5 ± 2.1 electron volts at a temperature of 5.5 kelvin, with a corresponding electron carrier density of 7.7 ± 1.1 × 10<sup>23</sup> particles per cubic centimeter, which is consistent with theoretical estimates of the atomic density. The properties are those of an atomic metal. We have produced the Wigner-Huntington dissociative transition to atomic metallic hydrogen in the laboratory.</p>

RNA interference is essential for cellular quiescence
<p>Quiescent cells play a predominant role in most organisms. Here we identify RNA interference (RNAi) as a major requirement for quiescence (G<sub>0</sub> phase of the cell cycle) in <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i>. RNAi mutants lose viability at G<sub>0</sub> entry and are unable to maintain long-term quiescence. We identified suppressors of G<sub>0</sub> defects in cells lacking Dicer (<i>dcr1</i>Δ), which mapped to genes involved in chromosome segregation, RNA polymerase–associated factors, and heterochromatin formation. We propose a model in which RNAi promotes the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e of RNA polymerase in cycling and quiescent cells: (i) RNA polymerase II <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e mediates heterochromatin formation at centromeres, allowing proper chromosome segregation during mitotic growth and G<sub>0</sub> entry, and (ii) RNA polymerase I <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e prevents heterochromatin formation at ribosomal DNA during quiescence maintenance. Our model may account for the codependency of RNAi and histone H3 lysine 9 methylation throughout eukaryotic evolution.</p>

Protein Phosphatase 2A B'α and B'β Protect Centromeric Cohesion during Meiosis I
<p>During meiosis, the stepwise <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e of sister chromatid cohesion is crucial for the equal distribution of genetic material to daughter cells, enabling generation of fertile gametophytes. However, the molecular mechanism that protects centromeric cohesion from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e at meiosis I is unclear in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Here, we report that the protein phosphatase 2A regulatory subunits B'α and B'β participate in the control of sister chromatid separation. The double mutant <i>b'αβ</i> exhibited severe male and female sterility, caused by the lack of a nucleus or presence of an abnormal nucleus in mature microspores and embryo sacs. 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole staining revealed unequal amounts of DNA in the mononuclear microspores. Transverse sections of the anthers revealed unevenly sized tetrads with or without a nucleus, suggesting a defect in meiocyte meiosis. An analysis of chromosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spread</span></strong>s showed that the sister chromatids separated prematurely at anaphase I in <i>b'αβ</i>. Immunoblotting showed that AtRECOMBINATION DEFECTIVE8 (AtREC8), a key member of the cohesin complex, was hyperphosphorylated in <i>b'αβ</i> anthers and pistils during meiosis but hypophosphorylated in the wild type. Furthermore, yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays showed that B'α and B'β interact specifically with AtREC8, AtSHUGOSHIN1 (AtSGO1), AtSGO2, and PATRONUS1. Given that B'α was reported to localize to the centromere in meiotic cells, we propose that protein phosphatase 2A B'α and B'β are recruited by AtSGO1/2 and PATRONUS1 to dephosphorylate AtREC8 at the site of centromere cohesion to shield it from cleavage until anaphase II, contributing to the balanced separation of sister chromatids at meiosis.</p>

Aphid-borne Viral Spread Is Enhanced by Virus-induced Accumulation of Plant Reactive Oxygen Species
<p>Most known plant viruses are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spread</span></strong> from plant to plant by insect vectors. There is strong evidence that nonpersistently <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmitt</span></strong>ed viruses manipulate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e of plant volatiles to attract insect vectors, thereby promoting virus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spread</span></strong>. The mechanisms whereby aphid settling and feeding is altered on plants infected with these viruses, however, are unclear. Here we employed loss-of-function mutations in cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) and one of its host plants, tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>), to elucidate such mechanisms. We show that, relative to a CMVΔ2b strain with a deletion of the viral suppressor of RNAi 2b protein in CMV, plants infected with wild-type CMV produce higher concentrations of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in plant tissues. Aphids on wild-type CMV-infected plants engage in shorter probes, less phloem feeding, and exhibit other changes, as detected by electrical penetration graphing technology, relative to CMVΔ2b-infected plants. Therefore, the frequency of virus acquisition and the virus load per aphid were greater on CMV-infected plants than on CMVΔ2b-infected plants. Aphids also moved away from initial feeding sites more frequently on wild-type CMV infected versus CMVΔ2b-infected plants. The role of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in eliciting these effects on aphids was corroborated using healthy plants infused with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Finally, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels were not elevated, and aphid behavior was unchanged, on CMV-infected RbohD-silenced tobacco plants, which are deficient in the induction of ROS production. These results suggest that CMV uses its viral suppressor of RNAi protein to increase plant ROS levels, thereby enhancing its acquisition and transmission by vector insects.</p>

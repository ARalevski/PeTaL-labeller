Local and Systemic Metabolic Responses during Light-Induced Rapid Systemic Signaling
<p>Plants evolved multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>gnaling pathways that transduce light-related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>gnals between leaves. These are thought to improve light stress acclimation in a process termed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic acquired acclimation. Although responses to light stress have been studied exten<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>vely in local leaves, and to a lesser degree in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic leaves, little is known about the responses that occur in the different tissues that connect the local to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic leaves. These could be important in defining the specificity of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic response as well as in supporting the generation of different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>gnals. Here, we report that local application of light stress to one rosette leaf of bolting Arabidop<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>s (<i>Arabidop<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>s thaliana</i>) plants resulted in a metabolic response that encompassed local, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic and transport tissues (stem tissues that connect the local to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic tissues), demonstrating a high degree of phy<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>cal and metabolic continuity between different tissues throughout the plant. Our results further indicate that the response of many of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ically altered metabolites is associated with the function of the reactive oxygen species wave and that the levels of eight different metabolites are altered in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>milar manner in all tissues tested (local, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic, and transport). These compounds could define a core metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>gnature for light stress that propagates from the local to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic leaves. Our findings suggest that metabolic changes occurring in cells that connect the local and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic tissues play an important role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic acquired acclimation and could convey specificity to the rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic response of plants to light stress.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
The Evolution of Silicon Transport in Eukaryotes
<p>Bio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>licification (the formation of biological structures from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>lica) occurs in diverse eukaryotic lineages, plays a major role in global biogeochemical cycles, and has <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>gnificant biotechnological applications. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>licon (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>) uptake is crucial for bio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>licification, yet the evolutionary history of the transporters involved remains poorly known. Recent evidence suggests that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>T family of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong> transporters, initially identified in diatoms, may be widely distributed, with an extended family of related transporters (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>T-Ls) present in some non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>licified organisms. Here, we identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>Ts and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>T-Ls in a range of eukaryotes, including major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>licified lineages (radiolarians and chrysophytes) and also bacterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>T-Ls. Our evidence suggests that the sym<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metric</span></strong>al 10-transmembrane-domain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>T structure has independently evolved multiple times via duplication and fu<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>on of 5-transmembrane-domain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>T-Ls. We also identify a second gene family, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>milar to the active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong> transporter L<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>2, that is broadly distributed amongst <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>liceous and non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>liceous eukaryotes. Our analyses resolve a distinct group of L<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>2-like genes, including plant and diatom <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>-respon<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>ve genes, and sequences unique to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>liceous sponges and choanoflagellates. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>T/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>T-L and L<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>2 transporter families likely contribute to bio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>licification in diverse lineages, indicating an ancient role for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong> transport in eukaryotes. We propose that these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong> transporters may have arisen initially to prevent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong> toxicity in the high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong> Precambrian oceans, with subsequent biologically induced reductions in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong> concentrations of Phanerozoic seas leading to widespread losses of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>T, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>T-L, and L<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>2-like genes in diverse lineages. Thus, the origin and diver<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>fication of two independent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong> transporter families both drove and were driven by ancient ocean <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong> levels.</p>

Circularity of t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> components was decreased in HF versus controls (0.37±0.01 versus 0.46±0.02; <i>P</i><0.01), and the volume/length ratio was increased in HF (0.36±0.01 versus 0.25±0.02 µm<sup>2</sup>; <i>P</i><0.0001). T-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> den<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>ty was reduced in HF, leading to increased ryanodine receptor–sarcolemma distances (0.96±0.05 versus 0.64±0.1 µm; <i>P</i><0.01). Low ryanodine receptor–sarcolemma distances at the time of LVAD implantation predicted high post-LVAD left ventricular ejection fractions (<i>P</i><0.01) and ejection fraction increases during unloading (<i>P</i><0.01). Ejection fraction in patients with pre-LVAD ryanodine receptor–sarcolemma distances >1 µm did not improve after mechanical unloading.

Association Between Hospital Volume, Processes of Care, and Outcomes in Patients Admitted With Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Hospital volume is frequently used as a structural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metric</span></strong> for asses<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>ng quality of care, but its utility in patients admitted with acute heart failure (HF) is not well characterized. Accordingly, we sought to determine the relationship between admis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>on volume, process-of-care <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metric</span></strong>s, and short- and long-term outcomes in patients admitted with acute HF.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients enrolled in the Get With The Guidelines-HF registry with linked Medicare inpatient data at 342 hospitals were assessed.

Tree Physiology
Measuring the ratio of CO<sub>2</sub> efflux to O<sub>2</sub> influx in tree stem respiration
<p>In recent studies, the ratio of tree stem CO<sub>2</sub> efflux to O<sub>2</sub> influx has been defined as the apparent respiratory quotient (ARQ). The metabolism of carbohydrates, the putative respiratory substrate in trees, is expected to yield an ARQ of 1.0. However, previous studies have reported ARQ values ranging between 0.23 and 0.90. These interesting results may indicate internal transport of respired CO<sub>2</sub> within stems; yet no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>mple field applicable methods for ARQ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement have been available. Here, we report on the assembly of a closed circulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> called ‘<i>Hampadah</i>’, which uses CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> analyzers to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e air samples from stem chambers. We tested the performance of the <i>Hampadah</i> with samples from 36 trees (<i>Tetragastris panamen<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>s</i> (Engl.) Kuntze). Additionally, we showed the fea<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>bility of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ing ARQ directly from stem chambers, u<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>ng portable CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> sensors, in both discrete and continuous modes of operation. The <i>Hampadah</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement proved to be con<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>stent with CO<sub>2</sub> gas standards (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.999) and with O<sub>2</sub> determined by O<sub>2</sub>/Ar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements with a mass spectrometer (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.998). The <i>Hampadah</i> gave highly reproducible results for ARQ determination of field samples (±0.01 for duplicates). The portable sensors <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement showed good correlation with the <i>Hampadah</i> in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ing CO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub> and ARQ (<i>n</i> = 5, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.97, 0.98 and 0.91, respectively). We have demonstrated here that the <i>Hampadah</i> and the sensors’ methods enable accurate ARQ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements for both laboratory and field research.</p>

Measurement of a superconducting qubit with a microwave photon counter
<p>Fast, high-fidelity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement is a key ingredient for quantum error correction. Conventional approaches to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement of superconducting qubits, involving linear amplification of a microwave probe tone followed by heterodyne detection at room temperature, do not scale well to large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>zes. We introduce an approach to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement based on a microwave photon counter demonstrating raw <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>ngle-shot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement fidelity of 92%. Moreover, the intrin<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>c damping of the photon counter is used to extract the energy released by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement process, allowing repeated high-fidelity quantum nondemolition <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements. Our scheme provides access to the clas<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>cal outcome of projective quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement at the millikelvin stage and could form the ba<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>s for a scalable quantum-to-clas<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>cal interface.</p>

Light Sheet Microscopy Imaging of Light Absorption and Photosynthesis Distribution in Plant Tissue
<p>In vivo variable chlorophyll fluorescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements of photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> II (P<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>I) quantum yields in optically dense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s are complicated by steep tissue light gradients due to scattering and absorption. Consequently, externally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed effective P<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>I quantum yields may be composed of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>gnals derived from cells differentially exposed to actinic light, where cells located deeper in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>de tissues receive lower irradiance than cells closer to the surface and can display distinct photophy<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>ological status. We demonstrate how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed distributions of P<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>I quantum yields in plant tissue change under natural tissue light gradients as compared with conventionally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed quantum yields with even exposure to actinic light. This was achieved by applying actinic irradiance perpendicular to one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>de of thallus cross sections of the aquatic macrophyte <i>Fucus ve<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>culosus</i> with laser light sheets of defined spectral compo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>tion, while imaging variable chlorophyll fluorescence from cross sections with a microscope-mounted pulse amplitude-modulated imaging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. We show that quantum yields are highly affected by light gradients and that traditional surface-based variable chlorophyll fluorescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements result in substantial underestimations and/or overestimations, depending on incident actinic irradiance. We present a method for u<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>ng chlorophyll fluorescence profiles in combination with integrating sphere <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements of reflectance and transmittance to calculate depth-resolved photon absorption profiles, which can be used to correct apparent P<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>I electron transport rates to photons absorbed by P<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>I. Absorption profiles of the investigated aquatic macrophyte were different in shape from what is typically observed in terrestrial leaves, and based on this finding, we discuss strategies for optimizing photon absorption via modulation of the structural organization of phytoelements according to in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>tu light environments.</p>

Role of insulin signaling impairment, adiponectin and dyslipidemia in peripheral and central neuropathy in mice
<p>One of the tissues or organs affected by diabetes is the nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, predominantly the peripheral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> (peripheral polyneuropathy and/or painful peripheral neuropathy) but also the central <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> with impaired learning, memory and mental flexibility. The aim of this study was to test the hypothe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>s that the pre-diabetic or diabetic condition caused by a high-fat diet (HFD) can damage both the peripheral and central nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. Groups of C57BL6 and Swiss Webster mice were fed a diet containing 60% fat for 8 months and compared to control and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic groups that were fed a standard diet containing 10% fat. Aspects of peripheral nerve function (conduction velocity, thermal sen<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>tivity) and central nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> function (learning ability, memory) were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed at assorted times during the study. Both strains of mice on HFD developed impaired glucose tolerance, indicative of insulin re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>stance, but only the C57BL6 mice showed statistically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>gnificant hyperglycemia. STZ-diabetic C57BL6 mice developed learning deficits in the Barnes maze after 8 weeks of diabetes, whereas neither C57BL6 nor Swiss Webster mice fed a HFD showed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>gns of defects at that time point. By 6 months on HFD, Swiss Webster mice developed learning and memory deficits in the Barnes maze test, whereas their peripheral nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> remained normal. In contrast, C57BL6 mice fed the HFD developed peripheral nerve dysfunction, as indicated by nerve conduction slowing and thermal hyperalge<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>a, but showed normal learning and memory functions. Our data indicate that STZ-induced diabetes or a HFD can damage both peripheral and central nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s, but learning deficits develop more rapidly in insulin-deficient than in insulin-re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>stant conditions and only in Swiss Webster mice. In addition to insulin impairment, dyslipidemia or adiponectinemia might determine the neuropathy phenotype.</p>

Probing Rényi entanglement entropy via randomized measurements

<p>Many-particle entanglement is a fundamental concept of quantum phy<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>cs that still presents conceptual challenges. Although nonclas<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>cal states of atomic ensembles were used to enhance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement preci<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>on in quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metrolog</span></strong>y, the notion of entanglement in these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s was debated because the correlations among the indistinguishable atoms were witnessed by collective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements only. Here, we use high-resolution imaging to directly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e the spin correlations between spatially separated parts of a spin-squeezed Bose-Einstein condensate. We observe entanglement that is strong enough for Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering: We can predict <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement outcomes for noncommuting observables in one spatial region on the ba<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>s of corresponding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements in another region with an inferred uncertainty product below the Heisenberg uncertainty bound. This method could be exploited for entanglement-enhanced imaging of electromagnetic field distributions and quantum information tasks.</p>

Systematic discovery of antiphage defense systems in the microbial pangenome
<p>The arms race between bacteria and phages led to the development of sophisticated antiphage defense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s, including CRISPR-Cas and restriction-modification <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. Evidence suggests that known and unknown defense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s are located in “defense islands” in microbial genomes. Here, we comprehen<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>vely characterized the bacterial defen<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>ve arsenal by examining gene families that are clustered next to known defense genes in prokaryotic genomes. Candidate defense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>atically engineered and validated in model bacteria for their antiphage activities. We report nine previously unknown antiphage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s and one antiplasmid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> that are widespread in microbes and strongly protect against foreign invaders. These include <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s that adopted components of the bacterial flagella and conden<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>n complexes. Our data also suggest a common, ancient ancestry of innate immunity components shared between animals, plants, and bacteria.</p>

CyanoGate: A Modular Cloning Suite for Engineering Cyanobacteria Based on the Plant MoClo Syntax
<p>Recent advances in synthetic biology research have been underpinned by an exponential increase in available genomic information and a proliferation of advanced DNA assembly tools. The adoption of plasmid vector assembly standards and parts libraries has greatly enhanced the reproducibility of research and the exchange of parts between different labs and biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. However, a standardized modular cloning (MoClo) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> is not yet available for cyanobacteria, which lag behind other prokaryotes in synthetic biology despite their huge potential regarding biotechnological applications. By building on the assembly library and syntax of the Plant Golden Gate MoClo kit, we have developed a versatile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> called CyanoGate that unites cyanobacteria with plant and algal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. Here, we describe the generation of a suite of parts and acceptor vectors for making (1) marked/unmarked knock-outs or integrations u<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>ng an integrative acceptor vector, and (2) tran<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>ent multigene expres<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>on and repres<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s u<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>ng known and previously undescribed replicative vectors. We tested and compared the CyanoGate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> in the established model cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 and the more recently described fast-growing strain <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973. The UTEX 2973 fast-growth phenotype was only evident under specific growth conditions; however, UTEX 2973 accumulated high levels of proteins with strong native or synthetic promoters. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> is publicly available and can be readily expanded to accommodate other standardized MoClo parts to accelerate the development of reliable synthetic biology tools for the cyanobacterial community.</p>

Probing entanglement in a many-body–localized system
<p>An interacting quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> that is subject to disorder may cease to thermalize owing to localization of its constituents, thereby marking the breakdown of thermodynamics. The key to understanding this phenomenon lies in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>’s entanglement, which is experimentally challenging to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e. We realize such a many-body–localized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> in a disordered Bose-Hubbard chain and characterize its entanglement properties through particle fluctuations and correlations. We observe that the particles become localized, suppres<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>ng transport and preventing the thermalization of sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. Notably, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e the development of nonlocal correlations, whose evolution is con<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>stent with a logarithmic growth of entanglement entropy, the hallmark of many-body localization.

Independent Regulation of Symbiotic Nodulation by the SUNN Negative and CRA2 Positive Systemic Pathways
<p>Plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>gnaling pathways allow the integration and coordination of shoot and root organ metabolism and development at the whole-plant level depending on nutrient availability. In legumes, two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic pathways have been reported in the <i>Medicago truncatula</i> model to regulate root nitrogen-fixing symbiotic nodulation. Both pathways involve leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases acting in shoots and proposed to perceive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>gnaling peptides produced in roots depending on soil nutrient availability. In this study, we characterized in the <i>M. truncatula</i> Jemalong A17 genotype a mutant allelic series affecting the Compact Root Architecture2 (CRA2) receptor. These analyses revealed that this pathway acts <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ically from shoots to po<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>tively regulate nodulation and is required for the activity of carboxyl-terminally encoded peptides (CEPs). In addition, we generated a double mutant to test genetic interactions of the CRA2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic pathway with the CLAVATA3/EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGION peptide (CLE)/Super Numeric Nodule (SUNN) receptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic pathway negatively regulating nodule number from shoots, which revealed an intermediate nodule number phenotype close to the wild type. Finally, we showed that the nitrate inhibition of nodule numbers was observed in <i>cra2</i> mutants but not in <i>sunn</i> and <i>cra2 sunn</i> mutants. Overall, these results suggest that CEP/CRA2 and CLE/SUNN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic pathways act independently from shoots to regulate nodule numbers.</p>

Measurement of Gross Photosynthesis, Respiration in the Light, and Mesophyll Conductance Using H<sub>2</sub><sup>18</sup>O Labeling
<p>A fundamental challenge in plant phy<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>ology is independently determining the rates of gross O<sub>2</sub> production by photosynthe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>s and O<sub>2</sub> consumption by respiration, photorespiration, and other processes. Previous studies on isolated chloroplasts or leaves have separately constrained net and gross O<sub>2</sub> production (NOP and GOP, respectively) by labeling ambient O<sub>2</sub> with <sup>18</sup>O while leaf water was unlabeled. Here, we describe a method to accurately <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e GOP and NOP of whole detached leaves in a cuvette as a routine gas-exchange <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement. The petiole is immersed in water enriched to a δ<sup>18</sup>O of ∼9,000‰, and leaf water is labeled through the transpiration stream. Photosynthe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>s transfers <sup>18</sup>O from H<sub>2</sub>O to O<sub>2</sub>. GOP is calculated from the increase in δ<sup>18</sup>O of O<sub>2</sub> as air passes through the cuvette. NOP is determined from the increase in O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>. Both terms are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed by isotope ratio mass spectrometry. CO<sub>2</sub> as<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>milation and other standard gas-exchange parameters also were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed. Reproducible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements are made on a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>ngle leaf for more than 15 h. We used this method to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e the light response curve of NOP and GOP in French bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>) at 21% and 2% O<sub>2</sub>. We then used these data to examine the O<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> ratio of net photosynthe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>s, the light response curve of mesophyll conductance, and the apparent inhibition of respiration in the light (Kok effect) at both oxygen levels. The results are discussed in the context of evaluating the technique as a tool to study and understand leaf phy<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>ological traits.</p>

A Genetic Network for Systemic RNA Silencing in Plants
<p>Non-cell autonomous RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>lencing can spread from cell to cell and over long distances in animals and plants. However, the genetic requirements and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>gnals involved in plant mobile gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>lencing are poorly understood. Here, we identified a <i>DICER-LIKE2</i> (<i>DCL2</i>)<i>-</i>dependent mechanism for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic spread of posttranscriptional RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>lencing, also known as posttranscriptional gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>lencing (PTGS), in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. U<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>ng a suite of transgenic <i>DCL</i> RNAi lines coupled with a GFP reporter, we demonstrated that <i>N. benthamiana</i> DCL1, DCL2, DCL3, and DCL4 are required to produce microRNAs and 22, 24, and 21nt small interfering RNAs (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>RNAs), respectively. All investigated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>RNAs produced in local incipient cells were present at low levels in distal tissues. Inhibition of <i>DCL2</i> expres<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>on reduced the spread of gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>lencing, while suppres<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>on of <i>DCL3</i> or <i>DCL4</i> expres<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>on enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS. In contrast to <i>DCL4</i> RNAi lines, <i>DCL2</i>-<i>DCL4</i> double-RNAi lines developed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>milar to that observed in <i>DCL2</i> RNAi. We further showed that the 21 or 24 nt local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>RNAs produced by DCL4 or DCL3 were not involved in long-distance gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>lencing. Grafting experiments demonstrated that <i>DCL2</i> was required in the scion to respond to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>gnal, but not in the rootstock to produce/send the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>gnal. These results suggest a coordinated <i>DCL</i> genetic pathway in which <i>DCL2</i> plays an essential role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS in <i>N. benthamiana</i>, while both <i>DCL4</i> and <i>DCL3</i> attenuate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS. We discuss the potential role of 21, 22, and 24 nt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>RNAs in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS.</p>

High-Throughput Phenotyping of Maize Leaf Physiological and Biochemical Traits Using Hyperspectral Reflectance
<p>High-throughput, noninva<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>ve field phenotyping has revealed genetic variation in crop morphological, developmental, and agronomic traits, but rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements of the underlying phy<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>ological and biochemical traits are needed to fully understand genetic variation in plant-environment interactions. This study tested the application of leaf hyperspectral reflectance (λ = 500–2,400 nm) as a high-throughput phenotyping approach for rapid and accurate assessment of leaf photosynthetic and biochemical traits in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). Leaf traits were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed with standard wet-laboratory and gas-exchange approaches along<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>de <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements of leaf reflectance. Partial least-squares regres<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>on was used to develop a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e of leaf chlorophyll content, nitrogen content, sucrose content, specific leaf area, maximum rate of phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate carboxylation, [CO<sub>2</sub>]-saturated rate of photosynthe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>s, and leaf oxygen radical absorbance capacity from leaf reflectance spectra. Partial least-squares regres<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>on models accurately predicted five out of seven traits and were more accurate than previously used <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>mple spectral indices for leaf chlorophyll, nitrogen content, and specific leaf area. Correlations among leaf traits and statistical inferences about differences among genotypes and treatments were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>milar for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed and modeled data. The hyperspectral reflectance approach to phenotyping was dramatically faster than traditional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements, enabling over 1,000 rows to be phenotyped during midday hours over just 2 to 4 d, and offers a nondestructive method to accurately assess phy<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>ological and biochemical trait responses to environmental stress.</p>

Periodic heartbeat reversals cause cardiogenic inspiration and expiration with coupled spiracle leakage in resting blowflies, <i>Calliphora vicina</i>
<p>Respiration in insects is thought to be independent of the circulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> because insects typically lack respiratory pigments and because oxygen transport occurs in the gaseous phase through a ramified tracheal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> by diffu<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>on and convection directly to the tissues. In the blowfly, as in other insects with periodic heartbeat reversal, the haemolymph is periodically shifted between the anterior body and abdomen, exerting alternating pressure changes on the compliant tracheae in the thorax and in the abdomen. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>multaneous pressure and O<sub>2</sub> optode <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements show that, during negative pressure periods, the tracheal partial pressure of oxygen (<i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>) increases by 0.5 kPa. In the quiescent fly, tracheal <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> is rather high (17.5–18.9 kPa), although the thoracic spiracles remain constricted. Microscopic video recordings and reflectance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements revealed that the dorsal soft edges of the valve lips of the second spiracle leave a very small leak, which is pas<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>vely widened during backward pulses of the heart. Thus, negative pressure, combined with increased leakage of the spiracle Sp2 valve enable inspiration in the thorax. The po<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>tive pressure periods are correlated with a new type of convective CO<sub>2</sub> micro-bursts as shown in flow-through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements. The bulk of the CO<sub>2</sub> is, however, released after longer interbursts in macro-bursts with actively opening valves reminiscent of the open phase in a cyclic gas exchange. When the valves open, the <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> in the thoracic air sacs unexpectedly drops by a mean of 2.75±1.09 kPa, suggesting a displacement of O<sub>2</sub> by the tran<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>ent accumulation of CO<sub>2</sub> in the tracheal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> before its release.</p>

Vocal production complexity correlates with neural instructions in the oyster toadfish (<i>Opsanus tau</i>)
<p>Sound communication is fundamental to many social interactions and essential to courtship and agonistic behaviours in many vertebrates. The swimbladder and associated muscles in batrachoidid fishes (midshipman and toadfish) is a unique vertebrate sound production <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, wherein fundamental frequencies are determined directly by the firing rate of a vocal-acoustic neural network that drives the contraction frequency of superfast swimbladder muscles. The oyster toadfish boatwhistle call starts with an irregular sound waveform that could be an emergent property of the peripheral nonlinear sound-producing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> or reflect complex encoding in the central nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. Here, we demonstrate that the start of the boatwhistle is indicative of a chaotic strange attractor, and tested whether its origin lies in the peripheral sound-producing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> or in the vocal motor network. We recorded sound and swimbladder muscle activity in awake, freely behaving toadfish during motor nerve stimulation, and recorded sound, motor nerve and muscle activity during spontaneous grunts. The results show that rhythmic motor volleys do not cause complex sound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>gnals. However, arrhythmic recruitment of swimbladder muscle during spontaneous grunts correlates with complex sounds. This supports the hypothe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>s that the irregular start of the boatwhistle is encoded in the vocal pre-motor neural network, and not caused by peripheral interactions with the sound-producing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. We suggest that sound production <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> demands across vocal tetrapods have selected for muscles and motorneurons adapted for speed, which can execute complex neural instructions into equivalently complex vocalisations.</p>

Observation of parity-time symmetry breaking in a single-spin system

The dynamics of quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s has been theoretically investigated with parity-time–sym<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metric</span></strong> Hamiltonians exhibiting exotic properties. Although parity-time symmetry has been explored in clas<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>cal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s, its observation in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>ngle quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> remains elu<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>ve.

Neutral mass spectrometry of virus capsids above 100 megadaltons with nanomechanical resonators
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement of the mass of particles in the mega- to gigadalton range is challenging with conventional mass spectrometry. Although this mass range appears optimal for nanomechanical resonators, nanomechanical mass spectrometers often suffer from prohibitive sample loss, extended analy<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>s time, or inadequate resolution.

Emergence of coexisting ordered states in active matter systems
<p>Active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s can produce a far greater variety of ordered patterns than conventional equilibrium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. In particular, tran<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>tions between disorder and either polar- or nematically ordered phases have been predicted and observed in two-dimen<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>onal active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. However, coexistence between phases of different types of order has not been reported. We demonstrate the emergence of dynamic coexistence of ordered states with fluctuating nematic and polar symmetry in an actomyo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>n motility assay. Combining experiments with agent-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>mulations, we identify sufficiently weak interactions that lack a clear alignment symmetry as a prerequi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>te for coexistence. Thus, the symmetry of macroscopic order becomes an emergent and dynamic property of the active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. These results provide a pathway by which living <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s can express different types of order by u<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>ng identical building blocks.</p>

Connecting neuronal circuits for movement
<p>Movement is the most common final output of nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> activity and is essential for survival. But what makes this seemingly trivial statement so scientifically challenging? Neurons that contribute to when and how our body moves are distributed throughout the nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. Thus, even a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>mple movement such as arm flexion requires the coordinated activation of many different neuronal populations across multiple brain regions. A key question is how the nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> produces diverse and precise actions aligned with the organisms' behavioral needs. These processes are affected in diseases such as Parkinson's or Huntington's, in which aberrant motor behavior dominates. Recent studies are transformative in how we think about the control of movement. A common denominator of these studies is that brain regions that contribute to motor behavior can no longer be con<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>dered as interacting boxes. Instead, deep circuit-level in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>ght based on specific neuronal populations emerges as being critical to revealing motor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> organization and understanding its function. It is likely that in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>ghts at this level can also help to de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>gn more specific and direct interventions for diseases of the motor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> and neuroprosthetics applied after injuries.</p>

The principles of cascading power limits in small, fast biological and engineered systems
<p>Mechanical power limitations emerge from the phy<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>cal trade-off between force and velocity. Many biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s incorporate power-enhancing mechanisms enabling extraordinary accelerations at small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>zes. We establish how power enhancement emerges through the dynamic coupling of motors, springs, and latches and reveal how each displays its own force-velocity behavior. We mathematically demonstrate a tunable performance space for spring-actuated movement that is applicable to biological and synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. Incorporating nonideal spring behavior and parameterizing latch dynamics allows the identification of critical tran<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>tions in mass and trade-offs in spring scaling, both of which offer explanations for long-observed scaling patterns in biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s.

Recurrences in an isolated quantum many-body system
<p>The complexity of interacting quantum many-body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s leads to exceedingly long recurrence times of the initial quantum state for all but the smallest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. For large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s, one cannot probe the full quantum state in all its details. Thus, experimentally, recurrences can only be determined on the level of the acces<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>ble observables. Realizing a commensurate spectrum of collective excitations in one-dimen<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>onal superfluids, we demonstrate recurrences of coherence and long-range order in an interacting quantum many-body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> containing thousands of particles.

Ultrafast optical ranging using microresonator soliton frequency combs
<p>Light detection and ranging is widely used in science and industry. Over the past decade, optical frequency combs were shown to offer advantages in optical ranging, enabling fast distance acqui<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>tion with high accuracy. Driven by emerging high-volume applications such as industrial sen<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>ng, drone navigation, or autonomous driving, there is now a growing demand for compact ranging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s.

Breaking Lorentz reciprocity to overcome the time-bandwidth limit in physics and engineering
<p>A century-old tenet in phy<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>cs and engineering asserts that any type of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, having bandwidth Δω, can interact with a wave over only a constrained time period Δ<i>t</i> inversely proportional to the bandwidth (Δ<i>t</i>·Δω ~ 2π). This law severely limits the generic capabilities of all types of resonant and wave-guiding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s in photonics, cavity quantum electrodynamics and optomechanics, acoustics, continuum mechanics, and atomic and optical phy<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>cs but is thought to be completely fundamental, ari<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>ng from ba<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>c Fourier reciprocity. We propose that this “fundamental” limit can be overcome in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s where Lorentz reciprocity is broken. As a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> becomes more asym<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metric</span></strong> in its transport properties, the degree to which the limit can be surpassed becomes greater. By way of example, we theoretically demonstrate how, in an astutely de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>gned magnetized semiconductor heterostructure, the above limit can be exceeded by orders of magnitude by u<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>ng realistic material parameters. Our findings revise prevailing paradigms for linear, time-invariant resonant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s, challenging the doctrine that high-quality resonances must invariably be narrowband and providing the pos<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>bility of developing devices with unprecedentedly high time-bandwidth performance.</p>

A Genetic Screen for Impaired Systemic RNAi Highlights the Crucial Role of DICER-LIKE 2
<p>Posttranscriptional gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>lencing (PTGS) of transgenes involves abundant 21-nucleotide small interfering RNAs (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>RNAs) and low-abundance 22-nucleotide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>RNAs produced from double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) by DCL4 and DCL2, respectively. However, DCL2 facilitates the recruitment of RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE 6 (RDR6) to ARGONAUTE 1-derived cleavage products, resulting in more efficient amplification of secondary and tran<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>tive dsRNA and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>RNAs. Here, we describe a reporter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> where RDR6-dependent PTGS is initiated by restricted expres<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>on of an inverted-repeat dsRNA specifically in the Arabidop<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>s (<i>Arabidop<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>s thaliana</i>) root tip, allowing a genetic screen to identify mutants impaired in RDR6-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS. Our screen identified <i>dcl2</i> but not <i>dcl4</i> mutants. Moreover, grafting experiments showed that DCL2, but not DCL4, is required in both the source rootstock and the recipient shoot tissue for efficient RDR6-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS. Furthermore, <i>dcl4</i> rootstocks produced more DCL2-dependent 22-nucleotide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>RNAs than the wild type and showed enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic movement of PTGS to grafted shoots. Thus, along with its role in recruiting RDR6 for further amplification of PTGS, DCL2 is crucial for RDR6-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS.</p>

MAP Kinase PrMPK9-1 Contributes to the Self-Incompatibility Response
<p>Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) form important <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>gnaling modules for a variety of cellular responses in eukaryotic cells. In plants, MAPKs play key roles in growth and development as well as in immunity/stress responses. Pollen-pistil interactions are critical early events regulating pollination and fertilization and involve many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>gnaling events. Self-incompatibility (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>) is an important mechanism to prevent self-fertilization and inbreeding in higher plants and also is known to utilize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>gnaling to achieve incompatible pollen rejection. Although several pollen-expressed MAPKs exist, very little is known about their function. We previously identified a pollen-expressed MAPK (p56) from <i>Papaver rhoeas</i> that was rapidly activated during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>; several studies implicated its role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>gnaling to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>-induced programmed cell death involving a DEVDase. However, to date, the identity of the MAPK involved has been unknown. Here, we have identified and cloned a pollen-expressed <i>P. rhoeas</i> threonine-aspartate-tyro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>ne (TDY) MAPK, <i>PrMPK9-1</i>. Rather few data relating to the function of TDY MAPKs in plants currently exist. We provide evidence that <i>PrMPK9-1</i> has a cell type-specific function, with a distinct role from <i>AtMPK9</i>. To our knowledge, this is the first study implicating a function for a TDY MAPK in pollen. We show that PrMPK9-1 corresponds to p56 and demonstrate that it is functionally involved in mediating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong> in <i>P. rhoeas</i> pollen: PrMPK9-1 is a key regulator for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong> in pollen and acts upstream of programmed cell death involving actin and activation of a DEVDase. Our study provides an important advance in elucidating functional roles for this class of MAPKs.</p>

A Viral Satellite DNA Vector (TYLCCNV) for Functional Analysis of miRNAs and siRNAs in Plants
<p>With experimental and bioinformatical methods, numerous small RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and short interfering RNAs (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>RNAs), have been found in plants, and they play vital roles in various biological regulation processes. However, most of these small RNAs remain to be functionally characterized. Until now, only several viral vectors were developed to overexpress miRNAs with limited application in plants. In this study, we report a new small RNA overexpres<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> via viral satellite DNA associated with <i>Tomato yellow leaf curl China virus</i> (TYLCCNV) vector, which could highly overexpress not only artificial and endogenous miRNAs but also endogenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>RNAs in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. First, we constructed ba<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>c TYLCCNV-amiRPDS(319L) vector with widely used <i>AtMIR319a</i> backbone, but the expected photobleaching phenotype was very weak. Second, through comparing the effect of backbones (<i>AtMIR319a</i>, <i>AtMIR390a</i>, and <i>SlMIR159</i>) on specificity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>gnificance of generating small RNAs, the <i>AtMIR390a</i> backbone was optimally selected to construct the small RNA overexpres<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. Third, through sRNA-Seq and Degradome-Seq, the small RNAs from <i>AtMIR390a</i> backbone in TYLCCNV-amiRPDS(390) vector were confirmed to highly overexpress amiRPDS and specifically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>lence targeted <i>PDS</i> gene. U<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>ng this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, rapid functional analy<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>s of endogenous miRNAs and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>RNAs was carried out, including miR156 and <i>athTAS3a</i> 5′D8(+). Meanwhile, through de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>gning corresponding artificial miRNAs, this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> could also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>gnificantly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>lence targeted endogenous genes and show specific phenotypes, including <i>PDS</i>, <i>Su</i>, and <i>PCNA</i>. These results demonstrated that this small RNA overexpres<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> could contribute to investigating not only the function of endogenous small RNAs, but also the functional genes in plants.</p>

Measuring gill paracellular permeability with polyethylene glycol-4000 in freely swimming trout: proof of principle
<p>The influence of swimming activity on gill paracellular permeability has not been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed previously in fishes. We critically assessed the use of tritium-labeled polyethylene glycol ([<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000) for this purpose, a substance that is also a clas<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>c marker for extracellular fluid volume, glomerular filtration rate and drinking rate. Tests (8 h) on resting freshwater trout showed that when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ing [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance from the plasma in the efflux direction, correction for a large excretion via glomerular filtration was essential, neces<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>tating urinary catheterization. When <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ing [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance from the water in the influx direction, correction for a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>gnificant uptake by drinking was essential, neces<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>tating terminal gut removal, whereas glomerular filtration losses were minimal. After correction for these alternate routes of loss and uptake, [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance rates by efflux from the plasma and by influx from the water were identical, showing that gill paracellular permeability is not rectified, and can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed in either direction. The influx technique with terminal gut removal was used to assess gill paracellular permeability in trout without urinary catheters freely swimming at 1.2 body lengths s<sup>−1</sup> for 8 h. Branchial [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance rate (by influx from the water) increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>gnificantly by ~80% in accord with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>milar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed increase in O<sub>2</sub> consumption rate. Thus in trout, gill paracellular permeability does increase during exercise, in accord with the traditional concept of the osmorespiratory compromise.</p>

Atom-by-atom assembly of defect-free one-dimensional cold atom arrays
<p>The realization of large-scale fully controllable quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s is an exciting frontier in modern phy<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>cal science. We use atom-by-atom assembly to implement a platform for the deterministic preparation of regular one-dimen<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>onal arrays of individually controlled cold atoms. In our approach, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement and feedback procedure eliminates the entropy associated with probabilistic trap occupation and results in defect-free arrays of more than 50 atoms in less than 400 milliseconds. The technique is based on fast, real-time control of 100 optical tweezers, which we use to arrange atoms in de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>red geo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metric</span></strong> patterns and to maintain these configurations by replacing lost atoms with surplus atoms from a reservoir.

Ultrafast many-body interferometry of impurities coupled to a Fermi sea

An Efficient System for <i>Ds</i> Transposon Tagging in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>
<p>Transposon tagging is a powerful tool that has been widely applied in several species for insertional mutagene<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>s in plants. Several efforts have aimed to create transfer-DNA (T-DNA) insertional mutant populations in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>, a monocot plant used as a model <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> to study temperate cereals, but there has been a lack of research aimed at u<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>ng transposon strategies. Here, we describe the application of a maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) <i>Dissociation</i> (<i>Ds</i>) transposon tagging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> in <i>B</i>. <i>distachyon</i>. The <i>35S</i>::<i>AcTPase</i> cassette and <i>Ds</i> element were constructed within the same T-DNA and transformed into <i>B</i>. <i>distachyon</i> plants. The <i>Ds</i> element was readily transposed to other chromosomes or to the same chromosome under the function of <i>Activator</i> (<i>Ac</i>) transposase. Through homologous chromosome synap<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>s, recombination, and segregation, the <i>Ds</i> element separated from the <i>Ac</i> element. We selected stable <i>Ds</i>-only plants u<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>ng G418 and GFP assays and analyzed 241 T<sub>0</sub> lines, some of which were highly efficient at producing <i>Ds</i>-only progeny. Through thermal asym<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metric</span></strong> interlaced PCR, we isolated 710 independent <i>Ds</i> flanking sequences from <i>Ds</i>-only plants. Furthermore, we identified a large collection of mutants with vi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>ble developmental phenotypes via this transposon tagging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> is relatively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>mple and rapid in comparison to traditional T-DNA insertion strategies, because once efficiency lines are obtained they can be reused to generate more lines from nontransposed plants without the use of time-consuming tissue culture steps.</p>

Split-TALE: A TALE-Based Two-Component System for Synthetic Biology Applications in Planta
<p>Transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) are bacterial Type-III effector proteins from phytopathogenic <i>Xanthomonas</i> species that act as transcription factors in plants. The modular DNA-binding domain of TALEs can be reprogrammed to target nearly any DNA sequence. Here, we de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>gned and optimized a two-component AND-gate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> for synthetic circuits in plants based on TALEs. In this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, named split-TALE (sTALE), the TALE DNA binding domain and the transcription activation domain are separated and each fused to protein interacting domains. Phy<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>cal interaction of interacting domains leads to TALE-reconstitution and can be monitored by reporter gene induction. This setup was used for optimization of the sTALE scaffolds, which result in an AND-gate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> with an improved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>gnal-to-noise ratio. We also provide a toolkit of ready-to-use vectors and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>ngle modules compatible with Golden Gate cloning and MoClo syntax. In addition to its implementation in synthetic regulatory circuits, the sTALE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> allows the analy<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">si</span></strong>s of protein-protein interactions in planta.</p>

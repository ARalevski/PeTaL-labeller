Hedgehog reciprocally controls trafficking of Smo and Ptc through the Smurf family of E3 ubiquitin ligases
<p>Hedgehog (Hh) induces signaling by promoting the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reciproc</span></strong>al trafficking of its receptor Patched (Ptc) and the signal transducer Smoothened (Smo), which is inhibited by Ptc, at the cell surface. We identified Smurf family E3 ubiquitin ligases as essential for Smo ubiquitylation and cell surface clearance and demonstrated that Smurf family members mediate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reciproc</span></strong>al trafficking of Ptc and Smo in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. G protein–coupled receptor kinase 2 (Gprk2)–mediated phosphorylation of Smurf promoted Smo ubiquitylation by increasing the recruitment of Smurf to Smo, whereas protein kinase A (PKA)–mediated phosphorylation of Smo caused Smurf to dissociate from Smo, thereby inhibiting Smo ubiquitylation. Smo and Ptc competed for the same pool of Smurf family E3 ubiquitin ligases, and Hh promoted Ptc ubiquitylation and degradation by disrupting the association of Smurf family E3 ubiquitin ligases with Smo and stimulating their binding to Ptc. Our study identifies the E3 ubiquitin ligases that target Smo and provides insight into how Hh regulates the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reciproc</span></strong>al trafficking of its receptor and signal transducer.</p>

Breaking Lorentz reciprocity to overcome the time-bandwidth limit in physics and engineering
<p>A century-old tenet in physics and engineering asserts that any type of system, having bandwidth Δω, can interact with a wave over only a constrained time period Δ<i>t</i> inversely proportional to the bandwidth (Δ<i>t</i>·Δω ~ 2π). This law severely limits the generic capabilities of all types of resonant and wave-guiding systems in photonics, cavity quantum electrodynamics and optomechanics, acoustics, continuum mechanics, and atomic and optical physics but is thought to be completely fundamental, arising from basic Fourier <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reciproc</span></strong>ity. We propose that this “fundamental” limit can be overcome in systems where Lorentz <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reciproc</span></strong>ity is broken. As a system becomes more asymmetric in its transport properties, the degree to which the limit can be surpassed becomes greater. By way of example, we theoretically demonstrate how, in an astutely designed magnetized semiconductor heterostructure, the above limit can be exceeded by orders of magnitude by using realistic material parameters. Our findings revise prevailing paradigms for linear, time-invariant resonant systems, challenging the doctrine that high-quality resonances must invariably be narrowband and providing the possibility of developing devices with unprecedentedly high time-bandwidth performance.</p>

The Accumulation of miRNAs Differentially Modulated by Drought Stress Is Affected by Grafting in Grapevine
<p>Grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) is routinely grafted, and rootstocks inducing drought tolerance represent a source for adapting vineyards to climate change in temperate areas. Our goal was to investigate drought stress effects on microRNA (miRNA) abundance in a drought-resistant grapevine rootstock, M4 (<i>Vitis vinifera</i> × <i>Vitis berlandieri</i>), compared with a commercial cultivar, Cabernet Sauvignon, using their autografts and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reciproc</span></strong>al grafts. RNA extracted from roots and leaves of droughted and irrigated plants of different graft combinations was used to prepare cDNA libraries for small RNA sequencing and to analyze miRNAs by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Measurements of leaf water potential, leaf gas exchange, and root hydraulic conductance attested that, under irrigation, M4 reduced water loss in comparison with cultivar Cabernet Sauvignon mostly through nonhydraulic, root-specific mechanisms. Under drought, stomatal conductance decreased at similar levels in the two genotypes. Small RNA sequencing allowed the identification of 70 conserved miRNAs and the prediction of 28 novel miRNAs. Different accumulation trends of miRNAs, observed upon drought and in different genotypes and organs, were confirmed by RT-qPCR. Corresponding target transcripts, predicted in silico and validated by RT-qPCR, often showed opposite expression profiles than the related miRNAs. Drought effects on miRNA abundance differed between the two genotypes. Furthermore, the concentration of drought-responsive miRNAs in each genotype was affected by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reciproc</span></strong>al grafting, suggesting either the movement of signals inducing miRNA expression in the graft partner or, possibly, miRNA transport between scion and rootstock. These results open new perspectives in the selection of rootstocks for improving grapevine adaptation to drought.</p>

Stability of Single-Parent Gene Expression Complementation in Maize Hybrids upon Water Deficit Stress
<p>Heterosis is the superior performance of F1 hybrids compared with their homozygous, genetically distinct parents. In this study, we monitored the transcriptomic divergence of the maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) inbred lines B73 and Mo17 and their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reciproc</span></strong>al F1 hybrid progeny in primary roots under control and water deficit conditions simulated by polyethylene glycol treatment. Single-parent expression (SPE) of genes is an extreme instance of gene expression complementation, in which genes are active in only one of two parents but are expressed in both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reciproc</span></strong>al hybrids. In this study, 1,997 genes only expressed in B73 and 2,024 genes only expressed in Mo17 displayed SPE complementation under control and water deficit conditions. As a consequence, the number of active genes in hybrids exceeded the number of active genes in the parental inbred lines significantly independent of treatment. SPE patterns were substantially more stable to expression changes by water deficit treatment than other genotype-specific expression profiles. While, on average, 75% of all SPE patterns were not altered in response to polyethylene glycol treatment, only 17% of the remaining genotype-specific expression patterns were not changed by water deficit. Nonsyntenic genes that lack syntenic orthologs in other grass species, and thus evolved late in the grass lineage, were significantly overrepresented among SPE genes. Hence, the significant overrepresentation of nonsyntenic genes among SPE patterns and their stability under water limitation might suggest a function of these genes during the early developmental manifestation of heterosis under fluctuating environmental conditions in hybrid progeny of the inbred lines B73 and Mo17.</p>

“Disruptor” residues in the regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) R12 subfamily attenuate the inactivation of Gα subunits
<p>Understanding the molecular basis of interaction specificity between RGS (regulator of G protein signaling) proteins and heterotrimeric (αβγ) G proteins would enable the manipulation of RGS-G protein interactions, explore their functions, and effectively target them therapeutically. RGS proteins are classified into four subfamilies (R4, R7, RZ, and R12) and function as negative regulators of G protein signaling by inactivating Gα subunits. We found that the R12 subfamily members RGS10 and RGS14 had lower activity than most R4 subfamily members toward the G<sub>i</sub> subfamily member Gα<sub>o</sub>. Using structure-based energy calculations with multiple Gα-RGS complexes, we identified R12-specific residues in positions that are predicted to determine the divergent activity of this subfamily. This analysis predicted that these residues, which we call “disruptor residues,” interact with the Gα helical domain. We engineered the R12 disruptor residues into the RGS domains of the high-activity R4 subfamily and found that these altered proteins exhibited reduced activity toward Gα<sub>o</sub>. Reciprocally, replacing the putative disruptor residues in RGS18 (a member of the R4 subfamily that exhibited low activity toward Gα<sub>o</sub>) with the corresponding residues from a high-activity R4 subfamily RGS protein increased its activity toward Gα<sub>o</sub>. Furthermore, the high activity of the R4 subfamily toward Gα<sub>o</sub> was independent of the residues in the homologous positions to the R12 subfamily and RGS18 disruptor residues. Thus, our results suggest that the identified RGS disruptor residues function as negative design elements that attenuate RGS activity for specific Gα proteins.</p>

The depalmitoylase APT1 directs the asymmetric partitioning of Notch and Wnt signaling during cell division
<p>Asymmetric cell division results in two distinctly fated daughter cells. A molecular hallmark of asymmetric division is the unequal partitioning of cell fate determinants. We have previously established that growth factor signaling promotes protein depalmitoylation to foster polarized protein localization, which, in turn, drives migration and metastasis. We report protein palmitoylation as a key mechanism for the asymmetric partitioning of the cell fate determinants Numb and β-catenin through the activity of the depalmitoylating enzyme APT1. Using point mutations, we showed that specific palmitoylated residues on Numb were required for its asymmetric localization. By live-cell imaging, we showed that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reciproc</span></strong>al interactions between APT1 and the Rho family GTPase CDC42 promoted the asymmetric localization of Numb and β-catenin to the plasma membrane. This, in turn, restricted Notch- or Wnt-responsive transcriptional activity to one daughter cell. Moreover, we showed that altering APT1 abundance changed the transcriptional signatures of MDA-MB-231 triple receptor–negative breast cancer cells, similar to changes in Notch and β-catenin–mediated Wnt signaling. We also showed that loss of APT1 depleted a specific subpopulation of tumorigenic cells in colony formation assays. Together, our findings suggest that APT1-mediated depalmitoylation is a major mechanism of asymmetric cell division that maintains Notch- and Wnt-associated protein dynamics, gene expression, and cellular functions.</p>

Relationship of gender differences in preferences to economic development and gender equality

Rearrangement bursts generate canonical gene fusions in bone and soft tissue tumors
<p>Sarcomas are cancers of the bone and soft tissue often defined by gene fusions. Ewing sarcoma involves fusions between <i>EWSR1</i>, a gene encoding an RNA binding protein, and E26 transformation-specific (ETS) transcription factors. We explored how and when <i>EWSR1-ETS</i> fusions arise by studying the whole genomes of Ewing sarcomas. In 52 of 124 (42%) of tumors, the fusion gene arises by a sudden burst of complex, loop-like rearrangements, a process called chromoplexy, rather than by simple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reciproc</span></strong>al translocations. These loops always contained the disease-defining fusion at the center, but they disrupted multiple additional genes. The loops occurred preferentially in early replicating and transcriptionally active genomic regions. Similar loops forming canonical fusions were found in three other sarcoma types. Chromoplexy-generated fusions appear to be associated with an aggressive form of Ewing sarcoma. These loops arise early, giving rise to both primary and relapse Ewing sarcoma tumors, which can continue to evolve in parallel.</p>

The controversial correlates of consciousness
<p>The mechanism of consciousness is one of the most fundamental, exciting, and challenging pursuits in 21st-century science. Although the field of consciousness studies attracts a diverse array of thinkers who posit myriad physical or metaphysical substrates for experience, consciousness must have a neural basis. But where in the brain is conscious experience generated? It would seem that, given this remarkable era of technical and experimental prowess in the neurosciences, we would be homing in on the specific circuits or precise neuronal subpopulations that generate experience. To the contrary, there is still active debate as to whether the neural correlates of consciousness are, in coarse terms, located in the back or the front of the brain (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). On page 537 of this issue, van Vugt <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) provide evidence that the prefrontal cortex is one of the brain regions that mediates visual consciousness. Additionally, Joglekar <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) provide evidence that the prefrontal cortex is important for igniting neural networks that contribute to visual signal processing. Both studies support a model for consciousness that involves distributed and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reciproc</span></strong>al interactions across the cortex.</p>

Nonreciprocal lasing in topological cavities of arbitrary geometries

Structural basis of the day-night transition in a bacterial circadian clock
<p>Circadian clocks are ubiquitous timing systems that induce rhythms of biological activities in synchrony with night and day. In cyanobacteria, timing is generated by a posttranslational clock consisting of KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC proteins and a set of output signaling proteins, SasA and CikA, which transduce this rhythm to control gene expression. Here, we describe crystal and nuclear magnetic resonance structures of KaiB-KaiC,KaiA-KaiB-KaiC, and CikA-KaiB complexes. They reveal how the metamorphic properties of KaiB, a protein that adopts two distinct folds, and the post–adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis state of KaiC create a hub around which nighttime signaling events revolve, including inactivation of KaiA and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reciproc</span></strong>al regulation of the mutually antagonistic signaling proteins, SasA and CikA.</p>

Mechanisms of reef coral resistance to future climate change
<p>Reef corals are highly sensitive to heat, yet populations resistant to climate change have recently been identified. To determine the mechanisms of temperature tolerance, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reciproc</span></strong>ally transplanted corals between reef sites experiencing distinct temperature regimes and tested subsequent physiological and gene expression profiles. Local acclimatization and fixed effects, such as adaptation, contributed about equally to heat tolerance and are reflected in patterns of gene expression. In less than 2 years, acclimatization achieves the same heat tolerance that we would expect from strong natural selection over many generations for these long-lived organisms. Our results show both short-term acclimatory and longer-term adaptive acquisition of climate resistance. Adding these adaptive abilities to ecosystem models is likely to slow predictions of demise for coral reef ecosystems.</p>

OsPHT1;3 Mediates Uptake, Translocation, and Remobilization of Phosphate under Extremely Low Phosphate Regimes
<p>Plant roots rely on inorganic orthophosphate (Pi) transporters to acquire soluble Pi from soil solutions that exists at micromolar levels in natural ecosystems. Here, we functionally characterized a rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) Pi transporter, Os Phosphate Transporter-1;3 (OsPHT1;3), that mediates Pi uptake, translocation, and remobilization. <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>3</i> was directly regulated by Os Phosphate Starvation Response-2 and, in response to Pi starvation, showed enhanced expression in young leaf blades and shoot basal regions and even more so in roots and old leaf blades. OsPHT1;3 was able to complement a yeast mutant strain defective in five Pi transporters and mediate Pi influx in <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes. Overexpression of <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>3</i> led to increased Pi concentration both in roots and shoots. However, unlike that reported for other known OsPHT1 members that facilitate Pi uptake at relatively higher Pi levels, mutation of <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>3</i> impaired Pi uptake and root-to-shoot Pi translocation only when external Pi concentration was below 5 μ<sc>m</sc>. Moreover, in basal nodes, the expression of <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>3</i> was restricted to the phloem of regular vascular bundles and enlarged vascular bundles. An isotope labeling experiment with <sup>32</sup>P showed that <i>ospht1</i>;<i>3</i> mutant lines were impaired in remobilization of Pi from source to sink leaves. Furthermore, overexpression and mutation of <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>3</i> led to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reciproc</span></strong>al alteration in the expression of <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>2</i> and several other <i>OsPHT1</i> genes. Yeast-two-hybrid, bimolecular fluorescence complementation, and coimmunoprecipitation assays all demonstrated a physical interaction between OsPHT1;3 and OsPHT1;2. Taken together, our results indicate that OsPHT1;3 acts as a crucial factor for Pi acquisition, root-to-shoot Pi translocation, and redistribution of phosphorus in plants growing in environments with extremely low Pi levels.</p>

Root Gravitropism Is Regulated by a Crosstalk between <i>para</i>-Aminobenzoic Acid, Ethylene, and Auxin
<p>Plants respond to gravitational force through directional growth along the gravity vector. Although auxin is the central component of the root graviresponse, it works in concert with other plant hormones. Here, we show that the folate precursor <i>para</i>-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) is a key modulator of the auxin-ethylene interplay during root gravitropism in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). In gravistimulated roots, PABA promotes an asymmetric auxin response, which causes the asymmetric growth responsible for root curvature. This activity requires the auxin response transcription factors AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR7 (ARF7) and ARF19 as well as ethylene biosynthesis and signaling, indicating that PABA activity requires both auxin and ethylene pathways. Similar to ethylene, exogenous PABA reverses the agravitropic root growth of the auxin transport mutant <i>pin-formed2</i> (<i>pin2</i>) and the auxin biosynthetic double mutant with loss of function of <i>weak ethylene insensitive</i> (<i>wei</i>) genes, <i>wei8wei2</i>, but not the <i>pin2wei8wei2</i> triple mutant. This finding suggests that PABA regulates the ethylene-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reciproc</span></strong>al compensation between auxin transport and biosynthesis. Furthermore, manipulation of endogenous free PABA levels by modulating the expression of the gene encoding its glucosylation enzyme, UDP-GLYCOSYL TRANSFERASE75B1, impacts the root graviresponse, suggesting that endogenous free PABA levels may play a crucial role in modulating the auxin-ethylene cross talk necessary for root gravitropism.</p>

Revised Phylogeny of the <i>Cellulose Synthase</i> Gene Superfamily: Insights into Cell Wall Evolution
<p>Cell walls are crucial for the integrity and function of all land plants and are of central importance in human health, livestock production, and as a source of renewable bioenergy. Many enzymes that mediate the biosynthesis of cell wall polysaccharides are encoded by members of the large <i>cellulose synthase</i> (<i>CesA</i>) gene superfamily. Here, we analyzed 29 sequenced genomes and 17 transcriptomes to revise the phylogeny of the <i>CesA</i> gene superfamily in angiosperms. Our results identify ancestral gene clusters that predate the monocot-eudicot divergence and reveal several novel evolutionary observations, including the expansion of the Poaceae-specific cellulose synthase-like <i>CslF</i> family to the graminids and restiids and the characterization of a previously unreported eudicot lineage, <i>CslM</i>, that forms a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reciproc</span></strong>ally monophyletic eudicot-monocot grouping with the <i>CslJ</i> clade. The <i>CslM</i> lineage is widely distributed in eudicots, and the <i>CslJ</i> clade, which was thought previously to be restricted to the Poales, is widely distributed in monocots. Our analyses show that some members of the <i>CslJ</i> lineage, but not the newly identified <i>CslM</i> genes, are capable of directing (1,3;1,4)-β-glucan biosynthesis, which, contrary to current dogma, is not restricted to Poaceae.</p>

Sequence Exchange between Homologous NB-LRR Genes Converts Virus Resistance into Nematode Resistance, and Vice Versa
<p>Plants have evolved a limited repertoire of NB-LRR disease resistance (<i>R</i>) genes to protect themselves against myriad pathogens. This limitation is thought to be counterbalanced by the rapid evolution of NB-LRR proteins, as only a few sequence changes have been shown to be sufficient to alter resistance specificities toward novel strains of a pathogen. However, little is known about the flexibility of NB-LRR <i>R</i> genes to switch resistance specificities between phylogenetically unrelated pathogens. To investigate this, we created domain swaps between the close homologs <i>Gpa2</i> and <i>Rx1</i>, which confer resistance in potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>) to the cyst nematode <i>Globodera pallida</i> and <i>Potato virus X</i>, respectively. The genetic fusion of the CC-NB-ARC of Gpa2 with the LRR of Rx1 (Gpa2<sub>CN</sub>/Rx1<sub>L</sub>) results in autoactivity, but lowering the protein levels restored its specific activation response, including extreme resistance to <i>Potato virus X</i> in potato shoots. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reciproc</span></strong>al chimera (Rx1<sub>CN</sub>/Gpa2<sub>L</sub>) shows a loss-of-function phenotype, but exchange of the first three LRRs of Gpa2 by the corresponding region of Rx1 was sufficient to regain a wild-type resistance response to <i>G. pallida</i> in the roots. These data demonstrate that exchanging the recognition moiety in the LRR is sufficient to convert extreme virus resistance in the leaves into mild nematode resistance in the roots, and vice versa. In addition, we show that the CC-NB-ARC can operate independently of the recognition specificities defined by the LRR domain, either aboveground or belowground. These data show the versatility of NB-LRR genes to generate resistance to unrelated pathogens with completely different lifestyles and routes of invasion.</p>

AtAIRP2 E3 Ligase Affects ABA and High-Salinity Responses by Stimulating Its ATP1/SDIRIP1 Substrate Turnover
<p>AtAIRP2 is a cytosolic RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase that positively regulates an abscisic acid (ABA) response in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Yeast two-hybrid screening using AtAIRP2 as bait identified ATP1 (AtAIRP2 Target Protein1) as a substrate of AtAIRP2. ATP1 was found to be identical to SDIRIP1, which was reported recently to be a negative factor in ABA signaling and a target protein of the RING E3 ligase SDIR1. Accordingly, ATP1 was renamed ATP1/SDIRIP1. A specific interaction between AtAIRP2 and ATP1/SDIRIP1 and ubiquitination of ATP1/SDIRIP1 by AtAIRP2 were demonstrated in vitro and in planta. The turnover of ATP1/SDIRIP1 was regulated by AtAIRP2 in cell-free degradation and protoplast cotransfection assays. The ABA-mediated germination assay of <i>35S</i>:<i>ATP1/SDIRIP1-RNAi/atairp2</i> double mutant progeny revealed that ATP1/SDIRIP1 acts downstream of AtAIRP2. AtAIRP2 and SDIR1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reciproc</span></strong>ally complemented the ABA- and salt-insensitive germination phenotypes of <i>sdir1</i> and <i>atairp2</i> mutants, respectively, indicating their combinatory roles in seed germination. Subcellular localization and bimolecular fluorescence complementation experiments in the presence of MG132, a 26S proteasome inhibitor, showed that AtAIRP2 and ATP1/SDIRIP1 were colocalized to the cytosolic spherical body, which lies in close proximity to the nucleus, in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>) leaf cells. The 26S proteasome subunits RPN12a and RPT1 and the molecular chaperones HSP70 and HSP101 were colocalized to these discrete punctae-like structures. These results raised the possibility that AtAIRP2 and ATP1/SDIRIP1 interact in the cytosolic spherical compartment. Collectively, our data suggest that the down-regulation of ATP1/SDIRIP1 by AtAIRP2 and SDIR1 RING E3 ubiquitin ligases is critical for ABA and high-salinity responses during germination in Arabidopsis.</p>

Understanding and Manipulating Meiotic Recombination in Plants
<p>Meiosis is a specialized cell division, essential in most reproducing organisms to halve the number of chromosomes, thereby enabling the restoration of ploidy levels during fertilization. A key step of meiosis is homologous recombination, which promotes homologous pairing and generates crossovers (COs) to connect homologous chromosomes until their separation at anaphase I. These CO sites, seen cytologically as chiasmata, represent a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reciproc</span></strong>al exchange of genetic information between two homologous nonsister chromatids. This gene reshuffling during meiosis has a significant influence on evolution and also plays an essential role in plant breeding, because a successful breeding program depends on the ability to bring the desired combinations of alleles on chromosomes. However, the number and distribution of COs during meiosis is highly constrained. There is at least one CO per chromosome pair to ensure accurate segregation of homologs, but in most organisms, the CO number rarely exceeds three regardless of chromosome size. Moreover, their positions are not random on chromosomes but exhibit regional preference. Thus, genes in recombination-poor regions tend to be inherited together, hindering the generation of novel allelic combinations that could be exploited by breeding programs. Recently, much progress has been made in understanding meiotic recombination. In particular, many genes involved in the process in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) have been identified and analyzed. With the coming challenges of food security and climate change, and our enhanced knowledge of how COs are formed, the interest and needs in manipulating CO formation are greater than ever before. In this review, we focus on advances in understanding meiotic recombination and then summarize the attempts to manipulate CO formation. Last, we pay special attention to the meiotic recombination in polyploidy, which is a common genomic feature for many crop plants.</p>

Brown and Polar Bear Y Chromosomes Reveal Extensive Male-Biased Gene Flow within Brother Lineages
<p>Brown and polar bears have become prominent examples in phylogeography, but previous phylogeographic studies relied largely on maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or were geographically restricted. The male-specific Y chromosome, a natural counterpart to mtDNA, has remained underexplored. Although this paternally inherited chromosome is indispensable for comprehensive analyses of phylogeographic patterns, technical difficulties and low variability have hampered its application in most mammals. We developed 13 novel Y-chromosomal sequence and microsatellite markers from the polar bear genome and screened these in a broad geographic sample of 130 brown and polar bears. We also analyzed a 390-kb-long Y-chromosomal scaffold using sequencing data from published male ursine genomes. Y chromosome evidence support the emerging understanding that brown and polar bears started to diverge no later than the Middle Pleistocene. Contrary to mtDNA patterns, we found 1) brown and polar bears to be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reciproc</span></strong>ally monophyletic sister (or rather brother) lineages, without signals of introgression, 2) male-biased gene flow across continents and on phylogeographic time scales, and 3) male dispersal that links the Alaskan ABC islands population to mainland brown bears. Due to female philopatry, mtDNA provides a highly structured estimate of population differentiation, while male-biased gene flow is a homogenizing force for nuclear genetic variation. Our findings highlight the importance of analyzing both maternally and paternally inherited loci for a comprehensive view of phylogeographic history, and that mtDNA-based phylogeographic studies of many mammals should be reevaluated. Recent advances in sequencing technology render the analysis of Y-chromosomal variation feasible, even in nonmodel organisms.</p>

<p>Haploinsufficiency of <i>SHANK3</i>, caused by chromosomal abnormalities or mutations that disrupt one copy of the gene, leads to a neurodevelopmental syndrome called Phelan-McDermid syndrome, symptoms of which can include absent or delayed speech, intellectual disability, neurological changes and autism spectrum disorders. The SHANK3 protein forms a key structural part of the post-synaptic density. We previously generated and characterized mice with a targeted disruption of <i>Shank3</i> in which exons coding for the ankyrin-repeat domain were deleted and expression of full-length Shank3 was disrupted. We documented specific deficits in synaptic function and plasticity, along with reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reciproc</span></strong>al social interactions, in <i>Shank3</i> heterozygous mice. Changes in phenotype owing to a mutation at a single locus are quite frequently modulated by other loci, most dramatically when the entire genetic background is changed. In mice, each strain of laboratory mouse represents a distinct genetic background and alterations in phenotype owing to gene knockout or transgenesis are frequently different across strains, which can lead to the identification of important modifier loci. We have investigated the effect of genetic background on phenotypes of <i>Shank3</i> heterozygous, knockout and wild-type mice, using C57BL/6, 129SVE and FVB/Ntac strain backgrounds. We focused on observable behaviors with the goal of carrying out subsequent analyses to identify modifier loci. Surprisingly, there were very modest strain effects over a large battery of analyses. These results indicate that behavioral phenotypes associated with <i>Shank3</i> haploinsufficiency are largely strain-independent.</p>

BEND6 is a nuclear antagonist of Notch signaling during self-renewal of neural stem cells
<p>The activity of the Notch pathway revolves around a CSL-class transcription factor, which recruits distinct complexes that activate or repress target gene expression. The co-activator complex is deeply conserved and includes the cleaved Notch intracellular domain (NICD) and Mastermind. By contrast, numerous CSL co-repressor proteins have been identified, and these are mostly different between invertebrate and vertebrate systems. In this study, we demonstrate that mammalian BEND6 is a neural BEN-solo factor that shares many functional attributes with <i>Drosophila</i> Insensitive, a co-repressor for the <i>Drosophila</i> CSL factor. BEND6 binds the mammalian CSL protein CBF1 and antagonizes Notch-dependent target activation. In addition, its association with Notch- and CBF1-regulated enhancers is promoted by CBF1 and antagonized by activated Notch. <i>In utero</i> electroporation experiments showed that ectopic BEND6 inhibited Notch-mediated self-renewal of neocortical neural stem cells and promoted neurogenesis. Conversely, knockdown of BEND6 increased NSC self-renewal in wild-type neocortex, and exhibited genetic interactions with gain and loss of Notch pathway activity. We recapitulated all of these findings in cultured neurospheres, in which overexpression and depletion of BEND6 caused <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reciproc</span></strong>al effects on neural stem cell renewal and neurogenesis. These data reveal a novel mammalian CSL co-repressor in the nervous system, and show that the Notch-inhibitory activity of certain BEN-solo proteins is conserved between flies and mammals.</p>

Moderate excess of pyruvate augments osteoclastogenesis
<p>Cell differentiation leads to adaptive changes in energy metabolism. Conversely, hyperglycemia induces malfunction of many body systems, including bone, suggesting that energy metabolism <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reciproc</span></strong>ally affects cell differentiation. We investigated how the differentiation of bone-resorbing osteoclasts, large polykaryons formed through fusion and growth of cells of monocytic origin, is affected by excess of energy substrate pyruvate and how energy metabolism changes during osteoclast differentiation. Surprisingly, small increases in pyruvate (1–2 mM above basal levels) augmented osteoclastogenesis <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, while larger increases were not effective <i>in vitro</i>. Osteoclast differentiation increased cell mitochondrial activity and ATP levels, which were further augmented in energy-rich conditions. Conversely, the inhibition of respiration significantly reduced osteoclast number and size. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) acts as a metabolic sensor, which is inhibited in energy-rich conditions. We found that osteoclast differentiation was associated with an increase in AMPK levels and a change in AMPK isoform composition. Increased osteoclast size induced by pyruvate (1 mM above basal levels) was prevented in the presence of AMPK activator 5-amino-4-imidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR). In keeping, inhibition of AMPK using dorsomorphin or siRNA to AMPKγ increased osteoclast size in control cultures to the level observed in the presence of pyruvate. Thus, we have found that a moderate excess of pyruvate enhances osteoclastogenesis, and that AMPK acts to tailor osteoclastogenesis to a cell's bioenergetics capacity.</p>

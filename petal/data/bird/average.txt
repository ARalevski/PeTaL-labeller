Defining modes of failure after joint-preserving surgery of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Joint-preserving surgery of the hip (JPSH) has evolved considerably   and now includes a number of procedures, including arthroscopy,   surgical dislocation, and redirectional osteotomies of the femur   and acetabulum. There are a number of different factors which lead   to failure of JPSH. Consequently, it is of interest to assess the   various modes of failure in order to continue to identify best practice   and the indications for these procedures. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Using a retrospective observational study design, we reviewed   1013 patients who had undergone JPSH by a single surgeon between   2005 and 2015. There were 509 men and 504 women with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age   of 39 years (16 to 78). Of the 1013 operations, 783 were arthroscopies,   122 surgical dislocations, and 108 peri-acetabular osteotomies (PAO).   We analysed the overall failure rates and modes of failure. Re-operations   were categorised into four groups: Mode 1 was arthritis progression   or organ failure leading to total hip arthroplasty (THA); Mode 2   was an Incorrect diagnosis/procedure; Mode 3 resulted from malcorrection   of femur (type A), acetabulum (type B), or labrum (type C) and Mode 4   resulted from an unintended consequence of the initial surgical   intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> follow-up of 2.5 years, there had been 104 re-operations   (10.2%) with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> patient age of 35.5 years (17 to 64). There   were 64 Mode 1 failures (6.3%) at a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> of 3.2 years following   JPSH with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> patient age of 46.8 years (18 to 64). There were   17 Mode 2 failures (1.7%) at a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> of 2.2 years post-JPSH with   a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> patient age of 28.9 years (17 to 42) (2% scopes; 1% surgical   dislocations). There were 19 Mode 3 failures (1.9%) at a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> of   2.0 years post-JPSH, with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> patient age of 29.9 years (18 to   51) (2% scopes; 2% surgical dislocations; 5% PAO). There were 4   Mode 4 failures (0.4%) at a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> of 1.8 years post-JPSH with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong>   patient age of 31.5 years (15 to 43). Using the modified Dindo-Clavien   classification system, the overall complication rate among JPSHs   was 4.2%.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>While defining the overall re-operation and complication rates,   it is important to define the safety and effectiveness of JPSH.   Standardisation of the modes of failure may help identify the best   practice. Application of these modes to large clinical series, such   as registries, will assist in further establishing how to improve   the efficacy of JPSH.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:303–9.</p></sec>

Total hip arthroplasty using a monobloc cementless femoral stem for patients with childhood Perthes’ disease
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Modular or custom-made femoral components have been preferred   for total hip arthroplasty (THA) in patients with a history of Perthes’   disease because of the distortion in the anatomy of the proximal   femur. However, it has not been established whether a monobloc cementless   stem will fit the distorted proximal femur or whether the results   of the procedure are satisfactory in this group of patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We reviewed 68 consecutive patients who had undergone THA for   childhood Perthes’ disease between June 2003 and December 2008.   There were 35 men and 33 women with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age of 48 years (16 to   73) at the time of index arthroplasty. Their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> body mass index   was 24.4 (18.3 to 32.9). Of the 68 hips, 32 were classified as Stulberg   class III and 36 as class IV. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> pre-operative shortening   of the affected leg was 17.2 mm (5 to 34). The minimum follow-up   was five years (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> 8.5 years; 5.2 to 10).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>An intra-operative calcar fracture occurred in eight hips (11.8%)   and was successfully treated by cerclage wiring. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> stem version   was 14.6° (-2.3 to 30; standard deviation (<sc>sd</sc>) 7.3). The   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> acetabular component abduction was 40.2° (23.7 to 56.0; <sc>sd</sc> 6.5)   and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> anteversion 28.3° (6.4 to 43.0; <sc>sd</sc> 7.6), respectively.   The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> follow-up was 8.5 years (5.2 to 10). No dislocations occurred   and no hips were revised during the course of the study. At final   follow-up, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> Harris Hip Score was 91 points (59 to 100) and   the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> University of California, Los Angeles activity score was   3.2 (2 to 8).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Monobloc cementless stems reliably restore the anatomy in Perthes’   disease at THA without the need for custom-made or modular implants.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:440–444.</p></sec>

Tree Physiology
Chemical responses to modified lignin composition in tension wood of hybrid poplar (<i>Populus tremula × Populus alba</i>)
<p>The effect of altering the expression level of the <i>F5H</i> gene was investigated in three wood tissues (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">norm</span></strong>al</span></strong>, opposite and tension wood) in 1-year-old hybrid poplar clone 717 (<i>Populus tremula × Populus alba</i> L.), containing the <i>F5H</i> gene under the control of the <i>C4H</i> promoter. Elevated expression of the <i>F5H</i> gene in poplar has been previously reported to increase the percent syringyl content of lignin. The wild-type and three transgenic lines were inclined 45° for 3 months to induce tension wood formation. Tension and opposite wood from inclined trees, along with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">norm</span></strong>al</span></strong> wood from control trees, were analyzed separately for carbohydrates, lignin, cellulose crystallinity and microfibril angle (MFA). In the wild-type poplar, the lignin in tension wood contained a significantly higher percentage of syringyl than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">norm</span></strong>al</span></strong> wood or opposite wood. However, there was no significant difference in the percent syringyl content of the three wood types within each of the transgenic lines. Increasing the <i>F5H</i> gene expression caused an increase in the percent syringyl content and a slight decrease in the total lignin in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">norm</span></strong>al</span></strong> wood. In tension wood, the addition of a gelatinous layer in the fiber walls resulted in a consistently lower percentage of total lignin in the tissue. Acid-soluble lignin was observed to increase by up to 2.3-fold in the transgenic lines. Compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">norm</span></strong>al</span></strong> wood and opposite wood, cell wall crystallinity in tension wood was higher and the MFA was smaller, as expected, with no evidence of an effect from modifying the syringyl monomer ratio. Tension wood in all the lines contained consistently higher total sugar and glucose percentages when compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">norm</span></strong>al</span></strong> wood within the respective lines. However, both sugar and glucose percentages were lower in the tension wood of transgenic lines when compared with the tension wood of wild-type trees. Evaluating the response of trees with altered syringyl content to gravity will improve our understanding of the changes in cell wall chemistry and ultrastructural properties of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">norm</span></strong>al</span></strong>, opposite and tension wood in plants.</p>

Posterior spinal fusion for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis using a convex pedicle screw technique
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We present the results of correcting a double or triple curve   adolescent idiopathic scoliosis using a convex segmental pedicle   screw technique.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We reviewed 191 patients with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age at surgery of 15 years   (11 to 23.3). Pedicle screws were placed at the convexity of each   curve. Concave screws were inserted at one or two cephalad levels   and two caudal levels. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> operating time was 183 minutes (132   to 276) and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> blood loss 0.22% of the total blood volume   (0.08% to 0.4%). Multimodal monitoring remained stable throughout   the operation. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> hospital stay was 6.8 days (5 to 15).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> post-operative follow-up was 5.8 years (2.5 to 9.5).   There were no neurological complications, deep wound infection,   obvious nonunion or need for revision surgery.</p><p>Upper thoracic scoliosis was corrected by a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> 68.2% (38% to   48%, p < 0.001). Main thoracic scoliosis was corrected by a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong>   71% (43.5% to 8.9%, p < 0.001). Lumbar scoliosis was corrected   by a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> 72.3% (41% to 90%, p < 0.001). No patient lost more   than 3° of correction at follow-up. The thoracic kyphosis improved   by 13.1° (-21° to 49°, p < 0.001); the lumbar lordosis remained   unchanged (p = 0.58). Coronal imbalance was corrected by a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong>   98% (0% to 100%, p < 0.001). Sagittal imbalance was corrected   by a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> 96% (20% to 100%, p < 0.001).

Minimally invasive surgery for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to report a retrospective, consecutive   series of patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) who   were treated with posterior minimally invasive surgery (MIS) with   a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> follow-up of two years (<sc>sd</sc> 1.4; 0.9 to 0 3.7). Our   objectives were to measure the correction of the deformity and record   the peri-operative morbidity. Special attention was paid to the   operating time (ORT), estimated blood loss (EBL), length of stay   (LOS) and further complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We prospectively collected the data of 70 consecutive patients   with AIS treated with MIS using three incisions and a muscle-splitting   approach by a single surgeon between June 2013 and February 2016   and these were retrospectively reviewed. There were eight male and   62 female patients with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age of 15 years (<sc>sd</sc> 4.5   ) with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> body mass index of 19.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (<sc>sd</sc> 5.4).   The curves were classified according to Lenke; 40 curves were type   1, 15 were type 2, three were type 3, two were type 4, eight were   type 5 and two were type 6.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> primary Cobb angle was corrected from 58.9° (<sc>sd</sc> 12.6°)   pre-operatively to 17.7° (<sc>sd</sc> 10.2°) post-operatively with   a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> correction of 69% (<sc>sd</sc> 20%, p < 0.001).

Regional and global sea-surface temperatures during the last interglaciation
<p>The last interglaciation (LIG, 129 to 116 thousand years ago) was the most recent time in Earth’s history when global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> sea level was substantially higher than it is at present. However, reconstructions of LIG global temperature remain uncertain, with estimates ranging from no significant difference to nearly 2°C warmer than present-day temperatures. Here we use a network of sea-surface temperature (SST) records to reconstruct spatiotemporal variability in regional and global SSTs during the LIG. Our results indicate that peak LIG global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> annual SSTs were 0.5 ± 0.3°C warmer than the climatological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> from 1870 to 1889 and indistinguishable from the 1995 to 2014 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong>. LIG warming in the extratropical latitudes occurred in response to boreal insolation and the bipolar seesaw, whereas tropical SSTs were slightly cooler than the 1870 to 1889 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> in response to reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> annual insolation.</p>

The analysis of synovial fluid in total knee arthroplasties with flexion instability
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Patients with flexion instability after total knee arthroplasty   (TKA) often present with a recurrent effusion, which may be a haemarthrosis.   While the radiographic factors contributing to flexion instability   have been elucidated, the clinical diagnosis remains challenging.   Our aim, in this study, was to determine the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> white cell count   and differential profile in pre-operative aspirations of synovial   fluid in a consecutive series of patients undergoing revision TKA   for flexion instability.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between 2000 and 2010, 60 patients undergoing aseptic revision   TKA for flexion instability were identified. The results of the   pre-operative aspiration of synovial fluid were available for 53   patients (88%). These patients were 1:2 matched to 106 patients   who underwent aseptic TKA for indications other than flexion instability.   The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age of the patients at revision TKA was 65 years (44 to   82) and 55% were women. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> follow-up was 4.3 years (2 to 10.2).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In the flexion instability group, the median total cell count   was 312 cells/µL (interquartile range (IQR) 104 to 624), with a   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> distribution of 45% macrophages (2% to 90%), 30% lymphocytes   (1% to 69%), 18% neutrophils (0% to 80%), 0.5% eosinophils (0% to   6%) and 7% other cells (0% to 42%; mainly synovial cells). There   was no significant difference in the median total cell count (p   = 0.14) or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> distribution of macrophages (p = 0.42), lymphocytes   (p = 0.38), neutrophils (p = 0.19) and eosinophils (p = 0.89) between   the flexion instability and control groups.

Early performance-based and patient-reported outcomes of a contemporary taper fit bone-conserving short stem femoral component in total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to compare early functional and health   related quality of life outcomes (HRQoL) in patients who have undergone   total hip arthroplasty (THA) using a bone conserving short stem   femoral component and those in whom a conventional length uncemented   component was used. Outcome was assessed using a validated performance   based outcome instrument as well as patient reported outcome measures   (PROMs).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We prospectively analysed 33 patients whose THA involved a contemporary   proximally porous coated tapered short stem femoral component and   53 patients with a standard conventional femoral component, at a   minimum follow-up of two years. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> follow-up was 31.4 months   (24 to 39). Patients with poor proximal femoral bone quality were   excluded. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age of the patients was 66.6 years (59 to 77)   and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> body mass index was 30.2 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (24.1 to   41.0).

Satisfaction, function and repair integrity after arthroscopic <i>versus</i> mini-open rotator cuff repair
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Advances in arthroscopic techniques for rotator cuff repair have   made the mini-open approach less popular. However, the mini-open   approach remains an important technique for repair for many surgeons.   The aims of this study were to compare the integrity of the repair,   the function of the shoulder and satisfaction post-operatively using   these two techniques in patients aged > 50 years.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We identified 22 patients treated with mini-open and 128 patients   treated with arthroscopic rotator cuff repair of July 2007 and June   2011. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> follow-up was two years (1 to 5). Outcome was assessed   using the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) and Simple   Shoulder Test (SST) scores, and satisfaction. The integrity of the repair   was assessed using ultrasonography. A power analysis ensured sufficient   enrolment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was no statistically significant difference between the   age, function, satisfaction, or pain scores (p > 0.05) of the two   groups. The integrity of the repair and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> SST scores were   significantly better in the mini-open group (91% of mini-open repairs   were intact <i>versus</i> 60% of arthroscopic repairs,   p = 0.023; <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> SST score 10.9 (standard deviation (<sc>sd</sc>)   1.3) in the mini-open group; 8.9 (<sc>sd</sc> 3.5) in arthroscopic   group; p = 0.003). The ASES scores were also higher in the mini-open   group (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> ASES score 91.0 (<sc>sd</sc> 10.5) in mini-open group;   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> 82.70 (<sc>sd</sc> 19.8) in the arthroscopic group; p = 0.048).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The integrity of the repair and function of the shoulder were   better after a mini-open repair than after arthroscopic repair of   a rotator cuff tear in these patients.

Quantifying the ‘law of diminishing returns’ in magnetically controlled growing rods
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Magnetically controlled growing rods (MCGRs) allow non-invasive   correction of the spinal deformity in the treatment of early-onset   scoliosis. Conventional growing rod systems (CGRS) need repeated   surgical distractions: these are associated with the effect of the   ‘law of diminishing returns’.</p><p>The primary aim of this study was to quantify this effect in   MCGRs over sequential distractions. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 35 patients with a maximum follow-up of 57 months   were included in the study. There were 17 boys and 18 girls with   a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age of 7.4 years (2 to 14). True Distraction (TD) was determined   by measuring the expansion gap on fluoroscopy. This was compared   with Intended Distraction (ID) and expressed as the ‘T/I’ ratio.   The T/I ratio and the Cobb angle were calculated at several time   points during follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> follow-up was 30 months (6 to 57). There was a significant   decrease in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> T/I ratio over time (convex rod at 3 months   0.81, <sc>sd</sc> 0.58 <i>vs</i> 51 months 0.17, <sc>sd </sc>0.16,    p = 0.0001; concave rod at 3 months 0.93, <sc>sd</sc> 0.67 <i>vs</i> 51   months 0.18, <sc>sd</sc> 0.15, p = 0.0001). A linear decline of   the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> T/I ratios was noted for both convex rods (r<sup>2</sup> =   0.90, p = 0.004) and concave rods (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.81, p = 0.015)   over 51 months. At the 24-month follow-up stage, there was a significant   negative correlation between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> T/I ratio of the concave rod   with weight (r = -0.59, p = 0.01), age (r = -0.59, p = 0.01), and   BMI of the child (r = -0.54,    p = 0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The ‘law of diminishing returns’ is also seen after serial distraction   using MCGR. Compared to previously published data for CGRS, there   is a gradual linear decline rather than a rapid initial decline   in lengthening. In older, heavier children a reduced distraction   ratio in the concave rod of the MCGR device is noted over time.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1658–64.</p></sec>

Clicky hip alone is not a true risk factor for developmental dysplasia of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>A clicky hip is a common referral for clinical and sonographic   screening for developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). There is   controversy regarding whether it represents a true risk factor for   pathological DDH. Therefore a 20-year prospective, longitudinal,   observational study was undertaken to assess the relationship between   the presence of a neonatal clicky hip and pathological DDH.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 362 infants from 1997 to 2016 were referred with clicky   hips to our ‘one-stop’ paediatric hip screening clinic. Hips were   assessed clinically for instability and by ultrasound imaging using   a simplified Graf/Harcke classification. Dislocated or dislocatable   hips were classified as Graf Type IV hips.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age at presentation was 13.8 weeks (12.8 to 14.7). In   all 351 out of 362 children (97.0%) had Graf Type I hips (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">norm</span></strong>al</span></strong>)   that required no treatment. Nine children (2.5%) had Graf Type II   hips but all resolved to Graf Type I hips on follow-up scans. One   child (0.3%) had Graf Type III hip dysplasia and one child (0.3%)   had an irreducible hip dislocation. The two pathological hips were   associated with unilateral limited hip abduction. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> referrals increased   from 12.9 to 23.3 each year (p = 0.002) from the first decade of   the study to the second, driven by increasing primary care referrals   (5.5 <i>versus</i> 16.7 per year, p < 0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Most clicky hips required no treatment other than reassurance   to parents. Clicky hips with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">norm</span></strong>al</span></strong> hip examination should be   considered a variant of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">norm</span></strong>al</span></strong> childhood and not a risk factor for   DDH. However, an ab<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">norm</span></strong>al</span></strong> hip examination including unilateral limited   hip abduction should prompt urgent further investigations.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1533–6.</p></sec>

Cemented total hip arthroplasty following acetabular fracture
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To evaluate the outcomes of cemented total hip arthroplasty (THA)   following a fracture of the acetabulum, with evaluation of risk   factors and comparison with a patient group with no history of fracture. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between 1992 and 2016, 49 patients (33 male) with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age of   57 years (25 to 87) underwent cemented THA at a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> of 6.5 years   (0.1 to 25) following acetabular fracture. A total of 38 had undergone   surgical fixation and 11 had been treated non-operatively; 13 patients   died at a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> of 10.2 years after THA (0.6 to 19). Patients were   assessed pre-operatively, at one year and at final follow-up (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong>   9.1 years, 0.5 to 23) using the Oxford Hip Score (OHS). Implant   survivorship was assessed. An age and gender-matched cohort of THAs   performed for non-traumatic osteoarthritis (OA) or avascular necrosis   (AVN) (n = 98) were used to compare complications and patient-reported outcome   measures (PROMs).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> time from fracture to THA was significantly shorter   for patients with AVN    (2.2 years) or protrusio (2.2 years) than those with post-traumatic   OA (9.4 years) or infection (8.0 years) (p = 0.03). Nine contained   and four uncontained defects were managed with autograft (n = 11),   bulk allograft (n = 1), or trabecular metal augment (n = 1). Initial   fracture management (open reduction and internal fixation or non-operative),   timing of THA    (>/< one year), and age (>/< 55 years) had no significant   effect on OHS or ten-year survival. Six THAs were revised at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong>   of 12 years (5 to 23) with ten-year all-cause survival of 92% (95%   confidence interval 80.8 to 100). THA complication rates (all complications,   heterotopic ossification, leg length discrepancy > 10 mm) were significantly higher   following acetabular fracture compared with atraumatic OA/AVN and   OHSs were inferior: one-year OHS    (35.7 v<i>ersus</i> 40.2, p = 0.026); and final follow-up   OHS (33.6 v<i>ersus</i> 40.9, p = 0.008). </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion </title><p>Cemented THA is a reasonable option for the sequelae of acetabular   fracture.

Tuberculosis of the spine with severe angular kyphosis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To address the natural history of severe post-tuberculous (TB)   kyphosis, with focus upon the long-term neurological outcome, occurrence   of restrictive lung disease, and the effect on life expectancy. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This is a retrospective clinical review of prospectively collected   imaging data based at a single institute. A total of 24 patients   of Southern Chinese origin who presented with spinal TB with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong>   of 113° of kyphosis (65° to 159°) who fulfilled inclusion criteria   were reviewed. Plain radiographs were used to assess the degree   of spinal deformity. Myelography, CT and MRI were used when available   to assess the integrity of the spinal cord and canal. Patient demographics,   age of onset of spinal TB and interventions, types of surgical procedure,   intra- and post-operative complications, and neurological status   were assessed. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>All except one of the 24 patients were treated with anti-TB chemotherapy   when they were first diagnosed with spinal TB. They subsequently   received surgery either for neurological deterioration, or deformity   correction in later life. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> follow-up was 34 years (11 to   59) since these surgical interventions. Some 16 patients (66.7%) suffered   from late neurological deterioration at a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> of 26 years (8 to   49) after the initial drug treatment. The causes of neurological   deterioration were healed disease in nine patients (56.2%),    re-activation in six patients (37.5%) and adjacent level spinal   stenosis in one patient (6.3%). The result of surgery was worse   in healed disease. Eight patients without neurological deterioration   received surgery to correct the kyphosis. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> correction ranged   from 97° to 72°. Three patients who were clinically quiescent with   no neurological deterioration were found to have active TB of the   spine. Solid fusion was achieved in all cases and no patient suffered   from neurological deterioration after 42 years of follow-up. On   final follow-up, six patients were noted to have deceased (age range:   47 years to 75 years).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study presents one of the longest assessments of spinal TB   with severe kyphosis. Severe post-TB kyphosis may lead to significant   health problems many years following the initial drug treatment.   Early surgical correction of the kyphosis, solid fusion and regular   surveillance may avoid late complications. Paraplegia, restrictive   lung disease and early onset kyphosis might relate to early death.

What is the morbidity of a non-invasive growing prosthesis?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Extendible endoprostheses have been available for more than 30   years and have become more sophisticated with time. The latest generation   is ‘non-invasive’ and can be lengthened with an external magnetic   force. Early results have shown a worryingly high rate of complications   such as infection. This study investigates the incidence of complications   and the need for further surgery in a cohort of patients with a   non-invasive growing endoprosthesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between 2003 and June 2014, 50 children (51 prostheses) had a   non-invasive growing prosthesis implanted for a primary bone sarcoma.   The minimum follow-up was 24 months for those who survived. Their   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age was 10.4 years (6 to 14). The incidence of complications   and further surgery was documented.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> follow-up was 64 months (20 to 145). The overall survivorship   of the patients was 84% at three years and 70% at five years. Revision-free   survival was 81.7% at three years and 61.6% at five years with competing   risk analysis. Deep infection occurred in 19.6% of implants at a   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> of 12.5 months (0 to 55). Other complications were a failure   of the lengthening mechanism in five prostheses (9.8%) and breakage   of the implant in two (3.9%). Overall, there were 53 additional   operations (0 to 5 per patient). A total of seven patients (14%)   underwent amputation, three for local recurrence and four for infection.   Their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> limb length discrepancy was 4.3 mm (0 to 25) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> Musculoskeletal   Tumor Society Score functional score was 26.5 (18 to 30) at the   final follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>When compared with previously published early results, this mid-term   series has shown continued good functional outcomes and compensation   for leg-length discrepancy.

Post-operative outcomes of atypical femoral subtrochanteric fracture in patients on bisphosphonate therapy
<p>Management of bisphosphonate-associated subtrochanteric   fractures remains opinion- or consensus-based. There are limited   data regarding the outcomes of this fracture.</p><p>We retrospectively reviewed 33 consecutive female patients with   a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age of 67.5 years (47 to 91) who were treated surgically   between May 2004 and October 2009. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> follow-up was 21.7 months   (0 to 53).

Clinical outcomes following re-admission for non-infectious wound complications after primary total knee replacement
<p>Haematomas, drainage, and other non-infectious   wound complications following total knee replacement (TKR) have   been associated with long-term sequelae, in particular, deep infection.   However, the impact of these wound complications on clinical outcome   is unknown. This study compares results in 15 patients re-admitted   for wound complications within 90 days of TKR to 30 matched patients   who underwent uncomplicated total knee replacements. Patients with   wound complications had a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age of 66 years (49 to 83) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong>   body mass index (BMI) of 37 (21 to 54), both similar to that of   patients without complications (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age 65 years and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> BMI 35). Those   with complications had lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> Knee Society function scores (46   (0 to 100 <i>vs</i> 66 (20 to 100), p = 0.047) and a higher   incidence of mild or greater pain (73% <i>vs</i> 33%,   p = 0.01) after two years compared with the non re-admitted group.   Expectations in patients with wound complications following TKR   should be tempered, even in those who do not develop an infection.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014;96-B:619–21.</p>

<i>In vivo</i> three-dimensional kinematics of normal knees during different high-flexion activities
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>In Asia and the Middle-East, people often flex their knees deeply   in order to perform activities of daily living. The purpose of this   study was to investigate the 3D kinematics of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">norm</span></strong>al</span></strong> knees during   high-flexion activities. Our hypothesis was that the femorotibial   rotation, varus-valgus angle, translations, and kinematic pathway   of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">norm</span></strong>al</span></strong> knees during high-flexion activities, varied according   to activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We investigated the <i>in vivo</i> kinematics of eight   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">norm</span></strong>al</span></strong> knees in four male volunteers (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age 41.8 years; 37 to   53) using 2D and 3D registration technique, and modelled the knees   with a computer aided design program. Each subject squatted, kneeled,   and sat cross-legged. We evaluated the femoral rotation and varus-valgus   angle relative to the tibia and anteroposterior translation of the   medial and lateral side, using the transepicodylar axis as our femoral   reference relative to the perpendicular projection on to the tibial   plateau. This method evaluates the femur medially from what has   elsewhere been described as the extension facet centre, and differs   from the method classically applied. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>During squatting and kneeling, the knees displayed femoral external   rotation. When sitting cross-legged, femurs displayed internal rotation   from 10° to 100°. From 100°, femoral external rotation was observed.   No significant difference in varus-valgus angle was seen between   squatting and kneeling, whereas a varus position was observed from   140° when sitting cross-legged. The measure kinematic pathway using   our methodology found during squatting a medial pivoting pattern   from 0° to 40° and bicondylar rollback from 40° to 150°. During   kneeling, a medial pivot pattern was evident. When sitting cross-legged,   a lateral pivot pattern was seen from 0° to 100°, and a medial pivot   pattern beyond 100°.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The kinematics of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">norm</span></strong>al</span></strong> knees during high flexion are variable   according to activity. Nevertheless, our study was limited to a   small number of male patients using a different technique to report   the kinematics than previous publications. Accordingly, caution   should be observed in generalizing our findings.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:50–5.</p></sec>

Mid-term results of lateral unicondylar mobile bearing knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this independent multicentre study was to assess the   mid-term results of mobile bearing unicondylar knee arthroplasty   (UKA) for isolated lateral osteoarthritis of the knee joint.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We retrospectively evaluated 363 consecutive, lateral UKAs (346   patients) performed using the Oxford domed lateral prosthesis undertaken   in three high-volume knee arthroplasty centres between 2006 and   2014. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age of the patients at surgery was 65 years (36 to 88)   with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> final follow-up of 37 months (12 to 93)</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 36 (10.5%) patients underwent revision surgery, giving   a survival rate of 90.1% at three years (95% confidence intervals   (CI) 86.1 to 93.1; number at risk: 155) and 85.0% at five years   (95% CI 77.9 to 89.9; number at risk: 43).

Prognostic Value of Coronary Artery Calcium in the PROMISE Study (Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is an established predictor of future major adverse atherosclerotic cardiovascular events in asymptomatic individuals. However, limited data exist as to how CAC compares with functional testing (FT) in estimating prognosis in symptomatic patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In the PROMISE trial (Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain), patients with stable chest pain (or dyspnea) and intermediate pretest probability for obstructive coronary artery disease were randomized to FT (exercise electrocardiography, nuclear stress, or stress echocardiography) or anatomic testing. We evaluated those who underwent CAC testing as part of the anatomic evaluation (n=4209) and compared that with results of FT (n=4602). We stratified CAC and FT results as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">norm</span></strong>al</span></strong> or mildly, moderately, or severely ab<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">norm</span></strong>al</span></strong> (for CAC: 0, 1–99 Agatston score [AS], 100–400 AS, and >400 AS, respectively; for FT: <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">norm</span></strong>al</span></strong>, mild=late positive treadmill, moderate=early positive treadmill or single-vessel ischemia, and severe=large ischemic region ab<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">norm</span></strong>al</span></strong>ity). The primary end point was all-cause death, myocardial infarction, or unstable angina hospitalization over a median follow-up of 26.1 months.

How “you” makes meaning
<p>“You” is one of the most common words in the English language. Although it typically refers to the person addressed (“How are you?”), “you” is also used to make timeless statements about people in general (“You win some, you lose some.”). Here, we demonstrate that this ubiquitous but understudied linguistic device, known as “generic-you,” has important implications for how people derive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong>ing from experience. Across six experiments, we found that generic-you is used to express <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">norm</span></strong>s in both ordinary and emotional contexts and that producing generic-you when reflecting on negative experiences allows people to “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">norm</span></strong>al</span></strong>ize” their experience by extending it beyond the self. In this way, a simple linguistic device serves a powerful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong>ing-making function.</p>

The medium- and long-term outcome of total shoulder arthroplasty for primary glenohumeral osteoarthritis in middle-aged patients
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Promising medium-term results from total shoulder arthroplasty   (TSA) have been reported for the treatment of primary osteoarthritis   in young and middle-aged patients. The aim of this study was to   evaluate the long-term functional and radiological outcome of TSA   in the middle-aged patient.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The data of all patients from the previous medium-term study   were available. At a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> follow-up of 13 years (8 to 17), we reviewed   21 patients (12 men, nine women, 21 shoulders) with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age of   55 years (37 to 60). The Constant-Murley score (CS) with its subgroups   and subjective satisfaction were measured. Radiological signs of implant   loosening were analysed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Two shoulders (two patients) were revised and in two shoulders   of two different patients, revision surgery was recommended. The   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> CS increased from 23.3 (10 to 45) pre-operatively to 56.5 (26   to 81; p < 0.0001), but with a decrease in CS from 62.8 (38 to   93) to 56.5 (26 to 81) between medium- and long-term follow-up (p   = 0.01). Without revision surgery, 18 patients (95%) rated their   result as good or very good.</p><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> radiolucent line score for the glenoid components increased   from 1.8 (0 to 6) to 8.2 (2 to 18) between medium- and long-term   follow-up (p < 0.001). </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>TSA in young and middle-aged patients leads to improvement in   clinical function and a relatively high satisfaction rate.

Long-term survival and risk factors for failure of the native hip joint after operatively treated displaced acetabular fractures
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Our aim in this study was to describe the long-term survival   of the native hip joint after open reduction and internal fixation   of a displaced fracture of the acetabulum. We also present long-term   clinical outcomes and risk factors associated with a poor outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 285 patients underwent surgery for a displaced acetabular   fracture between 1993 and 2005. For the survival analysis 253 were   included, there were 197 men and 56 women with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age of 42   years (12 to 78). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> follow-up of 11 years (1 to 20) was identified   from our pelvic fracture registry. There were 99 elementary and 154   associated fracture types. For the long-term clinical follow-up,   192 patients with complete data were included. Their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age was   40 years (13 to 78) with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> follow-up of 12 years (5 to 20).

Functional outcome of debridement, antibiotics and implant retention in periprosthetic joint infection involving the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Advocates of debridement, antibiotics and implant retention (DAIR)   in hip periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) argue that a procedure   not disturbing a sound prosthesis-bone interface is likely to lead   to better survival and functional outcome compared with revision.   This case-control study aims were to compare outcome of DAIRs for   infected primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) with outcomes following   primary THA and two-stage revision of infected primary THAs.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We retrospectively reviewed all DAIRs, performed for confirmed   infected primary hip arthropasty (n = 82) at out institution, between   1997 and 2013. Data recorded included full patient information and   type of surgery. Outcome measures included complications, mortality,   implant survivorship and functional outcome. Outcome was compared with   two control groups matched for gender and age; a cohort of primary   THAs (n = 120) and a cohort of two-stage revisions for infection   (n = 66).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age at DAIR was 69 years (33 to 87) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> follow-up was   eight years (2 to 17; standard deviation (<sc>sd)</sc> 5). A total   of 52 (63%) of DAIRs were for early PJI (less than six weeks). Greater   success in the eradication of infection with DAIR was identified   with early PJI, comprising an interval less than a week between   onset of symptoms and exchange of modular components with the DAIR   procedure. Eradication of infection, complications and re-operation   rates were similar in the DAIR and two-stage revision groups. For   hips with successful eradication of infection with DAIR, the five-year   survival (98%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 94 to 100) was similar   to the primary THA group (98%; 95% CI 95 to 100) (n = 43; p = 0.3).   The DAIR group had inferior <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> Oxford Hip Scores (OHS) (38; 12   to 48) compared with the primary THA group (42; 15 to 48) (p = 0.02)   but a significantly better <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> OHS compared with the two-stage   revision group (31; 0 to 48) (p = 0.008). Patients who required   only one DAIR for eradication of infection had a similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> OHS   (41; 20 to 48) to the primary THA group (p = 0.2).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The DAIR procedure is associated with a similar complication   rate and ability to eradicate infection as two-stage revision. This   study emphasises the need for exchange of modular components for   improved chances of eradication of infection.

Management of massive acetabular bone defects in revision arthroplasty of the hip using a reconstruction cage and porous metal augment
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>It may not be possible to undertake revision total hip arthroplasty   (THA) in the presence of massive loss of acetabular bone stock using   standard cementless hemispherical acetabular components and metal   augments, as satisfactory stability cannot always be achieved. We   aimed to study the outcome using a reconstruction cage and a porous   metal augment in these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 22 acetabular revisions in 19 patients were performed   using a combination of a reconstruction cage and porous metal augments.   The augments were used in place of structural allografts. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong>   age of the patients at the time of surgery was 70 years (27 to 85)   and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> follow-up was 39 months (27 to 58). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> number   of previous THAs was 1.9 (1 to 3). All patients had segmental defects   involving more than 50% of the acetabulum and seven hips had an   associated pelvic discontinuity. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Three failures were observed in two hips, both of which had undergone   a previous resection of a tumour affecting the acetabulum.

Hip revision arthroplasty for failed osteosynthesis in periprosthetic Vancouver type B1 fractures using a cementless, modular, tapered revision stem
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To evaluate the hypothesis that failed osteosynthesis of periprosthetic   Vancouver type B1 fractures can be treated successfully with stem   revision using a transfemoral approach and a cementless, modular,   tapered revision stem with reproducible rates of fracture healing,   stability of the revision stem, and clinically good results.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 14 patients (11 women, three men) with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age   of 72.4 years (65 to 90) undergoing revision hip arthroplasty after   failed osteosynthesis of periprosthetic fractures of Vancouver type   B1 were treated using a transfemoral approach to remove the well-fixed   stem before insertion of a modular, fluted titanium stem which obtained   distal fixation.

Minimally invasive periacetabular osteotomy using a modified Smith-Petersen approach
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Periacetabular osteotomy is an effective way of treating symptomatic   hip dysplasia. We describe a new minimally invasive technique using   a modification of the Smith-Peterson approach.</p><p>We performed a prospective, longitudinal cohort study to assess   for any compromise in acetabular correction when using this approach,   and to see if the procedure would have a higher complication rate   than that quoted in the literature for other approaches. We also   assessed for any improvement in functional outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>From 168 consecutive patients (189 hips) who underwent acetabular   correction between March 2010 and March 2013 we excluded those who   had undergone previous pelvic surgery for DDH and those being treated   for acetabular retroversion. The remaining 151 patients (15 men,   136 women) (166 hips) had a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age of 32 years (15 to 56) and the   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> duration of follow-up was 2.8 years (1.2 to 4.5). In all 90%   of cases were Tönnis grade 0 or 1. Functional outcomes were assessed   using the Non Arthritic Hip Score (NAHS), University of California,   Los Angeles (UCLA) and Tegner activity scores.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> pre-operative lateral centre-edge angle was 14.2° (-5°   to 30°) and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> acetabular index was 18.4° (4° to 40°). Post-operatively   these were 31° (18° to 46°) and 3° (-7° to 29°), respectively, a   significant improvement in both (p < 0.001). Allogenic blood   transfusion was required in two patients (1.2%). There were no major   nerve or vascular complications, and no wound infections. At the   time of last follow-up, we noted a significant improvement in functional   outcome scores: UCLA improved by 2.31 points, Tegner improved by   1.08 points, and the NAHS improved by 25.4 points (p < 0.001   for each). Hypermobility and longer duration of surgery were significant   negative predictors for a good post-operative UCLA score, while   residual retroversion was a positive predictor of post-operative   UCLA score.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have found this approach to be safe and effective, facilitating   early recovery from surgery.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:22–8.</p></sec>

Minimising aseptic loosening in extreme bone resections
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Following the resection of an extensive amount of bone in the   treatment of a tumour, the residual segment may be insufficient   to accept a standard length intramedullary cemented stem. Short-stemmed   endoprostheses conceivably have an increased risk of aseptic loosening.   Extra-cortical plates have been added to minimise this risk by supplementing   fixation. The aim of this study was to investigate the survivorship   of short-stemmed endoprostheses and extra-cortical plates.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The study involved 37 patients who underwent limb salvage surgery   for a primary neoplasm of bone between 1998 and 2013. Endoprosthetic   replacement involved the proximal humerus in nine, the proximal   femur in nine, the distal femur in 13 and the proximal tibia in   six patients. There were 12 primary (32%) and 25 revision procedures (68%).   Implant survivorship was compared with matched controls. The amount   of bone that was resected was > 70% of its length and statistically   greater than the standard control group at each anatomical site.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> follow-up was seven years (one to 17). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> length   of the stem was 33 mm (20 to 60) in the humerus and 79 mm (34 to   100) in the lower limb. Kaplan-Meier analysis of survival of the   implant according to anatomical site confirmed that there was no   statistically significant difference between the short-stemmed endoprostheses and   the standard stemmed controls at the proximal humeral (p = 0.84),   proximal femoral (p = 0.57), distal femoral (p = 0.21) and proximal   tibial (p = 0.61) sites.</p><p>In the short-stemmed group, no implants with extra-cortical plate   osseointegration suffered loosening at a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> of 8.5 years (range   2 to 16 years). Three of ten (30%) without osseointegration suffered   aseptic loosening at a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> of 7.7 years (range 2 to 11.5 years).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>When extensive resections of bone are required in the surgical   management of tumours, and in revision cases, the addition of extra-cortical   plates to short medullary stems has shown non-inferiority to standard   length medullary stems and minimises aseptic failure.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1689–95.</p></sec>

Clinical, functional and radiological outcomes of extracorporeal irradiation in limb salvage surgery for bone tumours
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We present a retrospective review of patients treated with extracorporeally   irradiated allografts for primary and secondary bone tumours with   the mid- and long-term survivorship and the functional and radiographic   outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 113 of 116 (97.4%) patients who were treated with   extracorporeally irradiated allografts between 1996 and 2014 were   followed up. Forms of treatment included reconstructions, prostheses   and composite reconstructions, both with and without vascularised   grafts. Survivorship was determined by the Kaplan-Meier method.   Clinical outcomes were assessed using the Musculoskeletal Tumor   Society (MSTS) scoring system, the Toronto Extremity Salvage Score   (TESS) and Quality of Life-C30 (QLQ-30) measures. Radiographic outcomes   were assessed using the International Society of Limb Salvage (ISOLS)   radiographic scoring system.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were 61 (54%) men with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age of 22 years (6 to 70)   and 52 (46%) women with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age of 26 years (3 to 85). There   were 23 deaths. The five-year patient survivorship was 82.3% and   the ten-year patient survivorship was 79.6%. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> follow-up   of the 90 surviving patients was 80.3 months (2 to 207). At the   last follow-up, 105 allografts (92.9%) were still in place or had   been at the time of death; eight (7%) had failed due to infection,   local recurrence or fracture. Outcome scores were comparable with   or superior to those in previous studies. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> outcome scores   were: MSTS 79% (<sc>sd</sc> 8); TESS 83% (<sc>sd</sc> 19); QLQ 82%   (<sc>sd</sc> 16); ISOLS 80.5% (<sc>sd</sc> 19). </p><p>Pearson correlation analysis showed a strong relationship between   the MSTS and ISOLS scores (r = 0.71, p < 0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study shows that extracorporeal irradiation is a versatile   reconstructive technique for dealing with large defects after the   resection of bone tumours with good functional and radiographic   outcomes.

Multiple limb salvage attempts for diabetic foot infections
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Limb salvage for diabetic foot infections often require multiple   procedures. Some patients will eventually end up with below knee   amputation (BKA) when all limb salvage attempts fail. We seek to   study the patients’ ability to return to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">norm</span></strong>al</span></strong> life, functional   status, prosthesis usage and perspectives on multiple limb salvage   procedures that culminated in BKA to review if they would undertake   a similar path if their situation was repeated.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 41 patients who underwent BKA between July 2011 and   June 2013 were reviewed. They were divided into primary and creeping   (prior multiple salvage procedures) amputations. The Barthel’s Index   (BI) and the Reintegration to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">norm</span></strong>al</span></strong> Living Index (RNLI) were used.

A pilot randomized trial of meniscal allograft transplantation versus personalized physiotherapy for patients with a symptomatic meniscal deficient knee compartment
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Meniscal allograft transplantation is undertaken to improve pain   and function in patients with a symptomatic meniscal deficient knee   compartment. While case series have shown improvements in patient   reported outcome measures (PROMs), its efficacy has not been rigorously   evaluated. This study aimed to compare PROMs in patients having   meniscal transplantation with those having personalized physiotherapy   at 12 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A single-centre assessor-blinded, comprehensive cohort study,   incorporating a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) was performed   on patients with a symptomatic compartment of the knee in which   a (sub)total meniscectomy had previously been performed. They were   randomized to be treated either with a meniscal allograft transplantation   or personalized physiotherapy, and stratified for malalignment of   the limb. They entered the preference groups if they were not willing   to be randomized. The Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS),   International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score and Lysholm   score and complications were collected at baseline and at four,   eight and 12 months following the interventions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 36 patients entered the study; 21 were randomized   and 15 chose their treatments. Their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age was 28 years (range   17 to 46). The outcomes were similar in the randomized and preference   groups, allowing pooling of data. At 12 months, the KOOS<sub>4</sub> composite   score (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> difference 12, p = 0.03) and KOOS subscales of pain   (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> difference 15, p = 0.02) and activities of daily living (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong>   difference 18, p = 0.005) were significantly superior in the meniscal   transplantation group. Other PROMs also favoured this group without   reaching statistical significance. There were five complications   in the meniscal transplantation and one in the physiotherapy groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This is the first study to compare meniscal allograft transplantation   to non-operative treatment. The results provide the best quality   evidence to date of the symptomatic benefits of meniscal allograft   transplantation in the short term, but a multicentre RCT is required   to investigate this question further.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:56–63.</p></sec>

Cardiac Outcomes After Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Insulin resistance is highly prevalent among patients with atherosclerosis and is associated with an increased risk for myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke. The IRIS trial (Insulin Resistance Intervention after Stroke) demonstrated that pioglitazone decreased the composite risk for fatal or nonfatal stroke and MI in patients with insulin resistance without diabetes mellitus, after a recent ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. The type and severity of cardiac events in this population and the impact of pioglitazone on these events have not been described.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed a secondary analysis of the effects of pioglitazone, in comparison with placebo, on acute coronary syndromes (MI and unstable angina) among IRIS participants. All potential acute coronary syndrome episodes were adjudicated in a blinded fashion by an independent clinical events committee.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The study cohort was composed of 3876 IRIS participants, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age 63 years, 65% male, 89% white race, and 12% with a history of coronary artery disease. Over a median follow-up of 4.8 years, there were 225 acute coronary syndrome events, including 141 MIs and 84 episodes of unstable angina. The MIs included 28 (19%) with ST-segment elevation. The majority of MIs were type 1 (94, 65%), followed by type 2 (45, 32%). Serum troponin was 10× to 100× upper limit of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">norm</span></strong>al</span></strong> in 49 (35%) and >100× upper limit of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">norm</span></strong>al</span></strong> in 39 (28%). Pioglitazone reduced the risk of acute coronary syndrome (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% confidence interval, 0.54–0.94; <i>P</i>=0.02). Pioglitazone also reduced the risk of type 1 MI (hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% confidence interval, 0.40–0.96; log-rank <i>P</i>=0.03), but not type 2 MI (hazard ratio, 1.05; 95% confidence interval, 0.58–1.91; <i>P</i>=0.87). Similarly, pioglitazone reduced the risk of large MIs with serum troponin >100× upper limit of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">norm</span></strong>al</span></strong> (hazard ratio, 0.44; 95% confidence interval, 0.22–0.87; <i>P</i>=0.02), but not smaller MIs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among patients with insulin resistance without diabetes mellitus, pioglitazone reduced the risk for acute coronary syndromes after a recent cerebrovascular event. Pioglitazone appeared to have its most prominent effect in preventing spontaneous type 1 MIs.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Congenital Heart Defects and Indices of Placental and Fetal Growth in a Nationwide Study of 924 422 Liveborn Infants
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Congenital heart defects (CHDs) have been associated with placental anomalies. The nature and the consequences of this association remain poorly understood. We aimed to estimate the associations between all major subtypes of CHD and placental weight at birth, and the association between placental weight and measures of both overall and cerebral growth in fetuses with CHD, as well.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We included all 924 422 liveborn Danish singletons, 1997 to 2011. CHD was present in 7569. We compared <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> differences in placental weight <i>z</i> score between newborns with CHD and newborns without CHD by multivariable linear regression adjusted for potential confounders.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>CHD was associated with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> <i>z</i> score difference of –0.04 (95% confidence interval, –0.07 to –0.02). Some subtypes were associated with smaller placental size at birth: tetralogy of Fallot, –0.45 (95% confidence interval, –0.58 to –0.31); double-outlet right ventricle, –0.48 (95% confidence interval, –0.87 to –0.10); major ventricular septal defects, –0.41 (95% confidence interval, –0.52 to –0.29). Placental weight <i>z</i> score was associated with birth weight and head circumference <i>z</i> scores in all subtypes. In the 3 mentioned subtypes, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> deviations from the population <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> head circumference and birth weight <i>z</i> scores were reduced by up to 66% with adjustment for placental weight <i>z</i> score.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Three subtypes of CHD were associated with lower placental weight, and placental weight was associated with measures of both overall growth and cerebral growth in fetuses with all subtypes of CHD. In certain subtypes, the described deviations in fetal growth were reduced by up to two-thirds after adjustment for placental weight <i>z</i> score.</p></sec>

The quality of Achilles tendon repair five to eight years after percutaneous tenotomy in the treatment of clubfoot
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Our aim was to describe the mid-term appearances of the repair   process of the Achilles tendon after tenotomy in children with a   clubfoot treated using the Ponseti method.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 15 children (ten boys, five girls) with idiopathic   clubfoot were evaluated at a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> of 6.8 years (5.4 to 8.1) after   complete percutaneous division of the Achilles tendon. The contour   and subjective thickness of the tendon were recorded, and superficial   defects and its strength were assessed clinically. The echogenicity,   texture, thickness, peritendinous irregularities and potential for   deformation of the tendon were evaluated by ultrasonography.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The appearance of the Achilles tendon was slightly ab<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">norm</span></strong>al</span></strong>,   with more thickening and less conspicuous contours than a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">norm</span></strong>al</span></strong>   tendon. Its strength was grossly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">norm</span></strong>al</span></strong>, with no insufficiency of   the triceps surae.

Comparative study on the effectiveness of a corticosteroid injection for carpal tunnel syndrome in patients with and without Raynaud’s phenomenon
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of a corticosteroid   injection for the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) in patients   with and without Raynaud’s phenomenon.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>In a prospective study, 139 patients with CTS were treated with   a corticosteroid injection (10 mg triamcinolone acetonide); 34 had   Raynaud’s phenomenon and 105 did not (control group). Grip strength,   perception of touch with a Semmes-Weinstein monofilament and the   Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaires (BCTQ) were assessed at baseline and   at six, 12 and 24 weeks after the injection. The Cold Intolerance   Severity Score (CISS) questionnaire was also assessed at baseline   and 24 weeks after the injection.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The two groups had similar baseline BCTQ scores, but the scores   in the Raynaud’s phenomenon group were significantly higher than   those in the control group at 12 and 24 weeks after the injection.   Throughout the 24-week follow-up, there were no significant differences   in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> grip strength between the groups, whereas the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> Semmes-Weinstein   monofilament sensory index for the control group was significantly   higher than that of the Raynaud’s phenomenon group. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> CISSs   were not significantly different between the groups at baseline   and at 24 weeks. After 24 weeks, 11 patients (32%) in the Raynaud’s   phenomenon group and 16 (15%) in the control group required carpal   tunnel decompression (p = 0.028). Multivariable analysis indicated   that concurrent Raynaud’s phenomenon (odds ratio (OR) 2.6) and severe   electrophysiological grade (OR 2.1) were independently associated with   a failure of treatment after a corticosteroid injection.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Although considerable improvements in symptoms will probably   occur in patients with Raynaud’s phenomenon who have CTS, they have   higher risk of poor functional outcomes and failure of treatment   than those without Raynaud’s phenomenon.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1637–42.</p></sec>

Comparative study of computer-assisted total knee arthroplasty after opening wedge osteotomy <i>versus</i> after unicompartmental arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The role of high tibial osteotomy (HTO) is being questioned by   the use of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) in the treatment   of medial compartment femorotibial osteoarthritis. Our aim was to   compare the outcomes of revision HTO or UKA to a total knee arthroplasty   (TKA) using computer-assisted surgery in matched groups of patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We conducted a retrospective study to compare the clinical and   radiological outcome of patients who underwent revision of a HTO   to a TKA (group 1) with those who underwent revision of a medial   UKA to a TKA (group 2). All revision procedures were performed using   computer-assisted surgery. We extracted these groups of patients   from our database. They were matched by age, gender, body mass index,   follow-up and pre-operative functional score. The outcomes included   the Knee Society Scores (KSS), radiological outcomes and the rate   of further revision.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were 20 knees in 20 patients in each group. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> follow-up   was 4.1 years (2 to 18.7). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> total KSS at last follow-up   was 185.7 (standard deviation (<sc>sd</sc>) 5) in group 1 compared   with 176.5 (<sc>sd</sc> 11) for group 2 (p = 0.003). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> hip-knee-ankle   angle was 180.2° (<sc>sd</sc> 3.2°) in group 1 and 179.0° (<sc>sd</sc> 2.2°)   in group 2. No revision was required.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We found that good functional and radiological outcomes followed   revision of both HTO and UKA to TKA.

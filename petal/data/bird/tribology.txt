Hemiarthroplasty proximal femoral endoprostheses following tumour reconstruction
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Dislocation rates are reportedly lower in patients requiring   proximal femoral hemiarthroplasty than for patients undergoing hip   arthroplasty for neoplasia. Without acetabular replacement, pain   due to acetabular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wear</span></strong> necessitating revision surgery has been described.   We aimed to determine whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wear</span></strong> of the native acetabulum following   hemiarthroplasty necessitates revision surgery with secondary replacement   of the acetabulum after proximal femoral replacement (PFR) for tumour   reconstruction.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We reviewed 100 consecutive PFRs performed between January 2003   and January 2013 without acetabular resurfacing.

There were 48 male and 52 female patients,   with a mean age of 61.4 years (19 to 85) and median follow-up of   two years (interquartile range (IQR) 0.5 to 3.7 years).

Multivalent counterions diminish the lubricity of polyelectrolyte brushes
<p>Polyelectrolyte brushes provide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wear</span></strong> protection and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lubric</span></strong>ation in many technical, medical, physiological, and biological applications. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wear</span></strong> resistance and low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">friction</span></strong> are attributed to counterion osmotic pressure and the hydration layer surrounding the charged polymer segments. However, the presence of multivalent counterions in solution can strongly affect the interchain interactions and structural properties of brush layers. We evaluated the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lubric</span></strong>ation properties of polystyrene sulfonate brush layers sliding against each other in aqueous solutions containing increasing concentrations of counterions. The presence of multivalent ions (Y<sup>3+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Ba<sup>2+</sup>), even at minute concentrations, markedly increases the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">friction</span></strong> forces between brush layers owing to electrostatic bridging and brush collapse. Our results suggest that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lubric</span></strong>ating properties of polyelectrolyte brushes in multivalent solution are hindered relative to those in monovalent solution.</p>

The rate of wear of second-generation highly crosslinked polyethylene liners five years post-operatively does not increase if large femoral heads are used
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The increased <i>in vivo</i> resistance to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wear</span></strong> of   highly crosslinked polyethylene (HXLPE) in total hip arthroplasty   (THA) has led to an increased use of larger articulations which   have been shown to reduce the incidence of early dislocation.

Suppressing corrosion in primary aluminum–air batteries via oil displacement
<p>Primary aluminum–air batteries boast high theoretical energy densities, but negative electrode <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">corros</span></strong>ion irreversibly limits their shelf life. Most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">corros</span></strong>ion mitigation methods are insufficient or compromise power and energy density. We suppressed open-circuit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">corros</span></strong>ion by displacing electrolyte from the electrode surface with a nonconducting oil during battery standby. High power and energy density are enabled by displacing the oil with electrolyte for battery discharge. The underwater-oleophobic wetting properties of the designed cell surfaces allow for reversible oil displacement. We demonstrate this method in an aluminum–air cell that achieves a 420% increase in usable energy density and 99.99% reduction in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">corros</span></strong>ion, which lowers self-discharge to a rate of 0.02% a month and enables system energy densities of 700 watt-hours per liter and 900 watt-hours per kilogram.</p>

Preventing mussel adhesion using lubricant-infused materials
<p>Mussels are opportunistic macrofouling organisms that can attach to most immersed solid surfaces, leading to serious economic and ecological consequences for the maritime and aquaculture industries. We demonstrate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lubric</span></strong>ant-infused coatings exhibit very low preferential mussel attachment and ultralow adhesive strengths under both controlled laboratory conditions and in marine field studies. Detailed investigations across multiple length scales—from the molecular-scale characterization of deposited adhesive proteins to nanoscale contact mechanics to macroscale live observations—suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lubric</span></strong>ant infusion considerably reduces fouling by deceiving the mechanosensing ability of mussels, deterring secretion of adhesive threads, and decreasing the molecular work of adhesion. Our study demonstrates that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lubric</span></strong>ant infusion represents an effective strategy to mitigate marine biofouling and provides insights into the physical mechanisms underlying adhesion prevention.</p>

Earth and Moon impact flux increased at the end of the Paleozoic
<p>The terrestrial impact crater record is commonly assumed to be biased, with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eros</span></strong>ion thought to eliminate older craters, even on stable terrains. Given that the same projectile population strikes Earth and the Moon, terrestrial selection effects can be quantified by using a method to date lunar craters with diameters greater than 10 kilometers and younger than 1 billion years. We found that the impact rate increased by a factor of 2.6 about 290 million years ago. The terrestrial crater record shows similar results, suggesting that the deficit of large terrestrial craters between 300 million and 650 million years ago relative to more recent times stems from a lower impact flux, not preservation bias. The almost complete absence of terrestrial craters older than 650 million years may indicate a massive global-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eros</span></strong>ion event near that time.</p>

Glacial lake outburst floods as drivers of fluvial erosion in the Himalaya
<p>Himalayan rivers are frequently hit by catastrophic floods that are caused by the failure of glacial lake and landslide dams; however, the dynamics and long-term impacts of such floods remain poorly understood. We present a comprehensive set of observations that capture the July 2016 glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) in the Bhotekoshi/Sunkoshi River of Nepal. Seismic records of the flood provide new insights into GLOF mechanics and their ability to mobilize large boulders that otherwise prevent channel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eros</span></strong>ion. Because of this boulder mobilization, GLOF impacts far exceed those of the annual summer monsoon, and GLOFs may dominate fluvial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eros</span></strong>ion and channel-hillslope coupling many tens of kilometers downstream of glaciated areas. Long-term valley evolution in these regions may therefore be driven by GLOF frequency and magnitude, rather than by precipitation.</p>

Abrupt cloud clearing of marine stratocumulus in the subtropical southeast Atlantic
<p>We document rapid and abrupt clearings of large portions of the subtropical marine low cloud deck that have implications for the global radiation balance and climate sensitivity. Over the southeast Atlantic, large areas of stratocumulus are quickly eroded, yielding partial or complete clearing along sharp transitions hundreds to thousands of kilometers in length that move westward at 8 to 12 meters per second and travel as far as 1000+ kilometers from the African coast. The westward-moving cloudiness reductions have an annual peak in occurrence in the period from April through June. The cloud <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eros</span></strong>ion boundaries reduce cloud at ≈10-kilometer scale in less than 15 minutes, move approximately perpendicular to the mean flow, and are often accompanied by small-scale wave features. Observations suggest that the cloud <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eros</span></strong>ion is caused by atmospheric gravity waves.</p>

Microbial oxidation of lithospheric organic carbon in rapidly eroding tropical mountain soils
<p>Lithospheric organic carbon (“petrogenic”; OC<sub>petro</sub>) is oxidized during exhumation and subsequent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eros</span></strong>ion of mountain ranges. This process is a considerable source of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) to the atmosphere over geologic time scales, but the mechanisms that govern oxidation rates in mountain landscapes are poorly constrained. We demonstrate that, on average, 67 ± 11% of the OC<sub>petro</sub> initially present in bedrock exhumed from the tropical, rapidly eroding Central Range of Taiwan is oxidized in soils, leading to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of 6.1 to 18.6 metric tons of carbon per square kilometer per year. The molecular and isotopic evolution of bulk OC and lipid biomarkers during soil formation reveals that OC<sub>petro</sub> remineralization is microbially mediated. Rapid oxidation in mountain soils drives CO<sub>2</sub> emission fluxes that increase with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eros</span></strong>ion rate, thereby counteracting CO<sub>2</sub> drawdown by silicate weathering and biospheric OC burial.</p>

The program simulates the radiographic   setup and matches the position and orientation of the models to   outlines of the pelvis, the acetabular and femoral component, and   femur on radiographs.

Genome-wide identification and characterization of Notch transcription complex–binding sequence-paired sites in leukemia cells
<p>Notch transcription complexes (NTCs) drive target gene expression by binding to two distinct types of genomic response elements, NTC monomer–binding sites and sequence-paired sites (SPSs) that bind NTC dimers. SPSs are conserved and have been linked to the Notch responsiveness of a few genes. To assess the overall contribution of SPSs to Notch-dependent gene regulation, we determined the DNA sequence requirements for NTC dimerization using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay and applied insights from these in vitro studies to Notch-“addicted” T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells. We found that SPSs contributed to the regulation of about a third of direct Notch target genes. Although originally described in promoters, SPSs are present mainly in long-range enhancers, including an enhancer containing a newly described SPS that regulates <i>HES5</i> expression. Our work provides a general method for identifying SPSs in genome-wide data sets and highlights the widespread role of NTC dimerization in Notch-transformed leukemia cells.</p>

Fluid-induced aseismic fault slip outpaces pore-fluid migration
<p>Earthquake swarms attributed to subsurface fluid injection are usually assumed to occur on faults destabilized by increased pore-fluid pressures. However, fluid injection could also activate aseismic slip, which might outpace pore-fluid migration and transmit earthquake-triggering stress changes beyond the fluid-pressurized region. We tested this theoretical prediction against data derived from fluid-injection experiments that activated and measured slow, aseismic slip on preexisting, shallow faults. We found that the pore pressure and slip history imply a fault whose strength is the product of a slip-weakening <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">friction</span></strong> coefficient and the local effective normal stress. Using a coupled shear-rupture model, we derived constraints on the hydromechanical parameters of the actively deforming fault. The inferred aseismic rupture front propagates faster and to larger distances than the diffusion of pressurized pore fluid.</p>

Climate model shows large-scale wind and solar farms in the Sahara increase rain and vegetation
<p>Wind and solar farms offer a major pathway to clean, renewable energies. However, these farms would significantly change land surface properties, and, if sufficiently large, the farms may lead to unintended climate consequences. In this study, we used a climate model with dynamic vegetation to show that large-scale installations of wind and solar farms covering the Sahara lead to a local temperature increase and more than a twofold precipitation increase, especially in the Sahel, through increased surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">friction</span></strong> and reduced albedo. The resulting increase in vegetation further enhances precipitation, creating a positive albedo–precipitation–vegetation feedback that contributes ~80% of the precipitation increase for wind farms. This local enhancement is scale dependent and is particular to the Sahara, with small impacts in other deserts.</p>

Friction at the bed does not control fast glacier flow
<p>The largest uncertainty in the ice sheet models used to predict future sea level rise originates from our limited understanding of processes at the ice/bed interface. Near glacier termini, where basal sliding controls ice flow, most predictive ice sheet models use a parameterization of sliding that has been theoretically derived for glacier flow over a hard bed. We find that this sliding relation does not apply to the 140 Greenland glaciers that we analyzed. There is no relationship between basal sliding and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">friction</span></strong>al stress at the glacier bed, contrary to theoretical predictions. There is a strong relationship between sliding speed and net pressure at the glacier bed. This latter finding is in agreement with earlier observations of mountain glaciers that have been largely overlooked by the glaciological community.</p>

Environmental dynamics during the onset of the Middle Stone Age in eastern Africa
<p>Development of the African Middle Stone Age (MSA) before 300,000 years ago raises the question of how environmental change influenced the evolution of behaviors characteristic of early <i>Homo sapiens</i>. We used temporally well-constrained sedimentological and paleoenvironmental data to investigate environmental dynamics before and after the appearance of the early MSA in the Olorgesailie basin, Kenya. In contrast to the Acheulean archeological record in the same basin, MSA sites are associated with a markedly different faunal community, more pronounced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eros</span></strong>ion-deposition cycles, tectonic activity, and enhanced wet-dry variability. Aspects of Acheulean technology in this region imply that, as early as 615,000 years ago, greater stone material selectivity and wider resource procurement coincided with an increased pace of land-lake fluctuation, potentially anticipating the adaptability of MSA hominins.</p>

Exposed subsurface ice sheets in the Martian mid-latitudes
<p>Thick deposits cover broad regions of the Martian mid-latitudes with a smooth mantle; <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eros</span></strong>ion in these regions creates scarps that expose the internal structure of the mantle. We investigated eight of these locations and found that they expose deposits of water ice that can be >100 meters thick, extending downward from depths as shallow as 1 to 2 meters below the surface. The scarps are actively retreating because of sublimation of the exposed water ice. The ice deposits likely originated as snowfall during Mars’ high-obliquity periods and have now compacted into massive, fractured, and layered ice. We expect the vertical structure of Martian ice-rich deposits to preserve a record of ice deposition and past climate.</p>

Biological fabrication of cellulose fibers with tailored properties
<p>Cotton is a promising basis for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wear</span></strong>able smart textiles. Current approaches that rely on fiber coatings suffer from function loss during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wear</span></strong>. We present an approach that allows biological incorporation of exogenous molecules into cotton fibers to tailor the material’s functionality. In vitro model cultures of upland cotton (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>) are incubated with 6-carboxyfluorescein–glucose and dysprosium–1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid–glucose, where the glucose moiety acts as a carrier capable of traveling from the vascular connection to the outermost cell layer of the ovule epidermis, becoming incorporated into the cellulose fibers. This yields fibers with unnatural properties such as fluorescence or magnetism. Combining biological systems with the appropriate molecular design offers numerous possibilities to grow functional composite materials and implements a material-farming concept.</p>

Surface changes on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko suggest a more active past
<p>The Rosetta spacecraft spent ~2 years orbiting comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, most of it at distances that allowed surface characterization and monitoring at submeter scales. From December 2014 to June 2016, numerous localized changes were observed, which we attribute to cometary-specific weathering, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eros</span></strong>ion, and transient events driven by exposure to sunlight and other processes. While the localized changes suggest compositional or physical heterogeneity, their scale has not resulted in substantial alterations to the comet’s landscape. This suggests that most of the major landforms were created early in the comet’s current orbital configuration. They may even date from earlier if the comet had a larger volatile inventory, particularly of CO or CO<sub>2</sub> ices, or contained amorphous ice, which could have triggered activity at greater distances from the Sun.</p>

Volcanic tremor and plume height hysteresis from Pavlof Volcano, Alaska
<p>The March 2016 eruption of Pavlof Volcano, Alaska, produced an ash plume that caused the cancellation of more than 100 flights in North America. The eruption generated strong tremor that was recorded by seismic and remote low-frequency acoustic (infrasound) stations, including the EarthScope Transportable Array. The relationship between the tremor amplitudes and plume height changes considerably between the waxing and waning portions of the eruption. Similar hysteresis has been observed between seismic river noise and discharge during storms, suggesting that flow and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eros</span></strong>ional processes in both rivers and volcanoes can produce irreversible structural changes that are detectable in geophysical data. We propose that the time-varying relationship at Pavlof arose from changes in the tremor source related to volcanic vent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eros</span></strong>ion. This relationship may improve estimates of volcanic emissions and characterization of eruption size and intensity.</p>

A Pleistocene ice core record of atmospheric O<sub>2</sub> concentrations
<p>The history of atmospheric O<sub>2</sub> partial pressures (<i>P</i><sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub>) is inextricably linked to the coevolution of life and Earth’s biogeochemical cycles. Reconstructions of past <i>P</i><sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub> rely on models and proxies but often markedly disagree. We present a record of <i>P</i><sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub> reconstructed using O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> ratios from ancient air trapped in ice. This record indicates that <i>P</i><sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub> declined by 7 per mil (0.7%) over the past 800,000 years, requiring that O<sub>2</sub> sinks were ~2% larger than sources. This decline is consistent with changes in burial and weathering fluxes of organic carbon and pyrite driven by either Neogene cooling or increasing Pleistocene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eros</span></strong>ion rates. The 800,000-year record of steady average carbon dioxide partial pressures (<i>P</i><sc>co</sc><sub>2</sub>) but declining <i>P</i><sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub> provides distinctive evidence that a silicate weathering feedback stabilizes <i>P</i><sc>co</sc><sub>2</sub> on million-year time scales.</p>

Convergence in morphology and masticatory function between the pharyngeal jaws of grass carp, <i>Ctenopharyngodon idella</i>, and oral jaws of amniote herbivores
<p>The cellulose-rich walls that protect plant cells are difficult to digest, and therefore mechanical food processing is a key aspect of herbivory across vertebrates. Cell walls are typically broken down by translation of flattened teeth in the occlusal plane (i.e. grinding) as part of a complex, rhythmic chewing stroke. The grass carp, <i>Ctenopharyngodon idella</i>, is a voracious, invasive herbivorous fish that relies solely on its pharyngeal teeth, located in the back of the throat, for mechanical processing of plant material. Here, we describe the musculoskeletal anatomy of the pharyngeal jaws of grass carp and use XROMM to quantify chewing kinematics and muscle strain. The pharyngeal jaws are suspended in a sling of 11 muscles and maintain no bony articulation with any other skeletal elements in the head. The jaws bear long, serrated teeth that are worn during use into flattened tooth cusps. Our kinematic data show that this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wear</span></strong> is the result of the teeth being elevated into occlusion against the basioccipital process and keratinous chewing pad, not tooth-on-tooth occlusion. Pharyngeal jaw elevation results from large strains in the jaw elevator muscle, the levator arcus branchialis V, to drive a pulley-like mechanism that rotates the jaws about a pivot point at the symphysis between the left and right pharyngeal jaws. These complex, rhythmic jaw rotations translate the teeth laterally across the chewing surface throughout the occlusion phase. The grass carp chewing system is strikingly similar in gross morphology and masticatory function to herbivorous chewing strategies in other vertebrates.</p>

Risk factors for wear-related failures after hip resurfacing in patients with a low contact patch to rim distance
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>A contact patch to rim (CPR) distance of < 10 mm has been   associated with edge-loading and excessive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wear</span></strong>. However, not all   arthroplasties with a low CPR distance show problems with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wear</span></strong>.   Therefore, CPR distance may not be the only variable affecting the   post-operative metal ion concentrations.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We used multiple logistic regression to determine what variables   differed between the patients who had high and low cobalt (CoS)   and chromium (CrS) serum ion concentrations within a cohort of patients   with low (< 10 mm) CPR distances. A total of 56 patients treated   with unilateral hip resurfacing arthroplasty (HRA) had CoS and CrS   ion studies performed more than one year after surgery.

Oxidised zirconium <i>versus</i> cobalt alloy bearing surfaces in total knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We sought to establish whether an oxidised zirconium (OxZr) femoral   component causes less loss of polyethylene volume than a cobalt   alloy (CoCr) femoral component in total knee arthroplasty.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A total of 20 retrieved tibial inserts that had articulated with   OxZr components were matched with 20 inserts from CoCr articulations   for patient age, body mass index, length of implantation, and revision   diagnosis.

Mid-term results of the BIOLOX delta ceramic-on-ceramic total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We conducted a prospective study of a delta ceramic total hip   arthroplasty (THA) to determine the rate of ceramic fracture, to   characterise post-operative noise, and to evaluate the mid-term   results and survivorship.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between March 2009 and March 2011, 274 patients (310 hips) underwent   cementless THA using a delta ceramic femoral head and liner. At   each follow-up, clinical and radiological outcomes were recorded.   A Kaplan-Meier analysis was undertaken to estimate survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Four patients (four hips) died and 18 patients (20 hips) were   lost to follow-up within five years. The remaining 252 patients   (286 hips) were followed for a mean of 66.5 months (60 to 84). There   were 144 men (166 hips) and 108 women (120 hips) with a mean age   of 49.7 years (16 to 83) at surgery. The mean pre-operative Harris   Hip Score of 47.1 points improved to 93.8 points at final follow-up.   Six patients reported squeaking in seven hips; however, none were   audible. Radiolucent lines involving Gruen zones one and/or seven   were seen in 52 hips (18.2%). No hip had detectable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wear</span></strong>, focal   osteolysis or signs of loosening. One hip was revised because of   fracture of the ceramic liner, which occurred due to an undetected   malseating of the ceramic liner at the time of surgery.

Radiographic scoring system for the evaluation of stability of cementless acetabular components in the presence of osteolysis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The stability of cementless acetabular components is an important   factor for surgical planning in the treatment of patients with pelvic   osteolysis after total hip arthroplasty (THA). However, the methods   for determining the stability of the acetabular component from pre-operative   radiographs remain controversial. Our aim was to develop a scoring   system to help in the assessment of the stability of the acetabular   component under these circumstances.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The new scoring system is based on the mechanism of failure of   these components and the location of the osteolytic lesion, according   to the DeLee and Charnley classification. Each zone is evaluated   and scored separately. The sum of the individual scores from the   three zones is reported as a total score with a maximum of 10 points.   The study involved 96 revision procedures which were undertaken   for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wear</span></strong> or osteolysis in 91 patients between July 2002 and December   2012. Pre-operative anteroposterior pelvic radiographs and Judet   views were reviewed. The stability of the acetabular component was   confirmed intra-operatively.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Intra-operatively, it was found that 64 components were well-fixed   and 32 were loose. Mean total scores in the well-fixed and loose   components were 2.9 (0 to 7) and 7.2 (1 to 10), respectively (p   < 0.001). In hips with a low score (0 to 2), the component was   only loose in one of 33 hips (3%). The incidence of loosening increased   with increasing scores: in those with scores of 3 and 4, two of   19 components (10.5%) were loose; in hips with scores of 5 and 6, eight   of 19 components (44.5%) were loose; in hips with scores of 7 or   8, 13 of 17 components (70.6%) were loose; and for hips with scores   of 9 and 10, nine of nine components (100%) were loose. Receiver-operating-characteristic curve   analysis demonstrated very good accuracy (area under the curve =   0.90, p < 0.001). The optimal cutoff point was a score of ≥ 5   with a sensitivity of 0.79, and a specificity of 0.87.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>There was a strong correlation between the scoring system and   the probability of loosening of a cementless acetabular component.   This scoring system provides a clinically useful tool for pre-operative   planning, and the evaluation of the outcome of revision surgery   for patients with loosening of a cementless acetabular component   in the presence of osteolysis.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:601–6.</p></sec>

While the RT group showed a significantly lower temperature around the nerve root   compared with the control group (mean 46.5°C; 34.5°C to 66.9°C, p < 0.001), RT   saline failed to significantly reduce the incidence of nerve root injury (ten out of 26; 38.5%; odds   ratio (OR) 0.96; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.516 to 1.785; p = 0.563). However, chilled saline   irrigation resulted in a significantly lower temperature than the control group (mean 39.0°C;   35.3°C to 52.3°C; p < 0.001) and a lower rate of nerve root injury (two out of 21;   9.5%, OR 0.13; 95% CI 0.02 to 0.703, p = 0.010).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">friction</span></strong>al heat caused by a high-speed drill can cause histological nerve root injury.

Radiation-Induced DNA Damage in Operators Performing Endovascular Aortic Repair
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Radiation exposure during fluoroscopically guided interventions such as endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) is a growing concern for operators. This study aimed to measure DNA damage/repair markers in operators perfoming EVAR.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Expression of the DNA damage/repair marker, γ-H2AX and DNA damage response marker, phosphorylated ataxia telangiectasia mutated (pATM), were quantified in circulating lymphocytes in operators during the peri-operative period of endovascular (infrarenal, branched, and fenestrated) and open aortic repair using flow cytometry. These markers were separately measured in the same operators but this time <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wear</span></strong>ing leg lead shielding in addition to upper body protection and compared with those operating with unprotected legs. Susceptibility to radiation damage was determined by irradiating operators’ blood in vitro.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>γ-H2AX and pATM levels increased significantly in operators immediately after branched endovascular aortic repair/fenestrated endovascular aortic repair (<i>P</i><0.0003 for both). Only pATM levels increased after infrarenal endovascular aortic repair (<i>P</i><0.04). Expression of both markers fell to baseline in operators after 24 hours (<i>P</i><0.003 for both). There was no change in γ-H2AX or pATM expression after open repair. Leg protection abrogated γ-H2AX and pATM response after branched endovascular aortic repair/fenestrated endovascular aortic repair. The expression of γ-H2AX varied significantly when operators’ blood was exposed to the same radiation dose in vitro (<i>P</i><0.0001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This is the first study to detect an acute DNA damage response in operators performing fluoroscopically guided aortic procedures and highlights the protective effect of leg shielding. Defining the relationship between this response and cancer risk may better inform safe levels of chronic low-dose radiation exposure.</p></sec>

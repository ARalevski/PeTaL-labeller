Breast tumors educate the proteome of stromal tissue in an individualized but coordinated manner
<p>Cancer forms specialized microenvironmental niches that promote local invasion and colonization. Engrafted patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) locally invade and colonize naive stroma in mice while enabling unambiguous molecular discrimination of human proteins in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> from mouse proteins in the microenvironment. To characterize how patient breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s form a niche and educate naive stroma, subcutaneous breast cancer PDXs were globally profiled by species-specific quantitative proteomics. Regulation of PDX stromal proteins by breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s was extensive, with 35% of the stromal proteome altered by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s consistently across different animals and passages. Differentially regulated proteins in the stroma clustered into six signatures, which included both known and previously unappreciated contributors to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> invasion and colonization. Stromal proteomes were coordinately regulated; however, the sets of proteins altered by each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> were highly distinct. Integrated analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> and stromal proteins, a comparison made possible in these xenograft models, indicated that the known hallmarks of cancer contribute pleiotropically to establishing and maintaining the microenvironmental niche of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>. Education of the stroma by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> is therefore an intrinsic property of breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s that is highly individualized, yet proceeds by consistent, nonrandom, and defined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-promoting molecular alterations.</p>

Risk of Cerebrovascular Events in 178 962 Five-Year Survivors of Cancer Diagnosed at 15 to 39 Years of Age
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Survivors of teenage and young adult cancer are at risk of cerebrovascular events, but the magnitude of and extent to which this risk varies by cancer type, decade of diagnosis, age at diagnosis, and attained age remains uncertain. This is the largest-ever cohort study to evaluate the risks of hospitalization for a cerebrovascular event among long-term survivors of teenage and young adult cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The population-based TYACSS (Teenage and Young Adult Cancer Survivor Study) (N=178,962) was linked to Hospital Episode Statistics data for England to investigate the risks of hospitalization for a cerebrovascular event among 5-year survivors of cancer diagnosed when 15 to 39 years of age. Observed numbers of first hospitalizations for cerebrovascular events were compared with that expected from the general population using standardized hospitalization ratios (SHRs) and absolute excess risks per 10 000 person-years. Cumulative incidence was calculated with death considered a competing risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, 2782 cancer survivors were hospitalized for a cerebrovascular event—40% higher than expected (SHR=1.4, 95% confidence interval, 1.3–1.4). Survivors of central nervous system (CNS) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s (SHR=4.6, 95% confidence interval, 4.3–5.0), head and neck <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s (SHR=2.6, 95% confidence interval, 2.2–3.1), and leukemia (SHR=2.5, 95% confidence interval, 1.9–3.1) were at greatest risk. Males had significantly higher absolute excess risks than females (absolute excess risks =7 versus 3), especially among head and neck <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> survivors (absolute excess risks =30 versus 11). By 60 years of age, 9%, 6%, and 5% of CNS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>, head and neck <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>, and leukemia survivors, respectively, had been hospitalized for a cerebrovascular event.

Bone voyage—Osteoblasts remotely control tumors
<p>Cancer is a systemic disease. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> growth and malignant progression rely not only on the intrinsic aberrant genetic and epigenetic makeup of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells but also on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-induced systemic factors that affect cells in the primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> as well as distant microenvironments (<i>1</i>). Notably, bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) have been shown to contribute to primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> progression by promoting hallmark processes such as inflammation, immunosuppression, vasculogenesis, and extracellular matrix remodeling. BMDCs are also involved in establishing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-permissive microenvironments that form before the arrival of disseminated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells at future metastatic sites (known as premetastatic niches) and promote metastatic outgrowth (<i>2</i>–<i>5</i>). In addition to the direct effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-secreted factors on BMDC recruitment to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s, on page eaal5081 of this issue Engblom <i>et al.</i> (<i>6</i>) report that osteoblasts, which reside in the bone, can be remotely activated by secreted factors from lung adenocarcinoma, which in turn mobilize a specific subset of BMDCs—neutrophils—to foster <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> growth.</p>

Blockade of surface-bound TGF-β on regulatory T cells abrogates suppression of effector T cell function in the tumor microenvironment
<p>Regulatory T cells (T<sub>regs</sub>) suppress anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> immunity by inhibiting the killing of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells by antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. To better understand the mechanisms involved, we used ex vivo three-dimensional collagen-fibrin gel cultures of dissociated B16 melanoma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s. This system recapitulated the in vivo suppression of antimelanoma immunity, rendering the dissociated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells resistant to killing by cocultured activated, antigen-specific T cells. Immunosuppression was not observed when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s excised from T<sub>reg</sub>-depleted mice were cultured in this system. Experiments with neutralizing antibodies showed that blocking transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) also prevented immunosuppression. Immunosuppression depended on cell-cell contact or cellular proximity because soluble factors from the collagen-fibrin gel cultures did not inhibit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cell killing by T cells. Moreover, intravital, two-photon microscopy showed that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-specific Pmel-1 effector T cells physically interacted with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-resident T<sub>regs</sub> in mice. T<sub>regs</sub> isolated from B16 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s alone were sufficient to suppress CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell–mediated killing, which depended on surface-bound TGF-β on the T<sub>regs</sub>. Immunosuppression of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells correlated with a decrease in the abundance of the cytolytic protein granzyme B and an increase in the cell surface amount of the immune checkpoint receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1). These findings suggest that contact between T<sub>regs</sub> and anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> T cells in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> microenvironment inhibits antimelanoma immunity in a TGF-β–dependent manner and highlight potential ways to inhibit intra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>al T<sub>regs</sub> therapeutically.</p>

Potassium shapes antitumor immunity
<p>T cells protect us from infections and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s. Nonetheless, cancers grow, persist, and metastasize, even in the presence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), which include T cells with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cell–killing capabilities. This lack of immune control stems from the functional exhaustion, or hyporesponsiveness, of TILs as a consequence of chronic antigen exposure, poor expression of rejection antigens by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells, hypoxia, lack of nutrients or substrates, and/or other suppressive mechanisms in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> microenvironment (TME). Despite these challenges, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> antigen–specific TILs with stem cell–like behavior can mediate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> destruction after successful immunotherapy, such as immune checkpoint blockade (<i>1</i>). Finding mechanisms that maintain the stemness of TILs may lead to improved cancer immunotherapies. On page 1417 of this issue, Vodnala <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) identify the concentration of extracellular potassium in the TME as a determinant of the dysfunction and stemness of CD8<sup>+</sup> TILs. This helps explain how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s progress in the presence of T cells that could clear them and suggests new approaches to boost T cell stemness in cancer immunotherapy.</p>

Tumor metastasis to lymph nodes requires YAP-dependent metabolic adaptation
<p>In cancer patients, metastasis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s to sentinel lymph nodes (LNs) predicts disease progression and often guides treatment decisions. The mechanisms underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> LN metastasis are poorly understood. By using comparative transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses of primary and LN-metastatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s in mice, we found that LN metastasis requires that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells undergo a metabolic shift toward fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Transcriptional coactivator yes-associated protein (YAP) is selectively activated in LN-metastatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s, leading to the up-regulation of genes in the FAO signaling pathway. Pharmacological inhibition of FAO or genetic ablation of YAP suppressed LN metastasis in mice. Several bioactive bile acids accumulated to high levels in the metastatic LNs, and these bile acids activated YAP in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells, likely through the nuclear vitamin D receptor. Inhibition of FAO or YAP may merit exploration as a potential therapeutic strategy for mitigating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> metastasis to LNs.</p>

Blockade of TNFR2 signaling enhances the immunotherapeutic effect of CpG ODN in a mouse model of colon cancer
<p>Through the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> necrosis factor (TNF) receptor type II (TNFR2), TNF preferentially activates, expands, and promotes the phenotypic stability of CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T (T<sub>reg</sub>) cells. Those T<sub>reg</sub> cells that have a high abundance of TNFR2 have the maximal immunosuppressive capacity. We investigated whether targeting TNFR2 could effectively suppress the activity of T<sub>reg</sub> cells and consequently enhance the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. We found that, relative to a suboptimal dose of the immunostimulatory Toll-like receptor 9 ligand CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN), the combination of the suboptimal dose of CpG ODN with the TNFR2-blocking antibody M861 more markedly inhibited the growth of subcutaneously grafted mouse CT26 colon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells. This resulted in markedly fewer TNFR2<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells and more interferon-γ–positive (IFN-γ<sup>+</sup>) CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T lymphocytes infiltrating the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> and improved long-term <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-free survival in the mouse cohort. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-free mice were resistant to rechallenge by the same but not unrelated (4T1 breast cancer) cells. Treatment with the combination of TNFR2-blocking antibody and a CD25-targeted antibody also resulted in enhanced inhibition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> growth in a syngeneic 4T1 mouse model of breast cancer. Thus, the combination of a TNFR2 inhibitor and an immunotherapeutic stimulant may represent a more effective treatment strategy for various cancers.</p>

The lncRNA H19 mediates breast cancer cell plasticity during EMT and MET plasticity by differentially sponging miR-200b/c and let-7b
<p>Metastasis is a multistep process by which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells disseminate from their primary site and form secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s at a distant site. The pathophysiological course of metastasis is mediated by the dynamic plasticity of cancer cells, which enables them to shift between epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes through a transcriptionally regulated program termed epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and its reverse process, mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET). Using a mouse model of spontaneous metastatic breast cancer, we investigated the molecular mediators of metastatic competence within a heterogeneous primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> and how these cells then manipulated their epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity during the metastatic process. We isolated cells from the primary mammary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>, the circulation, and metastatic lesions in the lung in TA2 mice and found that the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) H19 mediated EMT and MET by differentially acting as a sponge for the microRNAs miR-200b/c and let-7b. We found that this ability enabled H19 to modulate the expression of the microRNA targets <i>Git2</i> and <i>Cyth3</i>, respectively, which encode regulators of the RAS superfamily member adenosine 5′-diphosphate (ADP) ribosylation factor (ARF), a guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) that promotes cell migration associated with EMT and disseminating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells. Decreasing the abundance of H19 or manipulating that of members in its axis prevented metastasis from grafts in syngeneic mice. Abundance of H19, GIT2, and CYTH3 in patient samples further suggests that H19 might be exploited as a biomarker for metastatic cells within breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s and perhaps as a therapeutic target to prevent metastasis.</p>

The transcription factor MAFK induces EMT and malignant progression of triple-negative breast cancer cells through its target GPNMB
<p>Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is particularly aggressive and difficult to treat. For example, the transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) pathway is implicated in TNBC progression and metastasis, but its opposing role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> suppression in healthy tissues and early-stage lesions makes it a challenging target. Therefore, additional molecular characterization of TNBC may lead to improved patient prognosis by informing the development and optimum use of targeted therapies. We found that musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma (MAF) oncogene family protein K (MAFK), a member of the small MAF family of transcription factors that are induced by the TGF-β pathway, was abundant in human TNBC and aggressive mouse mammary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cell lines. MAFK promoted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>igenic growth and metastasis by 4T1 cells when implanted subcutaneously in mice. Overexpression of MAFK in mouse breast epithelial NMuMG cells induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotypes and promoted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> formation and invasion in mice. MAFK induced the expression of the gene encoding the transmembrane glycoprotein nmb (GPNMB). Similar to MAFK, GPNMB overexpression in NMuMG cells induced EMT, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> formation, and invasion, in mice, whereas knockdown of MAFK in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells before implantation suppressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> growth and progression. <i>MAFK</i> and <i>GPNMB</i> expression correlated with poor prognosis in TNBC patients. These findings suggest that MAFK and its target gene <i>GPNMB</i> play important roles in the malignant progression of TNBC cells, offering potentially new therapeutic targets for TNBC patients.</p>

PSMA redirects cell survival signaling from the MAPK to the PI3K-AKT pathways to promote the progression of prostate cancer
<p>Increased abundance of the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) on prostate epithelium is a hallmark of advanced metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) and correlates negatively with prognosis. However, direct evidence that PSMA functionally contributes to PCa progression remains elusive. We generated mice bearing PSMA-positive or PSMA-negative PCa by crossing PSMA-deficient mice with transgenic PCa (TRAMP) models, enabling direct assessment of PCa incidence and progression in the presence or absence of PSMA. Compared with PSMA-positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s, PSMA-negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s were smaller, lower-grade, and more apoptotic with fewer blood vessels, consistent with the recognized proangiogenic function of PSMA. Relative to PSMA-positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s lacking PSMA had less than half the abundance of type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R), less activity in the survival pathway mediated by PI3K-AKT signaling, and more activity in the proliferative pathway mediated by MAPK-ERK1/2 signaling. Biochemically, PSMA interacted with the scaffolding protein RACK1, disrupting signaling between the β<sub>1</sub> integrin and IGF-1R complex to the MAPK pathway, enabling activation of the AKT pathway instead. Manipulation of PSMA abundance in PCa cell lines recapitulated this signaling pathway switch. Analysis of published databases indicated that IGF-1R abundance, cell proliferation, and expression of transcripts for antiapoptotic markers positively correlated with PSMA abundance in patients, suggesting that this switch may be relevant to human PCa. Our findings suggest that increase in PSMA in prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s contributes to progression by altering normal signal transduction pathways to drive PCa progression and that enhanced signaling through the IGF-1R/β<sub>1</sub> integrin axis may occur in other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s.</p>

Targeting TNFR2 with antagonistic antibodies inhibits proliferation of ovarian cancer cells and tumor-associated T<sub>regs</sub>
<p>Major barriers to cancer therapy include the lack of selective inhibitors of regulatory T cells (T<sub>regs</sub>) and the lack of broadly applicable ways to directly target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s through frequently expressed surface oncogenes. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2) is an attractive target protein because of its restricted abundance to highly immunosuppressive T<sub>regs</sub> and oncogenic presence on human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s. We characterized the effect of TNFR2 inhibition using antagonistic antibodies. In culture-based assays, we found that two TNFR2 antagonists inhibited T<sub>reg</sub> proliferation, reduced soluble TNFR2 secretion from normal cells, and enabled T effector cell expansion. The antagonistic activity occurred in the presence of added TNF, a natural TNFR2 agonist. These TNFR2 antibodies killed T<sub>regs</sub> isolated from ovarian cancer ascites more potently than it killed T<sub>regs</sub> from healthy donor samples, suggesting that these antibodies may have specificity for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> microenvironment. The TNFR2 antagonists also killed OVCAR3 ovarian cancer cells, which have abundant surface TNFR2. The antibodies stabilized antiparallel dimers in cell surface TNFR2 that rendered the receptor unable to activate the nuclear factor κB pathway and trigger cell proliferation. Our data suggest that, by targeting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells and immunosuppressive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-associated T<sub>regs</sub>, antagonistic TNFR2 antibodies may be an effective treatment for cancers positive for TNFR2.</p>

High-fructose corn syrup enhances intestinal tumor growth in mice

NK cell–mediated cytotoxicity contributes to tumor control by a cytostatic drug combination

The Hippo pathway effector TAZ induces TEAD-dependent liver inflammation and tumors
<p>The Hippo signaling pathway regulates organ size and plays critical roles in maintaining tissue growth, homeostasis, and regeneration.

A defect in KCa3.1 channel activity limits the ability of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from cancer patients to infiltrate an adenosine-rich microenvironment
<p>The limited ability of cytotoxic T cells to infiltrate solid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s hampers immune surveillance and the efficacy of immunotherapies in cancer. Adenosine accumulates in solid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s and inhibits <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-specific T cells. Adenosine inhibits T cell motility through the A<sub>2A</sub> receptor (A<sub>2A</sub>R) and suppression of KCa3.1 channels. We conducted three-dimensional chemotaxis experiments to elucidate the effect of adenosine on the migration of peripheral blood CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients. The chemotaxis of HNSCC CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was reduced in the presence of adenosine, and the effect was greater on HNSCC CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells than on healthy donor (HD) CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. This response correlated with the inability of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to infiltrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s. The effect of adenosine was mimicked by an A<sub>2A</sub>R agonist and prevented by an A<sub>2A</sub>R antagonist. We found no differences in A<sub>2A</sub>R expression, 3′,5′-cyclic adenosine monophosphate abundance, or protein kinase A type 1 activity between HNSCC and HD CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. We instead detected a decrease in KCa3.1 channel activity, but not expression, in HNSCC CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Activation of KCa3.1 channels by 1-EBIO restored the ability of HNSCC CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to chemotax in the presence of adenosine. Our data highlight the mechanism underlying the increased sensitivity of HNSCC CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to adenosine and the potential therapeutic benefit of KCa3.1 channel activators, which could increase infiltration of these T cells into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s.</p>

Truncation- and motif-based pan-cancer analysis reveals tumor-suppressing kinases
<p>A major challenge in cancer genomics is identifying “driver” mutations from the many neutral “passenger” mutations within a given <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>. To identify driver mutations that would otherwise be lost within mutational noise, we filtered genomic data by motifs that are critical for kinase activity. In the first step of our screen, we used data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia and The Cancer Genome Atlas to identify kinases with truncation mutations occurring within or before the kinase domain. The top 30 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-suppressing kinases were aligned, and hotspots for loss-of-function (LOF) mutations were identified on the basis of amino acid conservation and mutational frequency. The functional consequences of new LOF mutations were biochemically validated, and the top 15 hotspot LOF residues were used in a pan-cancer analysis to define the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-suppressing kinome. A ranked list revealed MAP2K7, an essential mediator of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, as a candidate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> suppressor in gastric cancer, despite its mutational frequency falling within the mutational noise for this cancer type. The majority of mutations in MAP2K7 abolished its catalytic activity, and reactivation of the JNK pathway in gastric cancer cells harboring LOF mutations in MAP2K7 or the downstream kinase JNK suppressed clonogenicity and growth in soft agar, demonstrating the functional relevance of inactivating the JNK pathway in gastric cancer. Together, our data highlight a broadly applicable strategy to identify functional cancer driver mutations and define the JNK pathway as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-suppressive in gastric cancer.</p>

IL-33 and ST2 mediate FAK-dependent antitumor immune evasion through transcriptional networks
<p>Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) mediates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cell–intrinsic behaviors that promote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> growth and metastasis. We previously showed that FAK also induces the expression of inflammatory genes that inhibit anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> immunity in the microenvironment. We identified a crucial, previously unknown role for the dual-function cytokine interleukin-33 (IL-33) in FAK-dependent immune evasion. In murine squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells, specifically nuclear FAK enhanced the expression of the genes encoding IL-33, the chemokine CCL5, and the soluble, secreted form of the IL-33 receptor, called soluble ST2 (sST2). The abundance of IL-33 and CCL5 was increased in FAK-positive SCC cells but not in normal keratinocytes. IL-33 associated with FAK in the nucleus, and the FAK–IL-33 complex interacted with a network of chromatin modifiers and transcriptional regulators, including TAF9, WDR82, and BRD4, which promote the activity of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and its induction of genes encoding chemokines, including CCL5. We did not detect secretion of IL-33 from FAK-positive SCC cells; thus, we propose that the increased production and secretion of sST2 likely sequesters IL-33 secreted by other cell types within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> environment, thus blocking its stimulatory effects on infiltrating host immune cells. Depleting FAK, IL-33, or sST2 from SCC cells before implantation induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> regression in syngeneic mice, except when CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were co-depleted. Our data provide mechanistic insight into how FAK controls the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> immune environment, namely, through a transcriptional regulatory network mediated by nuclear IL-33. Targeting this axis may boost anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> immunity in patients.</p>

Intercellular transmission of the unfolded protein response promotes survival and drug resistance in cancer cells
<p>Increased protein translation in cells and various factors in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> microenvironment can induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which initiates the unfolded protein response (UPR). We have previously reported that factors released from cancer cells mounting a UPR induce a de novo UPR in bone marrow–derived myeloid cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells that facilitates pro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>igenic characteristics in culture and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> growth in vivo. We investigated whether this intercellular signaling, which we have termed transmissible ER stress (TERS), also operates between cancer cells and what its functional consequences were within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>. We found that TERS signaling induced a UPR in recipient human prostate cancer cells that included the cell surface expression of the chaperone GRP78. TERS also activated Wnt signaling in recipient cancer cells and enhanced resistance to nutrient starvation and common chemotherapies such as the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib and the microtubule inhibitor paclitaxel. TERS-induced activation of Wnt signaling required the UPR kinase and endonuclease IRE1. However, TERS-induced enhancement of cell survival was predominantly mediated by the UPR kinase PERK and a reduction in the abundance of the transcription factor ATF4, which prevented the activation of the transcription factor CHOP and, consequently, the induction of apoptosis. When implanted in mice, TERS-primed cancer cells gave rise to faster growing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s than did vehicle-primed cancer cells. Collectively, our data demonstrate that TERS is a mechanism of intercellular communication through which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells can adapt to stressful environments.</p>

Restoring tumor suppression
<p>Many oncogenes and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> suppressors that are mutated during cancer development act as enzymatic switches that phosphorylate (kinases) or dephosphorylate (phosphatases) substrates. Much attention has focused on therapeutically inhibiting oncogenic kinases that are activated by mutation. However, there has been less focus on targeting phosphatases, despite their importance in cancer development. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> suppressor PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog on chromosome 10) is the most frequently inactivated phosphatase in human cancer (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). The loss of PTEN phosphatase activity increases downstream activity of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)–AKT signaling pathway (<i>3</i>, <i>4</i>). Preclinical studies have shown that targeting the PI3K-AKT pathway reduces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> growth when PTEN is inactivated (<i>5</i>). However, many PTEN mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s are resistant to such therapies. On page 651 of this issue, Lee <i>et al.</i> (<i>6</i>) activate PTEN phosphatase by inhibiting a newly described inhibitory system and thereby reduce PI3K-AKT signaling and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> growth in mice.</p>

Genetic diversity of tumors with mismatch repair deficiency influences anti–PD-1 immunotherapy response
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s with mismatch repair deficiency (MMR-d) are characterized by sequence alterations in microsatellites and can accumulate thousands of mutations. This high mutational burden renders <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s immunogenic and sensitive to programmed cell death–1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitors. Yet, despite their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> immunogenicity, patients with MMR-deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s experience highly variable responses, and roughly half are refractory to treatment. We present experimental and clinical evidence showing that the degree of microsatellite instability (MSI) and resultant mutational load, in part, underlies the variable response to PD-1 blockade immunotherapy in MMR-d human and mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s. The extent of response is particularly associated with the accumulation of insertion-deletion (indel) mutational load. This study provides a rationale for the genome-wide characterization of MSI intensity and mutational load to better profile responses to anti–PD-1 immunotherapy across MMR-deficient human cancers.</p>

T cell stemness and dysfunction in tumors are triggered by a common mechanism
<p>A paradox of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> immunology is that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-infiltrating lymphocytes are dysfunctional in situ, yet are capable of stem cell–like behavior including self-renewal, expansion, and multipotency, resulting in the eradication of large metastatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s. We find that the overabundance of potassium in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> microenvironment underlies this dichotomy, triggering suppression of T cell effector function while preserving stemness. High levels of extracellular potassium constrain T cell effector programs by limiting nutrient uptake, thereby inducing autophagy and reduction of histone acetylation at effector and exhaustion loci, which in turn produces CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells with improved in vivo persistence, multipotency, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> clearance. This mechanistic knowledge advances our understanding of T cell dysfunction and may lead to novel approaches that enable the development of enhanced T cell strategies for cancer immunotherapy.</p>

They find that these neuroendocrine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s can arise from non-neuroendocrine epithelial cells, which converge upon reprogramming toward a neuroendocrine fate via a common and specific combination of genetic factors.</p>

Decoupling genetics, lineages, and microenvironment in IDH-mutant gliomas by single-cell RNA-seq

Differences in bulk profiles between IDH-mutant astrocytoma and oligodendroglioma can be primarily explained by distinct TME and signature genetic events, whereas both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> types share similar developmental hierarchies and lineages of glial differentiation. As <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> grade increases, we find enhanced proliferation of malignant cells, larger pools of undifferentiated glioma cells, and an increase in macrophage over microglia expression programs in TME.

The linker histone H1.0 generates epigenetic and functional intratumor heterogeneity

Numerous cancer types exhibit high inter- and intra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> heterogeneity of H1.0, with H1.0 levels correlating with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> differentiation status, patient survival, and, at the single-cell level, cancer stem cell markers.

Self-renewing epigenetic states are not stable, and reexpression of H1.0 in subsets of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells establishes transcriptional programs that restrict cancer cells’ long-term proliferative potential and drive their differentiation.

The cellular and molecular origin of tumor-associated macrophages

Developmental phosphoproteomics identifies the kinase CK2 as a driver of Hedgehog signaling and a therapeutic target in medulloblastoma
<p>A major limitation of targeted cancer therapy is the rapid emergence of drug resistance, which often arises through mutations at or downstream of the drug target or through intrinsic resistance of subpopulations of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells. Medulloblastoma (MB), the most common pediatric brain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>, is no exception, and MBs that are driven by sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling are particularly aggressive and drug-resistant. To find new drug targets and therapeutics for MB that may be less susceptible to common resistance mechanisms, we used a developmental phosphoproteomics approach in murine granule neuron precursors (GNPs), the developmental cell of origin of MB. The protein kinase CK2 emerged as a driver of hundreds of phosphorylation events during the proliferative, MB-like stage of GNP growth, including the phosphorylation of three of the eight proteins commonly amplified in MB. CK2 was critical to the stabilization and activity of the transcription factor GLI2, a late downstream effector in SHH signaling. CK2 inhibitors decreased the viability of primary SHH-type MB patient cells in culture and blocked the growth of murine MB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s that were resistant to currently available Hh inhibitors, thereby extending the survival of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-bearing mice. Because of structural interactions, one CK2 inhibitor (CX-4945) inhibited both wild-type and mutant CK2, indicating that this drug may avoid at least one common mode of acquired resistance. These findings suggest that CK2 inhibitors may be effective for treating patients with MB and show how phosphoproteomics may be used to gain insight into developmental biology and pathology.</p>

The neuropilin 2 isoform NRP2b uniquely supports TGFβ-mediated progression in lung cancer
<p>Neuropilins (NRP1 and NRP2) are co-receptors for heparin-binding growth factors and class 3 semaphorins. Different isoforms of NRP1 and NRP2 are produced by alternative splicing. We found that in non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines, transforming growth factor–β (TGFβ) signaling preferentially increased the abundance of NRP2b. NRP2b and NRP2a differ only in their carboxyl-terminal regions. Although the presence of NRP2b inhibited cultured cell proliferation and primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> growth, NRP2b enhanced cellular migration, invasion into Matrigel, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>sphere formation in cultured cells in response to TGFβ signaling and promoted metastasis in xenograft mouse models. These effects of overexpressed NRP2b contrast with the effects of overexpressed NRP2a. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)–induced phosphorylation of the kinase AKT was specifically promoted by NRP2b, whereas inhibiting the HGF receptor MET attenuated NRP2b-dependent cell migration. Unlike NRP2a, NRP2b did not bind the PDZ domain scaffolding protein GAIP carboxyl terminus–interacting protein (GIPC1) and only weakly recruited phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), potentially explaining the difference between NRP2b-mediated and NRP2a-mediated effects. Analysis of NSCLC patient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s showed that NRP2b abundance correlated with that of the immune cell checkpoint receptor ligand PD-L1 as well as with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotypes in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s, acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors, disease progression, and poor survival in patients. NRP2b knockdown attenuated the acquisition of resistance to the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib in cultured NSCLC cells. Thus, in NSCLC, NRP2b contributed to the oncogenic response to TGFβ and correlated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> progression in patients.</p>

Lymph node blood vessels provide exit routes for metastatic tumor cell dissemination in mice
<p>During metastasis, malignant cells escape the primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>, intravasate lymphatic vessels, and reach draining sentinel lymph nodes before they colonize distant organs via the blood circulation. Although lymph node metastasis in cancer patients correlates with poor prognosis, evidence is lacking as to whether and how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells enter the bloodstream via lymph nodes. To investigate this question, we delivered carcinoma cells into the lymph nodes of mice by microinfusing the cells into afferent lymphatic vessels.

Origins of lymphatic and distant metastases in human colorectal cancer

Tumor aneuploidy correlates with markers of immune evasion and with reduced response to immunotherapy
<p>Immunotherapies based on immune checkpoint blockade are highly effective in a subset of patients.

Aneuploidy, also known as somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs), is widespread in cancer and is posited to drive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>igenesis. Analyzing 12 human cancer types, we find that, for most, highly aneuploid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s show reduced expression of markers of cytotoxic infiltrating immune cells, especially CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, and increased expression of cell proliferation markers.

Together with other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> characteristics such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> mutational load, aneuploidy may thus help identify patients most likely to respond to immunotherapy.</p>

Cross-species analysis of genetically engineered mouse models of MAPK-driven colorectal cancer identifies hallmarks of the human disease
<p>Effective treatment options for advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) are limited, survival rates are poor and this disease continues to be a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Despite being a highly heterogeneous disease, a large subset of individuals with sporadic CRC typically harbor relatively few established ‘driver’ lesions. Here, we describe a collection of genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of sporadic CRC that combine lesions frequently altered in human patients, including well-characterized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> suppressors and activators of MAPK signaling. Primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s from these models were profiled, and individual GEMM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s segregated into groups based on their genotypes. Unique allelic and genotypic expression signatures were generated from these GEMMs and applied to clinically annotated human CRC patient samples. We provide evidence that a <i>Kras</i> signature derived from these GEMMs is capable of distinguishing human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s harboring <i>KRAS</i> mutation, and tracks with poor prognosis in two independent human patient cohorts. Furthermore, the analysis of a panel of human CRC cell lines suggests that high expression of the GEMM <i>Kras</i> signature correlates with sensitivity to targeted pathway inhibitors. Together, these findings implicate GEMMs as powerful preclinical tools with the capacity to recapitulate relevant human disease biology, and support the use of genetic signatures generated in these models to facilitate future drug discovery and validation efforts.</p>

An inducible knockout mouse to model the cell-autonomous role of PTEN in initiating endometrial, prostate and thyroid neoplasias
<p><i>PTEN</i> is one of the most frequently mutated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> suppressor genes in human cancers. The role of PTEN in carcinogenesis has been validated by knockout mouse models. <i>PTEN</i> heterozygous mice develop <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neoplasm</span></strong>s in multiple organs. Unfortunately, the embryonic lethality of biallelic excision of <i>PTEN</i> has inhibited the study of complete <i>PTEN</i> deletion in the development and progression of cancer. By crossing PTEN conditional knockout mice with transgenic mice expressing a tamoxifen-inducible Cre-ER<sup>T</sup> under the control of a chicken actin promoter, we have generated a tamoxifen-inducible mouse model that allows temporal control of <i>PTEN</i> deletion. Interestingly, administration of a single dose of tamoxifen resulted in <i>PTEN</i> deletion mainly in epithelial cells, but not in stromal, mesenchymal or hematopoietic cells. Using the mT/mG double-fluorescent Cre reporter mice, we demonstrate that epithelial-specific <i>PTEN</i> excision was caused by differential Cre activity among tissues and cells types. Tamoxifen-induced deletion of <i>PTEN</i> resulted in extremely rapid and consistent formation of endometrial <i>in situ</i> adenocarcinoma, prostate intraepithelial neoplasia and thyroid hyperplasia. We also analyzed the role of PTEN ablation in other epithelial cells, such as the tubular cells of the kidney, hepatocytes, colonic epithelial cells or bronchiolar epithelium, but those tissues did not exhibit neoplastic growth. Finally, to validate this model as a tool to assay the efficacy of anti-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> drugs in PTEN deficiency, we administered the mTOR inhibitor everolimus to mice with induced <i>PTEN</i> deletion. Everolimus dramatically reduced the progression of endometrial proliferations and significantly reduced thyroid hyperplasia. This model could be a valuable tool to study the cell-autonomous mechanisms involved in PTEN-loss-induced carcinogenesis and provides a good platform to study the effect of anti-neoplastic drugs on PTEN-negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s.</p>

Transmembrane voltage potential is an essential cellular parameter for the detection and control of tumor development in a <i>Xenopus</i> model
<p>Understanding mechanisms that orchestrate cell behavior into appropriately patterned tissues and organs within the organism is an essential element of preventing, detecting and treating cancer. Bioelectric signals (resting transmembrane voltage potential gradients in all cells) underlie an important and broadly conserved set of control mechanisms that regulate pattern formation. We tested the role of transmembrane potential in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>igenesis mediated by canonical oncogenes in <i>Xenopus laevis</i>. Depolarized membrane potential (<i>V</i><sub>mem</sub>) was a characteristic of induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-like structures (ITLSs) generated by overexpression of <i>Gli1</i>, <i>Kras<sup>G12D</sup></i>, <i>Xrel3</i> or <i>p53<sup>Trp248</sup></i>. This bioelectric signature was also present in precursor ITLS sites. <i>V</i><sub>mem</sub> is a bioelectric marker that reveals ITLSs before they become histologically and morphologically apparent. Moreover, voltage was functionally important: overexpression of hyperpolarizing ion transporters caused a return to normal <i>V</i><sub>mem</sub> and significantly reduced ITLS formation <i>in vivo</i>. To characterize the molecular mechanism by which <i>V</i><sub>mem</sub> change regulates ITLS phenotypes, we performed a suppression screen. <i>V</i><sub>mem</sub> hyperpolarization was transduced into downstream events via <i>V</i><sub>mem</sub>-regulated activity of SLC5A8, a sodium-butyrate exchanger previously implicated in human cancer. These data indicate that butyrate, a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, might be responsible for transcriptional events that mediate suppression of ITLSs by hyperpolarization. <i>V</i><sub>mem</sub> is a convenient cellular parameter by which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s induced by human oncogenes can be detected <i>in vivo</i> and represents a new diagnostic modality. Moreover, control of resting membrane potential is functionally involved in the process by which oncogene-bearing cells depart from normal morphogenesis programs to form <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s. Modulation of <i>V</i><sub>mem</sub> levels is a novel and promising strategy for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> normalization.</p>

Convergence of Wnt, growth factor, and heterotrimeric G protein signals on the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Daple
<p>Cellular proliferation, differentiation, and morphogenesis are shaped by multiple signaling cascades, and their dysregulation plays an integral role in cancer progression. Three cascades that contribute to oncogenic potential are those mediated by Wnt proteins and the receptor Frizzled (FZD), growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), and heterotrimeric G proteins and associated GPCRs. Daple is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the G protein G<sub>αi</sub>. Daple also binds to FZD and the Wnt/FZD mediator Dishevelled (Dvl), and it enhances β-catenin–independent Wnt signaling in response to Wnt5a-FZD7 signaling. We identified Daple as a substrate of multiple RTKs and non-RTKs and, hence, as a point of convergence for the three cascades. We found that phosphorylation near the Dvl-binding motif in Daple by both RTKs and non-RTKs caused Daple/Dvl complex dissociation and augmented the ability of Daple to bind to and activate G<sub>αi</sub>, which potentiated β-catenin–independent Wnt signals and stimulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) similarly to Wnt5a/FZD7 signaling. Although Daple acts as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> suppressor in the healthy colon, the concurrent increased abundance of Daple and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in colorectal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s was associated with poor patient prognosis. Thus, the Daple-dependent activation of G<sub>αi</sub> and the Daple-dependent enhancement of β-catenin–independent Wnt signals are not only stimulated by Wnt5a/FZD7 to suppress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>igenesis but also hijacked by growth factor–activated RTKs to enhance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> progression. These findings identify a cross-talk paradigm among growth factor RTKs, heterotrimeric G proteins, and the Wnt/FZD pathway in cancer.</p>

KIF22 coordinates CAR and EGFR dynamics to promote cancer cell proliferation
<p>The coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) is a transmembrane receptor that plays a key role in cell-cell adhesion. CAR is found in normal epithelial cells and is increased in abundance in various human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s, including lung carcinomas. We investigated the potential mechanisms by which CAR contributes to cancer cell growth and found that depletion of CAR in human lung cancer cells reduced anchorage-independent growth, epidermal growth factor (EGF)–dependent proliferation, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> growth in vivo. EGF induced the phosphorylation of CAR and its subsequent relocalization to cell junctions through the activation of the kinase PKCδ. EGF promoted the binding of CAR to the chromokinesin KIF22. KIF22-dependent regulation of microtubule dynamics led to delayed EGFR internalization, enhanced EGFR signaling, and coordination of CAR dynamics at cell-cell junctions. These data suggest a role for KIF22 in the coordination of membrane receptors and provide potential new therapeutic strategies to combat lung <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> growth.</p>

SILAC identifies LAD1 as a filamin-binding regulator of actin dynamics in response to EGF and a marker of aggressive breast tumors
<p>Mutations mimicking growth factor–induced proliferation and motility characterize aggressive subtypes of mammary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s. To unravel currently unknown players in these processes, we performed phosphoproteomic analysis on untransformed mammary epithelial cells (MCF10A) that were stimulated in culture with epidermal growth factor (EGF). We identified ladinin-1 (LAD1), a largely uncharacterized protein to date, as a phosphorylation-regulated mediator of the EGF-to-ERK pathway. Further experiments revealed that LAD1 mediated the proliferation and migration of mammary cells. LAD1 was transcriptionally induced, phosphorylated, and partly colocalized with actin stress fibers in response to EGF. Yeast two-hybrid, proximity ligation, and coimmunoprecipitation assays revealed that LAD1 bound to actin–cross-linking proteins called filamins. Cosedimentation analyses indicated that LAD1 played a role in actin dynamics, probably in collaboration with the scaffold protein 14-3-3σ (also called SFN). Depletion of LAD1 decreased the expression of transcripts associated with cell survival and inhibited the growth of mammary xenografts in an animal model. Furthermore, LAD1 predicts poor patient prognosis and is highly expressed in aggressive subtypes of breast cancer characterized as integrative clusters 5 and 10, which partly correspond to triple-negative and HER2-positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s. Thus, these findings reveal a cytoskeletal component that is critically involved in cell migration and the acquisition of oncogenic attributes in human mammary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s.</p>

Loss of SPDEF and gain of TGFBI activity after androgen deprivation therapy promote EMT and bone metastasis of prostate cancer
<p>Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) targeting the androgen receptor (AR) is a standard therapeutic regimen for treating prostate cancer. However, most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s progress to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer after ADT. We identified the type 1, 2, and 4 collagen–binding protein transforming growth factor–β (TGFβ)–induced protein (TGFBI) as an important factor in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and malignant progression of prostate cancer. In prostate cancer cell lines, AR signaling stimulated the activity of the transcription factor SPDEF, which repressed the expression of <i>TGFBI</i>. ADT, AR antagonism, or overexpression of TGFBI inhibited the activity of SPDEF and enhanced the proliferation rates of prostate cancer cells. Knockdown of TGFBI suppressed migration and proliferation in cultured cells and reduced prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> growth and brain and bone metastasis in xenograft models, extending the survival of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-bearing mice. Analysis of prostate tissue samples collected before and after ADT from the same patients showed that ADT reduced the nuclear abundance of SPDEF and increased the production of TGFBI. Our findings suggest that induction of TGFBI promotes prostate cancer growth and metastasis and can be caused by dysregulation or therapeutic inhibition of AR signaling.</p>

Differential abundance of CK1α provides selectivity for pharmacological CK1α activators to target WNT-dependent tumors
<p>Constitutive WNT activity drives the growth of various human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s, including nearly all colorectal cancers (CRCs). Despite this prominence in cancer, no WNT inhibitor is currently approved for use in the clinic largely due to the small number of druggable signaling components in the WNT pathway and the substantial toxicity to normal gastrointestinal tissue. We have shown that pyrvinium, which activates casein kinase 1α (CK1α), is a potent inhibitor of WNT signaling. However, its poor bioavailability limited the ability to test this first-in-class WNT inhibitor in vivo. We characterized a novel small-molecule CK1α activator called SSTC3, which has better pharmacokinetic properties than pyrvinium, and found that it inhibited the growth of CRC xenografts in mice. SSTC3 also attenuated the growth of a patient-derived metastatic CRC xenograft, for which few therapies exist. SSTC3 exhibited minimal gastrointestinal toxicity compared to other classes of WNT inhibitors. Consistent with this observation, we showed that the abundance of the SSTC3 target, CK1α, was decreased in WNT-driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s relative to normal gastrointestinal tissue, and knocking down CK1α increased cellular sensitivity to SSTC3. Thus, we propose that distinct CK1α abundance provides an enhanced therapeutic index for pharmacological CK1α activators to target WNT-driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s.</p>

Acetylation-dependent regulation of MDM2 E3 ligase activity dictates its oncogenic function
<p>Abnormal activation of the oncogenic E3 ubiquitin ligase murine double minute 2 (MDM2) is frequently observed in human cancers. By ubiquitinating the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> suppressor p53 protein, which leads to its proteasome-mediated destruction, MDM2 limits the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-suppressing activity of p53. On the other hand, by ubiquitinating itself, MDM2 targets itself for destruction and promotes the p53 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> suppressor pathway, a process that can be antagonized by the deubiquitinase herpesvirus-associated ubiquitin-specific protease (HAUSP). We investigated the regulation of MDM2 substrate specificity and found that acetyltransferase p300–mediated acetylation and stabilization of MDM2 are molecular switches that block self-ubiquitination, thereby shifting its E3 ligase activity toward p53. In vitro and in cancer cell lines, p300-mediated acetylation of MDM2 on Lys<sup>182</sup> and Lys<sup>185</sup> enabled HAUSP to bind, presumably deubiquitinate, and stabilize MDM2. This acetylation within the nuclear localization signal domain decreased its interaction with the acidic domain, subsequently increased the interaction between the acidic domain and RING domain in MDM2, enabled the binding of HAUSP to the acidic domain in MDM2, and shifted MDM2 activity from autoubiquitination to p53 ubiquitination. However, upon genotoxic stress through exposure to etoposide, the deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) deacetylated MDM2 at Lys<sup>182</sup> and Lys<sup>185</sup>, thereby promoting self-ubiquitination and less ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of p53, thus increasing p53-dependent apoptosis. Therefore, this study indicates that dynamic acetylation is a molecular switch in the regulation of MDM2 substrate specificity, revealing further insight into the posttranslational regulation of the MDM2/p53 cell survival axis.</p>

Reduced abundance of the E3 ubiquitin ligase E6AP contributes to decreased expression of the <i>INK4/ARF</i> locus in non–small cell lung cancer
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> suppressor p16<sup>INK4a</sup>, one protein encoded by the <i>INK4/ARF</i> locus, is frequently absent in multiple cancers, including non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Whereas increased methylation of the encoding gene (<i>CDKN2A</i>) accounts for its loss in a third of patients, no molecular explanation exists for the remainder. We unraveled an alternative mechanism for the silencing of the <i>INK4/ARF</i> locus involving the E3 ubiquitin ligase and transcriptional cofactor E6AP (also known as UBE3A). We found that the expression of three <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> suppressor genes encoded in the <i>INK4/ARF</i> locus (<i>p15</i><sup><i>INK4b</i></sup>, <i>p16</i><sup><i>INK4a</i></sup>, and <i>p19</i><sup><i>ARF</i></sup>) was decreased in <i>E6AP</i><sup><i>−/−</i></sup> mouse embryo fibroblasts. E6AP induced the expression of the <i>INK4/ARF</i> locus at the transcriptional level by inhibiting <i>CDC6</i> transcription, a gene encoding a key repressor of the locus. Luciferase assays revealed that E6AP inhibited <i>CDC6</i> expression by reducing its E2F1-dependent transcription. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that E6AP reduced the amount of E2F1 at the <i>CDC6</i> promoter. In a subset of NSCLC samples, an E6AP-low/CDC6-high/p16<sup>INK4a</sup>-low protein abundance profile correlated with low methylation of the gene encoding p16<sup>INK4a</sup> (<i>CDKN2A</i>) and poor patient prognosis. These findings define a previously unrecognized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-suppressive role for E6AP in NSCLC, reveal an alternative silencing mechanism of the <i>INK4/ARF</i> locus, and reveal E6AP as a potential prognostic marker in NSCLC.</p>

Reactivation of PTEN tumor suppressor for cancer treatment through inhibition of a MYC-WWP1 inhibitory pathway
<p>Activation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> suppressors for the treatment of human cancer has been a long sought, yet elusive, strategy. PTEN is a critical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> suppressive phosphatase that is active in its dimer configuration at the plasma membrane. Polyubiquitination by the ubiquitin E3 ligase WWP1 (WW domain–containing ubiquitin E3 ligase 1) suppressed the dimerization, membrane recruitment, and function of PTEN. Either genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of WWP1 triggered PTEN reactivation and unleashed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> suppressive activity. <i>WWP1</i> appears to be a direct MYC (MYC proto-oncogene) target gene and was critical for MYC-driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>igenesis. We identified indole-3-carbinol, a compound found in cruciferous vegetables, as a natural and potent WWP1 inhibitor. Thus, our findings unravel a potential therapeutic strategy for cancer prevention and treatment through PTEN reactivation.</p>

The chromatin of cancer
<p>Developments in modern genomics tools have led to rapid progress in our understanding of the genetic basis of cancer. Recent large-scale efforts have primarily focused on two types of analysis: mapping acquired somatic mutations by whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>), and identification of common inherited variants that increase cancer risk using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) (<i>3</i>). Despite the power of these technologies, we are still far from understanding how the variants and mutations found in individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s precisely drive the oncogenic process. A large number of genetic variants increase risk for cancer, but most explain only a very small fraction of the risk. Furthermore, although acquired somatic mutations are found in almost all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s, most do not carry complete sets of mutations that, according to our present mechanistic understanding, would be sufficient to cause cancer. On page 420 of this issue, Corces <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) show how a third type of genomics approach—functional genomic analyses of primary human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s—can begin to bridge this gap in our mechanistic understanding of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>igenic process.</p>

Gut microbiome–mediated bile acid metabolism regulates liver cancer via NKT cells
<p>Primary liver <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s and liver metastasis currently represent the leading cause of cancer-related death.

A major chromatin regulator determines resistance of tumor cells to T cell–mediated killing
<p>Many human cancers are resistant to immunotherapy, for reasons that are poorly understood.

Inactivation of >100 genes—including <i>Pbrm1</i>, <i>Arid2</i>, and <i>Brd7</i>, which encode components of the PBAF form of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex—sensitized mouse B16F10 melanoma cells to killing by T cells.

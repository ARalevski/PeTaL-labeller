The Genomes of Two Bat Species with Long Constant Frequency Echolocation Calls
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bat</span></strong>s can perceive the world by using a wide range of sensory systems, and some of the systems have become highly specialized, such as auditory sensory perception. Among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bat</span></strong> species, the Old World leaf-nosed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bat</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hors</span></strong>eshoe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bat</span></strong>s (rhinolophoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bat</span></strong>s) possess the most sophisti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat</span></strong>ed echolo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat</span></strong>ion systems. Here, we reported the whole-genome sequencing and <i>de novo</i> assembles of two rhinolophoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bat</span></strong>s—the great leaf-nosed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bat</span></strong> (<i>Hipposideros armiger</i>) and the Chinese rufous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hors</span></strong>eshoe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bat</span></strong> (<i>Rhinolophus sinicus</i>). Comparative genomic analyses revealed the adaptation of auditory sensory perception in the rhinolophoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bat</span></strong> lineages, probably resulting from the extreme selectivity used in the auditory processing by these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bat</span></strong>s. Pseu<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dog</span></strong>enization of some vision-related genes in rhinolophoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bat</span></strong>s was observed, suggesting that these genes have undergone relaxed natural selection. An extensive contraction of olfactory receptor gene repertoires was observed in the lineage leading to the common ancestor of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bat</span></strong>s. Further extensive gene contractions can be observed in the branch leading to the rhinolophoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bat</span></strong>s. Such concordance suggested that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mole</span></strong>cular changes at one sensory gene might have direct consequences for genes controlling for other sensory modalities. To characterize the population genetic structure and patterns of evolution, we re-sequenced the genome of 20 great leaf-nosed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bat</span></strong>s from four different geographical lo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat</span></strong>ions of China. The result showed similar sequence diversity values and little differentiation among populations. Moreover, evidence of genetic adaptations to high altitudes in the great leaf-nosed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bat</span></strong>s was observed. Taken together, our work provided a useful resource for future research on the evolution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bat</span></strong>s.</p>

Y Chromosome Analysis of Dingoes and Southeast Asian Village Dogs Suggests a Neolithic Continental Expansion from Southeast Asia Followed by Multiple Austronesian Dispersals
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dog</span></strong>s originated more than 14,000 BP, but the lo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat</span></strong>ion(s) where they first arose is uncertain. The earliest archeological evidence of ancient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dog</span></strong>s was discovered in Europe and the Middle East, some 5–7 millennia before that from Southeast Asia. However, mitochondrial DNA analyses suggest that most modern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dog</span></strong>s derive from Southeast Asia, which has fueled the controversial hypothesis that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dog</span></strong> domesti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat</span></strong>ion originated in this region despite the lack of supporting archeological evidence. We propose and investigate with Y chromosomes an alternative hypothesis for the proximate origins of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dog</span></strong>s from Southeast Asia—a massive Neolithic expansion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dog</span></strong>s from this region that largely replaced more primitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dog</span></strong>s to the west and north. Previous attempts to test matrilineal findings with independent patrilineal markers have lacked the necessary genealogical resolution and mutation rate estimates. Here, we used Y chromosome genotypes, composed of 29 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) and 5 single tandem repeats (STRs), from 338 Australian dingoes, New Guinea singing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dog</span></strong>s, and village <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dog</span></strong>s from Island Southeast Asia, along with modern European breed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dog</span></strong>s, to estimate the evolutionary mutation rates of Y chromosome STRs based on calibration to the independently known age of the dingo population. Dingoes exhibited a unique haplogroup characterized by a single distinguishing SNP mutation and 14 STR haplotypes. The age of the European haplogroup was estimated to be only 1.7 times older than that of the dingo population, suggesting an origin during the Neolithic rather than the Paleolithic (as predicted by the Southeast Asian origins hypothesis). We hypothesize that isolation of Neolithic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dog</span></strong>s from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wolv</span></strong>es in Southeast Asia was a key step accelerating their phenotypic transformation, enhancing their value in trade and as cargo, and enabling them to rapidly expand and replace more primitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dog</span></strong>s to the West. Our findings also suggest that dingoes could have arrived in Australia directly from Taiwan, independently of later dispersals of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dog</span></strong>s through Thailand to Island Southeast Asia.</p>

The evolutionary history of dogs in the Americas
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dog</span></strong>s were present in the Americas before the arrival of European colonists, but the origin and fate of these precontact <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dog</span></strong>s are largely unknown. We sequenced 71 mitochondrial and 7 nuclear genomes from ancient North American and Siberian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dog</span></strong>s from time frames spanning ~9000 years. Our analysis indi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat</span></strong>es that American <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dog</span></strong>s were not derived from North American <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wolv</span></strong>es. Instead, American <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dog</span></strong>s form a monophyletic lineage that likely originated in Siberia and dispersed into the Americas alongside people. After the arrival of Europeans, native American <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dog</span></strong>s almost completely disappeared, leaving a minimal genetic legacy in modern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dog</span></strong> populations. The closest detectable extant lineage to precontact American <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dog</span></strong>s is the canine transmissible venereal tumor, a contagious cancer clone derived from an individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dog</span></strong> that lived up to 8000 years ago.</p>

Ancient genomes revisit the ancestry of domestic and Przewalski’s horses
<p>The Eneolithic Botai culture of the Central Asian steppes provides the earliest archaeological evidence for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hors</span></strong>e husbandry, ~5500 years ago, but the exact nature of early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hors</span></strong>e domesti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat</span></strong>ion remains controversial. We generated 42 ancient-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hors</span></strong>e genomes, including 20 from Botai. Compared to 46 published ancient- and modern-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hors</span></strong>e genomes, our data indi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat</span></strong>e that Przewalski’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hors</span></strong>es are the feral descendants of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hors</span></strong>es herded at Botai and not truly wild <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hors</span></strong>es. All domestic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hors</span></strong>es dated from ~4000 years ago to present only show ~2.7% of Botai-related ancestry. This indi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat</span></strong>es that a massive genomic turnover underpins the expansion of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hors</span></strong>e stock that gave rise to modern domesti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat</span></strong>es, which coincides with large-scale human population expansions during the Early Bronze Age.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Large Numbers of Novel miRNAs Originate from DNA Transposons and Are Coincident with a Large Species Radiation in Bats
<p>Vesper <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bat</span></strong>s (family Vespertilionidae) experienced a rapid adaptive radiation beginning around 36 Ma that resulted in the second most species-rich mammalian family (>400 species). Coincident with that radiation was an initial burst of DNA transposon activity that has continued into the present in some species. Such extensive and recent DNA transposon activity has not been seen in any other extant mammal. Indeed, retrotransposon activity is much more common in all other sequenced mammal genomes. Deep sequencing of the small RNA fraction from a vespertilionid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bat</span></strong>, <i>Eptesicus fuscus</i>, as well as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dog</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hors</span></strong>e revealed large numbers of 17–24 bp putative miRNAs (p/miRNAs). Although the origination rate of p/miRNAs is similar in all three taxa, 61.1% of postdivergence p/miRNAs in <i>Eptesicus</i> are derived from transposable elements (TEs) compared with only 23.9% and 16.5% in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dog</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hors</span></strong>e, respectively. Not surprisingly, given the retrotransposon bias of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dog</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hors</span></strong>e, the majority of TE-derived p/miRNAs are associated with retrotransposons. In <i>Eptesicus</i>, however, 58.7% of the TE-derived and 35.9% of the total p/miRNAs arose not from retrotransposons but from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bat</span></strong>-specific DNA transposons. Notably, we observe that the timing of the DNA transposon expansion and the resulting introduction of novel p/miRNAs coincide with the rapid diversifi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat</span></strong>ion of the family Vespertilionidae. Furthermore, potential targets of the DNA transposon-derived p/miRNAs are identifiable and enriched for genes that are important for regulation of transcription. We propose that lineage-specific DNA transposon activity lead to the rapid and repeated introduction of novel p/miRNAs. Some of these p/miRNAs are likely functional miRNAs and potentially influenced the diversifi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat</span></strong>ion of Vespertilionidae. Our observations suggest a mechanism for introducing functional genomic variation rapidly through the expansion of DNA transposons that fits within the TE-thrust hypothesis.</p>

Ancient goat genomes reveal mosaic domestication in the Fertile Crescent
<p>Current genetic data are equivocal as to whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">goat</span></strong> domesti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat</span></strong>ion occurred multiple times or was a singular process. We generated genomic data from 83 ancient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">goat</span></strong>s (51 with genome-wide coverage) from Paleolithic to Medieval contexts throughout the Near East. Our findings demonstrate that multiple divergent ancient wild <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">goat</span></strong> sources were domesti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat</span></strong>ed in a dispersed process that resulted in genetically and geographically distinct Neolithic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">goat</span></strong> populations, echoing contemporaneous human divergence across the region. These early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">goat</span></strong> populations contributed differently to modern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">goat</span></strong>s in Asia, Africa, and Europe. We also detect early selection for pigmentation, stature, reproduction, milking, and response to dietary change, providing 8000-year-old evidence for human agency in molding genome variation within a partner species.</p>

Social place-cells in the bat hippocampus
<p>Social animals have to know the spatial positions of conspecifics. However, it is unknown how the position of others is represented in the brain. We designed a spatial observational-learning task, in which an observer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bat</span></strong> mimicked a demonstrator <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bat</span></strong> while we recorded hippocampal dorsal-CA1 neurons from the observer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bat</span></strong>. A neuronal subpopulation represented the position of the other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bat</span></strong>, in allocentric coordinates. About half of these “social place-cells” represented also the observer’s own position—that is, were place cells. The representation of the demonstrator <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bat</span></strong> did not reflect self-movement or trajectory planning by the observer. Some neurons represented also the position of inanimate moving objects; however, their representation differed from the representation of the demonstrator <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bat</span></strong>. This suggests a role for hippocampal CA1 neurons in social-spatial cognition.</p>

Talpid Mole Phylogeny Unites Shrew Moles and Illuminates Overlooked Cryptic Species Diversity
<p>The mammalian family Talpidae (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mole</span></strong>s, shrew <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mole</span></strong>s, desmans) is characterized by diverse ecomorphologies associated with terrestrial, semi-aquatic, semi-fossorial, fossorial, and aquatic-fossorial lifestyles. Prominent specializations involved with these different lifestyles, and the transitions between them, pose outstanding questions regarding the evolutionary history within the family, not only for living but also for fossil taxa. Here, we investigate the phylogenetic relationships, divergence times, and biogeographic history of the family using 19 nuclear and 2 mitochondrial genes (∼16 kb) from ∼60% of described species representing all 17 genera. Our phylogenetic analyses help settle classical questions in the evolution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mole</span></strong>s, identify an ancient (mid-Miocene) split within the monotypic genus <i>Scaptonyx</i>, and indi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat</span></strong>e that talpid species richness may be nearly 30% higher than previously recognized. Our results also uniformly support the monophyly of long-tailed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mole</span></strong>s with the two shrew <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mole</span></strong> tribes and confirm that the Gansu <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mole</span></strong> is the sole living Asian member of an otherwise North American radiation. Finally, we provide evidence that aquatic specializations within the tribes Condylurini and Desmanini evolved along different morphological trajectories, though we were unable to statistically reject monophyly of the strictly fossorial tribes Talpini and Scalopini. </p>

Brown and Polar Bear Y Chromosomes Reveal Extensive Male-Biased Gene Flow within Brother Lineages
<p>Brown and polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>s have become prominent examples in phylogeography, but previous phylogeographic studies relied largely on maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or were geographically restricted. The male-specific Y chromosome, a natural counterpart to mtDNA, has remained underexplored. Although this paternally inherited chromosome is indispensable for comprehensive analyses of phylogeographic patterns, technical difficulties and low variability have hampered its appli<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat</span></strong>ion in most mammals. We developed 13 novel Y-chromosomal sequence and microsatellite markers from the polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong> genome and screened these in a broad geographic sample of 130 brown and polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>s. We also analyzed a 390-kb-long Y-chromosomal scaffold using sequencing data from published male ursine genomes. Y chromosome evidence support the emerging understanding that brown and polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>s started to diverge no later than the Middle Pleistocene. Contrary to mtDNA patterns, we found 1) brown and polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>s to be reciprocally monophyletic sister (or rather brother) lineages, without signals of introgression, 2) male-biased gene flow across continents and on phylogeographic time scales, and 3) male dispersal that links the Alaskan ABC islands population to mainland brown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>s. Due to female philopatry, mtDNA provides a highly structured estimate of population differentiation, while male-biased gene flow is a homogenizing force for nuclear genetic variation. Our findings highlight the importance of analyzing both maternally and paternally inherited loci for a comprehensive view of phylogeographic history, and that mtDNA-based phylogeographic studies of many mammals should be reevaluated. Recent advances in sequencing technology render the analysis of Y-chromosomal variation feasible, even in nonmodel organisms.</p>

Transcriptional activation of elephant shark mineralocorticoid receptor by corticosteroids, progesterone, and spironolactone
<p>The mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) is a nuclear receptor and part of a large and diverse family of transcription factors that also includes receptors for glucocorticoids, progesterone, androgens, and estrogens. The corticosteroid aldosterone is the physiological activator of the MR in humans and other terrestrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vertebr</span></strong>ates; however, its activator is not known in cartilaginous fish, the oldest group of extant jawed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vertebr</span></strong>ates. Here, we analyzed the ability of corticosteroids and progesterone to activate the full-length MR from the elephant shark (<i>Callorhinchus milii</i>). On the basis of their measured activities, aldosterone, cortisol, 11-deoxycorticosterone, corticosterone, 11-deoxcortisol, progesterone, and 19-norprogesterone are potential physiological mineralocorticoids. However, aldosterone, the physiological mineralocorticoid in humans and other terrestrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vertebr</span></strong>ates, is not found in cartilaginous or ray-finned fish. Although progesterone activates MRs in ray-finned fish, progesterone does not activate MRs in humans, amphibians, or alligator, suggesting that during the transition to terrestrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vertebr</span></strong>ates, progesterone lost the ability to activate the MR. Both elephant shark MR and human MR are expressed in the brain, heart, ovary, testis, and other nonepithelial tissues, suggesting that MR expression in diverse tissues evolved in the common ancestor of jawed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vertebr</span></strong>ates. Our data suggest that 19-norprogesterone– and progesterone-activated MR may have unappreciated functions in reproductive physiology.</p>

The Vertebral Column of <i>Australopithecus sediba</i>

The nearshore cradle of early vertebrate diversification
<p>Ancestral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vertebr</span></strong>ate habitats are subject to controversy and obscured by limited, often contradictory paleontological data. We assembled fossil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vertebr</span></strong>ate occurrence and habitat datasets spanning the middle Paleozoic (480 million to 360 million years ago) and found that early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vertebr</span></strong>ate clades, both jawed and jawless, originated in restricted, shallow intertidal-subtidal environments. Nearshore divergences gave rise to body plans with different dispersal abilities: Robust fishes shifted shoreward, whereas gracile groups moved seaward. Fresh waters were invaded repeatedly, but movement to deeper waters was contingent upon form and short-lived until the later Devonian. Our results contrast with the onshore-offshore trends, reef-centered diversifi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat</span></strong>ion, and mid-shelf clustering observed for benthic in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vertebr</span></strong>ates. Nearshore origins for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vertebr</span></strong>ates may be linked to the demands of their mobility and may have influenced the structure of their early fossil record and diversifi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat</span></strong>ion.</p>

Gene editing restores dystrophin expression in a canine model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy
<p>Mutations in the gene encoding dystrophin, a protein that maintains muscle integrity and function, cause Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The deltaE50-MD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dog</span></strong> model of DMD harbors a mutation corresponding to a mutational “hotspot” in the human <i>DMD</i> gene. We used adeno-associated viruses to deliver CRISPR gene editing components to four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dog</span></strong>s and examined dystrophin protein expression 6 weeks after intramuscular delivery (<i>n</i> = 2) or 8 weeks after systemic delivery (<i>n</i> = 2). After systemic delivery in skeletal muscle, dystrophin was restored to levels ranging from 3 to 90% of normal, depending on muscle type. In cardiac muscle, dystrophin levels in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dog</span></strong> receiving the highest dose reached 92% of normal. The treated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dog</span></strong>s also showed improved muscle histology. These large-animal data support the concept that, with further development, gene editing approaches may prove clinically useful for the treatment of DMD.</p>

Fossils reveal the complex evolutionary history of the mammalian regionalized spine
<p>A unique characteristic of mammals is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vertebr</span></strong>al column with anatomically distinct regions, but when and how this trait evolved remains unknown. We reconstructed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vertebr</span></strong>al regions and their morphological disparity in the extinct forerunners of mammals, the nonmammalian synapsids, to elucidate the evolution of mammalian axial differentiation. Mapping patterns of regionalization and disparity (heterogeneity) across amniotes reveals that both traits increased during synapsid evolution. However, the onset of regionalization predates increased heterogeneity. On the basis of inferred homology patterns, we propose a “pectoral-first” hypothesis for region acquisition, whereby evolutionary shifts in forelimb function in nonmammalian therapsids drove increasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vertebr</span></strong>al modularity prior to differentiation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vertebr</span></strong>al column for specialized functions in mammals.</p>

The projected effect on insects, vertebrates, and plants of limiting global warming to 1.5°C rather than 2°C
<p>In the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, the United Nations is pursuing efforts to limit global warming to 1.5°C, whereas earlier aspirations focused on a 2°C limit. With current pledges, corresponding to ~3.2°C warming, climatically determined geographic range losses of >50% are projected in ~49% of insects, 44% of plants, and 26% of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vertebr</span></strong>ates. At 2°C, this falls to 18% of insects, 16% of plants, and 8% of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vertebr</span></strong>ates and at 1.5°C, to 6% of insects, 8% of plants, and 4% of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vertebr</span></strong>ates. When warming is limited to 1.5°C as compared with 2°C, numbers of species projected to lose >50% of their range are reduced by ~66% in insects and by ~50% in plants and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vertebr</span></strong>ates.</p>

CAT-tailing as a fail-safe mechanism for efficient degradation of stalled nascent polypeptides
<p>Ribosome stalling leads to recruitment of the ribosome quality control complex (RQC), which targets the partially synthesized polypeptide for proteasomal degradation through the action of the ubiquitin ligase Ltn1p. A second core RQC component, Rqc2p, modifies the nascent polypeptide by adding a carboxyl-terminal alanine and threonine (CAT) tail through a noncanonical elongation reaction. Here we examined the role of CAT-tailing in nascent-chain degradation in budding yeast. We found that Ltn1p efficiently accessed only nascent-chain lysines immediately proximal to the ribosome exit tunnel. For substrates without Ltn1p-accessible lysines, CAT-tailing enabled degradation by exposing lysines sequestered in the ribosome exit tunnel. Thus, CAT-tails do not serve as a degron, but rather provide a fail-safe mechanism that expands the range of RQC-degradable substrates.</p>

Control of species-dependent cortico-motoneuronal connections underlying manual dexterity
<p>Superior manual dexterity in higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">primat</span></strong>es emerged together with the appearance of cortico-motoneuronal (CM) connections during the evolution of the mammalian corticospinal (CS) system. Previously thought to be specific to higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">primat</span></strong>es, we identified transient CM connections in early postnatal mice, which are eventually eliminated by Sema6D-PlexA1 signaling. <i>PlexA1</i> mutant mice maintain CM connections into adulthood and exhibit superior manual dexterity as compared with that of controls. Last, differing <i>PlexA1</i> expression in layer 5 of the motor cortex, which is strong in wild-type mice but weak in humans, may be explained by FEZF2-mediated cis-regulatory elements that are found only in higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">primat</span></strong>es. Thus, species-dependent regulation of <i>PlexA1</i> expression may have been crucial in the evolution of mammalian CS systems that improved fine motor control in higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">primat</span></strong>es.</p>

Fructose-driven glycolysis supports anoxia resistance in the naked mole-rat
<p>The African naked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mole</span></strong>-rat’s (<i>Heterocephalus glaber</i>) social and subterranean lifestyle generates a hypoxic niche. Under experimental conditions, naked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mole</span></strong>-rats tolerate hours of extreme hypoxia and survive 18 minutes of total oxygen deprivation (anoxia) without apparent injury. During anoxia, the naked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mole</span></strong>-rat switches to anaerobic metabolism fueled by fructose, which is actively accumulated and metabolized to lactate in the brain. Global expression of the GLUT5 fructose transporter and high levels of ketohexokinase were identified as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mole</span></strong>cular signatures of fructose metabolism. Fructose-driven glycolytic respiration in naked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mole</span></strong>-rat tissues avoids feedback inhibition of glycolysis via phosphofructokinase, supporting viability. The metabolic rewiring of glycolysis can circumvent the normally lethal effects of oxygen deprivation, a mechanism that could be harnessed to minimize hypoxic damage in human disease.</p>

High-energy, high-fat lifestyle challenges an Arctic apex predator, the polar bear
<p>Regional declines in polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong> (<i>Ursus maritimus</i>) populations have been attributed to changing sea ice conditions, but with limited information on the causative mechanisms. By simultaneously measuring field metabolic rates, daily activity patterns, body condition, and foraging success of polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>s moving on the spring sea ice, we found that high metabolic rates (1.6 times greater than previously assumed) coupled with low intake of fat-rich <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marine mamm</span></strong>al prey resulted in an energy deficit for more than half of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>s examined.

Consequently, increases in mobility resulting from ongoing and forecasted declines in and fragmentation of sea ice are likely to increase energy demands and may be an important factor explaining observed declines in body condition and survival.</p>

Acoustic mirrors as sensory traps for bats
<p>Sensory traps pose a considerable and often fatal risk for animals, leading them to misinterpret their environment. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bat</span></strong>s predominantly rely on their echolo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat</span></strong>ion system to forage, orientate, and navigate. We found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bat</span></strong>s can mistake smooth, vertical surfaces as clear flight paths, repeatedly colliding with them, likely as a result of their acoustic mirror properties. The probability of collision is influenced by the number of echolo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat</span></strong>ion calls and by the amount of time spent in front of the surface. The echolo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat</span></strong>ion call analysis corroborates that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bat</span></strong>s perceive smooth, vertical surfaces as open flyways. Reporting on occurrences with different species in the wild, we argue that it is necessary to more closely monitor potentially dangerous lo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat</span></strong>ions with acoustic mirror properties (such as glass fronts) to assess the true frequency of fatalities around these sensory traps.</p>

Cognition-mediated evolution of low-quality floral nectars
<p>Plants pollinated by hummingbirds or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bat</span></strong>s produce dilute nectars even though these animals prefer more concentrated sugar solutions. This mismatch is an unsolved evolutionary paradox. Here we show that lower quality, or more dilute, nectars evolve when the strength of preferring larger quantities or higher qualities of nectar diminishes as magnitudes of the physical stimuli increase. In a virtual evolution experiment conducted in the tropical rainforest, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bat</span></strong>s visited computer-automated flowers with simulated genomes that evolved relatively dilute nectars. Simulations repli<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat</span></strong>ed this evolution only when value functions, which relate the physical stimuli to subjective sensations, were nonlinear. Selection also depended on the supply/demand ratio; <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bat</span></strong>s selected for more dilute nectar when competition for food was higher. We predict such a pattern to generally occur when decision-makers consider multiple value dimensions simultaneously, and increases of psychological value are not fully proportional to increases in physical magnitude.</p>

Formaldehyde stabilization facilitates lignin monomer production during biomass depolymerization
<p>Practical, high-yield lignin depolymerization methods could greatly increase biorefinery productivity and profitability. However, development of these methods is limited by the presence of interunit carbon-carbon bonds within native lignin, and further by formation of such linkages during lignin extraction. We report that adding formaldehyde during biomass pretreatment produces a soluble lignin fraction that can be converted to guaiacyl and syringyl monomers at near theoretical yields during subsequent hydrogenolysis (47 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mole</span></strong> % of Klason lignin for beech and 78 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mole</span></strong> % for a high-syringyl transgenic poplar). These yields were three to seven times those obtained without formaldehyde, which prevented lignin condensation by forming 1,3-dioxane structures with lignin side-chain hydroxyl groups. By depolymerizing cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin separately, monomer yields were between 76 and 90 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mole</span></strong> % for these three major biomass fractions.</p>

Evolution of Ancient Functions in the Vertebrate Insulin-Like Growth Factor System Uncovered by Study of Duplicated Salmonid Fish Genomes
<p>Whole-genome dupli<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat</span></strong>ion (WGD) was experienced twice by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vertebr</span></strong>ate ancestor (2 rounds; 2R), again by the teleost fish ancestor (3R) and most recently in certain teleost lineages (4R). Consequently, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vertebr</span></strong>ate gene families are often expanded in 3R and 4R genomes. Arguably, many types of “functional divergence” present across 2R gene families will exceed that between 3R/4R paralogs of genes comprising 2R families. Accordingly, 4R offers a form of repli<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat</span></strong>ion of 2R. Examining whether this concept has impli<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat</span></strong>ions for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mole</span></strong>cular evolutionary research, we studied insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding proteins (IGFBPs), whose six 2R family members carry IGF hormones and regulate interactions between IGFs and IGF1-receptors (IGF1Rs). Using phylogenomic approaches, we resolved the complete IGFBP repertoire of 4R-derived salmonid fishes (19 genes; 13 more than human) and established evolutionary relationships/nomenclature with respect to WGDs. Traits central to IGFBP action were determined for all genes, including atomic interactions in IGFBP–IGF1/IGF2 complexes regulating IGF–IGF1R binding. Using statistical methods, we demonstrate that attributes of these protein interfaces are overwhelming a product of 2R IGFBP family membership, explain 49–68% of variation in <i>IGFBP</i> mRNA concentration in several different tissues, and strongly predict the strength and direction of <i>IGFBP</i> transcriptional regulation under differing nutritional states. The results support a model where <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vertebr</span></strong>ate IGFBP family members evolved divergent structural attributes to provide distinct competition for IGFs with IGF1Rs, predisposing different functions in the regulation of IGF signaling. Evolution of gene expression then acted to ensure the appropriate physiological production of IGFBPs according to their structural specializations, leading to optimal IGF-signaling according to nutritional-status and the endocrine/local mode of action. This study demonstrates that relatively recent gene family expansion can facilitate inference of functional evolution within ancient genetic systems.</p>

Molecular Evolution of α-Latrotoxin, the Exceptionally Potent Vertebrate Neurotoxin in Black Widow Spider Venom
<p>Black widow spiders (members of the genus <i>Latrodectus</i>) are widely feared because of their potent neurotoxic venom. α-Latrotoxin is the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vertebr</span></strong>ate-specific toxin responsible for the dramatic effects of black widow envenomation. The evolution of this toxin is enigmatic because only two α-latrotoxin sequences are known. In this study, ∼4 kb α-latrotoxin sequences and their homologs were characterized from a diversity of <i>Latrodectus</i> species, and representatives of <i>Steatoda</i> and <i>Parasteatoda</i>, establishing the wide distribution of latrotoxins across the mega-diverse spider family Theridiidae. Across black widow species, α-latrotoxin shows ≥94% nucleotide identity and variability consistent with purifying selection. Multiple codon and branch-specific estimates of the nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution rate ratio also suggest a long history of purifying selection has acted on α-latrotoxin across <i>Latrodectus</i> and <i>Steatoda</i>. However, α-latrotoxin is highly divergent in amino acid sequence between these genera, with 68.7% of protein differences involving non-conservative substitutions, evidence for positive selection on its physiochemical properties and particular codons, and an elevated rate of nonsynonymous substitutions along α-latrotoxin’s <i>Latrodectus</i> branch. Such variation likely explains the efficacy of red-back spider, <i>L. hasselti</i>, antivenom in treating bites from other <i>Latrodectus</i> species, and the weaker neurotoxic symptoms associated with <i>Steatoda</i> and <i>Parasteatoda</i> bites. Long-term purifying selection on α-latrotoxin indi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat</span></strong>es its functional importance in black widow venom, even though <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vertebr</span></strong>ates are a small fraction of their diet. The greater differences between <i>Latrodectus</i> and <i>Steatoda</i> α-latrotoxin, and their relationships to in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vertebr</span></strong>ate-specific latrotoxins, suggest a shift in α-latrotoxin toward increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vertebr</span></strong>ate toxicity coincident with the evolution of widow spiders.</p>

During torpor, the relationship between <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> and <i>T</i><sub>a</sub> was curvilinear, and at low <i>T</i><sub>sub</sub> (~6°C), <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> fell to a minimum average of 8 beats min<sup>−1</sup>. The minimum average values for both [Formula] and <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> in torpor reported here were among the lowest recorded for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bat</span></strong>s. The relationship between <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> and [Formula] was significant for both resting (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup>=0.64, <i>P</i><0.001) and torpid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bat</span></strong>s (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup>=0.84, <i>P</i><0.001), with no overlap between the two states.

Can bees see at a glance?
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">primat</span></strong>es can analyse visual scenes extremely rapidly, making accurate decisions for presentation times of only 20 ms. We asked whether bumblebees, despite having potentially more limited processing power, could similarly detect and discriminate visual patterns presented for durations of 100 ms or less. Bumblebees detected stimuli and discriminated between differently oriented and coloured stimuli when presented as briefly as 25 ms but failed to identify ecologically relevant shapes (predatory spiders on flowers) even when presented for 100 ms. This suggests an important difference between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">primat</span></strong>e and insect visual processing, so that while <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">primat</span></strong>es can capture entire visual scenes ‘at a glance’, insects might have to rely on continuous online sampling of the world around them, using a process of active vision, which requires longer integration times.</p>

Convergence in morphology and masticatory function between the pharyngeal jaws of grass carp, <i>Ctenopharyngodon idella</i>, and oral jaws of amniote herbivores
<p>The cellulose-rich walls that protect plant cells are difficult to digest, and therefore mechanical food processing is a key aspect of herbivory across <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vertebr</span></strong>ates. Cell walls are typically broken down by translation of flattened teeth in the occlusal plane (i.e. grinding) as part of a complex, rhythmic chewing stroke. The grass carp, <i>Ctenopharyngodon idella</i>, is a voracious, invasive herbivorous fish that relies solely on its pharyngeal teeth, lo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat</span></strong>ed in the back of the throat, for mechanical processing of plant material. Here, we describe the musculoskeletal anatomy of the pharyngeal jaws of grass carp and use XROMM to quantify chewing kinematics and muscle strain. The pharyngeal jaws are suspended in a sling of 11 muscles and maintain no bony articulation with any other skeletal elements in the head. The jaws <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong> long, serrated teeth that are worn during use into flattened tooth cusps. Our kinematic data show that this wear is the result of the teeth being elevated into occlusion against the basioccipital process and keratinous chewing pad, not tooth-on-tooth occlusion. Pharyngeal jaw elevation results from large strains in the jaw elevator muscle, the levator arcus branchialis V, to drive a pulley-like mechanism that rotates the jaws about a pivot point at the symphysis between the left and right pharyngeal jaws. These complex, rhythmic jaw rotations translate the teeth laterally across the chewing surface throughout the occlusion phase. The grass carp chewing system is strikingly similar in gross morphology and masti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat</span></strong>ory function to herbivorous chewing strategies in other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vertebr</span></strong>ates.</p>

Ten-year follow-up study of three alternative bearing surfaces used in total hip arthroplasty in young patients
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We present the ten-year data of a cohort of patients, aged between   18 and 65 years (mean age 52.7 years; 19 to 64), who underwent total   hip arthroplasty. Patients were randomised to be treated with a   cobalt-chrome (CoCr) femoral head with an ultra-high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mole</span></strong>cular weight   polyethylene (UHMWPE), highly cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) or   ceramic-on-ceramic (CoC) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>ing surface.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 102 hips (91 patients) were randomised into the three   groups. At ten years, 97 hips were available for radiological and   functional follow-up. Two hips (two patients) had been revised (one   with deep infection and one for periprosthetic fracture) and three   were lost to follow-up.

Volumetric wear was also significantly reduced in the   XLPE group (29.29 mm<sup>3</sup>/yr) compared with the UHMWPE group   (100.75mm<sup>3</sup>/yr) (p = 0.0001). There were six patients   with UHMWPE who had non-progressive osteolysis and none in the XLPE   group. All three <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>ing groups had significant improvements in   12-item short form health survey scores, Western Ontario and McMaster   Universities Osteoarthritis Index score and Harris Hip Score. However,   the improvement in HSS was significantly less in the UHMWPE group   (p = 0.0188) than in the other two groups.</p><p>At ten years, the rates of volumetric and linear wear in the   XLPE group remain low and predominantly below the estimated threshold   for osteolysis (1 mm/yr). The rate of linear wear in the XLPE group   was three times less than in the UHMWPE group at five-year follow-up   and five times less at ten years. The rate of volumetric wear was also   three times less in the XLPE group at ten years.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>While CoC also performs well, XLPE at ten years remains a safe   and excellent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>ing option in young patients, with low rates of   wear and no evidence of osteolysis.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1590–5.</p></sec>

Rewiring metabolism under oxygen deprivation
<p>When faced with a reduced availability of oxygen in the environment (hypoxia), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vertebr</span></strong>ates can make a variety of respiratory, cardiovascular, and hematological adjustments to ensure an uninterrupted supply of oxygen to the cells of metabolizing tissues (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). These are adaptive solutions for “aerobic organisms in an aerobic world” (<i>3</i>). Coping with the complete absence of oxygen (anoxia) requires more fundamental alterations of cellular metabolism that are typically nothing more than emergency stopgap measures to buy time until the oxygen supply is (hopefully) reestablished (<i>4</i>). On page 307 of this issue, Park <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) identify a new champion of anoxia tolerance among mammals—the naked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mole</span></strong>-rat.</p>

Coordination-induced weakening of ammonia, water, and hydrazine X–H bonds in a molybdenum complex
<p>Although scores of transition metal complexes incorporating ammonia or water ligands have been characterized over the past century, little is known about how coordination influences the strength of the nitrogen-hydrogen and oxygen-hydrogen bonds. Here we report the synthesis of a molybdenum ammonia complex supported by terpyridine and phosphine ligands that lowers the nitrogen-hydrogen bond dissociation free energy from 99.5 (gas phase) to an experimentally measured value of 45.8 kilocalories per <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mole</span></strong> (agreeing closely with a value of 45.1 kilocalories per <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mole</span></strong> calculated by density functional theory). This bond weakening enables spontaneous dihydrogen evolution upon gentle heating, as well as the hydrogenation of styrene. Analogous molybdenum complexes promote dihydrogen evolution from coordinated water and hydrazine. Electrochemical and theoretical studies elucidate the contributions of metal redox potential and ammonia acidity to this effect.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Global Analysis of Gene Expression in Response to Whole-Chromosome Aneuploidy in Hexaploid Wheat
<p>Aneuploidy, a condition of unbalanced chromosome content, represents a large-effect mutation that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong>s significant relevance to human health and microbe adaptation. As such, extensive studies of aneuploidy have been conducted in unicellular model organisms and cancer cells. Aneuploidy also frequently is associated with plant polyploidization, but its impact on gene expression and its relevance to polyploid genome evolution/functional innovation remain largely unknown. Here, we used a panel of diverse types of whole-chromosome aneuploidy of hexaploid wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>), all under the common genetic background of cv Chinese Spring, to systemically investigate the impact of aneuploidy on genome-, subgenome-, and chromosome-wide gene expression. Compared with prior findings in haploid or diploid aneuploid systems, we unravel additional and novel features of alteration in global gene expression resulting from the two major impacts of aneuploidy, cis- and trans-regulation, as well as dosage compensation. We show that the expression-altered genes map evenly along each chromosome, with no evidence for coregulating aggregated expression domains. However, chromosomes and subgenomes in hexaploid wheat are unequal in their responses to aneuploidy with respect to the number of genes being dysregulated. Strikingly, homeologous chromosomes do not differ from nonhomologous chromosomes in terms of aneuploidy-induced trans-acting effects, suggesting that the three constituent subgenomes of hexaploid wheat are largely uncoupled at the transcriptional level of gene regulation. Together, our findings shed new insights into the functional interplay between homeologous chromosomes and interactions between subgenomes in hexaploid wheat, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bear</span></strong> impli<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat</span></strong>ions to further our understanding of allopolyploid genome evolution and efforts in breeding new allopolyploid crops.</p>

Gene Tree Discordance Can Generate Patterns of Diminishing Convergence over Time
<p>Phenotypic convergence is an exciting outcome of adaptive evolution, occurring when different species find similar solutions to the same problem. Unraveling the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mole</span></strong>cular basis of convergence provides a way to link genotype to adaptive phenotypes, but can also shed light on the extent to which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mole</span></strong>cular evolution is repeatable and predictable. Many recent genome-wide studies have uncovered a striking pattern of diminishing convergence over time, ascribing this pattern to the presence of intra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mole</span></strong>cular epistatic interactions. Here, we consider gene tree discordance as an alternative cause of changes in convergence levels over time in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">primat</span></strong>e dataset. We demonstrate that gene tree discordance can produce patterns of diminishing convergence by itself, and that controlling for discordance as a cause of apparent convergence makes the pattern disappear. We also show that synonymous substitutions, where neither selection nor epistasis should be prevalent, have the same diminishing pattern of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mole</span></strong>cular convergence in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">primat</span></strong>es. Finally, we demonstrate that even in situations where biological discordance is not possible, discordance due to errors in species tree inference can drive similar patterns. Though intra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mole</span></strong>cular epistasis could in principle create a pattern of declining convergence over time, our results suggest a possible alternative explanation for this widespread pattern. These results contribute to a growing appreciation not just of the presence of gene tree discordance, but of the unpredictable effects this discordance can have on analyses of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mole</span></strong>cular evolution.</p>

Whole-Genome Sequencing of Tibetan Macaque (<i>Macaca thibetana</i>) Provides New Insight into the Macaque Evolutionary History
<p>Macaques are the most widely distributed nonhuman <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">primat</span></strong>es and used as animal models in biomedical research. The availability of full-genome sequences from them would be essential to both biomedical and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">primat</span></strong>e evolutionary studies. Previous studies have reported whole-genome sequences from rhesus macaque (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>) and cynomolgus macaque (<i>M. fascicularis</i>, CE), both of which belong to the <i>fascicularis</i> group. Here, we present a 37-fold coverage genome sequence of the Tibetan macaque (<i>M. thibetana</i>; TM). TM is an endemic species to China belonging to the <i>sinica</i> group<i>.</i> On the basis of mapping to the rhesus macaque genome, we identified approximately 11.9 million single-nucleotide variants), of which 3.9 million were TM specific, as assessed by comparison two Chinese rhesus macaques (CR) and two CE genomes. Some genes carried TM-specific homozygous nonsynonymous variants (TSHNVs), which were scored as deleterious in human by both PolyPhen-2 and SIFT (Sorting Tolerant From Intolerant) and were enriched in the eye disease genes. In total, 273 immune response and disease-related genes carried at least one TSHNV. The heterozygosity rates of two CRs (0.002617 and 0.002612) and two CEs (0.003004 and 0.003179) were approximately three times higher than that of TM (0.000898). Polymerase chain reaction resequencing of 18 TM individuals showed that 29 TSHNVs exhibited high allele frequencies, thus confirming their low heterozygosity. Genome-wide genetic divergence analysis demonstrated that TM was more closely related to CR than to CE. We further detected unusual low divergence regions between TM and CR. In addition, after applying statistical criteria to detect putative introgression regions (PIRs) in the TM genome, up to 239,620 kb PIRs (8.84% of the genome) were identified. Given that TM and CR have overlapping geographical distributions, had the same refuge during the Middle Pleistocene, and show similar mating behaviors, it is highly likely that there was an ancient introgression event between them. Moreover, demographic inferences revealed that TM exhibited a similar demographic history as other macaques until 0.5 Ma, but then it maintained a lower effective population size until present time. Our study has provided new insight into the macaque evolutionary history, confirming hybridization events between macaque species groups based on genome-wide data.</p>

Expansion of Secretin-Like G Protein-Coupled Receptors and Their Peptide Ligands via Local Duplications Before and After Two Rounds of Whole-Genome Duplication
<p>In humans, the secretin-like G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family comprises 15 members with 18 corresponding peptide ligand genes. Although members have been identified in a large variety of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vertebr</span></strong>ate and non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vertebr</span></strong>ate species, the origin and relationship of these proteins remain unresolved. To address this issue, we employed large-scale genome comparisons to identify genome fragments with conserved synteny and matched these fragments to linkage groups in reconstructed early gnathostome ancestral chromosomes (<i>GAC</i>). This genome comparison revealed that most receptor and peptide genes were clustered in three <i>GAC</i> linkage groups and suggested that the ancestral forms of five peptide subfamilies (corticotropin-releasing hormone-like, calcitonin-like, parathyroid hormone-like, glucagon-like, and growth hormone-releasing hormone-like) and their cognate receptor families emerged through tandem local gene dupli<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat</span></strong>ions before two rounds (2R) of whole-genome dupli<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat</span></strong>ion. These subfamily genes have, then, been amplified by 2R whole-genome dupli<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat</span></strong>ion, followed by additional local dupli<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat</span></strong>ions and gene loss prior to the divergence of land <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vertebr</span></strong>ates and teleosts. This study delineates a possible evolutionary scenario for whole secretin-like peptide and receptor family members and may shed light on evolutionary mechanisms for expansion of a gene family with a large number of paralogs.</p>

The Developmental Brain Gene <i>NPAS3</i> Contains the Largest Number of Accelerated Regulatory Sequences in the Human Genome
<p>To identify the evolutionary genetic novelties that contributed to shape human-specific traits such as the use of a complex language, long-term planning and exceptional learning abilities is one of the ultimate frontiers of modern biology. Evolutionary signatures of functional shifts could be detected by comparing noncoding regions that are highly conserved across mammals or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">primat</span></strong>es and rapidly accumulated nucleotide substitutions only in the lineage leading to humans. As gene loci densely populated with human-accelerated elements (HAEs) are more likely to have contributed to human-specific novelties, we sought to identify the transcriptional units and genomic 1 Mb intervals of the entire human genome carrying the highest number of HAEs. To this end, we took advantage of four available data sets of human genomic accelerated regions obtained through different comparisons and algorithms and performed a meta-analysis of the combined data. We found that the brain developmental transcription factor <i>neuronal PAS domain-containing protein 3</i> (<i>NPAS3</i>) contains the largest cluster of noncoding-accelerated regions in the human genome with up to 14 elements that are highly conserved in mammals, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">primat</span></strong>es, but carry human-specific nucleotide substitutions. We then tested the ability of the 14 HAEs identified at the <i>NPAS3</i> locus to act as transcriptional regulatory sequences in a reporter expression assay performed in transgenic zebrafish. We found that 11 out of the 14 HAEs present in <i>NPAS3</i> act as transcriptional enhancers during development, particularly within the nervous system. As <i>NPAS3</i> is known to play a crucial role during mammalian brain development, our results indi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cat</span></strong>e that the high density of HAEs present in the human <i>NPAS3</i> locus could have modified the spatiotemporal expression pattern of <i>NPAS3</i> in the developing human brain and, therefore, contributed to human brain evolution.</p>

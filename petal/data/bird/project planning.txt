Vectorial representation of spatial goals in the hippocampus of bats
<p>To navigate, animals need to represent not only their own position and orientation, but also the location of their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">goal</span></strong>. Neural representations of an animal’s own position and orientation have been extensively studied. However, it is unknown how navigational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">goal</span></strong>s are encoded in the brain. We recorded from hippocampal CA1 neurons of bats flying in complex trajectories toward a spatial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">goal</span></strong>. We discovered a subpopulation of neurons with angular tuning to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">goal</span></strong> direction. Many of these neurons were tuned to an occluded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">goal</span></strong>, suggesting that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">goal</span></strong>-direction representation is memory-based. We also found cells that encoded the distance to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">goal</span></strong>, often in conjunction with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">goal</span></strong> direction. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">goal</span></strong>-direction and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">goal</span></strong>-distance signals make up a vectorial representation of spatial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">goal</span></strong>s, suggesting a previously unrecognized neuronal mechanism for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">goal</span></strong>-directed navigation.</p>

Coronary Artery Calcium to Guide a Personalized Risk-Based Approach to Initiation and Intensification of Antihypertensive Therapy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The use of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk to personalize systolic blood pressure (SBP) treatment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">goal</span></strong>s is a topic of increasing interest. Therefore, we studied whether coronary artery calcium (CAC) can further guide the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation of anti-hypertensive treatment intensity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We included 3733 participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) with SBP between 120 and 179 mm Hg. Within subgroups categorized by both SBP (120–139 mm Hg, 140–159 mm Hg, and 160–179 mm Hg) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated 10-year ASCVD risk (using the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Assocation pooled-cohort equations), we compared multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios for the composite outcome of incident ASCVD or heart failure after further stratifying by CAC (0, 1–100, or >100). We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated 10-year number-needed-to-treat for an intensive SBP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">goal</span></strong> of 120 mm Hg by applying the treatment benefit recorded in meta-analyses to event rates within CAC strata.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The mean age was 65 years, and 642 composite events took place over a median of 10.2 years. In persons with SBP <160 mm Hg, CAC stratified risk for events. For example, among those with an ASCVD risk of <15% and who had an SBP of either 120 to 139 mm Hg or 140 to 159 mm Hg, respectively, we found increasing hazard ratios for events with CAC 1 to 100 (1.7 [95% confidence interval, 1.0–2.6] or 2.0 [1.1–3.8]) and CAC >100 (3.0 [1.8–5.0] or 5.7 [2.9–11.0]), all relative to CAC=0. There appeared to be no statistical association between CAC and events when SBP was 160 to 179 mm Hg, irrespective of ASCVD risk level. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated 10-year number-needed-to-treat for a SBP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">goal</span></strong> of 120mmHg varied substantially according to CAC levels when predicted ASCVD risk <15% and SBP <160mmHg (eg, 10-year number-needed-to-treat of 99 for CAC=0 and 24 for CAC>100, when SBP 120-139mm Hg). However, few participants with ASCVD risk <5% had elevated CAC. Furthermore, 10-year number-needed-to-treat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ates were consistently low and varied less among CAC strata when SBP was 160 to 179 mm Hg or when ASCVD risk was ≥15% at any SBP level.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Combined CAC imaging and assessment of global ASCVD risk has the potential to guide personalized SBP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">goal</span></strong>s (eg, choosing a traditional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">goal</span></strong> of 140 or a more intensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">goal</span></strong> of 120 mm Hg), particularly among adults with an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated ASCVD risk of 5% to 15% and prehypertension or mild hypertension.</p></sec>

Fasting Versus Nonfasting and Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Accuracy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Recent recommendations favoring nonfasting lipid assessment may affect low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ation. The novel method of LDL-C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ation (LDL-C<sub>N</sub>) uses a flexible approach to derive patient-specific ratios of triglycerides to very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. This adaptability may confer an accuracy advantage in nonfasting patients over the fixed approach of the classic Friedewald method (LDL-C<sub>F</sub>).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used a US cross-sectional sample of 1 545  634 patients (959 153 fasting ≥10–12 hours; 586 481 nonfasting) from the second harvest of the Very Large Database of Lipids study to assess for the first time the impact of fasting status on novel LDL-C accuracy. Rapid ultracentrifugation was used to directly measure LDL-C content (LDL-C<sub>D</sub>). Accuracy was defined as the percentage of LDL-C<sub>D</sub> falling within an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated LDL-C (LDL-C<sub>N</sub> or LDL-C<sub>F</sub>) category by clinical cut points. For low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated LDL-C (<70 mg/dL), we evaluated accuracy by triglyceride levels. The magnitude of absolute and percent differences between LDL-C<sub>D</sub> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated LDL-C (LDL-C<sub>N</sub> or LDL-C<sub>F</sub>) was stratified by LDL-C and triglyceride categories.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In both fasting and nonfasting samples, accuracy was higher with the novel method across all clinical LDL-C categories (range, 87%–94%) compared with the Friedewald <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ation (range, 71%–93%; <i>P</i>≤0.001). With LDL-C <70 mg/dL, nonfasting LDL-C<sub>N</sub> accuracy (92%) was superior to LDL-C<sub>F</sub> accuracy (71%; <i>P</i><0.001). In this LDL-C range, 19% of fasting and 30% of nonfasting patients had differences ≥10 mg/dL between LDL-C<sub>F</sub> and LDL-C<sub>D</sub>, whereas only 2% and 3% of patients, respectively, had similar differences with novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ation. Accuracy of LDL-C <70 mg/dL further decreased as triglycerides increased, particularly for Friedewald <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ation (range, 37%–96%) versus the novel method (range, 82%–94%). With triglycerides of 200 to 399 mg/dL in nonfasting patients, LDL-C<sub>N</sub> <70 mg/dL accuracy (82%) was superior to LDL-C<sub>F</sub> (37%; <i>P</i><0.001). In this triglyceride range, 73% of fasting and 81% of nonfasting patients had ≥10 mg/dL differences between LDL-C<sub>F</sub> and LDL-C<sub>D</sub> compared with 25% and 20% of patients, respectively, with LDL-C<sub>N</sub>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Novel adaptable LDL-C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ation performs better in nonfasting samples than the fixed Friedewald <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ation, with a particular accuracy advantage in settings of low LDL-C and high triglycerides.

Use of a Single Baseline Versus Multiyear 24-Hour Urine Collection for Estimation of Long-Term Sodium Intake and Associated Cardiovascular and Renal Risk
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>A decrease in sodium intake has been shown to lower blood pressure, but data from cohort studies on the association with cardiovascular and renal outcomes are inconsistent. In these studies, sodium intake was often <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated with a single baseline measurement, which may be inaccurate considering day-to-day changes in sodium intake and sodium excretion. We compared the effects of single versus repetitive follow-up 24-hour urine samples on the relation between sodium intake and long-term cardiorenal outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We selected adult subjects with an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated glomerular filtration rate >60 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>, an outpatient 24-hour urine sample between 1998 and 1999, and at least 1 collection during a 17-year follow-up. Sodium intake was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated with a single baseline collection and the average of samples collected during a 1-, 5-, and 15-year follow-up. We used Cox regression analysis and the landmark approach to investigate the relation between sodium intake and cardiovascular (cardiovascular events or mortality) and renal (end-stage renal disease: dialysis, transplantation, and/or >60% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated glomerular filtration rate decline, or mortality) outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We included 574 subjects with 9776 twenty-four–hour urine samples. Average age was 47 years, and 46% were male. Median follow-up was 16.2 years. Average 24-hour sodium excretion, ranging from 3.8 to 3.9 g (165–170 mmol), was equal among all methods (<i>P</i>=0.88). However, relative to a single baseline measurement, 50% of the subjects had a >0.8-g (>34-mmol) difference in sodium intake with long-term <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ations. As a result, 45%, 49%, and 50% of all subjects switched between tertiles of sodium intake when the 1-, 5-, or 15-year average was used, respectively. Consequently, hazard ratios for cardiorenal outcome changed up to 85% with the use of sodium intake <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ations from short-term (1-year) and long-term (5-year) follow-up instead of baseline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ations.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Relative to a single baseline 24-hour sodium measurement, the use of subsequent 24-hour urine samples resulted in different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ations of an individual’s sodium intake, whereas population averages remained similar.

An Evidence-Based Medicine Approach to Antihyperglycemic Therapy in Diabetes Mellitus to Overcome Overtreatment
<p>Overtreatment is pervasive in medicine and leads to potential patient harms and excessive costs in health care. Although evidence-based medicine is often derided as practice by rote algorithmic medicine, the appropriate application of key evidence-based medicine principles in clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decis</span></strong>ion making is fundamental to preventing overtreatment and promoting high-value, individualized patient-centered care. Specifically, this article discusses the importance of (1) using absolute rather than relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ates of benefits to inform treatment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decis</span></strong>ions; (2) considering the time horizon to benefit of treatments; (3) balancing potential harms and benefits; and (4) using shared <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decis</span></strong>ion making by physicians to incorporate the patient’s values and preferences into treatment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decis</span></strong>ions. Here, we illustrate the application of these principles to considering the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decis</span></strong>ion of whether or not to recommend intensive glycemic control to patients to minimize microvascular and cardiovascular complications in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Through this lens, this example will illustrate how an evidence-based medicine approach can be used to individualize glycemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">goal</span></strong>s and prevent overtreatment, and can serve as a template for applying evidence-based medicine to inform treatment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decis</span></strong>ions for other conditions to optimize health and individualize patient care.</p>

Lack of Concordance Between Empirical Scores and Physician Assessments of Stroke and Bleeding Risk in Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Physicians treating patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) must weigh the benefits of anticoagulation in preventing stroke versus the risk of bleeding. Although empirical models have been developed to predict such risks, the degree to which these coincide with clinicians’ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ates is unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We examined 10 094 AF patients enrolled in the Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of AF (ORBIT-AF) registry between June 2010 and August 2011. Empirical stroke and bleeding risks were assessed by using the congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥75 years, diabetes mellitus, and previous stroke or transient ischemic attack (CHADS<sub>2</sub>) and Anticoagulation and Risk Factors in Atrial Fibrillation (ATRIA) scores, respectively. Separately, physicians were asked to categorize their patients’ stroke and bleeding risks: low risk (<3%); intermediate risk (3%–6%); and high risk (>6%). Overall, 72% (n=7251) in ORBIT-AF had high-risk CHADS<sub>2</sub> scores (≥2). However, only 16% were assessed as high stroke risk by physicians. Although 17% (n=1749) had high ATRIA bleeding risk (score ≥5), only 7% (n=719) were considered so by physicians. The associations between empirical and physician-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated stroke and bleeding risks were low (weighted Kappa 0.1 and 0.11, respectively). Physicians weighed hypertension, heart failure, and diabetes mellitus less significantly than empirical models in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ating stroke risk; physicians weighted anemia and dialysis less significantly than empirical models when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ating bleeding risks.

Direct Determination of the Mutation Rate in the Bumblebee Reveals Evidence for Weak Recombination-Associated Mutation and an Approximate Rate Constancy in Insects
<p>Accurate knowledge of the mutation rate provides a base line for inferring expected rates of evolution, for testing evolutionary hypotheses and for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ation of key parameters. Advances in sequencing technology now permit direct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ates of the mutation rate from sequencing of close relatives. Within insects there have been three prior such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ates, two in nonsocial insects (<i>Drosophila</i>: 2.8 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> per bp per haploid genome per generation; <i>Heliconius</i>: 2.9 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>) and one in a social species, the honeybee (3.4 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>). Might the honeybee’s rate be ∼20% higher because it has an exceptionally high recombination rate and recombination may be directly or indirectly mutagenic? To address this possibility, we provide a direct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ate of the mutation rate in the bumblebee (<i>Bombus terrestris</i>), this being a close relative of the honeybee but with a much lower recombination rate. We confirm that the crossover rate of the bumblebee is indeed much lower than honeybees (8.7 cM/Mb vs. 37 cM/Mb). Importantly, we find no significant difference in the mutation rates: we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ate for bumblebees a rate of 3.6 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> per haploid genome per generation (95% confidence intervals 2.38 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> and 5.37 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>) which is just 5% higher than the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ate that of honeybees. Both genomes have approximately one new mutation per haploid genome per generation. While we find evidence for a direct coupling between recombination and mutation (also seen in honeybees), the effect is so weak as to leave almost no footprint on any between-species differences. The similarity in mutation rates suggests an approximate constancy of the mutation rate in insects.</p>

Acclimation of <i>Betula alleghaniensis</i> Britton to moderate soil water deficit: small morphological changes make for important consequences in crown display
<p>In the context of the predicted increasing frequency of summer droughts in the northeastern deciduous forest of North America due to climate change, we investigated the acclimation capacity of yellow birch, an economically important native tree species, to soil water deficit. We carried out an integrated examination of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation of biomass, leaf physiology, branching pattern and in situ 3D crown display. Potted seedlings were subjected to moderate soil water deficit for four consecutive months during their second growing season. Individuals under soil water deficit showed a 40% decrease in biomass accumulation but no change in the relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation of biomass to the different plant compartments. Net CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rates at leaf level decreased under water deficit (~15%) but could not alone explain the total reduction in growth, excluding the carbon starvation hypothesis. The observed reduction in net CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rates was related to a decrease in stomatal conductance and chlorophyll content. <i>STAR</i><sub>zen</sub> (in situ silhouette to total leaf area ratio; a proxy for light interception efficiency) decreased under soil water deficit due to shifts in biomass <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation within the branch compartment from long upper axes to short bottom axes. Despite the fact that the understanding of the processes involved in growth reduction and branching pattern alteration will need more attention in future research, we conclude that under water deficit yellow birch at young stages will: (i) experience a substantial loss of growth and biomass; and (ii) acclimate through architectural plasticity rather than through changes in the relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation of root biomass to enhance its water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement.</p>

Reproduction-related variation in carbon allocation to woody tissues in <i>Fagus crenata</i> using a natural <sup>13</sup>C approach
<p>The contribution of new photo-assimilates and stored carbon (C) to plant growth remains poorly understood, especially during reproduction. In order to elucidate how mast seeding affects C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation to both reproductive and vegetative tissues, we measured biomass increase in each tissue, branch starch concentration and stable C isotope composition (δ<sup>13</sup>C) in bulk leaves, current-year shoots, 3-year branches and tree rings in fruiting and non-fruiting trees for 2 years, as well as in fruits. We isolated the effect of reproduction on C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation to vegetative growth by comparing <sup>13</sup>C enrichment in woody tissues in fruiting and non-fruiting specimens. Compared with 2‰ <sup>13</sup>C enrichment in shoots relative to leaves from non-fruiting trees, fruiting reduced the enrichment to 1‰ and this reduction disappeared in the following year with no fruiting, indicating that new photo-assimilates are preferentially used for woody tissues even with fruiting burden. In contrast, fruits had up to 2.5‰ <sup>13</sup>C enrichment at mid-summer, which dropped thereafter, indicating that fruit production relies on C storage early in the growing season then shifts to current photo-assimilates. At this tipping point, growth of shoots and cupules had almost finished and nuts had a second rapid growth period thereafter. Together with shorter shoots but higher biomass increment per length in fruiting trees than non-fruiting trees, these results indicate that the C limitation due to fruit burden is minimized by fine-tuning of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation of old C stores and new photo-assimilates, along with the growth pattern in various tissues. Furthermore, fruiting had no significant effect on starch concentration in 3-year-old branches, which became fully depleted during leaf and flower flushing but were quickly replenished. These results indicate that reproduction affects C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation to branches but not its source or storage. These reproduction-related variations in the fate of C have implications for evaluating forest ecosystem C cycles during climate change.</p>

Shouldering responsibility
<p>A key element of leadership is the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decis</span></strong>ion to shoulder responsibility for the welfare of others, whether they are one's family, a political party, or, as with heads of state, the entire country. In animal groups such as fish shoals or bird flocks, leadership may passively result from simple coordination principles (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). By contrast, human leaders often actively make <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decis</span></strong>ions on behalf of others. Although previous work has identified factors that predict those who will end up as leaders (<i>3</i>), it remains unclear how leaders decide to shoulder responsibility. On page 467 of this issue, Edelson <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) provide further understanding on the psychological and neural processes engaged when someone decides to lead. They show that such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decis</span></strong>ions are intimately linked to our confidence in making <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decis</span></strong>ions for others.</p>

Sensitivity to “sunk costs” in mice, rats, and humans
<p>Sunk costs are irrecoverable investments that should not influence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decis</span></strong>ions, because <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decis</span></strong>ions should be made on the basis of expected future consequences. Both human and nonhuman animals can show sensitivity to sunk costs, but reports from across species are inconsistent. In a temporal context, a sensitivity to sunk costs arises when an individual resists ending an activity, even if it seems unproductive, because of the time already invested. In two parallel foraging tasks that we designed, we found that mice, rats, and humans show similar sensitivities to sunk costs in their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decis</span></strong>ion-making. Unexpectedly, sensitivity to time invested accrued only after an initial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decis</span></strong>ion had been made. These findings suggest that sensitivity to temporal sunk costs lies in a vulnerability distinct from deliberation processes and that this distinction is present across species.</p>

Legacy nitrogen may prevent achievement of water quality goals in the Gulf of Mexico

However, to date there has been no rigorous assessment of the effect of N legacies on achieving water quality <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">goal</span></strong>s. In this study, we show that even if agricultural N use became 100% efficient, it would take decades to meet target N loads due to legacy N within the Mississippi River basin.

Plastic waste associated with disease on coral reefs
<p>Plastic waste can promote microbial colonization by pathogens implicated in outbreaks of disease in the ocean. We assessed the influence of plastic waste on disease risk in 124,000 reef-building corals from 159 reefs in the Asia-Pacific region. The likelihood of disease increases from 4% to 89% when corals are in contact with plastic. Structurally complex corals are eight times more likely to be affected by plastic, suggesting that microhabitats for reef-associated organisms and valuable fisheries will be disproportionately affected. Plastic levels on coral reefs correspond to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ates of terrestrial mis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ed plastic waste entering the ocean. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ate that 11.1 billion plastic items are entangled on coral reefs across the Asia-Pacific and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">project</span></strong> this number to increase 40% by 2025.

Ten-month-old infants infer the value of goals from the costs of actions
<p>Infants understand that people pursue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">goal</span></strong>s, but how do they learn which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">goal</span></strong>s people prefer? We tested whether infants solve this problem by inverting a mental model of action planning, trading off the costs of acting against the rewards actions bring. After seeing an agent attain two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">goal</span></strong>s equally often at varying costs, infants expected the agent to prefer the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">goal</span></strong> it attained through costlier actions. These expectations held across three experiments that conveyed cost through different physical path features (height, width, and incline angle), suggesting that an abstract variable—such as “force,” “work,” or “effort”—supported infants’ inferences. We modeled infants’ expectations as Bayesian inferences over utility-theoretic calculations, providing a bridge to recent quantitative accounts of action understanding in older children and adults.</p>

Eutrophication will increase during the 21st century as a result of precipitation changes
<p>Eutrophication, or excessive nutrient enrichment, threatens water resources across the globe. We show that climate change–induced precipitation changes alone will substantially increase (19 ± 14%) riverine total nitrogen loading within the continental United States by the end of the century for the “business-as-usual” scenario. The impacts, driven by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">project</span></strong>ed increases in both total and extreme precipitation, will be especially strong for the Northeast and the corn belt of the United States. Offsetting this increase would require a 33 ± 24% reduction in nitrogen inputs, representing a massive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement challenge. Globally, changes in precipitation are especially likely to also exacerbate eutrophication in India, China, and Southeast Asia.

FoxP influences the speed and accuracy of a perceptual decision in <i>Drosophila</i>
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decis</span></strong>ions take time if information gradually accumulates to a response threshold, but the neural mechanisms of integration and thresholding are unknown. We characterized a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decis</span></strong>ion process in <i>Drosophila</i> that bears the behavioral signature of evidence accumulation. As stimulus contrast in trained odor discriminations decreased, reaction times increased and perceptual accuracy declined, in quantitative agreement with a drift-diffusion model. <i>FoxP</i> mutants took longer than wild-type flies to form <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decis</span></strong>ions of similar or reduced accuracy, especially in difficult, low-contrast tasks. RNA interference with <i>FoxP</i> expression in αβ core Kenyon cells, or the overexpression of a potassium conductance in these neurons, recapitulated the <i>FoxP</i> mutant phenotype.

Leaf Amino Acid Supply Affects Photosynthetic and Plant Nitrogen Use Efficiency under Nitrogen Stress
<p>The coordinated distribution of nitrogen to source leaves and sinks is essential for supporting leaf metabolism while also supplying sufficient nitrogen to seeds for development. This study aimed to understand how regulated amino acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation to leaves affects photosynthesis and overall plant nitrogen use efficiency in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and how soil nitrogen availability influences these processes. Arabidopsis plants with a knockout of <i>AAP2</i>, encoding an amino acid permease involved in xylem-to-phloem transfer of root-derived amino acids, were grown in low-, moderate-, and high-nitrogen environments. We analyzed nitrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation to shoot tissues, photosynthesis, and photosynthetic and plant nitrogen use efficiency in these knockout plants. Our results demonstrate that, independent of nitrogen conditions, <i>aap2</i> plants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ate more nitrogen to leaves than wild-type plants. Increased leaf nitrogen supply positively affected chlorophyll and Rubisco levels, photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency, and carbon assimilation and transport to sinks. The <i>aap2</i> plants outperformed wild-type plants with respect to growth, seed yield and carbon storage pools, and nitrogen use efficiency in both high and deficient nitrogen environments. Overall, this study demonstrates that increasing nitrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation to leaves represents an effective strategy for improving carbon fixation and photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency. The results indicate that an optimized coordination of nitrogen and carbon partitioning processes is critical for high oilseed production in Arabidopsis, including in plants exposed to limiting nitrogen conditions.</p>

Population Parameters Underlying an Ongoing Soft Sweep in Southeast Asian Malaria Parasites
<p>Multiple <i>kelch13</i> alleles conferring artemisinin resistance (ART-R) are currently spreading through Southeast Asian malaria parasite populations, providing a unique opportunity to observe an ongoing soft selective sweep, investigate why resistance alleles have evolved multiple times and determine fundamental population genetic parameters for <i>Plasmodium</i>. We sequenced <i>kelch13</i> (<i>n</i> = 1,876), genotyped 75 flanking SNPs, and measured clearance rate (<i>n</i> = 3,552) in parasite infections from Western Thailand (2001–2014). We describe 32 independent coding mutations including common mutations outside the <i>kelch13</i> propeller associated with significant reductions in clearance rate. Mutations were first observed in 2003 and rose to 90% by 2014, consistent with a selection coefficient of ∼0.079. ART-R allele diversity rose until 2012 and then dropped as one allele (C580Y) spread to high frequency. The frequency with which adaptive alleles arise is determined by the rate of mutation and the population size. Two factors drive this soft sweep: (1) multiple <i>kelch13</i> amino-acid mutations confer resistance providing a large mutational target—we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ate the target is 87–163 bp. (2) The population mutation parameter (<i>Θ</i> = 2<i>N</i><sub>e</sub><i>μ</i>) can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated from the frequency distribution of ART-R alleles and is ∼5.69, suggesting that short term effective population size is 88 thousand to 1.2 million. This is 52–705 times greater than <i>N</i><sub>e</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated from fluctuation in allele frequencies, suggesting that we have previously under<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated the capacity for adaptive evolution in <i>Plasmodium</i>. Our central conclusions are that retrospective studies may under<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ate the complexity of selective events and the <i>N</i><sub>e</sub> relevant for adaptation for malaria is considerably higher than previously <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated.</p>

Impact of Novel Low-Density Lipoprotein-Cholesterol Assessment on the Utility of Secondary Non-High-Density Lipoprotein-C and Apolipoprotein B Targets in Selected Worldwide Dyslipidemia Guidelines

Building on the Accelerator-1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">project</span></strong>, we hypothesized that time to reperfusion could be further reduced with enhanced regional efforts.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Between April 2015 and March 2017, we worked with 12 metropolitan regions across the United States with 132 percutaneous coronary intervention–capable hospitals and 946 EMS agencies. Data were collected in the ACTION (Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Network)-Get With The Guidelines Registry for quarterly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mission</span></strong>: Lifeline reports. The primary end point was the change in the proportion of EMS-transported patients with first medical contact to device time ≤90 minutes from baseline to final quarter. We also compared treatment times and mortality with patients treated in hospitals not participating in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">project</span></strong> during the corresponding time period.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>During the study period, 10 730 patients were transported to percutaneous coronary intervention–capable hospitals, including 974 in the baseline quarter and 972 in the final quarter who met inclusion criteria. Median age was 61 years; 27% were women, 6% had cardiac arrest, and 6% had shock on ad<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mission</span></strong>; 10% were black, 12% were Latino, and 10% were uninsured. By the end of the intervention, all process measures reflecting coordination between EMS and hospitals had improved, including the proportion of patients with a first medical contact to device time of ≤90 minutes (67%–74%; <i>P</i><0.002), a first medical contact to device time to catheterization laboratory activation of ≤20 minutes (38%–56%; <i>P</i><0.0001), and emergency department dwell time of ≤20 minutes (33%–43%; <i>P</i><0.0001). Of the 12 regions, 9 regions reduced first medical contact to device time, and 8 met or exceeded the national <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">goal</span></strong> of 75% of patients treated in ≤90 minutes. Improvements in treatment times corresponded with a significant reduction in mortality (in-hospital death, 4.4%–2.3%; <i>P</i>=0.001) that was not apparent in hospitals not participating in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">project</span></strong> during the same time period.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Organization of care among EMS and hospitals in 12 regions was associated with significant reductions in time to reperfusion in patients with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction as well as in in-hospital mortality. These findings support a more intensive regional approach to emergency care for patients with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction.</p></sec>

The Cost-Effectiveness of Antibiotic Prophylaxis for Patients at Risk of Infective Endocarditis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In March 2008, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommended stopping antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) for those at risk of infective endocarditis (IE) undergoing dental procedures in the United Kingdom, citing a lack of evidence of efficacy and cost-effectiveness. We have performed a new economic evaluation of AP on the basis of contemporary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ates of efficacy, adverse events, and resource implications.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decis</span></strong>ion analytic cost-effectiveness model was used. Health service costs and benefits (measured as quality-adjusted life-years) were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated. Rates of IE before and after the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance were available to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ate prophylactic efficacy. AP adverse event rates were derived from recent UK data, and resource implications were based on English Hospital Episode Statistics.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>AP was less costly and more effective than no AP for all patients at risk of IE. The results are sensitive to AP efficacy, but efficacy would have to be substantially lower for AP not to be cost-effective. AP was even more cost-effective in patients at high risk of IE. Only a marginal reduction in annual IE rates (1.44 cases in high-risk and 33 cases in all at-risk patients) would be required for AP to be considered cost-effective at £20 000 ($26 600) per quality-adjusted life-year. Annual cost savings of £5.5 to £8.2 million ($7.3–$10.9 million) and health gains >2600 quality-adjusted life-years could be achieved from reinstating AP in England.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>AP is cost-effective for preventing IE, particularly in those at high risk. These findings support the cost-effectiveness of guidelines recommending AP use in high-risk individuals.</p></sec>

Outcome of the Swedish Nationwide Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Screening Program
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>A general abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening program, targeting 65-year-old men, has gradually been introduced in Sweden since 2006 and reached nationwide coverage in 2015. The aim of this study was to determine the outcome of this program.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data on the number of invited and examined men, screening-detected AAAs, AAAs operated on, and surgical outcome were retrieved from all 21 Swedish counties for the years 2006 through 2014.

A linear regression analysis was used to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ate the effect on AAA-specific mortality among all men ≥65 years of age for the observed time period. The long-term effects were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">project</span></strong>ed by using a validated Markov model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 302 957 men aged 65 years invited, 84% attended. The prevalence of screening-detected AAA was 1.5%. After a mean of 4.5 years, 29% of patients with AAA had been operated on, with a 30-day mortality rate of 0.9% (1.3% after open repair and 0.3% after endovascular repair, <i>P</i><0.001). The introduction of screening was associated with a significant reduction in AAA-specific mortality (mean, 4.0% per year of screening, <i>P</i>=0.020). The number needed to screen and the number needed to operate on to prevent 1 premature death were 667 and 1.5, respectively. With a total population of 9.5 million, the Swedish national AAA-screening program was predicted to annually prevent 90 premature deaths from AAA and to gain 577 quality-adjusted life-years.

Cardiovascular Health Promotion in Children: Challenges and Opportunities for 2020 and Beyond: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association
<p>This document provides a pediatric-focused companion to “Defining and Setting National <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">goal</span></strong>s for Cardiovascular Health Promotion and Disease Reduction: The American Heart Association’s Strategic Impact <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">goal</span></strong> Through 2020 and Beyond,” focused on cardiovascular health promotion and disease reduction in adults and children. The principles detailed in the document reflect the American Heart Association’s new dynamic and proactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">goal</span></strong> to promote cardiovascular health throughout the life course. The primary focus is on adult cardiovascular health and disease prevention, but critical to achievement of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">goal</span></strong> is maintenance of ideal cardiovascular health from birth through childhood to young adulthood and beyond. Emphasis is placed on the fundamental principles and metrics that define cardiovascular health in children for the clinical or research setting, and a balanced and critical appraisal of the strengths and weaknesses of the cardiovascular health construct in children and adolescents is provided. Specifically, this document discusses 2 important factors: the promotion of ideal cardiovascular health in all children and the improvement of cardiovascular health metric scores in children currently classified as having poor or intermediate cardiovascular health. Other topics include the current status of cardiovascular health in US children, opportunities for the refinement of health metrics, improvement of health metric scores, and possibilities for promoting ideal cardiovascular health. Importantly, concerns about the suitability of using single thresholds to identify elevated cardiovascular risk throughout the childhood years and the limits of our current knowledge are noted, and suggestions for future directions and research are provided.</p>

Diagnosis and Treatment of Fetal Cardiac Disease
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">goal</span></strong> of this statement is to review available literature and to put forth a scientific statement on the current practice of fetal cardiac medicine, including the diagnosis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement of fetal cardiovascular disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>A writing group appointed by the American Heart Association reviewed the available literature pertaining to topics relevant to fetal cardiac medicine, including the diagnosis of congenital heart disease and arrhythmias, assessment of cardiac function and the cardiovascular system, and available treatment options. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association classification of recommendations and level of evidence for practice guidelines were applied to the current practice of fetal cardiac medicine. Recommendations relating to the specifics of fetal diagnosis, including the timing of referral for study, indications for referral, and experience suggested for performance and interpretation of studies, are presented. The components of a fetal echocardiogram are described in detail, including descriptions of the assessment of cardiac anatomy, cardiac function, and rhythm. Complementary modalities for fetal cardiac assessment are reviewed, including the use of advanced ultrasound techniques, fetal magnetic resonance imaging, and fetal magnetocardiography and electrocardiography for rhythm assessment. Models for parental counseling and a discussion of parental stress and depression assessments are reviewed. Available fetal therapies, including medical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement for arrhythmias or heart failure and closed or open intervention for diseases affecting the cardiovascular system such as twin–twin transfusion syndrome, lung masses, and vascular tumors, are highlighted. Catheter-based intervention strategies to prevent the progression of disease in utero are also discussed. Recommendations for delivery planning strategies for fetuses with congenital heart disease including models based on classification of disease severity and delivery room treatment will be highlighted.

The long-run poverty and gender impacts of mobile money
<p>Mobile money, a service that allows monetary value to be stored on a mobile phone and sent to other users via text messages, has been adopted by the vast majority of Kenyan households. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ate that access to the Kenyan mobile money system M-PESA increased per capita consumption levels and lifted 194,000 households, or 2% of Kenyan households, out of poverty. The impacts, which are more pronounced for female-headed households, appear to be driven by changes in financial behavior—in particular, increased financial resilience and saving—and labor market outcomes, such as occupational choice, especially for women, who moved out of agriculture and into business. Mobile money has therefore increased the efficiency of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation of consumption over time while allowing a more efficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation of labor, resulting in a meaningful reduction of poverty in Kenya.</p>

Dopamine neurons encode performance error in singing birds
<p>Many behaviors are learned through trial and error by matching performance to internal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">goal</span></strong>s. Yet neural mechanisms of performance evaluation remain poorly understood. We recorded basal ganglia–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">project</span></strong>ing dopamine neurons in singing zebra finches as we controlled perceived song quality with distorted auditory feedback. Dopamine activity was phasically suppressed after distorted syllables, consistent with a worse-than-predicted outcome, and was phasically activated at the precise moment of the song when a predicted distortion did not occur, consistent with a better-than-predicted outcome. Error response magnitude depended on distortion probability. Thus, dopaminergic error signals can evaluate behaviors that are not learned for reward and are instead learned by matching performance outcomes to internal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">goal</span></strong>s.</p>

Midbrain dopamine neurons control judgment of time
<p>Our sense of time is far from constant. For instance, time flies when we are having fun, and it slows to a trickle when we are bored. Midbrain dopamine neurons have been implicated in variable time <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ation. However, a direct link between signals carried by dopamine neurons and temporal judgments is lacking. We measured and manipulated the activity of dopamine neurons as mice judged the duration of time intervals. We found that pharmacogenetic suppression of dopamine neurons decreased behavioral sensitivity to time and that dopamine neurons encoded information about trial-to-trial variability in time <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ates. Last, we found that transient activation or inhibition of dopamine neurons was sufficient to slow down or speed up time <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ation, respectively. Dopamine neuron activity thus reflects and can directly control the judgment of time.</p>

Positive biodiversity-productivity relationship predominant in global forests
<p>The biodiversity-productivity relationship (BPR) is foundational to our understanding of the global extinction crisis and its impacts on ecosystem functioning. Understanding BPR is critical for the accurate valuation and effective conservation of biodiversity. Using ground-sourced data from 777,126 permanent plots, spanning 44 countries and most terrestrial biomes, we reveal a globally consistent positive concave-down BPR, showing that continued biodiversity loss would result in an accelerating decline in forest productivity worldwide. The value of biodiversity in maintaining commercial forest productivity alone—US$166 billion to 490 billion per year according to our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ation—is more than twice what it would cost to implement effective global conservation. This highlights the need for a worldwide reassessment of biodiversity values, forest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement strategies, and conservation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prioriti</span></strong>es.</p>

An unexpected disruption of the atmospheric quasi-biennial oscillation
<p>One of the most repeatable phenomena seen in the atmosphere, the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) between prevailing eastward and westward wind jets in the equatorial stratosphere (approximately 16 to 50 kilometers altitude), was unexpectedly disrupted in February 2016. An unprecedented westward jet formed within the eastward phase in the lower stratosphere and cannot be accounted for by the standard QBO paradigm based on vertical momentum transport. Instead, the primary cause was waves transporting momentum from the Northern Hemisphere. Seasonal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forecast</span></strong>s did not predict the disruption, but analogous QBO disruptions are seen very occasionally in some climate simulations.

Diurnal Variation in Nonstructural Carbohydrate Storage in Trees: Remobilization and Vertical Mixing
<p>Nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) storage plays a critical role in tree function and survival, but understanding and predicting local NSC storage dynamics is challenging because NSC storage pools are dispersed throughout the complex architecture of trees and continuously exchange carbon between source and sink organs at different time scales. To address these knowledge gaps, characterization and understanding of NSC diel variation are necessary. Here, we analyzed diurnal NSC dynamics in the overall architecture of almond (<i>Prunus dulcis</i>) trees. We also analyzed the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation of newly assimilated carbon using isotopic labeling. We show that both components of NSC (i.e. soluble carbohydrates and starch) are highly dynamic at the diurnal time scale and that these trends are influenced by tissue type, age, and/or position within the canopy. In leaves, starch reserves can be depleted completely during the night, while woody tissue starch levels may vary by more than 50% over a daily cycle. Recently assimilated carbon showed a dispersed downward <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation across the entire tree. NSC diurnal fluctuations within the tree’s structure in combination with dispersed carbon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation patterns provide evidence for the presence of vertical mixing and suggest that the xylem acts as a secondary NSC redistribution pathway.</p>

A High-Throughput, Field-Based Phenotyping Technology for Tall Biomass Crops
<p>Recent advances in omics technologies have not been accompanied by equally efficient, cost-effective, and accurate phenotyping methods required to dissect the genetic architecture of complex traits. Even though high-throughput phenotyping platforms have been developed for controlled environments, field-based aerial and ground technologies have only been designed and deployed for short-stature crops. Therefore, we developed and tested Phenobot 1.0, an auto-steered and self-propelled field-based high-throughput phenotyping platform for tall dense canopy crops, such as sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>). Phenobot 1.0 was equipped with laterally positioned and vertically stacked stereo RGB cameras. Images collected from 307 diverse sorghum lines were reconstructed in 3D for feature extraction. User interfaces were developed, and multiple algorithms were evaluated for their accuracy in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ating plant height and stem diameter. Tested feature extraction methods included the following: (1) User-interactive Individual Plant Height Extraction (UsIn-PHe) based on dense stereo three-dimensional reconstruction; (2) Automatic Hedge-based Plant Height Extraction (Auto-PHe) based on dense stereo 3D reconstruction; (3) User-interactive Dense Stereo Matching Stem Diameter Extraction; and (4) User-interactive Image Patch Stereo Matching Stem Diameter Extraction (IPaS-Di). Comparative genome-wide association analysis and ground-truth validation demonstrated that both UsIn-PHe and Auto-PHe were accurate methods to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ate plant height, while Auto-PHe had the additional advantage of being a completely automated process. For stem diameter, IPaS-Di generated the most accurate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ates of this biomass-related architectural trait. In summary, our technology was proven robust to obtain ground-based high-throughput plant architecture parameters of sorghum, a tall and densely planted crop species.</p>

<i>pheno</i>Seeder - A Robot System for Automated Handling and Phenotyping of Individual Seeds
<p>The enormous diversity of seed traits is an intriguing feature and critical for the overwhelming success of higher plants. In particular, seed mass is generally regarded to be key for seedling development but is mostly approximated by using scanning methods delivering only two-dimensional data, often termed seed size. However, three-dimensional traits, such as the volume or mass of single seeds, are very rarely determined in routine measurements. Here, we introduce a device named <i>pheno</i>Seeder, which enables the handling and phenotyping of individual seeds of very different sizes. The system consists of a pick-and-place robot and a modular setup of sensors that can be versatilely extended. Basic biometric traits detected for individual seeds are two-dimensional data from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">project</span></strong>ions, three-dimensional data from volumetric measures, and mass, from which seed density is also calculated. Each seed is tracked by an identifier and, after phenotyping, can be planted, sorted, or individually stored for further evaluation or processing (e.g. in routine seed-to-plant tracking pipelines). By investigating seeds of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), rapeseed (<i>Brassica napus</i>), and barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), we observed that, even for apparently round-shaped seeds of rapeseed, correlations between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">project</span></strong>ed area and the mass of seeds were much weaker than between volume and mass. This indicates that simple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">project</span></strong>ions may not deliver good proxies for seed mass. Although throughput is limited, we expect that automated seed phenotyping on a single-seed basis can contribute valuable information for applications in a wide range of wild or crop species, including seed classification, seed sorting, and assessment of seed quality.</p>

TCS: A New Multiple Sequence Alignment Reliability Measure to Estimate Alignment Accuracy and Improve Phylogenetic Tree Reconstruction
<p>Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is a key modeling procedure when analyzing biological sequences. Homology and evolutionary modeling are the most common applications of MSAs. Both are known to be sensitive to the underlying MSA accuracy. In this work, we show how this problem can be partly overcome using the transitive consistency score (TCS), an extended version of the T-Coffee scoring scheme. Using this local evaluation function, we show that one can identify the most reliable portions of an MSA, as judged from BAliBASE and PREFAB structure-based reference alignments. We also show how this measure can be used to improve phylogenetic tree reconstruction using both an established simulated data set and a novel empirical yeast data set. For this purpose, we describe a novel lossless alternative to site filtering that involves overweighting the trustworthy columns. Our approach relies on the T-Coffee framework; it uses libraries of pairwise alignments to evaluate any third party MSA. Pairwise <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">project</span></strong>ions can be produced using fast or slow methods, thus allowing a trade-off between speed and accuracy. We compared TCS with Heads-or-Tails, GUIDANCE, Gblocks, and trimAl and found it to lead to significantly better <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ates of structural accuracy and more accurate phylogenetic trees. The software is available from <ext-link>www.tcoffee.org/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">project</span></strong>s/tcs</ext-link>.</p>

Y Chromosome Analysis of Dingoes and Southeast Asian Village Dogs Suggests a Neolithic Continental Expansion from Southeast Asia Followed by Multiple Austronesian Dispersals
<p>Dogs originated more than 14,000 BP, but the location(s) where they first arose is uncertain. The earliest archeological evidence of ancient dogs was discovered in Europe and the Middle East, some 5–7 millennia before that from Southeast Asia. However, mitochondrial DNA analyses suggest that most modern dogs derive from Southeast Asia, which has fueled the controversial hypothesis that dog domestication originated in this region despite the lack of supporting archeological evidence. We propose and investigate with Y chromosomes an alternative hypothesis for the proximate origins of dogs from Southeast Asia—a massive Neolithic expansion of dogs from this region that largely replaced more primitive dogs to the west and north. Previous attempts to test matrilineal findings with independent patrilineal markers have lacked the necessary genealogical resolution and mutation rate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ates. Here, we used Y chromosome genotypes, composed of 29 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) and 5 single tandem repeats (STRs), from 338 Australian dingoes, New Guinea singing dogs, and village dogs from Island Southeast Asia, along with modern European breed dogs, to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ate the evolutionary mutation rates of Y chromosome STRs based on calibration to the independently known age of the dingo population. Dingoes exhibited a unique haplogroup characterized by a single distinguishing SNP mutation and 14 STR haplotypes. The age of the European haplogroup was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated to be only 1.7 times older than that of the dingo population, suggesting an origin during the Neolithic rather than the Paleolithic (as predicted by the Southeast Asian origins hypothesis). We hypothesize that isolation of Neolithic dogs from wolves in Southeast Asia was a key step accelerating their phenotypic transformation, enhancing their value in trade and as cargo, and enabling them to rapidly expand and replace more primitive dogs to the West. Our findings also suggest that dingoes could have arrived in Australia directly from Taiwan, independently of later dispersals of dogs through Thailand to Island Southeast Asia.</p>

Moving without a purpose: an experimental study of swarm guidance in the Western honey bee, <i>Apis mellifera</i>
<p>During reproductive swarming, honey bee scouts perform two very important functions. Firstly, they find new nesting locations and return to the swarm cluster to communicate their discoveries. Secondly, once the swarm is ready to depart, informed scout bees act as guides, leading the swarm to its final destination. We have previously hypothesised that the two processes, selecting a new nest site and swarm guidance, are tightly linked in honey bees. When swarms can be <i>laissez faire</i> about where they nest, reaching directional consensus prior to lift off seems unnecessary. If, in contrast, it is essential that the swarm reaches a precise location, either directional consensus must be near unanimous prior to swarm departure or only a select subgroup of the scouts guide the swarm. Here, we tested experimentally whether directional consensus is necessary for the successful guidance of swarms of the Western honey bee <i>Apis mellifera</i> by forcing swarms into the air prior to the completion of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decis</span></strong>ion-making process. Our results show that swarms were unable to guide themselves prior to the swarm reaching the pre-flight buzzing phase of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decis</span></strong>ion-making process, even when directional consensus was high. We therefore suggest that not all scouts involved in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decis</span></strong>ion-making process attempt to guide the swarm.</p>

We investigated   the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement of open tibia fractures at a paediatric trauma centre,   primarily reporting the risk of infection and rate of union.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A retrospective review was performed on 61 children who between   2007 and 2015 presented with an open tibia fracture. Their mean   age was nine years (2 to 16) and the median follow-up was ten months   (interquartile range 5 to 18). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement involved IV antibiotics,   early debridement and combined treatment of the skeletal and soft-tissue injuries   in line with standards proposed by the British Orthopaedic Association.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were 36 diaphyseal fractures and 25 distal tibial fractures.   Of the distal fractures, eight involved the physis. Motor vehicle   collisions accounted for two thirds of the injuries and 38 patients   (62%) arrived outside of normal working hours. The initial method   of stabilisation comprised: casting in nine cases (15%); elastic   nailing in 19 (31%); Kirschner (K)-wiring in 13 (21%); intramedullary   nailing in one (2%); open reduction and plate fixation in four (7%); and   external fixation in 15 (25%). Wound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement comprised: primary   wound closure in 24 (39%), delayed primary closure in 11 (18%),   split skin graft (SSG) in eight (13%), local flap with SSG in 17   (28%) and a free flap in one. A total of 43 fractures (70%) were   Gustilo-Anderson grade III. There were four superficial (6.6%) and   three (4.9%) deep infections. Two deep infections occurred following   open reduction and plate fixation and the third after    K-wire fixation of a distal fracture. No patient who underwent primary   wound closure developed an infection. All the fractures united,   although nine patients required revision of a mono-lateral to circular   frame for delayed union (two) or for altered alignment or length   (seven). The mean time to union was two weeks longer in diaphyseal fractures   than in distal fractures (13 weeks <i>versus</i> 10.8   weeks, p<i> = </i>0.016). Children aged > 12 years had   a significantly longer time to union than those aged < 12 years   (16.3 weeks <i>versus</i> 11.4 weeks, p<i> = </i>0.045).   The length of stay in hospital for patients with a Gustilo-Anderson   grade IIIB fracture was twice as long as for less severe injuries. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Fractures in children heal better than those in adults. Based   on our experience of deep infection we discourage the use of internal   fixation with a plate for open tibial fractures in children. We   advocate aggressive initial wound debridement in theatre with early   definitive combined orthopaedic and plastic surgery in order to   obtain skeletal stabilisation and soft-tissue cover.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:544–53.</p></sec>

Does osteofibrous dysplasia progress to adamantinoma and how should they be treated?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to identify any progression between   benign osteofibrous dysplasia (OFD), OFD-like adamantinoma and malignant   adamantinoma, and to investigate the rates of local recurrence,   metastases and survival, in order to develop treatment algorithms   for each.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A single institution retrospective review of all patients presenting   with OFD, OFD-like adamantinoma and adamantinoma between 1973 and   2012 was undertaken. Complete data were available for 73 patients   (42 with OFD; ten with an OFD-like adamantinoma and 21 with an adamantinoma).   The mean follow-up was 10.3 years (3 to 25) for OFD, 9.2 years (3.0   to 26.3) for OFD-like and 11.6 years (0.25 to 33) for adamantinoma.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean age at diagnosis for OFD was 13.5 years (1 to 49), 10.5   years (6 to 28) for OFD-like and 34 years (14 to 86) for adamantinoma.   A total of 24 of the 42 patients with OFD (57%) have not required   any treatment and have been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ed with observation. A total of   18 of the 42 patients with OFD underwent surgery, 13 with curettage   and five with resection. In all, three patients developed recurrence   following curettage (23%) but none following resection. All these   patients were cured with further limited surgery. A total of six   patients initially diagnosed with OFD were subsequently found to   have OFD-like adamantinoma. Of the ten patients initially diagnosed   with OFD-like adamantinoma, three (30%) were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ed with observation   alone and seven underwent surgery, two with curettage and five with   resection. Local recurrence arose in two patients, one each after   curettage and resection. No patients with either OFD or an OFD-like   adamantinoma developed metastases or had progression to adamantinoma.   All patients with an adamantinoma were treated by surgery, three   with curettage, six with amputation and 12 with excision. In all,   two of the three treated with curettage developed local recurrence, requiring   further surgery. Late development of both local recurrence and metastases   led to a ten year disease specific survival of 93% which had dropped   to 39% by 20 years.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We found no evidence of progression from OFD to adamantinoma.   Conservative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement with observation or curettage is often successful   for patients with OFD and OFD-like adamantinoma. Resection with   clear margins is required for patients with adamantinoma. Late tumour   recurrence is not uncommon in adamantinoma and prolonged follow-up   should be considered.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:409–16.</p></sec>

Proximal femoral resection without post-operative traction for the painful dislocated hip in young patients with cerebral palsy
<p>Proximal femoral resection (PFR) is a proven   pain-relieving procedure for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement of patients with severe cerebral   palsy and a painful displaced hip. Previous authors have recommended   post-operative traction or immobilisation to prevent a recurrence   of pain due to proximal migration of the femoral stump. We present   a series of 79 PFRs in 63 patients, age 14.7 years (10 to 26; 35   male, 28 female), none of whom had post-operative traction or immobilisation.</p><p>A total of 71 hips (89.6%) were reported to be pain free or to   have mild pain following surgery. Four children underwent further   resection for persistent pain; of these, three had successful resolution   of pain and one had no benefit. A total of 16 hips (20.2%) showed   radiographic evidence of heterotopic ossification, all of which   had formed within one year of surgery. Four patients had a wound   infection, one of which needed debridement; all recovered fully.   A total of 59 patients (94%) reported improvements in seating and   hygiene.</p><p>The results are as good as or better than the historical results   of using traction or immobilisation. We recommend that following   PFR, children can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ed without traction or immobilisation,   and can be discharged earlier and with fewer complications. However,   care should be taken with severely dystonic patients, in whom more   extensive femoral resection should be considered in combination   with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement of the increased tone.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014; 96-B:701–6.</p>

Fractures of the femoral shaft in children
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology of closed   isolated fractures of the femoral shaft in children, and to compare   the treatment and length of stay (LOS) between major trauma centres   (MTCs) and trauma units (TUs) in England.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>National data were obtained from the Trauma and Audit Research   Network for all isolated, closed fractures of the femoral shaft   in children from birth to 15 years of age, between 2012 and 2015.   Age, gender, the season in which the fracture occurred, non-accidental   injury, the mechanism of injury, hospital trauma status, LOS and   type of treatment were recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 1852 fractures were identified. The mean annual incidence   was 5.82 per 100 000 children (95% confidence interval (CI) 5.20   to 6.44). The age of peak incidence was two years for both boys   and girls; this decreased with increasing age. Children aged four   to six years treated in MTCs were more likely to be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ed with   open reduction and internal fixation compared with those treated   in TUs (odds ratio 3.20; 95% CI 1.12 to 9.14; p = 0.03). The median LOS   was significantly less in MTCs than in TUs for children aged between   18 months and three years treated in both a spica (p = 0.005) and   traction (p = 0.0004). </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study highlights the current national trends in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement   of closed isolated fractures of the femoral shaft in children following   activation of major trauma networks in 2012. Future studies focusing   on the reasons for the differences which have been identified may   help to achieve more consistency in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement of these injuries across   the trauma networks.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:109–18.</p></sec>

Sex and Race Differences in Lifetime Risk of Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction and Heart Failure With Reduced Ejection Fraction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Lifetime risk of heart failure has been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated to range from 20% to 46% in diverse sex and race groups. However, lifetime risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ates for the 2 HF phenotypes, HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), are not known.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Participant-level data from 2 large prospective cohort studies, the CHS (Cardiovascular Health Study) and MESA (Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis), were pooled, excluding individuals with prevalent HF at baseline. Remaining lifetime risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ates for HFpEF (EF ≥45%) and HFrEF (EF <45%) were determined at different index ages with the use of a modified Kaplan-Meier method with mortality and the other HF subtype as competing risks.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We included 12 417 participants >45 years of age (22.2% blacks, 44.8% men) who were followed up for median duration of 11.6 years with 2178 overall incident HF events with 561 HFrEF events and 726 HFpEF events. At the index age of 45 years, the lifetime risk for any HF through 90 years of age was higher in men than women (27.4% versus 23.8%). Among HF subtypes, the lifetime risk for HFrEF was higher in men than women (10.6% versus 5.8%). In contrast, the lifetime risk for HFpEF was similar in men and women. In race-stratified analyses, lifetime risk for overall HF was higher in nonblacks than blacks (25.9% versus 22.4%). Among HF subtypes, the lifetime risk for HFpEF was higher in nonblacks than blacks (11.2% versus 7.7%), whereas that for HFrEF was similar across the 2 groups. Among participants with antecedent myocardial infarction before HF diagnosis, the remaining lifetime risks for HFpEF and HFrEF were up to 2.5-fold and 4-fold higher, respectively, compared with those without antecedent myocardial infarction.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Lifetime risks for HFpEF and HFrEF vary by sex, race, and history of antecedent myocardial infarction. These insights into the distribution of HF risk and its subtypes could inform the development of targeted strategies to improve population-level HF prevention and control.</p></sec>

High-Target Versus Low-Target Blood Pressure Management During Cardiopulmonary Bypass to Prevent Cerebral Injury in Cardiac Surgery Patients
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cerebral injury is an important complication after cardiac surgery with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. The rate of overt stroke after cardiac surgery is 1% to 2%, whereas silent strokes, detected by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, are found in up to 50% of patients. It is unclear whether a higher versus a lower blood pressure during cardiopulmonary bypass reduces cerebral infarction in these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a patient- and assessor-blinded randomized trial, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ated patients to a higher (70–80 mm Hg) or lower (40–50 mm Hg) target for mean arterial pressure by the titration of norepinephrine during cardiopulmonary bypass. Pump flow was fixed at 2.4 L·min<sup>−1</sup>·m<sup>−2</sup>. The primary outcome was the total volume of new ischemic cerebral lesions (summed in millimeters cubed), expressed as the difference between diffusion-weighted imaging conducted preoperatively and again postoperatively between days 3 and 6. Secondary outcomes included diffusion-weighted imaging–evaluated total number of new ischemic lesions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among the 197 enrolled patients, mean (SD) age was 65.0 (10.7) years in the low-target group (n=99) and 69.4 (8.9) years in the high-target group (n=98). Procedural risk scores were comparable between groups. Overall, diffusion-weighted imaging revealed new cerebral lesions in 52.8% of patients in the low-target group versus 55.7% in the high-target group (<i>P</i>=0.76). The primary outcome of volume of new cerebral lesions was comparable between groups, 25 mm<sup>3</sup> (interquartile range, 0–118 mm<sup>3</sup>; range, 0–25 261 mm<sup>3</sup>) in the low-target group versus 29 mm<sup>3</sup> (interquartile range, 0–143 mm<sup>3</sup>; range, 0–22 116 mm<sup>3</sup>) in the high-target group (median difference <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ate, 0; 95% confidence interval, −25 to 0.028; <i>P</i>=0.99), as was the secondary outcome of number of new lesions (1 [interquartile range, 0–2; range, 0–24] versus 1 [interquartile range, 0–2; range, 0–29] respectively; median difference <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ate, 0; 95% confidence interval, 0–0; <i>P</i>=0.71). No significant difference was observed in frequency of severe adverse events.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among patients undergoing on-pump cardiac surgery, targeting a higher versus a lower mean arterial pressure during cardiopulmonary bypass did not seem to affect the volume or number of new cerebral infarcts.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

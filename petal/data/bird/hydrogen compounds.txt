Gastrointestinal and renal responses to variable water intake in whitebellied sunbirds and New Holland honeyeaters
<p>Nectarivores face a constant challenge in terms of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> balance, experiencing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> loading or dehydration when switching between food plants or between feeding and fasting. To understand how whitebellied sunbirds and New Holland honeyeaters meet the challenges of varying preformed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> load, we used the elimination of intramuscular-injected [<sup>14</sup>C]-<sc>l</sc>-glucose and <sup>3</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O to quantify intestinal and renal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> handling on diets varying in sugar concentration. Both sunbirds and honeyeaters showed significant modulation of intestinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> absorption, allowing excess <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> to be shunted through the intestine when on dilute diets. Despite reducing their fractional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> absorption, both species showed linear increases in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> flux and fractional body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> turnover as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> intake increased (both afternoon and morning), suggesting that the modulation of fractional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> absorption was not sufficient to completely offset dietary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> loads. In both species, glomerular filtration rate was independent of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> gain (but was higher for the afternoon), as was renal fractional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> reabsorption (measured in the afternoon). During the natural overnight fast, both sunbirds and honeyeaters arrested whole kidney function. Evaporative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> loss in sunbirds was variable but correlated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> gain. Both sunbirds and honeyeaters appear to modulate intestinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> absorption as an important component of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> regulation to help deal with massive preformed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> loads. Shutting down glomerular filtration rate during the overnight fast is another way of saving energy for osmoregulatory function. Birds maintain osmotic balance on diets varying markedly in preformed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> load by varying both intestinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> absorption and excretion through the intestine and kidneys.</p>

Development Defects of Hydroxy-Fatty Acid-Accumulating Seeds Are Reduced by Castor Acyltransferases
<p>Researchers have long endeavored to produce modified fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s in easily managed crop plants where they are not natively found. An important step toward this goal has been the biosynthesis of these valuable products in model oilseeds. The successful production of such fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s has revealed barriers to the broad application of this technology, including low seed oil and low proportion of the introduced fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> and reduced seed vigor. Here, we analyze the impact of producing hydroxy-fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s on seedling development. We show that germinating seeds of a hydroxy-fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>-accumulating Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) line produce chlorotic cotyledons and suffer reduced photosynthetic capacity. These seedlings retain hydroxy-fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s in polar lipids, including chloroplast lipids, and exhibit decreased fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthesis. Triacylglycerol mobilization in seedling development also is reduced, especially for lipids that include hydroxy-fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> moieties. These developmental defects are ameliorated by increased flux of hydroxy-fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s into seed triacylglycerol created through the expression of either castor (<i>Ricinus communis</i>) acyltransferase enzyme ACYL-COA:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE2 or PHOSPHOLIPID:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1A. Such expression increases both the level of total stored triacylglycerol and the rate at which it is mobilized, fueling fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthesis and restoring photosynthetic capacity. Our results suggest that further improvements in seedling development may require the specific mobilization of triacylglycerol-containing hydroxy-fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s. Understanding the defects in early development caused by the accumulation of modified fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s and providing mechanisms to circumvent these defects are vital steps in the development of tailored oil crops.</p>

An Aromatic Farnesyltransferase Functions in Biosynthesis of the Anti-HIV Meroterpenoid Daurichromenic Acid
<p><i>Rhododendron dauricum</i> produces daurichromenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, an anti-HIV meroterpenoid, via oxidative cyclization of the farnesyl group of grifolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>. The prenyltransferase (PT) that synthesizes grifolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> is a farnesyltransferase in plant specialized metabolism. In this study, we demonstrated that the isoprenoid moiety of grifolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> is derived from the 2-<i>C</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-erythritol-4-phosphate pathway that takes place in plastids. We explored candidate sequences of plastid-localized PT homologs and identified a cDNA for this PT, RdPT1, which shares moderate sequence similarity with known aromatic PTs. RdPT1 is expressed exclusively in the glandular scales, where daurichromenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> accumulates. In addition, the gene product was targeted to plastids in plant cells. The recombinant RdPT1 regiospecifically synthesized grifolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> from orsellinic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> and farnesyl diphosphate, demonstrating that RdPT1 is the farnesyltransferase involved in daurichromenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> biosynthesis. This enzyme strictly preferred orsellinic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> as a prenyl acceptor, whereas it had a relaxed specificity for prenyl donor structures, also accepting geranyl and geranylgeranyl diphosphates with modest efficiency to synthesize prenyl chain analogs of grifolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>. Such a broad specificity is a unique catalytic feature of RdPT1 that is not shared among secondary metabolic aromatic PTs in plants. We discuss the unusual substrate preference of RdPT1 using a molecular modeling approach. The biochemical properties as well as the localization of RdPT1 suggest that this enzyme produces meroterpenoids in glandular scales cooperatively with previously identified daurichromenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthase, probably for chemical defense on the surface of <i>R. dauricum</i> plants.</p>

Carnosic Acid and Carnosol, Two Major Antioxidants of Rosemary, Act through Different Mechanisms
<p>Carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, a phenolic diterpene specific to the Lamiaceae family, is highly abundant in rosemary (<i>Rosmarinus officinalis</i>). Despite numerous industrial and medicinal/pharmaceutical applications of its antioxidative features, this compound in planta and its antioxidant mechanism have received little attention, except a few studies of rosemary plants under natural conditions. In vitro analyses, using high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet and luminescence imaging, revealed that carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> and its major oxidized derivative, carnosol, protect lipids from oxidation. Both compounds preserved linolenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> and monogalactosyldiacylglycerol from singlet oxygen and from hydroxyl radical. When applied exogenously, they were both able to protect thylakoid membranes prepared from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves against lipid peroxidation. Different levels of carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> and carnosol in two contrasting rosemary varieties correlated with tolerance to lipid peroxidation. Upon reactive oxygen species (ROS) oxidation of lipids, carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> was consumed and oxidized into various derivatives, including into carnosol, while carnosol resisted, suggesting that carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> is a chemical quencher of ROS. The antioxidative function of carnosol relies on another mechanism, occurring directly in the lipid oxidation process. Under oxidative conditions that did not involve ROS generation, carnosol inhibited lipid peroxidation, contrary to carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>. Using spin probes and electron paramagnetic resonance detection, we confirmed that carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, rather than carnosol, is a ROS quencher. Various oxidized derivatives of carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> were detected in rosemary leaves in low light, indicating chronic oxidation of this compound, and accumulated in plants exposed to stress conditions, in parallel with a loss of carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, confirming that chemical quenching of ROS by carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> takes place in planta.</p>

Spatiotemporal Coupling of Vessel Cavitation and Discharge of Stored Xylem Water in a Tree Sapling
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> discharge from stem internal storage compartments is thought to minimize the risk of vessel cavitation. Based on this concept, one would expect that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> storage compartments involved in the buffering of xylem tensions empty before the onset of vessel cavitation under drought stress, and potentially refill after soil saturation. However, scant in vivo data exist that elucidate this localized spatiotemporal coupling. In this study on intact saplings of American chestnut (<i>Castanea dentata</i>), x-ray computed microtomography (microCT) showed that the xylem matrix surrounding vessels releases stored <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> and becomes air-filled either concurrent to or after vessel cavitation under progressive drought stress. Among annual growth rings, the xylem matrix of the current year remained largely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-filled even under severe drought stress. In comparison, microtomography images collected on excised stems showed that applied pressures of much greater than 0 MPa were required to induce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> release from the xylem matrix. Viability staining highlighted that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> release from the xylem matrix was associated primarily with emptying of dead fibers. Refilling of the xylem matrix and vessels was detected in intact saplings when the canopy was bagged and stem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> potential was close to 0 MPa, and in leafless saplings over the winter period. In conclusion, this study indicates that the bulk of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> stored in the xylem matrix is released after the onset of vessel cavitation, and suggests that capillary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> contributes to overall stem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> storage under drought but is not used primarily for the prevention of drought-induced vessel cavitation in this species.</p>

Components of Water Use Efficiency Have Unique Genetic Signatures in the Model C<sub>4</sub> Grass <i>Setaria</i>
<p>Plant growth and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> use are interrelated processes influenced by genetically controlled morphological and biochemical characteristics. Improving plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> use efficiency (WUE) to sustain growth in different environments is an important breeding objective that can improve crop yields and enhance agricultural sustainability. However, genetic improvement of WUE using traditional methods has proven difficult due to the low throughput and environmental heterogeneity of field settings. To overcome these limitations, this study utilizes a high-throughput phenotyping platform to quantify plant size and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> use of an interspecific <i>Setaria italica</i> × <i>Setaria viridis</i> recombinant inbred line population at daily intervals in both well-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>ed and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-limited conditions. Our findings indicate that measurements of plant size and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> use are correlated strongly in this system; therefore, a linear modeling approach was used to partition this relationship into predicted values of plant size given <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> use and deviations from this relationship at the genotype level. The resulting traits describing plant size, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> use, and WUE all were heritable and responsive to soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> availability, allowing for a genetic dissection of the components of plant WUE under different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>ing treatments. Linkage mapping identified major loci underlying two different pleiotropic components of WUE. This study indicates that alleles controlling WUE derived from both wild and domesticated accessions can be utilized to predictably modulate trait values given a specified precipitation regime in the model C<sub>4</sub> genus <i>Setaria</i>.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Storage Compartments for Capillary Water Rarely Refill in an Intact Woody Plant
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> storage is thought to play an integral role in the maintenance of whole-plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> balance. The contribution of both living and dead cells to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> storage can be derived from rehydration and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-release curves on excised plant material, but the underlying tissue-specific emptying/refilling dynamics remain unclear. Here, we used x-ray computed microtomography to characterize the refilling of xylem fibers, pith cells, and vessels under both excised and in vivo conditions in <i>Laurus nobilis</i>. In excised stems supplied with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> uptake exhibited a biphasic response curve, and x-ray computed microtomography images showed that high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> storage capacitance was associated with fiber and pith refilling as driven by capillary forces: fibers refilled more rapidly than pith cells, while vessel refilling was minimal. In excised stems that were sealed, fiber and pith refilling was associated with vessel emptying, indicating a link between tissue connectivity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> storage. In contrast, refilling of fibers, pith cells, and vessels was negligible in intact saplings over two time scales, 24 h and 3 weeks. However, those compartments did refill slowly when the shoot was covered to prevent transpiration. Collectively, our data (1) provide direct evidence that storage compartments for capillary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> refill in excised stems but rarely under in vivo conditions, (2) highlight that estimates of capacitance from excised samples should be interpreted with caution, as certain storage compartments may not be utilized in the intact plant, and (3) question the paradigm that fibers play a substantial role in daily discharge/recharge of stem capacitance in an intact tree.</p>

Tree Physiology
Temperate tree species show identical response in tree water deficit but different sensitivities in sap flow to summer soil drying
<p>Temperate forests are expected to be particularly vulnerable to drought and soil drying because they are not adapted to such conditions and perform best in mesic environments. Here we ask (i) how sensitively four common temperate tree species (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i>, <i>Picea abies</i>, <i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i> and <i>Fraxinus excelsior</i>) respond in their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> relations to summer soil drying and seek to determine (ii) if species-specific responses to summer soil drying are related to the onset of declining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> status across the four species. Throughout 2012 and 2013 we determined tree <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit (TWD) as a proxy for tree <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> status from recorded stem radius changes and monitored sap flow rates with sensors on 16 mature trees studied in the field at Lageren, Switzerland. All tree species responded equally in their relative maximum TWD to the onset of declining soil moisture. This implies that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> supply of all tree species was affected by declining soil moisture and that none of the four species was able to fully maintain its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> status, e.g., by access to alternative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> sources in the soil. In contrast we found strong and highly species-specific responses of sap flow to declining soil moisture with the strongest decline in <i>P. abies</i> (92%), followed by <i>F. sylvatica</i> (53%) and <i>A. pseudoplatanus</i> (48%). <i>F. excelsior</i> did not significantly reduce sap flow. We hypothesize the species-specific responses in sap flow to declining soil moisture that occur despite a simultaneous increase in relative TWD in all species reflect how fast these species approach critical levels of their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> status, which is most likely influenced by species-specific traits determining the hydraulic properties of the species tree.</p>

Organ-coordinated response of early post-germination mahogany seedlings to drought
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit tolerance during post-germination stages is critical for seedling recruitment. In this work, we studied the effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit on morphological and biochemical responses in different organs of newly germinated mahogany (<i>Swietenia macrophylla</i> King) seedlings, a woody species that occurs in the Amazon rainforest. The root : shoot ratio increased under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit. The leaf number and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> potential were not altered, although reductions in leaf area and stomatal conductance were observed. Osmotic potential became more negative in leaves of seedlings under severe stress. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit increased fructose, glucose, sucrose and myo-inositol levels in leaves. Stems accumulated fructose, glucose and <sc>l</sc>-proline. Nitric oxide (NO) levels increased in the vascular cylinder of roots under severe stress while superoxide anion levels decreased due to augmented superoxide dismutase activity in this organ. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit induced glutathione reductase activity in both roots and stems. Upon moderate or severe stress, catalase activity decreased in leaves and remained unaffected in the other seedling organs, allowing for an increase of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen peroxid</span></strong>e (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) levels in leaves. Overall, the increase of signaling molecules in distinct organs—NO in roots, <sc>l</sc>-proline in stems and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and myo-inositol in leaves—contributed to the response of mahogany seedlings to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit by triggering biochemical processes that resulted in the attenuation of oxidative stress and the establishment of osmotic adjustment. Therefore, this body of evidence reveals that the development of newly germinated mahogany seedlings may occur in both natural habitats and crop fields even when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> availability is greatly limited.</p>

Going with the Flow: Multiscale Insights into the Composite Nature of Water Transport in Roots
<p>As <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> often limits crop production, a more complete understanding of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> capture and transport is necessary. Here, we developed MECHA, a mathematical model that computes the flow of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> across the root at the scale of walls, membranes, and plasmodesmata of individual cells, and used it to test hypotheses related to root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> transport in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). The model uses detailed root anatomical descriptions and a minimal set of experimental cell properties, including the conductivity of plasma membranes, cell walls, and plasmodesmata, which yield quantitative and scale-consistent estimations of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> pathways and root radial hydraulic conductivity (<i>k</i><sub>r</sub>). MECHA revealed that the mainstream hydraulic theories derived independently at the cell and root segment scales are compatible only if osmotic potentials within the apoplastic domains are uniform. The results suggested that the convection-diffusion of apoplastic solutes explained most of the offset between estimated <i>k</i><sub>r</sub> in pressure clamp and osmotic experiments, while the contribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-filled intercellular spaces was limited. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses quantified the relative impact of cortex and endodermis cell conductivity of plasma membranes on root <i>k</i><sub>r</sub> and suggested that only the latter contributed substantially to <i>k</i><sub>r</sub> due to the composite nature of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> flow across roots. The explicit root hydraulic anatomy framework brings insights into contradictory interpretations of experiments from the literature and suggests experiments to efficiently address questions pertaining to root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> relations. Its scale consistency opens avenues for cross-scale communication in the world of root hydraulics.</p>

Coexpression Analysis Identifies Two Oxidoreductases Involved in the Biosynthesis of the Monoterpene Acid Moiety of Natural Pyrethrin Insecticides in <i>Tanacetum cinerariifolium</i>
<p>Flowers of <i>Tanacetum cinerariifolium</i> produce a set of compounds known collectively as pyrethrins, which are commercially important pesticides that are strongly toxic to flying insects but not to most vertebrates. A pyrethrin molecule is an ester consisting of either trans-chrysanthemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> or its modified form, pyrethric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, and one of three alcohols, jasmolone, pyrethrolone, and cinerolone, that appear to be derived from jasmonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>. Chrysanthemyl diphosphate synthase (CDS), the first enzyme involved in the synthesis of trans-chrysanthemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, was characterized previously and its gene isolated. <i>TcCDS</i> produces free trans-chrysanthemol in addition to trans-chrysanthemyl diphosphate, but the enzymes responsible for the conversion of trans-chrysanthemol to the corresponding aldehyde and then to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> have not been reported. We used an RNA sequencing-based approach and coexpression correlation analysis to identify several candidate genes encoding putative trans-chrysanthemol and trans-chrysanthemal dehydrogenases. We functionally characterized the proteins encoded by these genes using a combination of in vitro biochemical assays and heterologous expression in planta to demonstrate that <i>TcADH2</i> encodes an enzyme that oxidizes trans-chrysanthemol to trans-chrysanthemal, while <i>TcALDH1</i> encodes an enzyme that oxidizes trans-chrysanthemal into trans-chrysanthemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>. Transient coexpression of <i>TcADH2</i> and <i>TcALDH1</i> together with <i>TcCDS</i> in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaves results in the production of trans-chrysanthemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> as well as several other side products. The majority (58%) of trans-chrysanthemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> was glycosylated or otherwise modified. Overall, these data identify key steps in the biosynthesis of pyrethrins and demonstrate the feasibility of metabolic engineering to produce components of these defense compounds in a heterologous host.</p>

Inhibition of Endothelial Notch Signaling Impairs Fatty Acid Transport and Leads to Metabolic and Vascular Remodeling of the Adult Heart
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Nutrients are transported through endothelial cells before being metabolized in muscle cells. However, little is known about the regulation of endothelial transport processes. Notch signaling is a critical regulator of metabolism and angiogenesis during development. Here, we studied how genetic and pharmacological manipulation of endothelial Notch signaling in adult mice affects endothelial fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> transport, cardiac angiogenesis, and heart function.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Endothelial-specific Notch inhibition was achieved by conditional genetic inactivation of Rbp-jκ in adult mice to analyze fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> metabolism and heart function. Wild-type mice were treated with neutralizing antibodies against the Notch ligand Delta-like 4. Fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> transport was studied in cultured endothelial cells and transgenic mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Treatment of wild-type mice with Delta-like 4 neutralizing antibodies for 8 weeks impaired fractional shortening and ejection fraction in the majority of mice. Inhibition of Notch signaling specifically in the endothelium of adult mice by genetic ablation of Rbp-jκ caused heart hypertrophy and failure. Impaired heart function was preceded by alterations in fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> metabolism and an increase in cardiac blood vessel density. Endothelial Notch signaling controlled the expression of endothelial lipase, Angptl4, CD36, and Fabp4, which are all needed for fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> transport across the vessel wall. In endothelial-specific Rbp-jκ–mutant mice, lipase activity and transendothelial transport of long-chain fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s to muscle cells were impaired. In turn, lipids accumulated in the plasma and liver. The attenuated supply of cardiomyocytes with long-chain fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s was accompanied by higher glucose uptake, increased concentration of glycolysis intermediates, and mTOR-S6K signaling. Treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin or displacing glucose as cardiac substrate by feeding a ketogenic diet prolonged the survival of endothelial-specific Rbp-jκ–deficient mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This study identifies Notch signaling as a novel regulator of fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> transport across the endothelium and as an essential repressor of angiogenesis in the adult heart.

Acclimation of <i>Betula alleghaniensis</i> Britton to moderate soil water deficit: small morphological changes make for important consequences in crown display
<p>In the context of the predicted increasing frequency of summer droughts in the northeastern deciduous forest of North America due to climate change, we investigated the acclimation capacity of yellow birch, an economically important native tree species, to soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit. We carried out an integrated examination of allocation of biomass, leaf physiology, branching pattern and in situ 3D crown display. Potted seedlings were subjected to moderate soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit for four consecutive months during their second growing season. Individuals under soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit showed a 40% decrease in biomass accumulation but no change in the relative allocation of biomass to the different plant compartments. Net CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rates at leaf level decreased under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit (~15%) but could not alone explain the total reduction in growth, excluding the carbon starvation hypothesis. The observed reduction in net CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rates was related to a decrease in stomatal conductance and chlorophyll content. <i>STAR</i><sub>zen</sub> (in situ silhouette to total leaf area ratio; a proxy for light interception efficiency) decreased under soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit due to shifts in biomass allocation within the branch compartment from long upper axes to short bottom axes. Despite the fact that the understanding of the processes involved in growth reduction and branching pattern alteration will need more attention in future research, we conclude that under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit yellow birch at young stages will: (i) experience a substantial loss of growth and biomass; and (ii) acclimate through architectural plasticity rather than through changes in the relative allocation of root biomass to enhance its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> management.</p>

<p>Plants have sophisticated mechanisms for sensing neighbor shade. To maximize their ability to compete for light, plants respond to shade through enhanced elongation and physiological changes. The shade avoidance response affects many different organs and growth stages, yet the signaling pathways underlying this response have mostly been studied in seedlings. We assayed transcriptome changes in response to shade across a 2-d time course in the wild type and 12 Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants. The resulting temporal map of transcriptional responses to shade defines early and late responses in adult plants, enabling us to determine connections between key signaling genes and downstream responses. We found a pervasive and unexpectedly strong connection between shade avoidance and genes related to salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, suggesting salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> signaling to be an important shade avoidance growth regulator. We tested this connection and found that several mutants disrupting salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> levels or signaling were defective in shade avoidance. The effect of these mutations on shade avoidance was specific to petiole elongation; neither hypocotyl nor flowering time responses were altered, thereby defining important stage-specific differences in the downstream shade avoidance signaling pathway. Shade treatment did not change salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> levels, indicating that the mediation of shade avoidance by salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> is not dependent on the modulation of salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> levels. These results demonstrate that salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> pathway genes also are key components of petiole shade avoidance.</p>

Starch Deficiency Enhances Lipid Biosynthesis and Turnover in Leaves
<p>Starch and lipids represent two major forms of carbon and energy storage in plants and play central roles in diverse cellular processes. However, whether and how starch and lipid metabolic pathways interact to regulate metabolism and growth are poorly understood. Here, we show that lipids can partially compensate for the lack of function of transient starch during normal growth and development in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Disruption of starch synthesis resulted in a significant increase in fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthesis via posttranslational regulation of the plastidic acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase and a concurrent increase in the synthesis and turnover of membrane lipids and triacylglycerol. Genetic analysis showed that blocking fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> peroxisomal β-oxidation, the sole pathway for metabolic breakdown of fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s in plants, significantly compromised or stunted the growth and development of mutants defective in starch synthesis under long days or short days, respectively. We also found that the combined disruption of starch synthesis and fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> turnover resulted in increased accumulation of membrane lipids, triacylglycerol, and soluble sugars and altered fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> flux between the two lipid biosynthetic pathways compartmentalized in either the chloroplast or the endoplasmic reticulum. Collectively, our findings provide insight into the role of fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> β-oxidation and the regulatory network controlling fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthesis, and they reveal the mechanistic basis by which starch and lipid metabolic pathways interact and undergo cross talk to modulate carbon allocation, energy homeostasis, and plant growth.</p>

Overexpression of RING Domain E3 Ligase ZmXerico1 Confers Drought Tolerance through Regulation of ABA Homeostasis
<p>Drought stress is one of the main environmental problems encountered by crop growers. Reduction in arable land area and reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> availability make it paramount to identify and develop strategies to allow crops to be more resilient in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-limiting environments. The plant hormone abscisic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> (ABA) plays an important role in the plants’ response to drought stress through its control of stomatal aperture and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> transpiration, and transgenic modulation of ABA levels therefore represents an attractive avenue to improve the drought tolerance of crops. Several steps in the ABA-signaling pathway are controlled by ubiquitination involving really interesting new genes (RING) domain-containing proteins. We characterized the maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) RING protein family and identified two novel RING-H2 genes called <i>ZmXerico1</i> and <i>ZmXerico2</i>. Expression of <i>ZmXerico</i> genes is induced by drought stress, and we show that overexpression of <i>ZmXerico1</i> and <i>ZmXerico2</i> in Arabidopsis and maize confers ABA hypersensitivity and improved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> use efficiency, which can lead to enhanced maize yield performance in a controlled drought-stress environment. Overexpression of <i>ZmXerico1</i> and <i>ZmXerico2</i> in maize results in increased ABA levels and decreased levels of ABA degradation products diphaseic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> and phaseic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>. We show that ZmXerico1 is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, where ABA 8′-hydroxylases have been shown to be localized, and that it functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. We demonstrate that ZmXerico1 plays a role in the control of ABA homeostasis through regulation of ABA 8′-hydroxylase protein stability, representing a novel control point in the regulation of the ABA pathway.</p>

A Central Role for Triacylglycerol in Membrane Lipid Breakdown, Fatty Acid <i>β</i>-Oxidation, and Plant Survival under Extended Darkness
<p>Neutral lipid metabolism is a key aspect of intracellular homeostasis and energy balance and plays a vital role in cell survival under adverse conditions, including nutrient deprivation in yeast and mammals, but the role of triacylglycerol (TAG) metabolism in plant stress response remains largely unknown. By thoroughly characterizing mutants defective in SUGAR-DEPENDENT1 (SDP1) triacylglycerol lipase or PEROXISOMAL ABC TRANSPORTER 1 (PXA1), here we show that TAG is a key intermediate in the mobilization of fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s from membrane lipids for peroxisomal β-oxidation under prolonged dark treatment. Disruption of SDP1 increased TAG accumulation in cytosolic lipid droplets and markedly enhanced plant tolerance to extended darkness. We demonstrate that blocking TAG hydrolysis enhances plant tolerance to dark treatment via two distinct mechanisms. In <i>pxa1</i> mutants, in which free fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s accumulated rapidly under extended darkness, SDP1 disruption resulted in a marked decrease in levels of cytotoxic lipid intermediates such as free fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s and phosphatidic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, suggesting a buffer function of TAG accumulation against lipotoxicity under fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> overload. In the wild type, in which free fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s remained low and unchanged under dark treatment, disruption of SDP1 caused a decrease in reactive oxygen species production and hence the level of lipid peroxidation, indicating a role of TAG in protection against oxidative damage. Overall, our findings reveal a crucial role for TAG metabolism in membrane lipid breakdown, fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> turnover, and plant survival under extended darkness.</p>

Stearoyl-Acyl Carrier Protein Desaturase Mutations Uncover an Impact of Stearic Acid in Leaf and Nodule Structure
<p>Stearoyl-acyl carrier protein desaturase (SACPD-C) has been reported to control the accumulation of seed stearic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>; however, no study has previously reported its involvement in leaf stearic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> content and impact on leaf structure and morphology. A subset of an ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenized population of soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) ‘Forrest’ was screened to identify mutants within the <i>GmSACPD-C</i> gene. Using a forward genetics approach, one nonsense and four missense <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutants were identified to have high levels of seed, nodule, and leaf stearic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> content. Homology modeling and in silico analysis of the GmSACPD-C enzyme revealed that most of these mutations were localized near or at conserved residues essential for diiron ion coordination. Soybeans carrying <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutations at conserved residues showed the highest stearic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> content, and these mutations were found to have deleterious effects on nodule development and function. Interestingly, mutations at nonconserved residues show an increase in stearic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> content yet retain healthy nodules. Thus, random mutagenesis and mutational analysis allows for the achievement of high seed stearic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> content with no associated negative agronomic characteristics. Additionally, expression analysis demonstrates that nodule leghemoglobin transcripts were significantly more abundant in soybeans with deleterious mutations at conserved residues of GmSACPD-C. Finally, we report that <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutations cause an increase in leaf stearic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> content and an alteration of leaf structure and morphology in addition to differences in nitrogen-fixing nodule structure.</p>

Network-Guided GWAS Improves Identification of Genes Affecting Free Amino Acids
<p>Amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s are essential for proper growth and development in plants. Amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s serve as building blocks for proteins but also are important for responses to stress and the biosynthesis of numerous essential compounds. In seed, the pool of free amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s (FAAs) also contributes to alternative energy, desiccation, and seed vigor; thus, manipulating FAA levels can significantly impact a seed’s nutritional qualities. While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on branched-chain amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s have identified some regulatory genes controlling seed FAAs, the genetic regulation of FAA levels, composition, and homeostasis in seeds remains mostly unresolved. Hence, we performed GWAS on 18 FAAs from a 313-ecotype Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) association panel. Specifically, GWAS was performed on 98 traits derived from known amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> metabolic pathways (approach 1) and then on 92 traits generated from an unbiased correlation-based metabolic network analysis (approach 2), and the results were compared. The latter approach facilitated the discovery of additional novel metabolic interactions and single-nucleotide polymorphism-trait associations not identified by the former approach. The most prominent network-guided GWAS signal was for a histidine (His)-related trait in a region containing two genes: a cationic amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> transporter (CAT4) and a polynucleotide phosphorylase resistant to inhibition with fosmidomycin. A reverse genetics approach confirmed CAT4 to be responsible for the natural variation of His-related traits across the association panel. Given that His is a semiessential amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> and a potent metal chelator, CAT4 orthologs could be considered as candidate genes for seed quality biofortification in crop plants.</p>

Combined effects of defoliation and water stress on pine growth and non-structural carbohydrates
<p>Climate change is expected to increase both pest insect damage and the occurrence of severe drought. There is therefore a need to better understand the combined effects of biotic and abiotic damage on tree growth in order to predict the multi-factorial effect of climate change on forest ecosystem productivity. Indeed, the effect of stress interactions on tree growth is an increasingly important topic that greatly lacks experiments and data, and it is unlikely that the impact of combined stresses can be extrapolated from the outcomes of studies that focused on a single stress. We developed an original manipulative study under real field conditions where we applied artificial defoliation and induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> stress on 10-year-old (∼10 m high) maritime pine trees (<i>Pinus pinaster</i> Ait.). Tree response to combined stresses was quantitatively assessed following tree secondary growth and carbohydrate pools. Such a design allowed us to address the crucial question of combined stresses on trees under stand conditions, sharing soil supplies with neighboring trees. Our initial hypotheses were that (i) moderate defoliation can limit the impact of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> stress on tree growth through reduced transpiration demand by a tree canopy partly defoliated and that (ii) defoliation results in reduced non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) pools, affecting tree tolerance to drought. Our results showed additive effects of defoliation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> stress on tree growth and contradict our initial hypothesis. Indeed, under stand conditions, we found that partial defoliation does not limit the impact of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> stress through reduced transpiration. Our study also highlighted that, even if NSC in all organs were affected by defoliation, tree response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> stress was not triggered. We found that stem NSC were maintained or increased during the entire growing season, supporting literature-based hypotheses such as an active maintenance of the hydraulic system or another limiting resource for tree growth under defoliation. We also observed a significant decrease in root carbohydrates, which suggests a shift in the root carbon balance under defoliation. The decrease in carbohydrate supply under defoliation may not counterbalance the carbon use for mineral and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> uptakes or a translocation to other tissues.</p>

Activation of master virulence regulator PhoP in acidic pH requires the <i>Salmonella</i>-specific protein UgtL
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>ic conditions, such as those inside phagosomes, stimulate the intracellular pathogen <i>Salmonella enterica</i> to activate virulence genes. The sensor PhoQ responds to a mildly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>ic pH by phosphorylating, and thereby activating, the virulence regulator PhoP. This PhoP/PhoQ two-component system is conserved in a subset of Gram-negative bacteria. PhoQ is thought to be sufficient to activate PhoP in mildly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>ic pH. However, we found that the <i>Salmonella</i>-specific protein UgtL, which was horizontally acquired by <i>Salmonella</i> before the divergence of <i>S. enterica</i> and <i>Salmonella bongori</i>, was also necessary for PhoQ to activate PhoP under mildly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>ic pH conditions but not for PhoQ to activate PhoP in response to low Mg<sup>2+</sup> or the antimicrobial peptide C18G. UgtL increased the abundance of phosphorylated PhoP by stimulating autophosphorylation of PhoQ, thereby increasing the amount of the phosphodonor for PhoP. Deletion of <i>ugtL</i> attenuated <i>Salmonella</i> virulence and further reduced PhoP activation in a strain bearing a form of PhoQ that is not responsive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>ic pH. These data suggest that when <i>Salmonella</i> experiences mildly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>ic pH, PhoP activation requires PhoQ to detect pH and UgtL to amplify the PhoQ response. Our findings reveal how acquisition of a foreign gene can strengthen signal responsiveness in an ancestral regulatory system.</p>

A liquid-liquid transition in supercooled aqueous solution related to the HDA-LDA transition
<p>Simulations and theory suggest that the thermodynamic anomalies of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> may be related to a phase transition between two supercooled liquid states, but so far this phase transition has not been observed experimentally because of preemptive ice crystallization.

Chloroplast Damage Induced by the Inhibition of Fatty Acid Synthesis Triggers Autophagy in Chlamydomonas
<p>Fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s are synthesized in the stroma of plant and algal chloroplasts by the fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthase complex. Newly synthesized fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s are then used to generate plastidial lipids that are essential for chloroplast structure and function. Here, we show that inhibition of fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthesis in the model alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> activates autophagy, a highly conserved catabolic process by which cells degrade intracellular material under adverse conditions to maintain cell homeostasis. Treatment of <i>Chlamydomonas</i> cells with cerulenin, a specific fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthase inhibitor, stimulated lipidation of the autophagosome protein ATG8 and enhanced autophagic flux. We found that inhibition of fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthesis decreased monogalactosyldiacylglycerol abundance, increased lutein content, down-regulated photosynthesis, and increased the production of reactive oxygen species. Electron microscopy revealed a high degree of thylakoid membrane stacking in cerulenin-treated cells. Moreover, global transcriptomic analysis of these cells showed an up-regulation of genes encoding chloroplast proteins involved in protein folding and oxidative stress and the induction of major catabolic processes, including autophagy and proteasome pathways. Thus, our results uncovered a link between lipid metabolism, chloroplast integrity, and autophagy through a mechanism that involves the activation of a chloroplast quality control system.</p>

Time-Course Transcriptomics Analysis Reveals Key Responses of Submerged Deepwater Rice to Flooding
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> submergence is an environmental factor that limits plant growth and survival. Deep<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) adapts to submergence by rapidly elongating its internodes and thereby maintaining its leaves above the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> surface. We performed a comparative RNA sequencing transcriptome analysis of the shoot base region, including basal nodes, internodes, and shoot apices of seedlings at two developmental stages from two varieties with contrasting deep<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> growth responses. A transcriptomic comparison between deep<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> rice cv C9285 and nondeep<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> rice cv Taichung 65 revealed both similar and differential expression patterns between the two genotypes during submergence. The expression of genes related to gibberellin biosynthesis, trehalose biosynthesis, anaerobic fermentation, cell wall modification, and transcription factors that include ethylene-responsive factors was significantly different between the varieties. Interestingly, in both varieties, the jasmonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> content at the shoot base decreased during submergence, while exogenous jasmonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> inhibited submergence-induced internode elongation in cv C9285, suggesting that jasmonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> plays a role in the submergence response of rice. Furthermore, a targeted de novo transcript assembly revealed transcripts that were specific to cv C9285, including submergence-induced biotic stress-related genes. Our multifaceted transcriptome approach using the rice shoot base region illustrates a differential response to submergence between deep<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> and nondeep<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> rice. Jasmonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> metabolism appears to participate in the submergence-mediated internode elongation response of deep<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> rice.</p>

Alternative Oxidase Isoforms Are Differentially Activated by Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle Intermediates
<p>The cyanide-insensitive alternative oxidase (AOX) is a non-proton-pumping ubiquinol oxidase that catalyzes the reduction of oxygen to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> and is posttranslationally regulated by redox mechanisms and 2-oxo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) possesses five AOX isoforms (AOX1A–AOX1D and AOX2). AOX1D expression is increased in <i>aox1a</i> knockout mutants from Arabidopsis (especially after restriction of the cytochrome <i>c</i> pathway) but cannot compensate for the lack of AOX1A, suggesting a difference in the regulation of these isoforms. Therefore, we analyzed the different AOX isoenzymes with the aim to identify differences in their posttranslational regulation. Seven tricarboxylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> cycle intermediates (citrate, isocitrate, 2-oxoglutarate, succinate, fumarate, malate, and oxaloacetate) were tested for their influence on AOX1A, AOX1C, and AOX1D wild-type protein activity using a refined in vitro system. AOX1C is insensitive to all seven organic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s, AOX1A and AOX1D are both activated by 2-oxoglutarate, but only AOX1A is additionally activated by oxaloacetate. Furthermore, AOX isoforms cannot be transformed to mimic one another by substituting the variable cysteine residues at position III in the protein. In summary, we show that AOX isoforms from Arabidopsis are differentially fine-regulated by tricarboxylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> cycle metabolites (most likely depending on the amino-terminal region around the highly conserved cysteine residues known to be involved in regulation by the 2-oxo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s pyruvate and glyoxylate) and propose that this is the main reason why they cannot functionally compensate for each other.</p>

Abscisic Acid Down-Regulates Hydraulic Conductance of Grapevine Leaves in Isohydric Genotypes Only<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plants evolved different strategies to cope with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> stress. While isohydric species maintain their midday leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> potential (Ψ<sub>M</sub>) under soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit by closing their stomata, anisohydric species maintain higher stomatal aperture and exhibit substantial reductions in Ψ<sub>M</sub>. It was hypothesized that isohydry is related to a locally higher sensitivity of stomata to the drought-hormone abscisic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> (ABA). Interestingly, recent lines of evidence in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) suggested that stomatal responsiveness is also controlled by an ABA action on leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> supply upstream from stomata. Here, we tested the possibility in grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) that different genotypes ranging from near isohydric to more anisohydric may have different sensitivities in these ABA responses. Measurements on whole plants in drought conditions were combined with assays on detached leaves fed with ABA. Two different methods consistently showed that leaf hydraulic conductance (K<sub>leaf</sub>) was down-regulated by exogenous ABA, with strong variations depending on the genotype. Importantly, variation between isohydry and anisohydry correlated with K<sub>leaf</sub> sensitivity to ABA, with K<sub>leaf</sub> in the most anisohydric genotypes being unresponsive to the hormone. We propose that the observed response of K<sub>leaf</sub> to ABA may be part of the overall ABA regulation of leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> status.</p>

Genetic Control of Plasticity in Root Morphology and Anatomy of Rice in Response to Water Deficit
<p>Elucidating the genetic control of rooting behavior under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-deficit stress is essential to breed climate-robust rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) cultivars. Using a diverse panel of 274 <i>indica</i> genotypes grown under control and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-deficit conditions during vegetative growth, we phenotyped 35 traits, mostly related to root morphology and anatomy, involving 45,000 root-scanning images and nearly 25,000 cross sections from the root-shoot junction. The phenotypic plasticity of these traits was quantified as the relative change in trait value under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-deficit compared with control conditions.

One hundred four significant loci were detected for these traits under control conditions, 106 were detected under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-deficit stress, and 76 were detected for trait plasticity. We predicted 296 (control), 284 (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-deficit stress), and 233 (plasticity) a priori candidate genes within linkage disequilibrium blocks for these loci.

The Chinese soft-shelled turtle, <i>Pelodiscus sinensis</i>, decreases nitrogenous excretion, reduces urea synthesis and suppresses ammonia production during emersion
<p>The objective of this study was to examine the effects of 6 days of emersion on nitrogen metabolism and excretion in the Chinese soft-shelled turtle, <i>Pelodiscus sinensis</i>. Despite having a soft shell with a cutaneous surface that is known to be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> permeable, <i>P. sinensis</i> lost only ~2% of body mass and was able to maintain its hematocrit and plasma osmolality, [Na<sup>+</sup>] and [Cl<sup>−</sup>] during 6 days of emersion. During emersion, it ameliorated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> loss by reducing urine output, which led to a reduction (by 29–76%) in ammonia excretion. In comparison, there was a more prominent reduction (by 82–99%) in urea excretion during emersion due to a lack of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> to flush the buccopharyngeal epithelium, which is known to be the major route of urea excretion. Consequently, emersion resulted in an apparent shift from ureotely to ammonotely in <i>P. sinensis</i>. Although urea concentration increased in several tissues, the excess urea accumulated could only account for 13–22% of the deficit in urea excretion. Hence, it can be concluded that a decrease (~80%) in urea synthesis occurred in <i>P. sinensis</i> during the 6 days of emersion. Indeed, emersion led to significant decreases in the activity of some ornithine–urea cycle enzymes (argininosuccinate synthetase/argininosuccinate lyase and arginase) from the liver of <i>P. sinensis</i>. As a decrease in urea synthesis occurred without the accumulation of ammonia and total free amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s, it can be deduced that ammonia production through amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> catabolism was suppressed with a proportional reduction in proteolysis in <i>P. sinensis</i> during emersion. Indeed, calculated results revealed that there could be a prominent decrease (~88%) in ammonia production in turtles after 6 days of emersion. In summary, despite being ureogenic and ureotelic in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>, <i>P. sinensis</i> adopted a reduction in ammonia production, instead of increased urea synthesis, as the major strategy to ameliorate ammonia toxicity and problems associated with dehydration during terrestrial exposure.</p>

Natural noncanonical protein splicing yields products with diverse β-amino acid residues
<p>Current textbook knowledge holds that the structural scope of ribosomal biosynthesis is based exclusively on α-amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> backbone topology. Here we report the genome-guided discovery of bacterial pathways that posttranslationally create β-amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>–containing products. The transformation is widespread in bacteria and is catalyzed by an enzyme belonging to a previously uncharacterized radical <i>S</i>-adenosylmethionine family. We show that the β-amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s result from an unusual protein splicing process involving backbone carbon-carbon bond cleavage and net excision of tyramine. The reaction can be used to incorporate diverse and multiple β-amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s into genetically encoded precursors in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. In addition to enlarging the set of basic amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> components, the excision generates keto functions that are useful as orthogonal reaction sites for chemical diversification.</p>

Lysosomal metabolomics reveals V-ATPase- and mTOR-dependent regulation of amino acid efflux from lysosomes
<p>The lysosome degrades and recycles macromolecules, signals to the cytosol and nucleus, and is implicated in many diseases. Here, we describe a method for the rapid isolation of mammalian lysosomes and use it to quantitatively profile lysosomal metabolites under various cell states. Under nutrient-replete conditions, many lysosomal amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s are in rapid exchange with those in the cytosol. Loss of lysosomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>ification through inhibition of the vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>–adenosine triphosphatase (V-ATPase) increased the luminal concentrations of most metabolites but had no effect on those of the majority of essential amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s. Instead, nutrient starvation regulates the lysosomal concentrations of these amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s, an effect we traced to regulation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Inhibition of mTOR strongly reduced the lysosomal efflux of most essential amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s, converting the lysosome into a cellular depot for them. These results reveal the dynamic nature of lysosomal metabolites and that V-ATPase- and mTOR-dependent mechanisms exist for controlling lysosomal amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> efflux.</p>

Thirst-associated preoptic neurons encode an aversive motivational drive
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deprivation produces a drive to seek and consume <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>. How neural activity creates this motivation remains poorly understood. We used activity-dependent genetic labeling to characterize neurons activated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deprivation in the hypothalamic median preoptic nucleus (MnPO). Single-cell transcriptional profiling revealed that dehydration-activated MnPO neurons consist of a single excitatory cell type. After optogenetic activation of these neurons, mice drank <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> and performed an operant lever-pressing task for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> reward with rates that scaled with stimulation frequency. This stimulation was aversive, and instrumentally pausing stimulation could reinforce lever-pressing. Activity of these neurons gradually decreased over the course of an operant session. Thus, the activity of dehydration-activated MnPO neurons establishes a scalable, persistent, and aversive internal state that dynamically controls thirst-motivated behavior.</p>

The Hydrogen Isotope Composition δ<sup>2</sup>H Reflects Plant Performance
<p>The stable carbon (δ<sup>13</sup>C) and oxygen (δ<sup>18</sup>O) isotope compositions in plant matter reflect photosynthetic and transpirative conditions in plants, respectively. However, the nature of hydrogen isotope composition (δ<sup>2</sup>H) and what it reflects of plant performance is poorly understood. Using durum wheat (<i>Triticum turgidum</i> var <i>durum</i>), this study evaluated the effect of different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> and nitrogen growing field conditions on transpiration and how this effect influenced the performance of δ<sup>2</sup>H in autotrophic (flag leaf), mixotrophic (ears), and heterotrophic (grains and roots) organs. Moreover, δ<sup>2</sup>H was compared with the δ<sup>13</sup>C and δ<sup>18</sup>O in the same organs. Isotope compositions were analyzed in dry matter, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-soluble fraction, and in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> from different tissues of a set of genotypes. Similar to δ<sup>13</sup>C, the δ<sup>2</sup>H correlated negatively with stomatal conductance, whereas no correlation was observed for δ<sup>18</sup>O. Moreover, δ<sup>2</sup>H was not only affected by changes in transpiration but also by photosynthetic reactions, probably as a consequence of NADPH formation in autotrophic organs. Compared with the δ<sup>2</sup>H of stem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>, plant δ<sup>2</sup>H was strongly diminished in photosynthetic organs such as the flag leaves, whereas it strongly increased in heterotrophic organs such as grains and roots. In heterotrophic organs, δ<sup>2</sup>H was associated with postphotosynthetic effects because there are several processes that lead to <sup>2</sup>H-enrichment of carbohydrates. In summary, δ<sup>2</sup>H exhibited specific features that inform about the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> conditions of the wheat crop, together with the photosynthetic characteristics of the plant part considered. Moreover, correlations of δ<sup>2</sup>H with grain yield illustrate that this isotope can be used to assess plant performance under different growing conditions.</p>

Identification of Genes Encoding Enzymes Catalyzing the Early Steps of Carrot Polyacetylene Biosynthesis
<p>Polyacetylenic lipids accumulate in various Apiaceae species after pathogen attack, suggesting that these compounds are naturally occurring pesticides and potentially valuable resources for crop improvement. These compounds also promote human health and slow tumor growth. Even though polyacetylenic lipids were discovered decades ago, the biosynthetic pathway underlying their production is largely unknown. To begin filling this gap and ultimately enable polyacetylene engineering, we studied polyacetylenes and their biosynthesis in the major Apiaceae crop carrot (<i>Daucus carota</i> subsp. <i>sativus</i>). Using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, we identified three known polyacetylenes and assigned provisional structures to two novel polyacetylenes. We also quantified these compounds in carrot leaf, petiole, root xylem, root phloem, and root periderm extracts. Falcarindiol and falcarinol predominated and accumulated primarily in the root periderm. Since the multiple double and triple carbon-carbon bonds that distinguish polyacetylenes from ubiquitous fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s are often introduced by Δ12 oleic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> desaturase (FAD2)-type enzymes, we mined the carrot genome for <i>FAD2</i> genes. We identified a <i>FAD2</i> family with an unprecedented 24 members and analyzed public, tissue-specific carrot RNA-Seq data to identify coexpressed members with root periderm-enhanced expression. Six candidate genes were heterologously expressed individually and in combination in yeast and Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), resulting in the identification of one canonical FAD2 that converts oleic to linoleic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, three divergent FAD2-like acetylenases that convert linoleic into crepenynic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, and two bifunctional FAD2s with Δ12 and Δ14 desaturase activity that convert crepenynic into the further desaturated dehydrocrepenynic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, a polyacetylene pathway intermediate. These genes can now be used as a basis for discovering other steps of falcarin-type polyacetylene biosynthesis, to modulate polyacetylene levels in plants, and to test the in planta function of these molecules.</p>

Nodulin Intrinsic Protein 7;1 Is a Tapetal Boric Acid Channel Involved in Pollen Cell Wall Formation
<p>Boron is an essential plant micronutrient that plays a structural role in the rhamnogalacturonan II component of the pectic cell wall. To prevent boron deficiency under limiting conditions, its uptake, distribution, and homeostasis are mediated by boric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> transporters and channel proteins. Among the membrane channels that facilitate boric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> uptake are the type II nodulin intrinsic protein (NIP) subfamily of aquaporin-like proteins. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) possesses three NIP II genes (<i>NIP5;1</i>, <i>NIP6;1</i>, and <i>NIP7;1</i>) that show distinct tissue expression profiles (predominantly expressed in roots, stem nodes, and developing flowers, respectively). Orthologs of each are represented in all dicots. Here, we show that purified and reconstituted NIP7;1 is a boric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> facilitator. By using native promoter-reporter fusions, we show that NIP7;1 is expressed predominantly in anthers of young flowers in a narrow developmental window, floral stages 9 and 10, with protein accumulation solely within tapetum cells, where it is localized to the plasma membrane. Under limiting boric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> conditions, loss-of-function T-DNA mutants (<i>nip7;1-1</i> and <i>nip7;1-2</i>) show reduced fertility, including shorter siliques and an increase in aborted seeds, compared with the wild type. Under these conditions, <i>nip7;1</i> mutant pollen grains show morphological defects, increased aggregation, defective exine cell wall formation, reduced germination frequency, and decreased viability. During stages 9 and 10, the tapetum is essential for supplying materials to the pollen microspore cell wall. We propose that NIP7;1 serves as a gated boric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> channel in developing anthers that aids in the uptake of this critical micronutrient by tapetal cells.</p>

Screening for Biologically Annotated Drugs That Trigger Triacylglycerol Accumulation in the Diatom <i>Phaeodactylum</i>
<p>Microalgae are a promising feedstock for the production of triacylglycerol (TAG) for a variety of potential applications, ranging from food and human health to biofuels and green chemistry. However, obtaining high TAG yields is challenging. A phenotypic assay for the accumulation of oil droplets was developed to screen a library of 1,200 drugs, annotated with pharmacology information, to select compounds that trigger TAG accumulation in the diatom <i>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</i>. Using this screen, we identified 34 molecules acting in a dose-dependent manner. Previously characterized targets of these compounds include cell division and cell signaling effectors, membrane receptors and transporters, and sterol metabolism. Among the five compounds possibly acting on sterol metabolism, we focused our study on ethynylestradiol, a synthetic form of estrogen that is used in contraceptive pills and known for its ecological impact as an endocrine disruptor. Ethynylestradiol impaired the production of very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s, destabilized the galactolipid versus phospholipid balance, and triggered the recycling of fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s from membrane lipids to TAG. The <i>P. tricornutum</i> transcriptomic response to treatment with ethynylestradiol was consistent with the reallocation of carbon from sterols to acetyl-coenzyme A and TAG. The mode of action and catabolism of ethynylestradiol are unknown but might involve several up-regulated cytochrome P450 proteins. A fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> elongase, Δ6-ELO-B1, might be involved in the impairment of very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s and fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> turnover. This phenotypic screen opens new perspectives for the exploration of novel bioactive molecules, potential target genes, and pathways controlling TAG biosynthesis. It also unraveled the sensitivity of diatoms to endocrine disruptors, highlighting an impact of anthropogenic pollution on phytoplankton.</p>

Biotin Attachment Domain-Containing Proteins Irreversibly Inhibit Acetyl CoA Carboxylase
<p>The first committed step in fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthesis is mediated by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase), a biotin-dependent enzyme that carboxylates acetyl-CoA to produce malonyl-CoA. ACCase can be feedback regulated by short-term or long-term exposure to fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s in the form of Tween 80 (predominantly containing oleic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>), which results in reversible or irreversible ACCase inhibition, respectively. Biotin attachment domain-containing (BADC) proteins are inactive analogs of biotin carboxyl transfer proteins that lack biotin, and their incorporation into ACCase down-regulates its activity by displacing active (biotin-containing) biotin carboxyltransferase protein subunits. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) lines containing T-DNA insertions in <i>BADC1</i>, <i>BADC2</i>, and <i>BADC3</i> were used to generate <i>badc1 badc2</i> and <i>badc1 badc3</i> double mutants. The <i>badc1 badc3</i> mutant exhibited normal growth and development; however, ACCase activity was 26% higher in <i>badc1 badc3</i> and its seeds contained 30.1% more fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s and 32.6% more triacylgycerol relative to wild-type plants. To assess whether BADC contributes to the irreversible phase of ACCase inhibition, cell suspension cultures were generated from the leaves of <i>badc1 badc3</i> and wild-type plants and treated with 10 m<sc>m</sc> Tween 80. Reversible ACCase inhibition was similar in <i>badc1 badc3</i> and wild-type cultures after 2 d of Tween 80 treatment, but irreversible inhibition was reduced by 50% in <i>badc1 badc3</i> relative to wild-type plants following 4 d of Tween 80 treatment. In this study, we present evidence for two important homeostatic roles for BADC proteins in down-regulating ACCase activity: by acting during normal growth and development and by contributing to its long-term irreversible feedback inhibition resulting from the oversupply of fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s.</p>

<i>S5H/DMR6</i> Encodes a Salicylic Acid 5-Hydroxylase That Fine-Tunes Salicylic Acid Homeostasis
<p>The phytohormone salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> (SA) plays essential roles in biotic and abiotic responses, plant development, and leaf senescence. 2,5-Dihydroxybenzoic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> (2,5-DHBA or gentisic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>) is one of the most commonly occurring aromatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s in green plants and is assumed to be generated from SA, but the enzymes involved in its production remain obscure. DMR6 (Downy Mildew Resistant6; At5g24530) has been proven essential in plant immunity of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), but its biochemical properties are not well understood. Here, we report the discovery and functional characterization of DMR6 as a salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> 5-hydroxylase (S5H) that catalyzes the formation of 2,5-DHBA by hydroxylating SA at the C5 position of its phenyl ring in Arabidopsis. S5H/DMR6 specifically converts SA to 2,5-DHBA in vitro and displays higher catalytic efficiency (<i>K</i><sub>cat</sub>/<i>K</i><sub>m</sub> = 4.96 × 10<sup>4</sup> <sc>m</sc><sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) than the previously reported S3H (<i>K</i><sub>cat</sub>/<i>K</i><sub>m</sub> = 6.09 × 10<sup>3</sup> <sc>m</sc><sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) for SA. Interestingly, S5H/DMR6 displays a substrate inhibition property that may enable automatic control of its enzyme activities. The <i>s5h</i> mutant and <i>s5hs3h</i> double mutant overaccumulate SA and display phenotypes such as a smaller growth size, early senescence, and a loss of susceptibility to <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>tomato</i> DC3000. <i>S5H</i>/<i>DMR6</i> is sensitively induced by SA/pathogen treatment and is expressed widely from young seedlings to senescing plants, whereas <i>S3H</i> is more specifically expressed at the mature and senescing stages. Collectively, our results disclose the identity of the enzyme required for 2,5-DHBA formation and reveal a mechanism by which plants fine-tune SA homeostasis by mediating SA 5-hydroxylation.</p>

Autophagy Deficiency Compromises Alternative Pathways of Respiration following Energy Deprivation in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>Under heterotrophic conditions, carbohydrate oxidation inside the mitochondrion is the primary energy source for cellular metabolism. However, during energy-limited conditions, alternative substrates are required to support respiration. Amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> oxidation in plant cells plays a key role in this by generating electrons that can be transferred to the mitochondrial electron transport chain via the electron transfer flavoprotein/ubiquinone oxidoreductase system. Autophagy, a catabolic mechanism for macromolecule and protein recycling, allows the maintenance of amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> pools and nutrient remobilization. Although the association between autophagy and alternative respiratory substrates has been suggested, the extent to which autophagy and primary metabolism interact to support plant respiration remains unclear. To investigate the metabolic importance of autophagy during development and under extended darkness, Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants with disruption of autophagy (<i>atg</i> mutants) were used. Under normal growth conditions, <i>atg</i> mutants showed lower growth and seed production with no impact on photosynthesis. Following extended darkness, <i>atg</i> mutants were characterized by signatures of early senescence, including decreased chlorophyll content and maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II coupled with increases in dark respiration. Transcript levels of genes involved in alternative pathways of respiration and amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> catabolism were up-regulated in <i>atg</i> mutants. The metabolite profiles of dark-treated leaves revealed an extensive metabolic reprogramming in which increases in amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> levels were partially compromised in <i>atg</i> mutants. Although an enhanced respiration in <i>atg</i> mutants was observed during extended darkness, autophagy deficiency compromises protein degradation and the generation of amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s used as alternative substrates to the respiration.</p>

An R2R3-MYB Transcription Factor Regulates Capsaicinoid Biosynthesis
<p>Capsaicinoids are responsible for the hot taste of chili peppers. They are restricted to the genus <i>Capsicum</i> and are synthesized by the acylation of the aromatic compound vanillylamine (derived from the phenylpropanoid pathway) with a branched-chain fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> by the catalysis of the putative enzyme capsaicinoid synthase. R2R3-MYB transcription factors have been reported in different species of plants as regulators of structural genes of the phenylpropanoid pathway; therefore, we hypothesized that MYB genes might be involved in the regulation of the biosynthesis of pungent compounds. In this study, an <i>R2R3-MYB</i> transcription factor gene, designated <i>CaMYB31</i>, was isolated and characterized in <i>Capsicum annuum</i> ‘Tampiqueíííéóéííóéíño 74’. Bioinformatic analysis suggested that <i>CaMYB31</i> could be involved in secondary metabolism, stress and plant hormone responses, and development. <i>CaMYB31</i> expression analysis from placental tissue of pungent and nonpungent chili pepper fruits showed a positive correlation with the structural genes <i>Ca4H</i>, <i>Comt</i>, <i>Kas</i>, <i>pAmt</i>, and <i>AT3</i> expression and also with the content of capsaicin and dihydrocapsacin during fruit development. However, <i>CaMYB31</i> also was expressed in vegetative tissues (leaves, roots, and stems). Moreover, <i>CaMYB31</i> silencing significantly reduced the expression of capsaicinoid biosynthetic genes and the capsaicinoid content. Additionally, <i>CaMYB31</i> expression was affected by the plant hormones indoleacetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, jasmonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, and gibberellic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> or by wounding, temperature, and light, factors known to affect the production of capsaicinoids. These findings indicate that <i>CaMYB31</i> is indeed involved in the regulation of structural genes of the capsaicinoid biosynthetic pathway.</p>

Stress-Related Gene Expression Reflects Morphophysiological Responses to Water Deficit
<p>Acclimation to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit (WD) enables plants to maintain growth under unfavorable environmental conditions, although the mechanisms are not completely understood. In this study, the natural variation of long-term acclimation to moderate and severe soil WD was investigated in 18 Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) accessions using PHENOPSIS, an automated phenotyping platform. Soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> content was adjusted at an early stage of plant development and maintained at a constant level until reproductive age was achieved. The accessions were selected based on the expression levels of <i>ANNEXIN1</i>, a drought-related marker. Severe WD conditions had a greater effect on most of the measured morphophysiological traits than moderate WD conditions. Multivariate analyses indicated that trait responses associated with plant size and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> management drove most of the variation. Accessions with similar responses at these two levels were grouped in clusters that displayed different response strategies to WD. The expression levels of selected stress-response genes revealed large natural variation under WD conditions. Responses of morphophysiological traits, such as projected rosette area, transpiration rate, and rosette <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> content, were correlated with changes in the expression of stress-related genes, such as <i>NINE-CIS-EPOXYCAROTENOID DIOXYGENASE3</i> and <i>N-MYC DOWNREGULATED-LIKE1</i> (<i>NDL1</i>), in response to WD. Interestingly, the morphophysiological acclimation response to WD also was reflected in the gene expression levels (most notably those of <i>NDL1</i>, <i>CHALCONE SYNTHASE</i>, and <i>MYB DOMAIN PROTEIN44</i>) in plants cultivated under well-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>ed conditions. Our results may lead to the development of biomarkers and predictors of plant morphophysiological responses based on gene expression patterns.</p>

Drought-Enhanced Xylem Sap Sulfate Closes Stomata by Affecting ALMT12 and Guard Cell ABA Synthesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> limitation of plants causes stomatal closure to prevent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> loss by transpiration. For this purpose, progressing soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit is communicated from roots to shoots. Abscisic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> (ABA) is the key signal in stress-induced stomatal closure, but ABA as an early xylem-delivered signal is still a matter of debate. In this study, poplar plants (<i>Populus × canescens</i>) were exposed to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> stress to investigate xylem sap sulfate and ABA, stomatal conductance, and sulfate transporter (<i>SULTR</i>) expression. In addition, stomatal behavior and expression of ABA receptors, drought-responsive genes, transcription factors, and <i>NCED3</i> were studied after feeding sulfate and ABA to detached poplar leaves and epidermal peels of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The results show that increased xylem sap sulfate is achieved upon drought by reduced xylem unloading by PtaSULTR3;3a and PtaSULTR1;1, and by enhanced loading from parenchyma cells into the xylem via PtaALMT3b. Sulfate application caused stomatal closure in excised leaves and peeled epidermis. In the loss of sulfate-channel function mutant, At<i>almt12</i>, sulfate-triggered stomatal closure was impaired. The QUAC1/ALMT12 anion channel heterologous expressed in oocytes was gated open by extracellular sulfate. Sulfate up-regulated the expression of <i>NCED3</i>, a key step of ABA synthesis, in guard cells. In conclusion, xylem-derived sulfate seems to be a chemical signal of drought that induces stomatal closure via QUAC1/ALMT12 and/or guard cell ABA synthesis.</p>

Variable Mesophyll Conductance among Soybean Cultivars Sets a Tradeoff between Photosynthesis and Water-Use-Efficiency
<p>Photosynthetic efficiency is a critical determinant of crop yield potential, although it remains below the theoretical optimum in modern crop varieties. Enhancing mesophyll conductance (i.e. the rate of carbon dioxide diffusion from substomatal cavities to the sites of carboxylation) may increase photosynthetic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> use efficiencies. To improve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> use efficiency, mesophyll conductance should be increased without concomitantly increasing stomatal conductance. Here, we partition the variance in mesophyll conductance to within- and among-cultivar components across soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) grown under both controlled and field conditions and examine the covariation of mesophyll conductance with photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> use efficiency, and leaf mass per area. We demonstrate that mesophyll conductance varies more than 2-fold and that 38% of this variation is due to cultivar identity. As expected, mesophyll conductance is positively correlated with photosynthetic rates. However, a strong positive correlation between mesophyll and stomatal conductance among cultivars apparently impedes positive scaling between mesophyll conductance and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> use efficiency in soybean. Contrary to expectations, photosynthetic rates and mesophyll conductance both increased with increasing leaf mass per area. The presence of genetic variation for mesophyll conductance suggests that there is potential to increase photosynthesis and mesophyll conductance by selecting for greater leaf mass per area. Increasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> use efficiency, though, is unlikely unless there is simultaneous stabilizing selection on stomatal conductance.</p>

A Specialized Diacylglycerol Acyltransferase Contributes to the Extreme Medium-Chain Fatty Acid Content of <i>Cuphea</i> Seed Oil
<p>Seed oils of many <i>Cuphea</i> sp. contain >90% of medium-chain fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s, such as decanoic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> (10:0). These seed oils, which are among the most compositionally variant in the plant kingdom, arise from specialized fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> biosynthetic enzymes and specialized acyltransferases. These include lysophosphatidic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> acyltransferases (LPAT) and diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGAT) that are required for successive acylation of medium-chain fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s in the <i>sn</i>-2 and <i>sn</i>-3 positions of seed triacylglycerols (TAGs). Here we report the identification of a cDNA for a DGAT1-type enzyme, designated CpuDGAT1, from the transcriptome of <i>C. avigera</i> var <i>pulcherrima</i> developing seeds. Microsomes of camelina (<i>Camelina sativa</i>) seeds engineered for CpuDGAT1 expression displayed DGAT activity with 10:0-CoA and the diacylglycerol didecanoyl, that was approximately 4-fold higher than that in camelina seed microsomes lacking CpuDGAT1. In addition, coexpression in camelina seeds of CpuDGAT1 with a <i>C. viscosissima</i> FatB thioesterase (CvFatB1) that generates 10:0 resulted in TAGs with nearly 15 mol % of 10:0. More strikingly, expression of CpuDGAT1 and CvFatB1 with the previously described CvLPAT2, a 10:0-CoA-specific <i>Cuphea</i> LPAT, increased 10:0 amounts to 25 mol % in camelina seed TAG. These TAGs contained up to 40 mol % 10:0 in the <i>sn</i>-2 position, nearly double the amounts obtained from coexpression of CvFatB1 and CvLPAT2 alone. Although enriched in diacylglycerol, 10:0 was not detected in phosphatidylcholine in these seeds. These findings are consistent with channeling of 10:0 into TAG through the combined activities of specialized LPAT and DGAT activities and demonstrate the biotechnological use of these enzymes to generate 10:0-rich seed oils.</p>

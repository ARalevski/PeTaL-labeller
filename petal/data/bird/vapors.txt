Impact of Smoking on Circulating Cardiac Troponin I Concentrations and Cardiovascular Events in the General Population
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Both tobacco smoking and circulating cardiac troponin I (cTnI) levels are associated with the risk of acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and cardiovascular death. However, whether cTnI levels differ according to smoking status and whether smoking modifies the prognostic relationship between cTnI and outcomes remain unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using data from a large, population-based cohort, we assessed the association between smoking and cTnI and the impact of smoking on the associations between cTnI levels and the incidence of acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and cardiovascular death. cTnI was measured with a high-sensitivity assay in 3824 never <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">smoke</span></strong>rs, 2341 former <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">smoke</span></strong>rs, and 2550 current <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">smoke</span></strong>rs participating in the prospective observational HUNT Study (Nord-Trøndelag Health Study). All subjects were free from known prior cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus at baseline.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The age of the participants ranged from 19 to 94 years; 55.5% were women. Current <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">smoke</span></strong>rs exhibited significantly lower levels of cTnI (median, 2.9 ng/L; interquartile range, 2.0–4.1 ng/L) than never <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">smoke</span></strong>rs (3.2 ng/L; interquartile range, 2.2–4.7 ng/L; <i>P</i><0.001) and former <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">smoke</span></strong>rs (3.4 ng/L; interquartile range, 2.3–5.0 ng/L; <i>P</i><0.001). This association remained significant after adjustment for potential confounders (B=−0.098; 95% confidence interval, −0.129 to −0.068). We observed an association between increasing concentrations of cTnI and clinical end points in the total study cohort (adjusted hazard ratio per log unit increase in cTnI, 1.41; 95% confidence interval, 1.29–1.54). This association was attenuated for current <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">smoke</span></strong>rs (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95% confidence interval, 0.98–1.40) and was significantly weaker than in never/former <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">smoke</span></strong>rs (<i>P</i> for interaction=0.003). Prognostic accuracy, as assessed by C statistics, was significantly lower in current <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">smoke</span></strong>rs than in never <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">smoke</span></strong>rs (<i>P</i><0.001). In addition, cTnI provided no incremental prognostic information to the Framingham Cardiovascular Disease risk score in current <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">smoke</span></strong>rs (<i>P</i>=0.08).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Current smoking is associated with lower concentrations of cTnI, suggesting that substances in tobacco <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">smoke</span></strong> may affect cardiomyocyte injury. The association between cTnI levels and cardiovascular end points is stronger in never/former <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">smoke</span></strong>rs than in current <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">smoke</span></strong>rs, compatible with the theory that the detrimental cardiovascular impact of current smoking is mediated via mechanisms other than subclinical myocardial injury.</p></sec>

Cardiovascular Consequences of Childhood Secondhand Tobacco Smoke Exposure: Prevailing Evidence, Burden, and Racial and Socioeconomic Disparities: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although public health programs have led to a substantial decrease in the prevalence of tobacco smoking, the adverse health effects of tobacco <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">smoke</span></strong> exposure are by no means a thing of the past. In the United States, 4 of 10 school-aged children and 1 of 3 adolescents are involuntarily exposed to secondhand tobacco <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">smoke</span></strong> (SHS), with children of minority ethnic backgrounds and those living in low-socioeconomic-status households being disproportionately affected (68% and 43%, respectively). Children are particularly vulnerable, with little control over home and social environment, and lack the understanding, agency, and ability to avoid SHS exposure on their own volition; they also have physiological or behavioral characteristics that render them especially susceptible to effects of SHS. Side-stream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">smoke</span></strong> (the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">smoke</span></strong> emanating from the burning end of the cigarette), a major component of SHS, contains a higher concentration of some toxins than mainstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">smoke</span></strong> (inhaled by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">smoke</span></strong>r directly), making SHS potentially as dangerous as or even more dangerous than direct smoking. Compelling animal and human evidence shows that SHS exposure during childhood is detrimental to arterial function and structure, resulting in premature atherosclerosis and its cardiovascular consequences. Childhood SHS exposure is also related to impaired cardiac autonomic function and changes in heart rate variability. In addition, childhood SHS exposure is associated with clustering of cardiometabolic risk factors such as obesity, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance. Individualized interventions to reduce childhood exposure to SHS are shown to be at least modestly effective, as are broader-based policy initiatives such as community smoking bans and increased taxation.</p></sec><sec><title>Purpose:</title><p>The purpose of this statement is to summarize the available evidence on the cardiovascular health consequences of childhood SHS exposure; this will support ongoing efforts to further reduce and eliminate SHS exposure in this vulnerable population. This statement reviews relevant data from epidemiological studies, laboratory-based experiments, and controlled behavioral trials concerning SHS and cardiovascular disease risk in children. Information on the effects of SHS exposure on the cardiovascular system in animal and pediatric studies, including vascular disruption and platelet activation, oxidation and inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, increased vascular stiffness, changes in vascular structure, and autonomic dysfunction, is examined.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The epidemiological, observational, and experimental evidence accumulated to date demonstrates the detrimental cardiovascular consequences of SHS exposure in children.</p></sec><sec><title>Implications:</title><p>Increased awareness of the adverse, lifetime cardiovascular consequences of childhood SHS may facilitate the development of innovative individual, family-centered, and community health interventions to reduce and ideally eliminate SHS exposure in the vulnerable pediatric population. This evidence calls for a robust public health policy that embraces zero tolerance of childhood SHS exposure.</p></sec>

Mutational signatures associated with tobacco smoking in human cancer
<p>Tobacco smoking increases the risk of at least 17 classes of human cancer. We analyzed somatic mutations and DNA methylation in 5243 cancers of types for which tobacco smoking confers an elevated risk. Smoking is associated with increased mutation burdens of multiple distinct mutational signatures, which contribute to different extents in different cancers. One of these signatures, mainly found in cancers derived from tissues directly exposed to tobacco <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">smoke</span></strong>, is attributable to misreplication of DNA damage caused by tobacco carcinogens. Others likely reflect indirect activation of DNA editing by APOBEC cytidine deaminases and of an endogenous clocklike mutational process. Smoking is associated with limited differences in methylation. The results are consistent with the proposition that smoking increases cancer risk by increasing the somatic mutation load, although direct evidence for this mechanism is lacking in some smoking-related cancer types.</p>

Loss of Cardioprotective Effects at the <i>ADAMTS7</i> Locus as a Result of Gene-Smoking Interactions
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Common diseases such as coronary heart disease (CHD) are complex in etiology. The interaction of genetic susceptibility with lifestyle factors may play a prominent role. However, gene-lifestyle interactions for CHD have been difficult to identify. Here, we investigate interaction of smoking behavior, a potent lifestyle factor, with genotypes that have been shown to associate with CHD risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We analyzed data on 60 919 CHD cases and 80 243 controls from 29 studies for gene-smoking interactions for genetic variants at 45 loci previously reported to be associated with CHD risk. We also studied 5 loci associated with smoking behavior. Study-specific gene-smoking interaction effects were calculated and pooled using fixed-effects meta-analyses. Interaction analyses were declared to be significant at a <i>P</i> value of <1.0×10<sup>–3</sup> (Bonferroni correction for 50 tests).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We identified novel gene-smoking interaction for a variant upstream of the <i>ADAMTS7</i> gene.

Electronic Cigarettes in North America
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Designed to mimic the look and feel of tobacco cigarettes, electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) may facilitate smoking cessation. However, the efficacy and safety of e-cigarette use for this purpose remain poorly understood. Our objectives were to review the available data on the efficacy and safety of e-cigarettes for smoking cessation and to consider issues relevant to the context in which they are used, including product awareness and regulatory and ethical concerns.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We systematically searched PubMed for randomized controlled trials and uncontrolled, experimental studies involving e-cigarettes. Included studies were limited to English or French language reports. Quality assessment was performed according to the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. We identified 169 publications, of which 7 studies were included. Studies have concluded that e-cigarettes can help reduce the number of cigarettes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">smoke</span></strong>d and may be as effective for smoking cessation as the nicotine patch. Although there is a lack of data concerning the safety and efficacy of e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation therapy, available evidence showed no significant difference in adverse event rates between e-cigarettes and the nicotine patch. E-cigarettes are widely used among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">smoke</span></strong>rs attempting to quit. However, significant international variation remains in the regulatory mechanisms governing the sale and distribution of e-cigarettes. Ethical concerns surround the use of e-cigarettes among minors and their potential to undermine efforts to reduce cigarette smoking.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion—</title><p>Given the limited available evidence on the risks and benefits of e-cigarette use, large, randomized, controlled trials are urgently needed to definitively establish their potential for smoking cessation.</p></sec>

Near the phase-transition temperature (190 kelvin), the energy of the electronic mode fell to zero at nonzero momentum, indicating dynamical slowing of plasma fluctuations and crystallization of the valence electrons into an exciton <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ate.

Templated nanofiber synthesis via chemical vapor polymerization into liquid crystalline films
<p>Extrusion, electrospinning, and microdrawing are widely used to create fibrous polymer mats, but these approaches offer limited access to oriented arrays of nanometer-scale fibers with controlled size, shape, and lateral organization. We show that chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vapor</span></strong></span></strong> polymerization can be performed on surfaces coated with thin films of liquid crystals to synthesize organized assemblies of end-attached polymer nanofibers. The process uses low concentrations of radical monomers formed initially in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vapor</span></strong></span></strong> phas</span></strong>e and then diffused into the liquid-crystal template. This minimizes monomer-induced changes to the liquid-crystal phase and enables access to nanofiber arrays with complex yet precisely defined structures and compositions. The nanofiber arrays permit tailoring of a wide range of functional properties, including adhesion that depends on nanofiber chirality.</p>

Atmospheric new particle formation from sulfuric acid and amines in a Chinese megacity
<p>Atmospheric new particle formation (NPF) is an important global phenomenon that is nevertheless sensitive to ambient conditions. According to both observation and theoretical arguments, NPF usually requires a relatively high sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) concentration to promote the formation of new particles and a low preexisting aerosol loading to minimize the sink of new particles. We investigated NPF in Shanghai and were able to observe both precursor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vapor</span></strong></span></strong>s (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) and initial clusters at a molecular level in a megacity. High NPF rates were observed to coincide with several familiar markers suggestive of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>–dimethylamine (DMA)–water (H<sub>2</sub>O) nucleation, including sulfuric acid dimers and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>-DMA clusters. In a cluster kinetics simulation, the observed concentration of sulfuric acid was high enough to explain the particle growth to ~3 nanometers under the very high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ation sink, whereas the subsequent higher growth rate beyond this size is believed to result from the added contribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ing organic species. These findings will help in understanding urban NPF and its air quality and climate effects, as well as in formulating policies to mitigate secondary particle formation in China.</p>

Universal space-time scaling symmetry in the dynamics of bosons across a quantum phase transition
<p>The dynamics of many-body systems spanning <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ed matter, cosmology, and beyond are hypothesized to be universal when the systems cross continuous phase transitions. The universal dynamics are expected to satisfy a scaling symmetry of space and time with the crossing rate, inspired by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. We test this symmetry based on Bose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ates in a shaken optical lattice. Shaking the lattice drives <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ates across an effectively ferromagnetic quantum phase transition. After crossing the critical point, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ates manifest delayed growth of spin fluctuations and develop antiferromagnetic spatial correlations resulting from the sub-Poisson distribution of the spacing between topological defects. The fluctuations and correlations are invariant in scaled space-time coordinates, in support of the scaling symmetry of quantum critical dynamics.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Signal Dynamics and Interactions during Flooding Stress
<p>Flooding is detrimental for nearly all higher plants, including crops. The compound stress elicited by slow gas exchange and low light levels under water is responsible for both a carbon and an energy crisis ultimately leading to plant death. The endogenous concentrations of four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gase</span></strong>ous compounds, oxygen, carbon dioxide, ethylene, and nitric oxide, change during the submergence of plant organs in water. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gase</span></strong>s play a pivotal role in signal transduction cascades, leading to adaptive processes such as metabolic adjustments and anatomical features. Of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gase</span></strong>s, ethylene is seen as the most consistent, pervasive, and reliable signal of early flooding stress, most likely in tight interaction with the other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gase</span></strong>s. The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in plant cells during flooding and directly after subsidence, during which the plant is confronted with high light and oxygen levels, is characteristic for this abiotic stress. Low, well-controlled levels of ROS are essential for adaptive signaling pathways, in interaction with the other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gase</span></strong>ous flooding signals. On the other hand, excessive uncontrolled bursts of ROS can be highly damaging for plants. Therefore, a fine-tuned balance is important, with a major role for ROS production and scavenging. Our understanding of the temporal dynamics of the four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gase</span></strong>s and ROS is basal, whereas it is likely that they form a signature readout of prevailing flooding conditions and subsequent adaptive responses.</p>

Stoichiometry controls activity of phase-separated clusters of actin signaling proteins
<p>Biomolecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ates concentrate macromolecules into foci without a surrounding membrane. Many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ates appear to form through multivalent interactions that drive liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). LLPS increases the specific activity of actin regulatory proteins toward actin assembly by the Arp2/3 complex. We show that this increase occurs because LLPS of the Nephrin–Nck–N-WASP signaling pathway on lipid bilayers increases membrane dwell time of N-WASP and Arp2/3 complex, consequently increasing actin assembly. Dwell time varies with relative stoichiometry of the signaling proteins in the phase-separated clusters, rendering N-WASP and Arp2/3 activity stoichiometry dependent. This mechanism of controlling protein activity is enabled by the stoichiometrically undefined nature of biomolecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ates. Such regulation should be a general feature of signaling systems that assemble through multivalent interactions and drive nonequilibrium outputs.</p>

The intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of BRD4 and MED1 can form phase-separated droplets, and MED1-IDR droplets can compartmentalize and concentrate the transcription apparatus from nuclear extracts. These results support the idea that coactivators form phase-separated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ates at SEs that compartmentalize and concentrate the transcription apparatus, suggest a role for coactivator IDRs in this process, and offer insights into mechanisms involved in the control of key cell-identity genes.</p>

Above- and belowground controls on water use by trees of different wood types in an eastern US deciduous forest
<p>Stomata control tree transpiration by sensing and integrating environmental signals originating in the atmosphere and soil, and co-occurring species may differ in inherent stomatal sensitivity to these above- and belowground signals and in the types of signals to which they respond. Stomatal responsiveness to environmental signals is likely to differ across species having different types of wood (e.g., ring-porous, diffuse-porous and coniferous) because each wood type differs in the structure, size and spatial distribution of its xylem conduits as well as in the scaling of hydraulic properties with stem diameter. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of variation in soil water availability and atmospheric e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vapor</span></strong></span></strong>ative demand on stomatal regulation of transpiration in seven co-occurring temperate deciduous forest species representing three wood types. We measured whole-tree sap flux and soil and atmospheric variables in a mixed deciduous forest in central Pennsylvania over the course of a growing season characterized by severe drought and large fluctuations in atmospheric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vapor</span></strong></span></strong> pressure deficit (<i>D</i>). The relative sensitivity of sap flux to soil drying was ∼2.2–2.3 times greater in the diffuse-porous and coniferous species than in the ring-porous species. Stomata of the ring-porous oaks were only about half as responsive to increased <i>D</i> as those of trees of the other two wood types. These differences in responsiveness to changes in the below- and aboveground environment implied that regulation of leaf water potential in the ring-porous oaks was less stringent than that in the diffuse-porous angiosperms or the conifers. The results suggest that increases in the frequency or intensity of summer droughts in the study region could have multiple consequences for forest function, including altered successional time courses or climax species composition and cumulative effects on whole-tree architecture, resulting in a structural and physiological legacy that would restrict the ability of trees to respond rapidly to more favorable growth conditions.</p>

Optogenetic manipulation of stomatal kinetics improves carbon assimilation, water use, and growth
<p>Stomata serve dual and often conflicting roles, facilitating carbon dioxide influx into the plant leaf for photosynthesis and restricting water efflux via transpiration. Strategies for reducing transpiration without incurring a cost for photosynthesis must circumvent this inherent coupling of carbon dioxide and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vapor</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong> diffusion. We expressed the synthetic, light-gated K<sup>+</sup> channel BLINK1 in guard cells surrounding stomatal pores in <i>Arabidopsis</i> to enhance the solute fluxes that drive stomatal aperture. BLINK1 introduced a K<sup>+</sup> conductance and accelerated both stomatal opening under light exposure and closing after irradiation. Integrated over the growth period, BLINK1 drove a 2.2-fold increase in biomass in fluctuating light without cost in water use by the plant. Thus, we demonstrate the potential of enhancing stomatal kinetics to improve water use efficiency without penalty in carbon fixation.</p>

Wafer-scale single-crystal hexagonal boron nitride film via self-collimated grain formation
<p>Although polycrystalline hexagonal boron nitride (PC-hBN) has been realized, defects and grain boundaries still cause charge scatterings and trap sites, impeding high-performance electronics. Here, we report a method of synthesizing wafer-scale single-crystalline hBN (SC-hBN) monolayer films by chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vapor</span></strong></span></strong> deposition. The limited solubility of boron (B) and nitrogen (N) atoms in liquid gold promotes high diffusion of adatoms on the surface of liquid at high temperature to provoke the circular hBN grains. These further evolve into closely packed unimodal grains by means of self-collimation of B and N edges inherited by electrostatic interaction between grains, eventually forming an SC-hBN film on a wafer scale. This SC-hBN film also allows for the synthesis of wafer-scale graphene/hBN heterostructure and single-crystalline tungsten disulfide.</p>

Self-assembly of lattices with high structural complexity from a geometrically simple molecule
<p>Here we report an anomalous porous molecular crystal built of C–H···N-bonded double-layered roof-floor components and wall components of a segregatively interdigitated architecture. This complicated porous structure consists of only one type of fully aromatic multijoint molecule carrying three identical dipyridylphenyl wedges. Despite its high symmetry, this molecule accomplishes difficult tasks by using two of its three wedges for roof-floor formation and using its other wedge for wall formation. Although a C–H···N bond is extremely labile, the porous crystal maintains its porosity until thermal breakdown of the C–H···N bonds at 202°C occurs, affording a nonporous polymorph. Though this nonporous crystal survives even at 325°C, it can retrieve the parent porosity under acetonitrile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vapor</span></strong></span></strong>.

High thermal conductivity in cubic boron arsenide crystals
<p>The high density of heat generated in power electronics and optoelectronic devices is a critical bottleneck in their application. New materials with high thermal conductivity are needed to effectively dissipate heat and thereby enable enhanced performance of power controls, solid-state lighting, communication, and security systems. We report the experimental discovery of high thermal conductivity at room temperature in cubic boron arsenide (BAs) grown through a modified chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vapor</span></strong></span></strong> transport technique. The thermal conductivity of BAs, 1000 ± 90 watts per meter per kelvin meter-kelvin, is higher than that of silicon carbide by a factor of 3 and is surpassed only by diamond and the basal-plane value of graphite. This work shows that BAs represents a class of ultrahigh–thermal conductivity materials predicted by a recent theory, and that it may constitute a useful thermal management material for high–power density electronic devices.</p>

Phase changes in neurotransmission

Polarity compensation mechanisms on the perovskite surface KTaO<sub>3</sub>(001)

The as-cleaved surface in vacuum is frozen in place but immediately responds with an insulator-to-metal transition and possibly ferroelectric lattice distortions.

Dual-comb spectroscopy of water vapor with a free-running semiconductor disk laser

The absolute stability of the optical comb modes is characterized both for free-running operation and with simple microwave stabilization. This approach drastically reduces the complexity for dual-comb spectroscopy. Band-gap engineering to tune the center wavelength from the ultraviolet to the mid-infrared could optimize frequency combs for specific gas targets, further enabling dual-comb spectroscopy for a wider range of industrial applications.</p>

Deterministic entanglement generation from driving through quantum phase transitions
<p>Many-body entanglement is often created through the system evolution, aided by nonlinear interactions between the constituting particles.

We directly observe number squeezing of 10.7 ± 0.6 decibels and normalized collective spin length of 0.99 ± 0.01. Together, these observations allow us to infer an entanglement-enhanced phase sensitivity of ~6 decibels beyond the standard quantum limit and an entanglement breadth of ~910 atoms. Our work highlights the power of generating large-scale useful entanglement by taking advantage of the different entanglement landscapes separated by QPTs.</p>

A Simple Method for Measuring Apoplast Hydration and Collecting Apoplast Contents
<p>The plant leaf apoplast is a dynamic environment subject to a variety of both internal and external stimuli. In addition to being a conduit for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vapor</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong> and gas exchange involved in transpiration and photosynthesis, the apoplast also accumulates many nutrients transported from the soil as well as those produced through photosynthesis. The internal leaf also provides a protective environment for endophytic and pathogenic microbes alike. Given the diverse array of physiological processes occurring in the apoplast, it is expedient to develop methods to study its contents. Many established methods rely on vacuum infiltration of an apoplast wash solution followed by centrifugation. In this study, we describe a refined method optimized for maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) seedling leaves, which not only provides a simple procedure for obtaining apoplast fluid, but also allows direct calculation of apoplast hydration at the time of harvest for every sample. In addition, we describe an abbreviated method for estimating apoplast hydration if the full apoplast extraction is not necessary. Finally, we show the applicability of this optimized apoplast extraction procedure for plants infected with the maize pathogen <i>Pantoea stewartii</i> ssp <i>stewartii</i>, including the efficient isolation of bacteria previously residing in the apoplast. The approaches to establishing this method should make it generally applicable to other types of plants.</p>

Hydraulics Regulate Stomatal Responses to Changes in Leaf Water Status in the Fern <i>Athyrium filix</i>-<i>femina</i>
<p>Stomatal responses to changes in leaf water status are important for the diurnal regulation of gas exchange and the survival of plants during drought. These stomatal responses in angiosperm species are well characterized, yet in species of nonseed plants, an ongoing debate surrounds the role of metabolism, particularly the role of the hormone abscisic acid (ABA), in functionally regulating stomatal responses to changes in leaf water status. Here, we measured the stomatal response to changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vapor</span></strong></span></strong> pressure difference (VPD) in two natural forms of the fern species <i>Athyrium filix</i>-<i>femina</i>, recently suggested to have stomata that are regulated by ABA. The two forms measured had considerable differences in key hydraulic traits, including leaf hydraulic conductance and capacitance, as well as the kinetics of stomatal response to changes in VPD. In both forms, the stomatal responses to VPD could be accurately predicted by a dynamic, mechanistic model that assumes guard cell turgor changes in concert with leaf turgor in the light, and not via metabolic processes including the level of ABA. During drought, endogenous ABA did not play a role in stomatal closure, and exogenous ABA applied to live, intact leaves did not induce stomatal closure. Our results indicate that functional stomatal responses to changes in leaf water status in ferns are regulated by leaf hydraulics and not metabolism. With ferns being sister to seed plants, this result has implications for the evolutionary reconstruction of functional stomatal responses across vascular land plant lineages.</p>

Jasmonate Negatively Regulates Stomatal Development in Arabidopsis Cotyledons
<p>Stomata are ports that facilitate gas and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vapor</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong> exchange between plants and their environment. Stomatal development is strictly regulated by endogenous signals and environmental cues. Jasmonate is an important signal that modulates multiple physiological processes in plants, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying its interactions with other developmental signaling pathways remain poorly understood. Here, we show that jasmonate negatively regulates stomatal development in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) cotyledons. Cotyledons of the wild type and stomata-overproliferating mutants (such as <i>too many mouths-1</i> and <i>stomatal density and distribution1-1</i>) treated with methyl jasmonate exhibit a clear reduction in stomata number. By contrast, blocking endogenous jasmonate biosynthesis or perception enhanced stomatal development. Moreover, three MYC transcription factors involved in jasmonate signaling, MYC2, MYC3, and MYC4, were found to redundantly modulate jasmonate-inhibited stomatal development. A genetic analysis showed that these MYC proteins act upstream of the SPEECHLESS and FAMA transcription factors to mediate stomatal development. Furthermore, jasmonate repression of stomatal development is dependent on these three MYC transcription factors, as stomatal development of the <i>myc2 myc3 myc4</i> triple mutant was insensitive to methyl jasmonate treatment. Collectively, our study demonstrates that jasmonate and MYC transcription factors negatively regulate stomatal development in Arabidopsis cotyledons.</p>

Acclimation to Fluctuating Light Impacts the Rapidity of Response and Diurnal Rhythm of Stomatal Conductance<sup><xref>1</xref></sup>
<p>Plant acclimation to growth light environment has been studied extensively; however, the majority of these studies have focused on light intensity and photo-acclimation, with few studies exploring the impact of dynamic growth light on stomatal acclimation and behavior. To assess the impact of growth light regime on stomatal acclimation, we grew Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants in three different lighting regimes (with the same average daily intensity), fluctuating with a fixed pattern of light, fluctuating with a randomized pattern of light (sinusoidal), and nonfluctuating (square wave), to assess the effect of light regime dynamics on gas exchange. We demonstrated that <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> (stomatal conductance to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vapor</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>) acclimation is influenced by both intensity and light pattern, modifying the stomatal kinetics at different times of the day and resulting in differences in the rapidity and magnitude of the <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> response. We also describe and quantify the response to an internal signal that uncouples variation in <i>A</i> and <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> over the majority of the diurnal period and represents 25% of the total diurnal <i>g<sub>s</sub></i>. This <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> response can be characterized by a Gaussian element and when incorporated into the widely used Ball-Berry model greatly improved the prediction of <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> in a dynamic environment. From these findings, we conclude that acclimation of <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> to growth light could be an important strategy for maintaining carbon fixation and overall plant water status and should be considered when inferring responses in the field from laboratory-based experiments.</p>

Stomatal VPD Response: There Is More to the Story Than ABA
<p>Guard cells shrink and close stomatal pores when air humidity decreases (i.e. when the difference between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vapor</span></strong></span></strong> pressures of leaf and atmosphere [VPD] increases). The role of abscisic acid (ABA) in VPD-induced stomatal closure has been studied using ABA-related mutants that respond to VPD in some studies and not in others. The importance of ABA biosynthesis in guard cells versus vasculature for whole-plant stomatal regulation is unclear as well. Here, we show that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) lines carrying mutations in different steps of ABA biosynthesis as well as pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) <i>wilty</i> and tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) <i>flacca</i> ABA-deficient mutants had higher stomatal conductance compared with wild-type plants. To characterize the role of ABA production in different cells, we generated transgenic plants where ABA biosynthesis was rescued in guard cells or phloem companion cells of an ABA-deficient mutant. In both cases, the whole-plant stomatal conductance, stunted growth phenotype, and leaf ABA level were restored to wild-type values, pointing to the redundancy of ABA sources and to the effectiveness of leaf ABA transport. All ABA-deficient lines closed their stomata rapidly and extensively in response to high VPD, whereas plants with mutated protein kinase OST1 showed stunted VPD-induced responses. Another strongly ABA-insensitive mutant, defective in the six ABA PYR/RCAR receptors, responded to changes in VPD in both directions strongly and symmetrically, indicating that its VPD-induced closure could be passive hydraulic. We discuss that both the VPD-induced passive hydraulic stomatal closure and the stomatal VPD regulation of ABA-deficient mutants may be conditional on the initial pretreatment stomatal conductance.</p>

Field experiments during late winter on <i>Picea abies</i> growing at the alpine timberline revealed three distinct freezing patterns: (1) from the top of the tree toward the base, (2) from thin branches toward the main stem’s top and base, and (3) from the base toward the top. Infrared imaging showed freezing within branches from their base toward distal parts. Such complex freezing causes dynamic and heterogenous patterns in water potential and probably in cavitation. This study highlights the interaction between environmental conditions upon freezing and thawing and demonstrates the enormous complexity of freezing processes in trees. Diameter shrinkage, which indicated water fluxes within the stem, and acoustic emission analysis, which indicated cavitation events near the ice front upon freezing, were both related to minimum temperature and, upon thawing, related to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vapor</span></strong></span></strong> pressure deficit and soil temperature. These complex patterns, emphasizing the common mechanisms between frost and drought stress, shed new light on winter tree physiology.</p>

Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound does not influence bone healing by distraction osteogenesis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this double-blind prospective randomised controlled   trial was to assess whether low intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS)   accelerated or enhanced the rate of bone healing in adult patients   undergoing distraction osteogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 62 adult patients undergoing limb lengthening or bone   transport by distraction osteogenesis were randomised to treatment   with either an active (n = 32) or a placebo (n = 30) ultrasound   device. A standardised corticotomy was performed in the proximal   tibial metaphysis and a circular Ilizarov frame was used in all   patients. The rate of distraction was also standardised. The primary   outcome measure was the time to removal of the frame after adjusting   for the length of distraction in days/cm for both the per protocol   (PP) and the intention-to-treat (ITT) groups. The assessor was blinded   to the form of treatment. A secondary outcome was to identify covariates affecting   the time to removal of the frame.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was no difference in the time to removal of the frame between   the PP (difference in favour of the control group was 10.1 days/cm,   95% confidence interval (CI) -3.2 to 23.4, p = 0.054) or ITT (difference   5.0 days/cm, 95% CI -8.2 to 18.21, p = 0.226) groups. The smoking   status was the only covariate which increased the time to removal   of the frame (hazard ratio 0.47, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.97, p = 0.042).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>LIPUS does not influence the rate of bone healing in patients   who undergo distraction osteogenesis.

The impact of lifestyle risk factors on the rate of infection after surgery for a fracture of the ankle
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Lifestyle risk factors are thought to increase the risk of infection   after acute orthopaedic surgery but the evidence is scarce. We aimed   to investigate whether smoking, obesity and alcohol overuse are   risk factors for the development of infections after surgery for   a fracture of the ankle.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We retrospectively reviewed all patients who underwent internal   fixation of a fracture of the ankle between 2008 and 2013. The primary   outcome was the rate of deep infection and the secondary outcome   was any surgical site infection (SSI). Associations with the risk   factors and possible confounding variables were analysed univariably   and multivariably with backwards elimination.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 1043 patients were included; 64 (6.1%) had a deep   infection and 146 (14.0%) had SSI. Obesity was strongly associated   with both outcomes (odds ratio (OR) 2.21, p = 0.017 and OR 1.68,   p = 0.032) in all analyses. Alcohol overuse was similarly associated,   though significant only in unadjusted analyses. Surprisingly, smoking   did not yield statistically significant associations with infections.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These findings suggest that obesity and possibly alcohol overuse   are independent risk factors for the development of infection following   surgery for a fracture of the ankle.

The outcome and complications of vascularised fibular grafts
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Free vascularised fibular grafting has been used for the treatment   of large bony defects for more than 40 years. However, there is   little information about the risk factors for failure and whether   newer locking techniques of fixation improve the rates of union.   The purpose of this study was to compare the rates of union of free   fibular grafts fixed with locking and traditional techniques, and   to quantify the risk factors for nonunion and failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A retrospective review involved 134 consecutive procedures over   a period of 20 years. Of these, 25 were excluded leaving 109 patients   in the study. There were 66 men and 43 women, with a mean age of   33 years (5 to 78). Most (62) were performed for oncological indications,   and the most common site (52) was the lower limb. Rate of union   was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and risk factors for   nonunion were assessed using Cox regression. All patients were followed   up for at least one year.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The rate of union was 82% at two years and 97% at five years.   Union was achieved after the initial procedure in 76 patients (70%)   at a mean of ten months (3 to 19), and overall union was achieved   in 99 patients (91%)<bold>. </bold>No surgical factor, including   the use of locked fixation or supplementary corticocancellous bone   grafts increased the rate of union. A history of smoking was significantly   associated with a risk of nonunion.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Free vascularised fibular grafting is a successful form of treatment   for large bony defects. These results suggest that the use of modern   techniques of fixation does not affect the risk of nonunion when   compared with traditional forms of fixation, and smoking increases   the risk of nonunion following this procedure.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:134–8.</p></sec>

Recyclable, Strong Thermosets and Organogels via Paraformaldehyde Condensation with Diamines
<sec><title>Recyclable Thermoset Polymers</title><p>The high mechanical strength and durability of thermoset polymers are exploited in applications such as composite materials, where they form the matrix surrounding carbon fibers.

Transverse Demagnetization Dynamics of a Unitary Fermi Gas
<sec><title>Untwisting the Spin Spiral</title><p>Ultracold Fermi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gase</span></strong>s in the so-called unitary regime—where the diverging interactions between atoms make their thermodynamics universal—are an excellent test bed for an array of strongly interacting matter systems. The transport characteristics in this regime are particularly intriguing, and a discrepancy between two- and three-dimensional transport coefficients has been observed. <bold>Bardon <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 722) studied the demagnetization dynamics of a three-dimensional Fermi gas. The gas was initially polarized along a single direction and was noninteracting. An applied magnetic field gradient then caused a spin spiral to form; as the gas relaxed from this state, the authors extracted the diffusion coefficient and observed the buildup of interactions between the atoms.</p></sec>

A New Wrap for Neuronal Activity?
<p>As we learn and experience the world around us, our brains are remodeling neuronal pathways. Is this remodeling only a property of neurons, or are other brain cell types also adapting and contributing to learning? A substantial proportion of cells in the mammalian brain are oligodendrocytes and their precursors (collectively called oligodendroglia). Oligodendrocytes generate multiple myelin sheaths, lipid-rich extensions of specialized plasma membrane that spirally coat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ed layers around neurons. This insulation facilitates rapid nerve conduction, increasing velocities of neuron signals 10-fold (<i>1</i>) by restricting current flow to the small gaps between sheaths—the nodes of Ranvier. More than half of the human brain is composed of myelinated nerves (“white matter”). With such extensive myelinated neural networks, it raises the questions: Do the myelin-producing oligodendrocytes in the brain also adapt as neural circuits are modified in response to activity, and does adaptation of oligodendrocytes then affect the underlying neural circuits? On page 487 of this issue, Gibson <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) provide new evidence to address how neuron activity may promote oligodendroglia changes.</p>

Physio-Genetic Dissection of Dark-Induced Leaf Senescence and Timing Its Reversal in Barley
<p>Barley crop model was analyzed for early and late events during the dark-induced leaf senescence (DILS) as well as for deciphering critical time limit for reversal of the senescence process. Chlorophyll fluorescence vitality index Rfd was determined as the earliest parameter that correlated well with the cessation of photosynthesis prior to microautophagy symptoms, initiation of DNA degradation, and severalfold increase in the endonuclease <i>BNUC1.</i> DILS was found characterized by up-regulation of processes that enable recycling of degraded macromolecules and metabolites, including increased NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> remobilization, gluconeogenesis, glycolysis, and partial up-regulation of glyoxylate and tricarboxylate acid cycles. The most evident differences in gene medleys between DILS and developmental senescence included hormone-activated signaling pathways, lipid catabolic processes, carbohydrate metabolic processes, low-affinity ammonia remobilization, and RNA methylation. The mega-autophagy symptoms were apparent much later, specifically on day 10 of DILS, when disruption of organelles—nucleus and mitochondria —became evident. Also, during this latter-stage programmed cell death processes, namely, shrinking of the protoplast, tonoplast interruption, and vacuole breakdown, chromatin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ation, more DNA fragmentation, and disintegration of the cell membrane were prominent. Reversal of DILS by re-exposure of the plants from dark to light was possible until but not later than day 7 of dark exposure and was accompanied by regained photosynthesis, increase in chlorophyll, and reversal of Rfd, despite activation of macro-autophagy-related genes.</p>

SDG2-Mediated H3K4me3 Is Crucial for Chromatin Condensation and Mitotic Division during Male Gametogenesis in Arabidopsis
<p>Epigenetic reprogramming occurring during reproduction is crucial for both animal and plant development. Histone H3 Lys 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) is an evolutionarily conserved epigenetic mark of transcriptional active euchromatin. While much has been learned in somatic cells, H3K4me3 deposition and function in gametophyte is poorly studied. Here, we demonstrate that SET DOMAIN GROUP2 (SDG2)-mediated H3K4me3 deposition participates in epigenetic reprogramming during Arabidopsis male gametogenesis. We show that loss of SDG2 barely affects meiosis and cell fate establishment of haploid cells. However, we found that SDG2 is critical for postmeiotic microspore development. Mitotic cell division progression is partly impaired in the loss-of-function <i>sdg2-1</i> mutant, particularly at the second mitosis setting up the two sperm cells. We demonstrate that SDG2 is involved in promoting chromatin de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ation in the pollen vegetative nucleus, likely through its role in H3K4me3 deposition, which prevents ectopic heterochromatic H3K9me2 speckle formation. Moreover, we found that derepression of the LTR retrotransposon <i>ATLANTYS1</i> is compromised in the vegetative cell of the <i>sdg2-1</i> mutant pollen. Consistent with chromatin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ation and compromised transcription activity, pollen germination and pollen tube elongation, representing the key function of the vegetative cell in transporting sperm cells during fertilization, are inhibited in the <i>sdg2-1</i> mutant. Taken together, we conclude that SDG2-mediated H3K4me3 is an essential epigenetic mark of the gametophyte chromatin landscape, playing critical roles in gamete mitotic cell cycle progression and pollen vegetative cell function during male gametogenesis and beyond.</p>

The Sites of Evaporation within Leaves
<p>The sites of e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vapor</span></strong></span></strong>ation within leaves are unknown, but they have drawn attention for decades due to their perceived implications for many factors, including patterns of leaf isotopic enrichment, the maintenance of mesophyll water status, stomatal regulation, and the interpretation of measured stomatal and leaf hydraulic conductances. We used a spatially explicit model of coupled water and heat transport outside the xylem, MOFLO 2.0, to map the distribution of net e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vapor</span></strong></span></strong>ation across leaf tissues in relation to anatomy and environmental parameters. Our results corroborate earlier predictions that most e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vapor</span></strong></span></strong>ation occurs from the epidermis at low light and moderate humidity but that the mesophyll contributes substantially when the leaf center is warmed by light absorption, and more so under high humidity. We also found that the bundle sheath provides a significant minority of e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vapor</span></strong></span></strong>ation (15% in darkness and 18% in high light), that the vertical center of amphistomatous leaves supports net <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ation, and that vertical temperature gradients caused by light absorption vary over 10-fold across species, reaching 0.3°C. We show that several hypotheses that depend on the e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vapor</span></strong></span></strong>ating sites require revision in light of our findings, including that experimental measurements of stomatal and hydraulic conductances should be affected directly by changes in the location of the e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vapor</span></strong></span></strong>ating sites. We propose a new conceptual model that accounts for mixed-phase water transport outside the xylem. These conclusions have far-reaching implications for inferences in leaf hydraulics, gas exchange, water use, and isotope physiology.</p>

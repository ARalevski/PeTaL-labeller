<i>CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1</i> (<i>CCA1</i>) and the Circadian Control of Stomatal Aperture
<p>The endogenous circadian (∼24 h) system allows plants to anticipate and adapt to daily environmental changes. Stomatal aperture is one of the many processes under circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>; stomatal opening and closing occurs under constant conditions, even in the absence of environmental cues. To understand the significance of circadian-mediated anticipation in stomatal opening, we have generated <i>SGC</i> (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ically guard cell) Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants in which the oscillator gene <i>CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1</i> (<i>CCA1</i>) was overexpressed under the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of the guard-cell-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic promoter, <i>GC1.</i> The <i>SGC</i> plants showed a loss of ability to open stomata in anticipation of daily dark-to-light changes and of circadian-mediated stomatal opening in constant light. We observed that under fully watered and mild drought conditions, <i>SGC</i> plants outperform wild type with larger leaf area and biomass. To investigate the molecular basis for circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of guard cell aperture, we used large-scale qRT-PCR to compare circadian oscillator gene expression in guard cells compared with the “average” whole-leaf oscillator and examined gene expression and stomatal aperture in several lines of plants with misexpressed <i>CCA1</i>. Our results show that the guard cell oscillator is different from the average plant oscillator. Moreover, the differences in guard cell oscillator function may be important for the correct regulation of photoperiod pathway genes that have previously been reported to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> stomatal aperture. We conclude by showing that CONSTANS and FLOWERING LOCUS T, components of the photoperiod pathway that regulate flowering time, also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> stomatal aperture in a daylength-dependent manner.</p>

Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Frequencies of Known Haplotypes from Pooled Sequence Data
<p>DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es are often pooled, either by experimental design or because the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e itself is a mixture. For example, when population allele frequencies are of primary interest, individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es may be pooled together to lower the cost of sequencing. Alternatively, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e itself may be a mixture of multiple species or strains (e.g., bacterial species comprising a microbiome or pathogen strains in a blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e). We present an expectation–maximization algorithm for estimating haplotype frequencies in a pooled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e directly from mapped sequence reads, in the case where the possible haplotypes are known. This method is relevant to the analysis of pooled sequencing data from selection experiments, as well as the calculation of proportions of different species within a metagenomics <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e. Our method outperforms existing methods based on single-site allele frequencies, as well as simple approaches using sequence read data. We have implemented the method in a freely available open-source software tool.</p>

Opposing Actions of Fibroblast and Cardiomyocyte Smad3 Signaling in the Infarcted Myocardium
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Transforming growth factor–βs regulate a wide range of cellular responses by activating Smad-dependent and Smad-independent cascades.

We hypothesized that cell-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic actions of Smad3 regulate repair and remodeling in the infarcted myocardium.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To dissect cell-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic Smad3 actions in myocardial infarction, we generated mice with Smad3 loss in activated fibroblasts or cardiomyocytes. Cardiac function was assessed after reperfused or nonreperfused infarction using echocardiography. The effects of cell-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic Smad3 loss on the infarcted heart were studied using histological studies, assessment of protein, and gene expression levels. In vitro, we studied Smad-dependent and Smad-independent actions in isolated cardiac fibroblasts.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Mice with fibroblast-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic Smad3 loss had accentuated adverse remodeling after reperfused infarction and exhibited an increased incidence of late rupture after nonreperfused infarction. The consequences of fibroblast-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic Smad3 loss were not a result of effects on acute infarct size but were associated with unrestrained fibroblast proliferation, impaired scar remodeling, reduced fibroblast-derived collagen synthesis, and perturbed alignment of myofibroblast arrays in the infarct. Polarized light microscopy in Sirius red–stained sections demonstrated that the changes in fibroblast morphology were associated with perturbed organization of the collagenous matrix in the infarcted area. In contrast, α-smooth muscle actin expression by infarct myofibroblasts was not affected by Smad3 loss. Smad3 critically regulated fibroblast function, activating integrin-mediated nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase–2 (NOX-2) expression. Smad3 loss in cardiomyocytes attenuated remodeling and dysfunction after infarction. Cardiomyocyte-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic Smad3 loss did not affect acute infarct size but was associated with attenuated cardiomyocyte apoptosis in the remodeling myocardium, accompanied by decreased myocardial NOX-2 levels, reduced nitrosative stress, and lower matrix metalloproteinase–2 expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In healing myocardial infarction, myofibroblast- and cardiomyocyte-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic activation of Smad3 has contrasting functional outcomes that may involve activation of an integrin/reactive oxygen axis.</p></sec>

Global Pulmonary Vascular Remodeling in Pulmonary Hypertension Associated With Heart Failure and Preserved or Reduced Ejection Fraction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>We hypothesized that pulmonary venous hypertension in heart failure (HF) leads to predominate remodeling of pulmonary veins and that the severity of venous remodeling is associated with the severity of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in HF.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients with HF (n=108; 53 preserved and 55 reduced ejection fraction) with PH (HF-PH; pulmonary artery systolic pressure [PASP] ≥40 mm Hg) were compared to normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>s (n=12) and patients with primary pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD; n=17). In lung specimens from autopsy (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>, HF-PH, and 7 PVOD) or surgery (10 PVOD), quantitative histomorphometry was performed in all analyzable arteries (n=4949), veins (n=7630), and small indeterminate vessels (IV; n=2168) to define percent medial thickness (arteries) and percent intimal thickness (%IT) (arteries, veins, and IV) relative to external diameter.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The average arterial percent medial thickness (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>, 6.9; HF-PH, 11.0; PVOD, 15.0), arterial %IT (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>, 4.9; HF-PH, 14.9; PVOD, 31.1), venous %IT (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>, 14.0; HF-PH, 24.9; PVOD, 43.9), and IV %IT (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>, 10.6; HF-PH, 25.8; PVOD, 50.0) in HF-PH were higher than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>s (<i>P</i><0.0001 for all) but lower than PVOD (<i>P</i>≤0.005 for all). PASP (mm Hg) was lower in HF-PH (median, 59 [interquartile range, 50–70]) than in PVOD (median, 91 [interquartile range, 82–103]). PASP correlated with arterial percent medial thickness (<i>r</i>=0.41) and arterial %IT (<i>r</i>=0.35) but more strongly with venous %IT (<i>r</i>=0.49) and IV %IT (<i>r</i>=0.55) (<i>P</i><0.0001 for all). Associations between PASP and venous or IV %IT remained significant after adjusting for arterial percent medial thickness and %IT and did not vary by HF type. In patients with right heart catheterization (30 HF-PH, 14 PVOD), similar associations between the transpulmonary gradient and pulmonary vascular remodeling existed, with numerically stronger associations for venous and IV %IT. Although the PASP was slightly higher in patients with HF-PH with right ventricular dysfunction, pulmonary vascular remodeling was not more severe. Pulmonary vascular remodeling severity was associated with reductions in the diffusing capacity of the lungs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In HF, PH is associated with global pulmonary vascular remodeling, but the severity of PH correlates most strongly with venous and small IV intimal thickening, similar to the pattern observed in PVOD.

Disturbed Placental Imprinting in Preeclampsia Leads to Altered Expression of DLX5, a Human-Specific Early Trophoblast Marker
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Preeclampsia is a complex and common human-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic pregnancy syndrome associated with placental pathology. The human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity provides both intellectual and methodological challenges, lacking a robust model system. Given the role of imprinted genes in human placentation and the vulnerability of imprinted genes to loss of imprinting changes, there has been extensive speculation, but no robust evidence, that imprinted genes are involved in preeclampsia. Our study aims to investigate whether disturbed imprinting contributes to preeclampsia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We first aimed to confirm that preeclampsia is a disease of the placenta by generating and analyzing genome-wide molecular data on well-characterized patient material. We performed high-throughput transcriptome analyses of multiple placenta <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es from healthy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>s and patients with preeclampsia. Next, we identified differentially expressed genes in preeclamptic placentas and intersected them with the list of human imprinted genes. We used bioinformatics/statistical analyses to confirm association between imprinting and preeclampsia and to predict biological processes affected in preeclampsia. Validation included epigenetic and cellular assays. In terms of human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity, we established an in vitro invasion-differentiation trophoblast model. Our comparative phylogenetic analysis involved single-cell transcriptome data of human, macaque, and mouse preimplantation embryogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We found disturbed placental imprinting in preeclampsia and revealed potential candidates, including <i>GATA3</i> and <i>DLX5</i>, with poorly explored imprinted status and no prior association with preeclampsia. As a result of loss of imprinting, <i>DLX5</i> was upregulated in 69% of preeclamptic placentas. Levels of <i>DLX5</i> correlated with classic preeclampsia markers. DLX5 is expressed in human but not in murine trophoblast. The DLX5<sup>high</sup> phenotype resulted in reduced proliferation, increased metabolism, and endoplasmic reticulum stress-response activation in trophoblasts in vitro. The transcriptional profile of such cells mimics the transcriptome of preeclamptic placentas. Pan-mammalian comparative analysis identified <i>DLX5</i> as part of the human-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic regulatory network of trophoblast differentiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our analysis provides evidence of a true association among disturbed imprinting, gene expression, and preeclampsia. As a result of disturbed imprinting, the upregulated <i>DLX5</i> affects trophoblast proliferation. Our in vitro model might fill a vital niche in preeclampsia research. Human-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic regulatory circuitry of <i>DLX5</i> might help explain certain aspects of preeclampsia.</p></sec>

MAP KINASE PHOSPHATASE1 Controls Cell Fate Transition during Stomatal Development
<p>Stomata on the plant epidermis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> gas and water exchange and are formed by MAPK-dependent processes. Although the contribution of MAP KINASE3 (MPK3) and MPK6 (MPK3/MPK6) to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of stomatal patterning and differentiation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) has been examined extensively, how they are inactivated and regulate distinct stages of stomatal development is unknown. Here, we identify a dual-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity phosphatase, MAP KINASE PHOSPHATASE1 (MKP1), which promotes stomatal cell fate transition by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>ling MAPK activation at the early stage of stomatal development. Loss of function of <i>MKP1</i> creates clusters of small cells that fail to differentiate into stomata, resulting in the formation of patches of pavement cells. We show that MKP1 acts downstream of YODA (a MAPK kinase kinase) but upstream of MPK3/MPK6 in the stomatal signaling pathway and that MKP1 deficiency causes stomatal signal-induced MAPK hyperactivation in vivo. By expressing MKP1 in the three discrete cell types of stomatal lineage, we further identified that MKP1-mediated deactivation of MAPKs in early stomatal precursor cells directs cell fate transition leading to stomatal differentiation. Together, our data reveal the important role of MKP1 in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>ling MAPK signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity and cell fate decision during stomatal development.</p>

Fatty acid transport was studied in cultured endothelial cells and transgenic mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Treatment of wild-type mice with Delta-like 4 neutralizing antibodies for 8 weeks impaired fractional shortening and ejection fraction in the majority of mice. Inhibition of Notch signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ically in the endothelium of adult mice by genetic ablation of Rbp-jκ caused heart hypertrophy and failure. Impaired heart function was preceded by alterations in fatty acid metabolism and an increase in cardiac blood vessel density.

Design and evaluation of engineered protein biosensors for live-cell imaging of EGFR phosphorylation
<p>Live-cell fluorescence microscopy is broadly applied to study the dynamics of receptor-mediated cell signaling, but the availability of intracellular biosensors is limited. A biosensor based on the tandem SH2 domains from phospholipase C–γ1 (PLCγ1), tSH2-WT, has been used to measure phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Here, we found that tSH2-WT lacked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity for phosphorylated EGFR, consistent with the known promiscuity of SH2 domains. Further, EGF-stimulated membrane recruitment of tSH2-WT differed qualitatively from the expected kinetics of EGFR phosphorylation. Analysis of a mathematical model suggested, and experiments confirmed, that the high avidity of tSH2-WT resulted in saturation of its target and interference with EGFR endocytosis. To overcome the apparent target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity and saturation issues, we implemented two protein engineering strategies. In the first approach, we screened a combinatorial library generated by random mutagenesis of the C-terminal SH2 domain (cSH2) of PLCγ1 and isolated a mutant form (mSH2) with enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity for phosphorylated Tyr<sup>992</sup> (pTyr<sup>992</sup>) of EGFR. A biosensor based on mSH2 closely reported the kinetics of EGFR phosphorylation but retained cross-reactivity similar to tSH2-WT. In the second approach, we isolated a pTyr<sup>992</sup>-binding protein (SPY992) from a combinatorial library generated by mutagenesis of the Sso7d protein scaffold. Compared to tSH2-WT and mSH2, SPY992 exhibited superior performance as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic, moderate-affinity biosensor.

Transcriptional repressor REST drives lineage stage–specific chromatin compaction at <i>Ptch1</i> and increases AKT activation in a mouse model of medulloblastoma
<p>In medulloblastomas (MBs), the expression and activity of RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST) is increased in tumors driven by the sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ically the SHH-α (children 3 to 16 years) and SHH-β (infants) subgroups. Neuronal maturation is greater in SHH-β than SHH-α tumors, but both correlate with poor overall patient survival.

This model revealed a neuronal maturation context–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic antagonistic interplay between the transcriptional repressor REST and the activator GLI1 at <i>Ptch1</i>. Expression of <i>Arrb1</i>, which encodes β-arrestin1 (a GLI1 inhibitor), was substantially reduced in proliferating and, to a lesser extent, lineage-committed <i>RESTTG</i><sup></sup> cells compared with wild-type proliferating CGNPs. Lineage-committed <i>REST<sup>TG</sup></i> cells also had decreased GLI1 activity and increased histone H3K9 methylation at the <i>Ptch1</i> locus, which correlated with premature silencing of <i>Ptch1</i>.

Expression of <i>PTCH1</i> and <i>GLI1</i> were less, and <i>ARRB1</i> was somewhat greater, in patient SHH-β than SHH-α MBs, whereas that of <i>PTEN</i> was similarly lower in both subtypes than in others.

The Role of Gβ Protein in Controlling Cell Expansion via Potential Interaction with Lipid Metabolic Pathways
<p>Heterotrimeric G-proteins influence almost all aspects of plant growth, development, and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses in plants, likely via their interaction with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic effectors. However, the identity of such effectors and their mechanism of action are mostly unknown. While investigating the roles of different G-protein subunits in modulating the oil content in Camelina (<i>Camelina sativa</i>), an oil seed crop, we uncovered a role of Gβ proteins in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>ling anisotropic cell expansion. Knockdown of <i>Gβ</i> genes causes reduced longitudinal and enhanced transverse expansion, resulting in altered cell, tissue, and organ shapes in transgenic plants during vegetative and reproductive development. These plants also exhibited substantial changes in their fatty acid and phospholipid profiles, which possibly leads to the increased oil content of the transgenic seeds. This increase is potentially caused by the direct interaction of Gβ proteins with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic patatin-like phospholipase, pPLAIIIδ. Camelina plants with suppressed <i>Gβ</i> expression exhibit higher lipase activity, and show phenotypes similar to plants overexpressing <i>pPLAIIIδ</i>, suggesting that the Gβ proteins are negative regulators of pPLAIIIδ. These results reveal interactions between the G-protein–mediated and lipid signaling/metabolic pathways, where <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic phospholipases may act as effectors that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> key developmental and environmental responses of plants.</p>

A Comprehensive Toolkit for Inducible, Cell Type-Specific Gene Expression in Arabidopsis
<p>Understanding the context-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic role of gene function is a key objective of modern biology. To this end, we generated a resource for inducible cell type-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic transactivation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) based on the well-established combination of the chimeric GR-LhG4 transcription factor and the synthetic <i>pOp</i> promoter. Harnessing the flexibility of the GreenGate cloning system, we produced a comprehensive set of transgenic lines termed GR-LhG4 driver lines targeting most tissues in the Arabidopsis shoot and root with a strong focus on the indeterminate meristems. When we combined these transgenic lines with effectors under the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of the <i>pOp</i> promoter, we observed tight temporal and spatial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of gene expression. In particular, inducible expression in F1 plants obtained from crosses of driver and effector lines allows for rapid assessment of the cell type-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic impact of an effector with high temporal resolution. Thus, our comprehensive and flexible method is suitable for overcoming the limitations of ubiquitous genetic approaches, the outputs of which often are difficult to interpret due to the widespread existence of compensatory mechanisms and the integration of diverging effects in different cell types.</p>

Overexpression of RING Domain E3 Ligase ZmXerico1 Confers Drought Tolerance through Regulation of ABA Homeostasis
<p>Drought stress is one of the main environmental problems encountered by crop growers. Reduction in arable land area and reduced water availability make it paramount to identify and develop strategies to allow crops to be more resilient in water-limiting environments. The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays an important role in the plants’ response to drought stress through its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of stomatal aperture and water transpiration, and transgenic modulation of ABA levels therefore represents an attractive avenue to improve the drought tolerance of crops. Several steps in the ABA-signaling pathway are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led by ubiquitination involving really interesting new genes (RING) domain-containing proteins. We characterized the maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) RING protein family and identified two novel RING-H2 genes called <i>ZmXerico1</i> and <i>ZmXerico2</i>. Expression of <i>ZmXerico</i> genes is induced by drought stress, and we show that overexpression of <i>ZmXerico1</i> and <i>ZmXerico2</i> in Arabidopsis and maize confers ABA hypersensitivity and improved water use efficiency, which can lead to enhanced maize yield performance in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led drought-stress environment. Overexpression of <i>ZmXerico1</i> and <i>ZmXerico2</i> in maize results in increased ABA levels and decreased levels of ABA degradation products diphaseic acid and phaseic acid. We show that ZmXerico1 is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, where ABA 8′-hydroxylases have been shown to be localized, and that it functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. We demonstrate that ZmXerico1 plays a role in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of ABA homeostasis through regulation of ABA 8′-hydroxylase protein stability, representing a novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> point in the regulation of the ABA pathway.</p>

Tissue-Specific Control of the Endocycle by the Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome Inhibitors UVI4 and DEL1<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The endocycle represents a modified mitotic cell cycle that in plants is often coupled to cell enlargement and differentiation. Endocycle onset is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led by activity of the Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C), a multisubunit E3 ubiquitin ligase targeting cell-cycle factors for destruction. CELL CYCLE SWITCH52 (CCS52) proteins represent rate-limiting activator subunits of the APC/C. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), mutations in either <i>CCS52A1</i> or <i>CCS52A2</i> activators result in a delayed endocycle onset, whereas their overexpression triggers increased DNA ploidy levels. Here, the relative contribution of the APC/C<sup>CCS52A1</sup> and APC/C<sup>CCS52A2</sup> complexes to different developmental processes was studied through analysis of their negative regulators, being the ULTRAVIOLET-B-INSENSITIVE4 protein and the DP-E2F-Like1 transcriptional repressor, respectively. Our data illustrate cooperative activity of the APC/C<sup>CCS52A1</sup> and APC/C<sup>CCS52A2</sup> complexes during root and trichome development, but functional interdependency during leaf development.

Gene Regulatory Networks for the Haploid-to-Diploid Transition of <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>
<p>The sexual cycle of the unicellular <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> culminates in the formation of diploid zygotes that differentiate into dormant spores that eventually undergo meiosis. Mating between gametes induces rapid cell wall shedding via the enzyme g-lysin; cell fusion is followed by heterodimerization of sex-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic homeobox transcription factors, GSM1 and GSP1, and initiation of zygote-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic gene expression. To investigate the genetic underpinnings of the zygote developmental pathway, we performed comparative transcriptome analysis of both pre- and post-fertilization <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es. We identified 253 transcripts <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ically enriched in early zygotes, 82% of which were not up-regulated in <i>gsp1</i> null zygotes. We also found that the GSM1/GSP1 heterodimer negatively regulates the vegetative wall program at the posttranscriptional level, enabling prompt transition from vegetative wall to zygotic wall assembly. Annotation of the g-lysin-induced and early zygote genes reveals distinct vegetative and zygotic wall programs, supported by concerted up-regulation of genes encoding cell wall-modifying enzymes and proteins involved in nucleotide-sugar metabolism. The haploid-to-diploid transition in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> is masterfully <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led by the GSM1/GSP1 heterodimer, translating fertilization and gamete coalescence into a bona fide differentiation program. The fertilization-triggered integration of genes required to make related, but structurally and functionally distinct organelles—the vegetative versus zygote cell wall—presents a likely scenario for the evolution of complex developmental gene regulatory networks.</p>

Genetic Control of Plasticity in Root Morphology and Anatomy of Rice in Response to Water Deficit
<p>Elucidating the genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of rooting behavior under water-deficit stress is essential to breed climate-robust rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) cultivars. Using a diverse panel of 274 <i>indica</i> genotypes grown under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> and water-deficit conditions during vegetative growth, we phenotyped 35 traits, mostly related to root morphology and anatomy, involving 45,000 root-scanning images and nearly 25,000 cross sections from the root-shoot junction. The phenotypic plasticity of these traits was quantified as the relative change in trait value under water-deficit compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> conditions. We then carried out a genome-wide association analysis on these traits and their plasticity, using 45,608 high-quality single-nucleotide polymorphisms. One hundred four significant loci were detected for these traits under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> conditions, 106 were detected under water-deficit stress, and 76 were detected for trait plasticity. We predicted 296 (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>), 284 (water-deficit stress), and 233 (plasticity) a priori candidate genes within linkage disequilibrium blocks for these loci. We identified key a priori candidate genes regulating root growth and development and relevant alleles that, upon validation, can help improve rice adaptation to water-deficit stress.</p>

5′ to 3′ mRNA Decay Contributes to the Regulation of Arabidopsis Seed Germination by Dormancy
<p>The regulation of plant gene expression, necessary for development and adaptive responses, relies not only on RNA transcription but also on messenger RNA (mRNA) fate. To understand whether seed germination relies on the degradation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic subsets of mRNA, we investigated whether the 5′ to 3′ RNA decay machinery participated in the regulation of this process. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seeds of <i>exoribonuclease4</i> (<i>xrn4</i>) and <i>varicose</i> (<i>vcs</i>) mutants displayed distinct dormancy phenotypes. Transcriptome analysis <i>of xrn4-5</i> and <i>vcs-8</i> mutant seeds allowed us to identify genes that are likely to play a role in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of germination. Study of 5′ untranslated region features of these transcripts revealed that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic motifs, secondary energy, and GC content could play a role in their degradation by XRN4 and VCS, and Gene Ontology clustering revealed novel actors of seed dormancy and germination. Several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic transcripts identified as being putative targets of XRN4 and VCS in seeds (<i>PECTIN LYASE-LIKE</i>, <i>ASPARTYL PROTEASE</i>, <i>DWD-HYPERSENSITIVE-TO-ABA3</i>, and <i>YELLOW STRIPE-LIKE5</i>) were further studied by reverse genetics, and their functional roles in the germination process were confirmed by mutant analysis. These findings suggest that completion of germination and its regulation by dormancy also depend on the degradation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic subsets of mRNA.</p>

The IQD Family of Calmodulin-Binding Proteins Links Calcium Signaling to Microtubules, Membrane Subdomains, and the Nucleus
<p>Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) signaling and dynamic reorganization of the cytoskeleton are essential processes for the coordination and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of plant cell shape and cell growth. Calmodulin (CaM) and closely related calmodulin-like (CML) polypeptides are principal sensors of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. CaM/CMLs decode and relay information encrypted by the second messenger via differential interactions with a wide spectrum of targets to modulate their diverse biochemical activities. The plant-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic IQ67 DOMAIN (IQD) family emerged as possibly the largest class of CaM-interacting proteins with undefined molecular functions and biological roles. Here, we show that the 33 members of the IQD family in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) differentially localize, using green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged proteins, to multiple and distinct subcellular sites, including microtubule (MT) arrays, plasma membrane subdomains, and nuclear compartments. Intriguingly, the various IQD-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic localization patterns coincide with the subcellular patterns of IQD-dependent recruitment of CaM, suggesting that the diverse IQD members sequester Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM signaling modules to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic subcellular sites for precise regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent processes. Because MT localization is a hallmark of most IQD family members, we quantitatively analyzed GFP-labeled MT arrays in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> cells transiently expressing GFP-IQD fusions and observed IQD-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic MT patterns, which point to a role of IQDs in MT organization and dynamics. Indeed, stable overexpression of select IQD proteins in Arabidopsis altered cellular MT orientation, cell shape, and organ morphology. Because IQDs share biochemical properties with scaffold proteins, we propose that IQD families provide an assortment of platform proteins for integrating CaM-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling at multiple cellular sites to regulate cell function, shape, and growth.</p>

Functional Analysis of Cellulose Synthase (CESA) Protein Class Specificity
<p>The cellulose synthase complex (CSC) exhibits a 6-fold symmetry and is known as a “rosette.” Each CSC is believed to contain between 18 and 24 CESA proteins that each synthesize an individual glucan chain. These chains form the microfibrils that confer the remarkable structural properties of cellulose. At least three different classes of CESA proteins are essential to form the CSC. However, while organization of the CSC determines microfibril structure, how individual CESA proteins are organized within the CSC remains unclear. Parts of the plant CESA proteins map sufficiently well onto the bacterial CESA (BcsA) structure, indicating that they are likely to share a common catalytic mechanism. However, plant CESA proteins are much larger than the bacterial BcsA protein, prompting the suggestion that these plant-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic regions are important for interactions between CESA proteins and for conferring CESA class <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity. In this study, we have undertaken a comprehensive analysis of well-defined regions of secondary cell wall CESA proteins, with the aim of defining what distinguishes different CESA proteins and hence what determines the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity of each CESA class. Our results demonstrate that CESA class <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity extends throughout the protein and not just in the highly variable regions. Furthermore, we find that different CESA isoforms vary greatly in their levels of site <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity and this is likely to be determined by the constraints imposed by their position within the CSC rather than their primary structure.</p>

In barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), the allelic Mildew locus A (MLA) receptors mediate isolate-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic disease resistance against powdery mildew fungus (<i>Blumeria graminis</i> f. sp. <i>hordei</i>). Currently, how MLA stability is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led remains unknown. Here, we identified an MLA-interacting RING-type E3 ligase, MIR1, that interacts with several MLAs. We showed that the carboxyl-terminal TPR domain of MIR1 mediates the interaction with the coiled-coil domain-containing region of functional MLAs, such as MLA1, MLA6, and MLA10, but not with that of the nonfunctional MLA18-1. MIR1 can ubiquitinate the amino-terminal region of MLAs in vitro and promotes the proteasomal degradation of MLAs in vitro and in planta. Both proteasome inhibitor treatment and virus-induced gene silencing-mediated <i>MIR1</i> silencing significantly increased MLA abundance in barley transgenic lines. Furthermore, overexpression of MIR1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ically compromised MLA-mediated disease resistance in barley, while coexpression of MIR1 and MLA10 attenuated MLA10-induced cell death signaling in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>.

Disclosing the Molecular Basis of the Postharvest Life of Berry in Different Grapevine Genotypes
<p>The molecular events that characterize postripening grapevine berries have rarely been investigated and are poorly defined. In particular, a detailed definition of changes occurring during the postharvest dehydration, a process undertaken to make some particularly special wine styles, would be of great interest for both winemakers and plant biologists. We report an exhaustive survey of transcriptomic and metabolomic responses in berries representing six grapevine genotypes subjected to postharvest dehydration under identical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led conditions. The modulation of phenylpropanoid metabolism clearly distinguished the behavior of genotypes, with stilbene accumulation as the major metabolic event, although the transient accumulation/depletion of anthocyanins and flavonols was the prevalent variation in genotypes that do not accumulate stilbenes. The modulation of genes related to phenylpropanoid/stilbene metabolism highlighted the distinct metabolomic plasticity of genotypes, allowing for the identification of candidate structural and regulatory genes. In addition to genotype-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic responses, a core set of genes was consistently modulated in all genotypes, representing the common features of berries undergoing dehydration and/or commencing senescence. This included genes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>ling ethylene and auxin metabolism as well as genes involved in oxidative and osmotic stress, defense responses, anaerobic respiration, and cell wall and carbohydrate metabolism.

Similar specificities of symbiont uptake by adults and larvae in an anemone model system for coral biology
<p>Reef-building corals depend for much of their energy on photosynthesis by symbiotic dinoflagellate algae (genus <i>Symbiodinium</i>) that live within their gastrodermal cells. However, the cellular mechanisms underpinning this ecologically critical symbiosis, including those governing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity of symbiont uptake by the host, remain poorly understood, in part because of the difficulties of working with corals in the laboratory. Here, we used the small symbiotic sea anemone <i>Aiptasia</i> as an experimentally tractable model system to analyze the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity and timing of symbiosis onset in larval and adult animals under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led laboratory conditions. Using four clonal, axenic <i>Symbiodinium</i> strains, we found no difference in uptake <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity between larvae (even when very young) and adults. Although both compatible and incompatible algal strains were found within the larval guts, only the former appeared to be internalized by gastrodermal cells, and they (but not incompatible algae) proliferated rapidly within the larvae in the absence of detectable exchange with other larvae. Older larvae showed reduced ingestion of both compatible and incompatible algae, and the addition of food failed to promote the uptake of an incompatible algal strain. Thus, <i>Aiptasia</i> adults and larvae appear to have similar mechanisms for discriminating between compatible and incompatible dinoflagellate types prior to phagocytosis by host gastrodermal cells. Whether a particular algal strain is compatible or incompatible appears to be stable during years of axenic culture in the absence of a host. These studies provide a foundation for future analyses of the mechanisms of symbiont-uptake <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity in this emerging model system.</p>

Flexible strategies for flight control: an active role for the abdomen
<p>Moving animals orchestrate myriad motor systems in response to multimodal sensory inputs. Coordinating movement is particularly challenging in flight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>, where animals deal with potential instability and multiple degrees of freedom of movement. Prior studies have focused on wings as the primary flight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> structures, for which changes in angle of attack or shape are used to modulate lift and drag forces. However, other actuators that may impact flight performance are reflexively activated during flight. We investigated the visual–abdominal reflex displayed by the hawkmoth <i>Manduca sexta</i> to determine its role in flight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>. We measured the open-loop stimulus–response characteristics (measured as a transfer function) between the visual stimulus and abdominal response in tethered moths. The transfer function reveals a 41 ms delay and a high-pass filter behavior with a pass band starting at ~0.5 Hz. We also developed a simplified mathematical model of hovering flight wherein articulation of the thoracic–abdominal joint redirects an average lift force provided by the wings. We show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of the joint, subject to a high-pass filter, is sufficient to maintain stable hovering, but with a slim stability margin. Our experiments and models suggest a novel mechanism by which articulation of the body or ‘airframe’ of an animal can be used to redirect lift forces for effective flight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>. Furthermore, the small stability margin may increase flight agility by easing the transition from stable flight to a more maneuverable, unstable regime.</p>

Atrial Fibrillation Burden in Young Patients With Congenital Heart Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) are assumed to be vulnerable to atrial fibrillation (AF) as a result of residual shunts, anomalous vessel anatomy, progressive valvulopathy, hypertension, and atrial scars from previous heart surgery. However, the risk of developing AF and the complications associated with AF in children and young adults with CHD have not been compared with those in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data from the Swedish Patient and Cause of Death registers were used to identify all patients with a diagnosis of CHD who were born from 1970 to 1993. Each patient with CHD was matched by birth year, sex, and county with 10 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> subjects from the Total Population Register in Sweden. Follow-up data were collected until 2011.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 21 982 patients (51.6% men) with CHD and 219 816 matched <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> subjects, 654 and 328 developed AF, respectively. The mean follow-up was 27 years. The risk of developing AF was 21.99 times higher (95% confidence interval, 19.26–25.12) in patients with CHD than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> subjects. According to a hierarchical CHD classification, patients with conotruncal defects had the highest risk (hazard ratio, 84.27; 95% confidence interval, 56.86–124.89). At the age of 42 years, 8.3% of all patients with CHD had a recorded diagnosis of AF. Heart failure was the quantitatively most important complication in patients with CHD and AF, with a 10.7% (70 of 654) recorded diagnosis of heart failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The risk of AF in children and young adults with CHD was 22 times higher than that in matched <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> subjects. Up to the age of 42 years, 1 of 12 patients with CHD had developed AF, and 1 of 10 patients with CHD with AF had developed heart failure. The patient groups with the most complex congenital defects carried the greatest risk of AF and could be considered for targeted monitoring.</p></sec>

0/1-Hour Triage Algorithm for Myocardial Infarction in Patients With Renal Dysfunction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The European Society of Cardiology recommends a 0/1-hour algorithm for rapid rule-out and rule-in of non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction using high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) concentrations irrespective of renal function. Because patients with renal dysfunction (RD) frequently present with increased hs-cTn concentrations even in the absence of non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, concern has been raised regarding the performance of the 0/1-hour algorithm in RD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a prospective multicenter diagnostic study enrolling unselected patients presenting with suspected non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction to the emergency department, we assessed the diagnostic performance of the European Society of Cardiology 0/1-hour algorithm using hs-cTnT and hs-cTnI in patients with RD, defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, and compared it to patients with normal renal function. The final diagnosis was centrally adjudicated by 2 independent cardiologists using all available information, including cardiac imaging. Safety was quantified as sensitivity in the rule-out zone, accuracy as the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity in the rule-in zone, and efficacy as the proportion of the overall cohort assigned to either rule-out or rule-in based on the 0- and 1-hour <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 3254 patients, RD was present in 487 patients (15%). The prevalence of non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction was substantially higher in patients with RD compared with patients with normal renal function (31% versus 13%, <i>P</i><0.001). Using hs-cTnT, patients with RD had comparable sensitivity of rule-out (100.0% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 97.6–100.0] versus 99.2% [95% CI, 97.6–99.8]; <i>P</i>=0.559), lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity of rule-in (88.7% [95% CI, 84.8–91.9] versus 96.5% [95% CI, 95.7–97.2]; <i>P</i><0.001), and lower overall efficacy (51% versus 81%, <i>P</i><0.001), mainly driven by a much lower percentage of patients eligible for rule-out (18% versus 68%, <i>P</i><0.001) compared with patients with normal renal function. Using hs-cTnI, patients with RD had comparable sensitivity of rule-out (98.6% [95% CI, 95.0–99.8] versus 98.5% [95% CI, 96.5–99.5]; <i>P</i>=1.0), lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity of rule-in (84.4% [95% CI, 79.9–88.3] versus 91.7% [95% CI, 90.5–92.9]; <i>P</i><0.001), and lower overall efficacy (54% versus 76%, <i>P</i><0.001; proportion ruled out, 18% versus 58%, <i>P</i><0.001) compared with patients with normal renal function.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In patients with RD, the safety of the European Society of Cardiology 0/1-hour algorithm is high, but <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity of rule-in and overall efficacy are decreased.

Transcatheter Interatrial Shunt Device for the Treatment of Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction (REDUCE LAP-HF I [Reduce Elevated Left Atrial Pressure in Patients With Heart Failure])
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In nonrandomized, open-label studies, a transcatheter interatrial shunt device (IASD, Corvia Medical) was associated with lower pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), fewer symptoms, and greater quality of life and exercise capacity in patients with heart failure (HF) and midrange or preserved ejection fraction (EF ≥40%). We conducted the first randomized sham-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led trial to evaluate the IASD in HF with EF ≥40%.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>REDUCE LAP-HF I (Reduce Elevated Left Atrial Pressure in Patients With Heart Failure) was a phase 2, randomized, parallel-group, blinded multicenter trial in patients with New York Heart Association class III or ambulatory class IV HF, EF ≥40%, exercise PCWP ≥25 mm Hg, and PCWP-right atrial pressure gradient ≥5 mm Hg. Participants were randomized (1:1) to the IASD versus a sham procedure (femoral venous access with intracardiac echocardiography but no IASD placement). The participants and investigators assessing the participants during follow-up were blinded to treatment assignment. The primary effectiveness end point was exercise PCWP at 1 month. The primary safety end point was major adverse cardiac, cerebrovascular, and renal events at 1 month. PCWP during exercise was compared between treatment groups using a mixed-effects repeated measures model analysis of covariance that included data from all available stages of exercise.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 94 patients were enrolled, of whom 44 met inclusion/exclusion criteria and were randomized to the IASD (n=22) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> (n=22) groups. Mean age was 70±9 years, and 50% were female. At 1 month, the IASD resulted in a greater reduction in PCWP compared with sham <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> (<i>P</i>=0.028 accounting for all stages of exercise). Peak PCWP decreased by 3.5±6.4 mm Hg in the treatment group versus 0.5±5.0 mm Hg in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> group (<i>P</i>=0.14). There were no peri-procedural or 1-month major adverse cardiac, cerebrovascular, and renal events in the IASD group and 1 event (worsening renal function) in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> group (<i>P</i>=1.0).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In patients with HF and EF ≥40%, IASD treatment reduces PCWP during exercise.

Right Ventricular Myofilament Functional Differences in Humans With Systemic Sclerosis–Associated Versus Idiopathic Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc)–associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have a far worse prognosis than those with idiopathic PAH (IPAH). In the intact heart, SSc-PAH exhibits depressed rest and reserve right ventricular (RV) contractility compared with IPAH. We tested whether this disparity involves underlying differences in myofilament function.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Cardiac myocytes were isolated from RV septal endomyocardial biopsies from patients with SSc-PAH, IPAH, or SSc with exertional dyspnea but no resting PAH (SSc-d); <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> RV septal tissue was obtained from nondiseased donor hearts (6–7 per group). Isolated myocyte passive length-tension and developed tension-calcium relationships were determined and correlated with in vivo RV function and reserve. RV septal fibrosis was also examined.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Myocyte passive stiffness from length-tension relations was similarly increased in IPAH and SSc-PAH compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>, although SSc-PAH biopsies had more interstitial fibrosis. More striking disparities were found between active force-calcium relations. Compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>s, maximal calcium-activated force (F<sub>max</sub>) was 28% higher in IPAH but 37% lower in SSc-PAH. F<sub>max</sub> in SSc-d was intermediate between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> and SSc-PAH. The calcium concentration required for half-maximal force (EC<sub>50</sub>) was similar between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>, IPAH, and SSc-d but lower in SSc-PAH. This disparity disappeared in myocytes incubated with the active catalytic subunit of protein kinase A. Myocyte F<sub>max</sub> directly correlated with in vivo RV contractility assessed by end-systolic elastance (<i>R<sup>2</sup></i>=0.46, <i>P</i>=0.002) and change in end-systolic elastance with exercise (<i>R<sup>2</sup></i>=0.49, <i>P</i>=0.008) and was inversely related with exercise-induced chamber dilation (<i>R<sup>2</sup></i>=0.63, <i>P</i><0.002), which also was a marker of depressed contractile reserve.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>A primary defect in human SSc-PAH resides in depressed sarcomere function, whereas this is enhanced in IPAH. These disparities correlate with in vivo RV contractility and contractile reserve and are consistent with worse clinical outcomes in SSc-PAH. The existence of sarcomere disease before the development of resting PAH in patients with SSc-d suggests that earlier identification and intervention may prove useful.</p></sec>

Particulate Matter Air Pollution Exposure and Heart Disease Mortality Risks by Race and Ethnicity in the United States
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Most US studies of mortality and air pollution have been conducted on largely non-Hispanic white study populations. However, many health and mortality outcomes differ by race and ethnicity, and non-Hispanic white persons experience lower air pollution exposure than those who are non-Hispanic black or Hispanic. This study examines whether associations between air pollution and heart disease mortality differ by race/ethnicity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used data from the 1997 to 2009 National Health Interview Survey linked to mortality records through December 2011 and annual estimates of fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) by census tract. Proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals between PM<sub>2.5</sub> (per 10 µg/m<sup>3</sup>) and heart disease mortality using the full <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e adults, which have information on additional health variables.

After adjustment for several factors, we found a significant positive association between PM<sub>2.5</sub> and heart disease mortality (hazard ratio, 1.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.08–1.25). This association was similar in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e adults with adjustment for smoking and body mass index (hazard ratio, 1.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.06–1.31). Interaction terms for non-Hispanic black and Hispanic groups compared with the non-Hispanic white group were not statistically significant.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Using a nationally representative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e, the association between PM<sub>2.5</sub> and heart disease mortality was elevated and similar to previous estimates. Associations for non-Hispanic black and Hispanic adults were not statistically significantly different from those for non-Hispanic white adults.</p></sec>

Reversing the Cardiac Effects of Sedentary Aging in Middle Age—A Randomized Controlled Trial
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Poor fitness in middle age is a risk factor for heart failure, particularly heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction. The development of heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction is likely mediated through increased left ventricular (LV) stiffness, a consequence of sedentary aging. In a prospective, parallel group, randomized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led trial, we examined the effect of 2 years of supervised high-intensity exercise training on LV stiffness.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Sixty-one (48% male) healthy, sedentary, middle-aged participants (53±5 years) were randomly assigned to either 2 years of exercise training (n=34) or attention <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>; n=27). Right heart catheterization and 3-dimensional echocardiography were performed with preload manipulations to define LV end-diastolic pressure-volume relationships and Frank-Starling curves. LV stiffness was calculated by curve fit of the diastolic pressure-volume curve. Maximal oxygen uptake (Vo<sub>2</sub>max) was measured to quantify changes in fitness.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Fifty-three participants completed the study. Adherence to prescribed exercise sessions was 88±11%. Vo<sub>2</sub>max increased by 18% (exercise training: pre 29.0±4.8 to post 34.4±6.4; <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>: pre 29.5±5.3 to post 28.7±5.4, group×time <i>P</i><0.001) and LV stiffness was reduced (right/downward shift in the end-diastolic pressure-volume relationships; preexercise training stiffness constant 0.072±0.037 to postexercise training 0.051±0.0268, <i>P</i>=0.0018), whereas there was no change in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>s (group×time <i>P</i><0.001; pre stiffness constant 0.0635±0.026 to post 0.062±0.031, <i>P</i>=0.83). Exercise increased LV end-diastolic volume (group×time <i>P</i><0.001), whereas pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was unchanged, providing greater stroke volume for any given filling pressure (loading×group×time <i>P</i>=0.007).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In previously sedentary healthy middle-aged adults, 2 years of exercise training improved maximal oxygen uptake and decreased cardiac stiffness. Regular exercise training may provide protection against the future risk of heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction by preventing the increase in cardiac stiffness attributable to sedentary aging.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Application of Large-Scale Aptamer-Based Proteomic Profiling to Planned Myocardial Infarctions
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Emerging proteomic technologies using novel affinity-based reagents allow for efficient multiplexing with high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e throughput. To identify early biomarkers of myocardial injury, we recently applied an aptamer-based proteomic profiling platform that measures 1129 proteins to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es from patients undergoing septal alcohol ablation for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a human model of planned myocardial injury. Here, we examined the scalability of this approach using a markedly expanded platform to study a far broader range of human proteins in the context of myocardial injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We applied a highly multiplexed, expanded proteomic technique that uses single-stranded DNA aptamers to assay 4783 human proteins (4137 distinct human gene targets) to derivation and validation cohorts of planned myocardial injury, individuals with spontaneous myocardial infarction, and at-risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We found 376 target proteins that significantly changed in the blood after planned myocardial injury in a derivation cohort (n=20; <i>P</i><1.05E-05, 1-way repeated measures analysis of variance, Bonferroni threshold). Two hundred forty-seven of these proteins were validated in an independent planned myocardial injury cohort (n=15; <i>P</i><1.33E-04, 1-way repeated measures analysis of variance); >90% were directionally consistent and reached nominal significance in the validation cohort. Among the validated proteins that were increased within 1 hour after planned myocardial injury, 29 were also elevated in patients with spontaneous myocardial infarction (n=63; <i>P</i><6.17E-04). Many of the novel markers identified in our study are intracellular proteins not previously identified in the peripheral circulation or have functional roles relevant to myocardial injury. For example, the cardiac LIM protein, cysteine- and glycine-rich protein 3, is thought to mediate cardiac mechanotransduction and stress responses, whereas the mitochondrial ATP synthase F<sub>0</sub> subunit component is a vasoactive peptide on its release from cells. Last, we performed aptamer-affinity enrichment coupled with mass spectrometry to technically verify aptamer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity for a subset of the new biomarkers.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our results demonstrate the feasibility of large-scale aptamer multiplexing at a level that has not previously been reported and with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e throughput that greatly exceeds other existing proteomic methods.

Effect of Distinct Lifestyle Interventions on Mobilization of Fat Storage Pools
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>We aimed to assess whether distinct lifestyle strategies can differentially affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic body adipose depots.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed an 18-month randomized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led trial among 278 sedentary adults with abdominal obesity (75%) or dyslipidemia in an isolated workplace with a monitored provided lunch. Participants were randomized to isocaloric low-fat or Mediterranean/low-carbohydrate (MED/LC) diet+28 g walnuts/day with/without added moderate physical activity (PA; 80% aerobic; supervised/free gym membership). Overall primary outcome was body fat redistribution, and the main <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic end point was visceral adipose tissue (VAT). We further followed the dynamics of different fat depots (deep and superficial subcutaneous, liver, pericardial, muscle, pancreas, and renal sinus) by magnetic resonance imaging.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 278 participants (age, 48 years, 89% men, body mass index, 30.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), 86% completed the trial with good adherence. The low-fat group preferentially decreased reported fat intake (−21.0% versus −11.5% for the MED/LC; <i>P</i><0.001), and the MED/LC group decreased reported carbohydrates intake (−39.5% versus −21.3% for the low-fat group; <i>P</i><0.001). The PA<sup>+</sup> groups significantly increased the metabolic equivalents per week versus the PA<sup>−</sup> groups (19.0 versus 2.1; <i>P</i>=0.009). Whereas final moderate weight loss was indifferent, exercise attenuated the waist circumference rebound with the greatest effect in the MED/LC<sup>PA+</sup> group (<i>P</i><0.05). VAT (−22%), intrahepatic (−29%), and intrapericardial (−11%) fats declines were higher than pancreatic and femur intermuscular fats (1% to 2%) loss. Independent of weight loss, PA<sup>+</sup> with either diet had a significantly greater effect on decreasing VAT (mean of difference, −6.67cm<sup>2</sup>; 95% confidence interval, −14.8 to −0.45) compared with PA<sup>−</sup>. The MED/LC diet was superior to the low-fat diet in decreasing intrahepatic, intrapericardial, and pancreatic fats (<i>P</i><0.05 for all). In contrast, renal sinus and femoral intermuscular fats were not differentially altered by lifestyle interventions but by weight loss per se. In multivariate models further adjusted for weight loss, losing VAT or intrahepatic fat was independently associated with improved lipid profile, losing deep subcutaneous adipose tissue with improved insulin sensitivity, and losing superficial subcutaneous adipose tissue remained neutral except for an association with decreased leptin.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Moderate weight loss alone inadequately reflects the significant lifestyle effects on atherogenic and diabetogenic fat depots. The MED/LC diet mobilizes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic ectopic fat depots, and exercise has an independent contribution to VAT loss. Fat depots exhibit diverse responsiveness and are differentially related to cardiometabolic markers. Distinct lifestyle protocols may uniquely induce fat mobilization from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic anatomic sites.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Improving Assessment of Drug Safety Through Proteomics
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Early detection of adverse effects of novel therapies and understanding of their mechanisms could improve the safety and efficiency of drug development. We have retrospectively applied large-scale proteomics to blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es from ILLUMINATE (Investigation of Lipid Level Management to Understand its Impact in Atherosclerotic Events), a trial of torcetrapib (a cholesterol ester transfer protein inhibitor), that involved 15 067 participants at high cardiovascular risk. ILLUMINATE was terminated at a median of 550 days because of significant absolute increases of 1.2% in cardiovascular events and 0.4% in mortality with torcetrapib. The aims of our analysis were to determine whether a proteomic analysis might reveal biological mechanisms responsible for these harmful effects and whether harmful effects of torcetrapib could have been detected early in the ILLUMINATE trial with proteomics.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A nested case-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> analysis of paired plasma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es at baseline and at 3 months was performed in 249 participants assigned to torcetrapib plus atorvastatin and 223 participants assigned to atorvastatin only. Within each treatment arm, cases with events were matched to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>s 1:1. Main outcomes were a survey of 1129 proteins for discovery of biological pathways altered by torcetrapib and a 9-protein risk score validated to predict myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, or death.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Plasma concentrations of 200 proteins changed significantly with torcetrapib. Their pathway analysis revealed unexpected and widespread changes in immune and inflammatory functions, as well as changes in endocrine systems, including in aldosterone function and glycemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>. At baseline, 9-protein risk scores were similar in the 2 treatment arms and higher in participants with subsequent events. At 3 months, the absolute 9-protein derived risk increased in the torcetrapib plus atorvastatin arm compared with the atorvastatin-only arm by 1.08% (<i>P</i>=0.0004). Thirty-seven proteins changed in the direction of increased risk of 49 proteins previously associated with cardiovascular and mortality risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Heretofore unknown effects of torcetrapib were revealed in immune and inflammatory functions. A protein-based risk score predicted harm from torcetrapib within just 3 months.

Human Plasma Thioredoxin-80 Increases With Age and in ApoE<sup>−/−</sup> Mice Induces Inflammation, Angiogenesis, and Atherosclerosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Thioredoxin (TRX)-1, a ubiquitous 12-kDa protein, exerts antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. In contrast, the truncated form, called TRX80, produced by macrophages induces upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines. TRX80 also promotes the differentiation of mouse peritoneal and human macrophages toward a proinflammatory M1 phenotype.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>TRX1 and TRX80 plasma levels were determined with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic ELISA. A disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein (ADAM)-10, ADAM-17, and ADAM-10 activities were measured with SensoLyte 520 ADAM10 Activity Assay Kit, Fluorimetric, and InnoZyme TACE Activity Kit, respectively. Western immunoblots were performed with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic antibodies to ADAM-10 or ADAM-17. Angiogenesis study was evaluated in vitro with human microvascular endothelial cells-1 and in vivo with the Matrigel plug angiogenesis assay in mice. The expression of macrophage phenotype markers was investigated with real-time polymerase chain reaction. Phosphorylation of Akt, mechanistic target of rapamycin, and 70S6K was determined with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic antibodies. The effect of TRX80 on NLRP3 inflammasome activity was evaluated by measuring the level of interleukin-1β and -18 in the supernatants of activated macrophages with ELISA. Hearts were used for lesion surface evaluation and immunohistochemical studies, and whole descending aorta were stained with Oil Red O. For transgenic mice generation, the human scavenger receptor (SR-A) promoter/enhancer was used to drive macrophage-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic expression of human TRX80 in mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In this study, we observed a significant increase of plasma levels of TRX80 in old subjects compared with healthy young subjects. In parallel, an increase in expression and activity of ADAM-10 and ADAM-17 in old peripheral blood mononuclear cells compared with those of young subjects was observed. Furthermore, TRX80 was found to colocalize with tumor necrosis factor-α, a macrophage M1 marker, in human atherosclerotic plaque. In addition, TRX80 induced the expression of murine M1 macrophage markers through Akt2/mechanistic target of rapamycin–C1/70S6K pathway and activated the inflammasome NLRP3, leading to the release of interleukin-1β and -18, potent atherogenic cytokines. Moreover, TRX80 exerts a powerful angiogenic effect in both in vitro and in vivo mouse studies. Finally, transgenic mice that overexpress human TRX80 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ically in macrophages of apoE<sup>−/−</sup> mice have a significant increase of aortic atherosclerotic lesions.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>TRX80 showed an age-dependent increase in human plasma. In mouse models, TRX80 was associated with a proinflammatory status and increased atherosclerosis.</p></sec>

Vascular CXCR4 Limits Atherosclerosis by Maintaining Arterial Integrity
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The CXCL12/CXCR4 chemokine ligand/receptor axis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>s (progenitor) cell homeostasis and trafficking. So far, an atheroprotective role of CXCL12/CXCR4 has only been implied through pharmacological intervention, in particular, because the somatic deletion of the <i>CXCR4</i> gene in mice is embryonically lethal. Moreover, cell-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic effects of CXCR4 in the arterial wall and underlying mechanisms remain elusive, prompting us to investigate the relevance of CXCR4 in vascular cell types for atheroprotection.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We examined the role of vascular CXCR4 in atherosclerosis and plaque composition by inducing an endothelial cell (BmxCreER<sup>T2</sup>-driven)–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic or smooth muscle cell (SMC, SmmhcCreER<sup>T2</sup>- or TaglnCre-driven)–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic deficiency of <i>CXCR4</i> in an apolipoprotein E–deficient mouse model. To identify underlying mechanisms for effects of CXCR4, we studied endothelial permeability, intravital leukocyte adhesion, involvement of the Akt/WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway and relevant phosphatases in VE-cadherin expression and function, vascular tone in aortic rings, cholesterol efflux from macrophages, and expression of SMC phenotypic markers. Finally, we analyzed associations of common genetic variants at the <i>CXCR4</i> locus with the risk for coronary heart disease, along with <i>CXCR4</i> transcript expression in human atherosclerotic plaques.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The cell-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic deletion of <i>CXCR4</i> in arterial endothelial cells (n=12–15) or SMCs (n=13–24) markedly increased atherosclerotic lesion formation in hyperlipidemic mice. Endothelial barrier function was promoted by CXCL12/CXCR4, which triggered Akt/WNT/β-catenin signaling to drive VE-cadherin expression and stabilized junctional VE-cadherin complexes through associated phosphatases. Conversely, endothelial <i>CXCR4</i> deficiency caused arterial leakage and inflammatory leukocyte recruitment during atherogenesis. In arterial SMCs, CXCR4 sustained normal vascular reactivity and contractile responses, whereas <i>CXCR4</i> deficiency favored a synthetic phenotype, the occurrence of macrophage-like SMCs in the lesions, and impaired cholesterol efflux. Regression analyses in humans (n=259 796) identified the C-allele at <i>rs2322864</i> within the <i>CXCR4</i> locus to be associated with increased risk for coronary heart disease. In line, C/C risk genotype carriers showed reduced CXCR4 expression in carotid artery plaques (n=188), which was furthermore associated with symptomatic disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our data clearly establish that vascular CXCR4 limits atherosclerosis by maintaining arterial integrity, preserving endothelial barrier function, and a normal contractile SMC phenotype. Enhancing these beneficial functions of arterial CXCR4 by selective modulators might open novel therapeutic options in atherosclerosis.</p></sec>

Interferon Regulatory Factor 4 Inhibits Neointima Formation by Engaging Krüppel-Like Factor 4 Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The mechanisms underlying neointima formation remain unclear. Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), which are key innate immune regulators, play important roles in cardiometabolic diseases. However, the function of IRF4 in arterial restenosis is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>IRF4 expression was first detected in human and mouse restenotic arteries. Then, the effects of IRF4 on neointima formation were evaluated with universal IRF4-deficient mouse and rat carotid artery injury models. We performed immunostaining to identify IRF4-expressing cells in the lesions. Smooth muscle cell (SMC)–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic IRF4-knockout (KO) and -transgenic (TG) mice were generated to evaluate the effects of SMC-IRF4 on neointima formation. We used microarray, bioinformatics analysis, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay to identify the downstream signals of IRF4 and to verify the targets in vitro. We compared SMC-IRF4-KO/Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4)–TG mice with SMC-IRF4-KO mice and SMC-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic IRF4-TG/KLF4-KO mice with SMC-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic IRF4-TG mice to investigate whether the effect of IRF4 on neointima formation is KLF4-dependent. The effect of IRF4 on SMC phenotype switching was also evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>IRF4 expression in both the human and mouse restenotic arteries is eventually downregulated. Universal IRF4 ablation potentiates neointima formation in both mice and rats. Immunostaining indicated that IRF4 was expressed primarily in SMCs in restenotic arteries. After injury, SMC-IRF4-KO mice developed a thicker neointima than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> mice. This change was accompanied by increased SMC proliferation and migration. However, SMC-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic IRF4-TG mice exhibited the opposite phenotype, demonstrating that IRF4 exerts protective effects against neointima formation. The mechanistic study indicated that IRF4 promotes KLF4 expression by directly binding to its promoter. Genetic overexpression of KLF4 in SMCs largely reversed the neointima-promoting effect of IRF4 ablation, whereas ablation of KLF4 abolished the protective function of IRF4, indicating that the protective effects of IRF4 against neointima formation are KLF4-dependent. In addition, IRF4 promoted SMC dedifferentiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>IRF4 protects arteries against neointima formation by promoting the expression of KLF4 by directly binding to its promoter. Our findings suggest that this previously undiscovered IRF4-KLF4 axis plays a key role in vasculoproliferative pathology and may be a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of arterial restenosis.</p></sec>

Use of a Single Baseline Versus Multiyear 24-Hour Urine Collection for Estimation of Long-Term Sodium Intake and Associated Cardiovascular and Renal Risk
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>A decrease in sodium intake has been shown to lower blood pressure, but data from cohort studies on the association with cardiovascular and renal outcomes are inconsistent. In these studies, sodium intake was often estimated with a single baseline measurement, which may be inaccurate considering day-to-day changes in sodium intake and sodium excretion. We compared the effects of single versus repetitive follow-up 24-hour urine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es on the relation between sodium intake and long-term cardiorenal outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We selected adult subjects with an estimated glomerular filtration rate >60 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>, an outpatient 24-hour urine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e between 1998 and 1999, and at least 1 collection during a 17-year follow-up. Sodium intake was estimated with a single baseline collection and the average of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es collected during a 1-, 5-, and 15-year follow-up. We used Cox regression analysis and the landmark approach to investigate the relation between sodium intake and cardiovascular (cardiovascular events or mortality) and renal (end-stage renal disease: dialysis, transplantation, and/or >60% estimated glomerular filtration rate decline, or mortality) outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We included 574 subjects with 9776 twenty-four–hour urine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es. Average age was 47 years, and 46% were male. Median follow-up was 16.2 years. Average 24-hour sodium excretion, ranging from 3.8 to 3.9 g (165–170 mmol), was equal among all methods (<i>P</i>=0.88). However, relative to a single baseline measurement, 50% of the subjects had a >0.8-g (>34-mmol) difference in sodium intake with long-term estimations. As a result, 45%, 49%, and 50% of all subjects switched between tertiles of sodium intake when the 1-, 5-, or 15-year average was used, respectively. Consequently, hazard ratios for cardiorenal outcome changed up to 85% with the use of sodium intake estimations from short-term (1-year) and long-term (5-year) follow-up instead of baseline estimations.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Relative to a single baseline 24-hour sodium measurement, the use of subsequent 24-hour urine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es resulted in different estimations of an individual’s sodium intake, whereas population averages remained similar.

Distinct Regulatory Effects of Myeloid Cell and Endothelial Cell NAPDH Oxidase 2 on Blood Pressure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Hypertension caused by increased renin-angiotensin system activation is associated with elevated reactive oxygen species production. Previous studies implicate NADPH oxidase (Nox) proteins as important reactive oxygen species sources during renin-angiotensin system activation, with different Nox isoforms being potentially involved. Among these, Nox2 is expressed in multiple cell types, including endothelial cells, fibroblasts, immune cells, and microglia. Blood pressure (BP) is regulated at the central nervous system, renal, and vascular levels, but the cell-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic role of Nox2 in BP regulation is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We generated a novel mouse model with a floxed Nox2 gene and used Tie2-Cre, LysM Cre, or Cdh5-CreERT2 driver lines to develop cell-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic models of Nox2 perturbation to investigate its role in BP regulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Unexpectedly, Nox2 deletion in myeloid but not endothelial cells resulted in a significant reduction in basal BP. Both Tie2-CreNox2 knockout (KO) mice (in which Nox2 was deficient in both endothelial cells and myeloid cells) and LysM CreNox2KO mice (in which Nox2 was deficient in myeloid cells) had significantly lower BP than littermate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>s, whereas basal BP was unaltered in Cdh5-CreERT2 Nox2KO mice (in which Nox2 is deficient only in endothelial cells). The lower BP was attributable to an increased NO bioavailability that dynamically dilated resistance vessels in vivo under basal conditions without a change in renal function.

Patients With Long-QT Syndrome Caused by Impaired <i>hERG</i>-Encoded K<sub>v</sub>11.1 Potassium Channel Have Exaggerated Endocrine Pancreatic and Incretin Function Associated With Reactive Hypoglycemia
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Loss-of-function mutations in <i>hERG</i> (encoding the K<sub>v</sub>11.1 voltage-gated potassium channel) cause long-QT syndrome type 2 (LQT2) because of prolonged cardiac repolarization. However, K<sub>v</sub>11.1 is also present in pancreatic α and β cells and intestinal L and K cells, secreting glucagon, insulin, and the incretins glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide), respectively. These hormones are crucial for glucose regulation, and long-QT syndrome may cause disturbed glucose regulation. We measured secretion of these hormones and cardiac repolarization in response to glucose ingestion in LQT2 patients with functional mutations in <i>hERG</i> and matched healthy participants, testing the hypothesis that LQT2 patients have increased incretin and β-cell function and decreased α-cell function, and thus lower glucose levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Eleven patients with LQT2 and 22 sex-, age-, and body mass index–matched <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> participants underwent a 6-hour 75-g oral glucose tolerance test with ECG recording and blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>ing for measurements of glucose, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, GLP-1, and GIP.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In comparison with matched <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> participants, LQT2 patients had 56% to 78% increased serum insulin, serum C-peptide, plasma GLP-1, and plasma GIP responses (<i>P</i>=0.03–0.001) and decreased plasma glucose levels after glucose ingestion (<i>P</i>=0.02) with more symptoms of hypoglycemia (<i>P</i>=0.04). Sixty-three percent of LQT2 patients developed hypoglycemic plasma glucose levels (<70 mg/dL) versus 36% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> participants (<i>P</i>=0.16), and 18% patients developed serious hypoglycemia (<50 mg/dL) versus none of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>s. LQT2 patients had defective glucagon responses to low glucose, <i>P</i>=0.008. β-Cell function (Insulin Secretion Sensitivity Index-2) was 2-fold higher in LQT2 patients than in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>s (4398 [95% confidence interval, 2259–8562] versus 2156 [1961–3201], <i>P</i>=0.03). Pharmacological K<sub>v</sub>11.1 blockade (dofetilide) in rats had similar effect, and small interfering RNA inhibition of <i>hERG</i> in β and L cells increased insulin and GLP-1 secretion up to 50%.

Throughout the 24-week follow-up, there were no significant differences   in the mean grip strength between the groups, whereas the mean Semmes-Weinstein   monofilament sensory index for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> group was significantly   higher than that of the Raynaud’s phenomenon group.

The effect of a single early high-dose vitamin D supplement on fracture union in patients with hypovitaminosis D
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To evaluate the effect of a single early high-dose vitamin D   supplement on fracture union in patients with hypovitaminosis D   and a long bone fracture.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between July 2011 and August 2013, 113 adults with a long bone   fracture were enrolled in a prospective randomised double-blind   placebo-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led trial. Their serum vitamin D levels were measured   and a total of 100 patients were found to be vitamin D deficient   (< 20 ng/ml) or insufficient (< 30 ng/mL). These were then   randomised to receive a single dose of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> orally   (100 000 IU) within two weeks of injury (treatment group, n = 50)   or a placebo (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> group, n = 50). We recorded patient demographics,   fracture location and treatment, vitamin D level, time to fracture   union and complications, including vitamin D toxicity.</p><p>Outcomes included union, nonunion or complication requiring an   early, unplanned secondary procedure. Patients without an outcome   at 15 months and no scheduled follow-up were considered lost to   follow-up. The <i>t</i>-test and cross tabulations verified   the adequacy of randomisation. An intention-to-treat analysis was   carried out.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In all, 100 (89%) patients had hypovitaminosis D. Both treatment   and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> groups had similar demographics and injury characteristics.   The initial median vitamin D levels were 16 ng/mL (interquartile   range 5 to 28) in both groups (p = 0.885). A total of 14 patients   were lost to follow-up (seven from each group), two had fixation   failure (one in each group) and one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> group patient developed   an infection. Overall, the nonunion rate was 4% (two per group).   No patient showed signs of clinical toxicity from their supplement.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Despite finding a high level of hypovitaminosis D, the rate of   union was high and independent of supplementation with vitamin D<sub>3</sub>.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1520–5.</p></sec>

Synovasure ‘quick test’ is not as accurate as the laboratory-based α-defensin immunoassay
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>α-defensin is a biomarker which has been described as having   a high degree of accuracy in the diagnosis of periprosthetic joint   infection (PJI). Current meta-analyses are based on the α-defensin   laboratory-based immunoassay rather than the quick on-table lateral   flow test kit. This study is the first meta-analysis to compare the   accuracy of the α-defensin laboratory-based immunoassay and the   lateral flow test kit for the diagnosis of PJI.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A systematic review was performed according to the Preferred   Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.   Inclusion criteria were all clinical studies where the diagnosis   of PJI was uncertain. All studies selected used the Musculoskeletal   Infection Society (MSIS) or modified MSIS criteria. Two independent   reviewers reviewed the studies and extracted data. A meta-analysis   of results was carried out: pooled sensitivity, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity, positive   and negative likelihood ratio, heterogeneity and areas under curves   are reported.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Ten studies (759 patients) were included. Of these, seven studies   (640 patients) evaluated the laboratory-based α-defensin immunoassay   and three (119 patients) the lateral flow test. The pooled sensitivity   and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity of the qualitative α-defensin laboratory immunoassay   was 0.953 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87 to 0.984) and 0.965 (95%   CI 0.943 to 0.979) respectively. The pooled positive likelihood   ratio (PLR) and negative likelihood ratio (NLR) were 34.86 (95%   CI 19.34 to 62.85) and 0.02 (95% CI 0.00 to 0.11). The pooled sensitivity   and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity of the lateral flow test were 0.774 (95% CI 0.637   to 0.870) and 0.913 (95% CI 0.828 to 0.958), respectively. The pooled   PLR and NLR were 8.675 (95% CI 4.229 to 17.794) and 0.248 (95% CI   0.147 to 0.418), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The pooled sensitivity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity of the lateral flow test   were lower than those of the   α-defensin laboratory-based immunoassay test. Hence, care must be   taken with interpretation of the lateral flow test when relying   on its results for the intra-operative diagnosis of PJI.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:66–72.</p></sec>

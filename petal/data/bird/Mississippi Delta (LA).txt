Global extent of rivers and streams
<p>The turbulent surfaces of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">river</span></strong>s and streams are natural hotspots of biogeochemical exchange with the atmosphere. At the global scale, the total <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">river</span></strong>-atmosphere flux of trace gasses such as carbon dioxide depends on the proportion of Earth’s surface that is covered by the fluvial network, yet the total surface area of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">river</span></strong>s and streams is poorly constrained. We used a global database of planform <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">river</span></strong> hydromorphology and a statistical approach to show that global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">river</span></strong> and stream surface area at mean annual discharge is 773,000 ± 79,000 square kilometers (0.58 ± 0.06%) of Earth’s nonglaciated land surface, an area 44 ± 15% larger than previous spatial estimates. We found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">river</span></strong>s and streams likely play a greater role in controlling land-atmosphere fluxes than is currently represented in global carbon budgets.</p>

Designing river flows to improve food security futures in the Lower Mekong Basin
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">river</span></strong>s provide unrivaled opportunity for clean energy via hydropower, but little is known about the potential impact of dam-building on the food security these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">river</span></strong>s provide. In tropical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">river</span></strong>s, rainfall drives a periodic flood pulse fueling fish production and delivering nutrition to more than 150 million people worldwide. Hydropower will modulate this flood pulse, thereby threatening food security. We identified variance components of the Mekong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">river</span></strong> flood pulse that predict yield in one of the largest freshwater fisheries in the world. We used these variance components to design an algorithm for a managed hydrograph to explore future yields. This algorithm mimics attributes of discharge variance that drive fishery yield: prolonged low flows followed by a short flood pulse. Designed flows increased yield by a factor of 3.7 relative to historical hydrology. Managing desired components of discharge variance will lead to greater efficiency in the Lower Mekong Basin food system.</p>

Continental Diversification of an African Catfish Radiation (Mochokidae: <i>Synodontis</i>)
<p>Despite African <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">river</span></strong>s containing high species diversity, continental-scale studies investigating the mechanisms generating biological diversity of African <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">river</span></strong>ine faunas are limited compared with lacustrine systems. To investigate the build-up of diversity in a tropical aquatic continental radiation, we test different models of lineage diversification and reconstruct the biogeographic history in a species-rich siluriform genus, <i>Synodontis</i> (~130 species), with a broad distribution across all major tropical African drainage basins. The resulting robust species-level phylogeny (~60% complete, based on a multigene data set) exhibits a near constant rate of lineage accumulation throughout the mid-Cenozoic to recent, irrespective of missing species and despite the changing environmental conditions that were prevalent during this time period. This pattern contrasts with the findings for species-level diversification of large clades that commonly show an early burst of cladogenesis followed by declining rates through time. The identification of distinct biogeographic clades demonstrates a correlation between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">river</span></strong> hydrology and cladogenesis, although there is evidence of recent repeat dispersal into the southern range of the focal group. We conclude that diverse freshwater fish radiations with tropical continental distributions represent important organisms to test hypotheses of diversification and investigate the effects of palaeo-landscapes and climates on present day biodiversity.

Shifting habitat mosaics and fish production across river basins
<p>Watersheds are complex mosaics of habitats whose conditions vary across space and time as landscape features filter overriding climate forcing, yet the extent to which the reliability of ecosystem services depends on these dynamics remains unknown. We quantified how shifting habitat mosaics are expressed across a range of spatial scales within a large, free-flowing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">river</span></strong>, and how they stabilize the production of Pacific salmon that support valuable fisheries. The strontium isotope records of ear stones (otoliths) show that the relative productivity of locations across the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">river</span></strong> network, as both natal- and juvenile-rearing habitat, varies widely among years and that this variability is expressed across a broad range of spatial scales, ultimately stabilizing the interannual production of fish at the scale of the entire basin.</p>

Glacial lake outburst floods as drivers of fluvial erosion in the Himalaya
<p>Himalayan <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">river</span></strong>s are frequently hit by catastrophic floods that are caused by the failure of glacial lake and landslide dams; however, the dynamics and long-term impacts of such floods remain poorly understood. We present a comprehensive set of observations that capture the July 2016 glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) in the Bhotekoshi/Sunkoshi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">river</span></strong> of Nepal. Seismic records of the flood provide new insights into GLOF mechanics and their ability to mobilize large boulders that otherwise prevent channel erosion. Because of this boulder mobilization, GLOF impacts far exceed those of the annual summer monsoon, and GLOFs may dominate fluvial erosion and channel-hillslope coupling many tens of kilometers downstream of glaciated areas. Long-term valley evolution in these regions may therefore be driven by GLOF frequency and magnitude, rather than by precipitation.</p>

Changing climate shifts timing of European floods
<p>A warming climate is expected to have an impact on the magnitude and timing of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">river</span></strong> floods; however, no consistent large-scale climate change signal in observed flood magnitudes has been identified so far. We analyzed the timing of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">river</span></strong> floods in Europe over the past five decades, using a pan-European database from 4262 observational hydrometric stations, and found clear patterns of change in flood timing. Warmer temperatures have led to earlier spring snowmelt floods throughout northeastern Europe; delayed winter storms associated with polar warming have led to later winter floods around the North Sea and some sectors of the Mediterranean coast; and earlier soil moisture maxima have led to earlier winter floods in western Europe. Our results highlight the existence of a clear climate signal in flood observations at the continental scale.</p>

Volcanic tremor and plume height hysteresis from Pavlof Volcano, Alaska
<p>The March 2016 eruption of Pavlof Volcano, Alaska, produced an ash plume that caused the cancellation of more than 100 flights in North America. The eruption generated strong tremor that was recorded by seismic and remote low-frequency acoustic (infrasound) stations, including the EarthScope Transportable Array. The relationship between the tremor amplitudes and plume height changes considerably between the waxing and waning portions of the eruption. Similar hysteresis has been observed between seismic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">river</span></strong> noise and discharge during storms, suggesting that flow and erosional processes in both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">river</span></strong>s and volcanoes can produce irreversible structural changes that are detectable in geophysical data. We propose that the time-varying relationship at Pavlof arose from changes in the tremor source related to volcanic vent erosion. This relationship may improve estimates of volcanic emissions and characterization of eruption size and intensity.</p>

Ceramic-on-ceramic bearing fractures in total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Ceramic-on-ceramic (CoC) bearings in total hip arthroplasty (THA)   are commonly used, but concerns exist regarding ceramic fracture.   This study aims to report the risk of revision for fracture of modern   CoC bearings and identify factors that might influence this risk,   using data from the National Joint Registry (NJR) for England, Wales, Northern   Ireland and the Isle of Man.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We analysed data on 223 362 bearings from 111 681 primary CoC   THAs and 182 linked revisions for bearing fracture recorded in the   NJR. We used implant codes to identify ceramic bearing composition   and generated Kaplan-Meier estimates for implant survivorship. Logistic   regression analyses were performed for implant size and patient specific   variables to determine any associated risks for revision.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 222 852 bearings (99.8%) were CeramTec Biolox products.   Revisions for fracture were linked to seven of 79 442 (0.009%) Biolox   Delta heads, 38 of 31 982 (0.119%) Biolox Forte heads, 101 of 80   170 (0.126%) Biolox Delta liners and 35 of 31 258 (0.112%) Biolox   Forte liners. Regression analysis of implant size revealed smaller   heads had significantly higher odds of fracture (chi-squared 68.0,   p < 0.001). The highest fracture risk was observed in the 28 mm   Biolox Forte subgroup (0.382%). There were no fractures in the 40   mm head group for either ceramic type. Liner thickness was not predictive   of fracture (p = 0.67). Body mass index (BMI) was independently   associated with revision for both head fractures (odds ratio (OR)   1.09 per unit increase, p = 0.031) and liner fractures (OR 1.06   per unit increase, p = 0.006). </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We report the largest independent study of CoC bearing fractures   to date. The risk of revision for CoC bearing fracture is very low   but previous studies have underestimated this risk. There is good   evidence that the latest generation of ceramic has greatly reduced   the odds of head fracture but not of liner fracture. Small head   size and high patient BMI are associated with an increased risk   of ceramic bearing fracture.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1012–19.</p></sec>

Development
An extracellular region of Serrate is essential for ligand-induced cis-inhibition of Notch signaling
<p>Cell-to-cell communication via the Notch pathway is mediated between the membrane-bound Notch receptor and either of its canonical membrane-bound ligands Delta or Serrate. Notch ligands mediate receptor transactivation between cells and also mediate receptor cis-inhibition when Notch and ligand are co-expressed on the same cell. We demonstrate in <i>Drosophila</i> that removal of any of the EGF-like repeats (ELRs) 4, 5 or 6 results in a Serrate molecule capable of transactivating Notch but exhibiting little or no Notch cis-inhibition capacity. These forms of Serrate require Epsin (Liquid facets) to transduce a signal, suggesting that ELR 4-6-deficient ligands still require endocytosis for Notch activation. We also demonstrate that ELRs 4-6 are responsible for the dominant-negative effects of Serrate ligand forms that lack the intracellular domain and are therefore incapable of endocytosis in the ligand-expressing cell. We find that ELRs 4-6 of Serrate are conserved across species but do not appear to be conserved in Delta homologs.</p>

Inhibition of Endothelial Notch Signaling Impairs Fatty Acid Transport and Leads to Metabolic and Vascular Remodeling of the Adult Heart
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Nutrients are transported through endothelial cells before being metabolized in muscle cells. However, little is known about the regulation of endothelial transport processes. Notch signaling is a critical regulator of metabolism and angiogenesis during development. Here, we studied how genetic and pharmacological manipulation of endothelial Notch signaling in adult mice affects endothelial fatty acid transport, cardiac angiogenesis, and heart function.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Endothelial-specific Notch inhibition was achieved by conditional genetic inactivation of Rbp-jκ in adult mice to analyze fatty acid metabolism and heart function. Wild-type mice were treated with neutralizing antibodies against the Notch ligand Delta-like 4. Fatty acid transport was studied in cultured endothelial cells and transgenic mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Treatment of wild-type mice with Delta-like 4 neutralizing antibodies for 8 weeks impaired fractional shortening and ejection fraction in the majority of mice. Inhibition of Notch signaling specifically in the endothelium of adult mice by genetic ablation of Rbp-jκ caused heart hypertrophy and failure. Impaired heart function was preceded by alterations in fatty acid metabolism and an increase in cardiac blood vessel density. Endothelial Notch signaling controlled the expression of endothelial lipase, Angptl4, CD36, and Fabp4, which are all needed for fatty acid transport across the vessel wall. In endothelial-specific Rbp-jκ–mutant mice, lipase activity and transendothelial transport of long-chain fatty acids to muscle cells were impaired. In turn, lipids accumulated in the plasma and liver. The attenuated supply of cardiomyocytes with long-chain fatty acids was accompanied by higher glucose uptake, increased concentration of glycolysis intermediates, and mTOR-S6K signaling. Treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin or displacing glucose as cardiac substrate by feeding a ketogenic diet prolonged the survival of endothelial-specific Rbp-jκ–deficient mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This study identifies Notch signaling as a novel regulator of fatty acid transport across the endothelium and as an essential repressor of angiogenesis in the adult heart. The data imply that the endothelium controls cardiomyocyte metabolism and function.</p></sec>

Gall induction may benefit host plant: a case of a gall wasp and eucalyptus tree
<p>Gall-inducing insects display intimate interactions with their host plants, usually described as parasitic relationships; the galls seem to favor the galler alone. We report on a case in which the presence of the galls induced by <i>Leptocybe invasa</i> Fisher & LaSalle (Hymenoptera; Eulophidae) benefit its host plant, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">river</span></strong> red gum <i>Eucalyptus camaldulensis</i> Dehnh. Field observations showed that <i>E. camaldulensis</i> plants infected by this gall wasp were less susceptible to cold injury than neighboring conspecific plants without galls. In the laboratory, frost resistance was compared between galled and non-galled plants which were both divided into two subgroups: cold-acclimated plants and plants that were non-acclimated. Galled plants displayed higher frost resistance than the non-galled ones, and the differences were higher in non-acclimated plants compared with acclimated ones. Physiological changes in host plant were determined by chemical analyses of chlorophylls, proteins, soluble sugars and anthocyanin contents. The results showed higher values of all physiological parameters in the galled plants, supporting the hypothesis that the presence of the gall wasp induces physiological changes on the plant foliage, which may in turn increase plant defense mechanisms against cold. Therefore, the toll of galling by the herbivore may pay off by the host plant acquiring increased frost resistance. This work provides evidence for physiological changes induced by a herbivore which might have a positive indirect effect on the host plant, promoting frost resistance such as cold acclimation.</p>

Paleo-Drainage Basin Connectivity Predicts Evolutionary Relationships across Three Southeast Asian Biodiversity Hotspots
<p>Understanding factors driving diversity across biodiversity hotspots is critical for formulating conservation priorities in the face of ongoing and escalating environmental deterioration. While biodiversity hotspots encompass a small fraction of Earth's land surface, more than half the world's plants and two-thirds of terrestrial vertebrate species are endemic to these hotspots. Tropical Southeast (SE) Asia displays extraordinary species richness, encompassing four biodiversity hotspots, though disentangling multiple potential d<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">river</span></strong>s of species richness is confounded by the region's dynamic geological and climatic history. Here, we use multilocus molecular genetic data from dense multispecies sampling of freshwater fishes across three biodiversity hotspots, to test the effect of Quaternary climate change and resulting drainage rearrangements on aquatic faunal diversification. While Cenozoic geological processes have clearly shaped evolutionary history in SE Asian halfbeak fishes, we show that paleo-drainage re-arrangements resulting from Quaternary climate change played a significant role in the spatiotemporal evolution of lowland aquatic taxa, and provide priorities for conservation efforts.

Hybridization may give some parasites a leg up
<p>Infecting an estimated 230 million people, schistosomiasis is the world's most widespread parasitic disease after malaria. But temperate latitudes were thought to be spared, until researchers documented an outbreak on the French island of Corsica in 2014. Scientists found that a local freshwater snail was serving as the intermediate host that's essential to the flatworms' complicated life cycle. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">river</span></strong> is still infested: At least 120 people have become infected. And the disease is turning up elsewhere on Corsica. The culprit is no ordinary schistosome parasite, but a hybrid of two separate species that appears to be better than both parent species at infecting both the snails and its unfortunate mammalian hosts. Such hybrids, discovered in other parasitic species as well, could widen a parasite's range of host mammals, complicating efforts to control it.</p>

Legacy nitrogen may prevent achievement of water quality goals in the Gulf of Mexico
<p>In August 2017, the Gulf of Mexico’s hypoxic zone was declared to be the largest ever measured. It has been estimated that a 60% decrease in watershed nitrogen (N) loading may be necessary to adequately reduce eutrophication in the Gulf. However, to date there has been no rigorous assessment of the effect of N legacies on achieving water quality goals. In this study, we show that even if agricultural N use became 100% efficient, it would take decades to meet target N loads due to legacy N within the Mississippi River basin. Our results suggest that both long-term commitment and large-scale changes in agricultural management practices will be necessary to decrease Mississippi N loads and to meet current goals for reducing the size of the Gulf hypoxic zone.</p>

Factoring stream turbulence into global assessments of nitrogen pollution
<p>The discharge of excess nitrogen to streams and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">river</span></strong>s poses an existential threat to both humans and ecosystems. A seminal study of headwater streams across the United States concluded that in-stream removal of nitrate is controlled primarily by stream chemistry and biology. Reanalysis of these data reveals that stream turbulence (in particular, turbulent mass transfer across the concentration boundary layer) imposes a previously unrecognized upper limit on the rate at which nitrate is removed from streams. The upper limit closely approximates measured nitrate removal rates in streams with low concentrations of this pollutant, a discovery that should inform stream restoration designs and efforts to assess the effects of nitrogen pollution on receiving water quality and the global nitrogen cycle.</p>

Redox stratification of an ancient lake in Gale crater, Mars

Geological reconstructions from Curiosity rover data have revealed an ancient, habitable lake environment fed by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">river</span></strong>s draining into the crater. We synthesize geochemical and mineralogical data from lake-bed mudstones collected during the first 1300 martian solar days of rover operations in Gale. We present evidence for lake redox stratification, established by depth-dependent variations in atmospheric oxidant and dissolved-solute concentrations. Paleoclimate proxy data indicate that a transition from colder to warmer climate conditions is preserved in the stratigraphy. Finally, a late phase of geochemical modification by saline fluids is recognized.</p>

Global drainage patterns and the origins of topographic relief on Earth, Mars, and Titan
<p>Rivers have eroded the topography of Mars, Titan, and Earth, creating diverse landscapes. However, the dominant processes that generated topography on Titan (and to some extent on early Mars) are not well known. We analyzed drainage patterns on all three bodies and found that large drainages, which record interactions between deformation and erosional modification, conform much better to long-wavelength topography on Titan and Mars than on Earth. We use a numerical landscape evolution model to demonstrate that short-wavelength deformation causes drainage directions to diverge from long-wavelength topography, as observed on Earth. We attribute the observed differences to ancient long-wavelength topography on Mars, recent or ongoing generation of long-wavelength relief on Titan, and the creation of short-wavelength relief by plate tectonics on Earth.</p>

Self-organized Notch dynamics generate stereotyped sensory organ patterns in <i>Drosophila</i>
<p>The emergence of spatial patterns in developing multicellular organisms relies on positional cues and cell-cell communication. <i>Drosophila</i> sensory organs have informed a paradigm in which these operate in two distinct steps: Prepattern factors drive localized proneural activity, then Notch-mediated lateral inhibition singles out neural precursors. Here we show that self-organization through Notch signaling also establishes the proneural stripes that resolve into rows of sensory bristles on the fly thorax. Patterning, initiated by a gradient of Delta ligand expression, progresses through inhibitory signaling between and within stripes. Thus, Notch signaling can support self-organized tissue patterning as a prepattern is transduced by cell-cell interactions into a refined arrangement of cellular fates.</p>

Notch-Jagged complex structure implicates a catch bond in tuning ligand sensitivity
<p>Notch receptor activation initiates cell fate decisions and is distinctive in its reliance on mechanical force and protein glycosylation. The 2.5-angstrom-resolution crystal structure of the extracellular interacting region of Notch1 complexed with an engineered, high-affinity variant of Jagged1 (Jag1) reveals a binding interface that extends ~120 angstroms along five consecutive domains of each protein. <i>O</i>-Linked fucose modifications on Notch1 epidermal growth factor–like (EGF) domains 8 and 12 engage the EGF3 and C2 domains of Jag1, respectively, and different Notch1 domains are favored in binding to Jag1 than those that bind to the Delta-like 4 ligand. Jag1 undergoes conformational changes upon Notch binding, exhibiting catch bond behavior that prolongs interactions in the range of forces required for Notch activation. This mechanism enables cellular forces to regulate binding, discriminate among Notch ligands, and potentiate Notch signaling.</p>

Ligand-dependent Notch signaling strength orchestrates lateral induction and lateral inhibition in the developing inner ear
<p>During inner ear development, Notch exhibits two modes of operation: lateral induction, which is associated with prosensory specification, and lateral inhibition, which is involved in hair cell determination. These mechanisms depend respectively on two different ligands, jagged 1 (Jag1) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">delta</span></strong> 1 (Dl1), that rely on a common signaling cascade initiated after Notch activation. In the chicken otocyst, expression of Jag1 and the Notch target Hey1 correlates well with lateral induction, whereas both Jag1 and Dl1 are expressed during lateral inhibition, as are Notch targets Hey1 and Hes5. Here, we show that Jag1 drives lower levels of Notch activity than Dl1, which results in the differential expression of Hey1 and Hes5. In addition, Jag1 interferes with the ability of Dl1 to elicit high levels of Notch activity. Modeling the sensory epithelium when the two ligands are expressed together shows that ligand regulation, differential signaling strength and ligand competition are crucial to allow the two modes of operation and for establishing the alternate pattern of hair cells and supporting cells. Jag1, while driving lateral induction on its own, facilitates patterning by lateral inhibition in the presence of Dl1. This novel behavior emerges from Jag1 acting as a competitive inhibitor of Dl1 for Notch signaling. Both modeling and experiments show that hair cell patterning is very robust. The model suggests that autoactivation of proneural factor Atoh1, upstream of Dl1, is a fundamental component for robustness. The results stress the importance of the levels of Notch signaling and ligand competition for Notch function.</p>

Sara endosomes and the asymmetric division of intestinal stem cells
<p>Tissue homeostasis is maintained by adult stem cells, which self-renew and give rise to differentiating cells. The generation of daughter cells with different fates is mediated by signalling molecules coming from an external niche or being asymmetrically dispatched between the two daughters upon stem cell mitosis. In the adult <i>Drosophila</i> midgut, the intestinal stem cell (ISC) divides to generate a new ISC and an enteroblast (EB) differentiating daughter. Notch signalling activity restricted to the EB regulates intestinal cell fate decision. Here, we show that ISCs divide asymmetrically, and Sara endosomes in ISCs are specifically dispatched to the presumptive EB. During ISC mitosis, Notch and Delta traffic through Sara endosomes, thereby contributing to Notch signalling bias, as revealed in Sara mutants: Sara itself contributes to the control of the ISC asymmetric division. Our data uncover an intrinsic endosomal mechanism during ISC mitosis, which participates in the maintenance of the adult intestinal lineage.</p>

Programmable protein circuits in living cells
<p>Synthetic protein-level <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s could enable engineering of powerful new cellular behaviors. Rational protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> design would be facilitated by a composable protein-protein regulation system in which individual protein components can regulate one another to create a variety of different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> architectures. In this study, we show that engineered viral proteases can function as composable protein components, which can together implement a broad variety of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>-level functions in mammalian cells. In this system, termed CHOMP (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s of hacked orthogonal modular proteases), input proteases dock with and cleave target proteases to inhibit their function. These components can be connected to generate regulatory cascades, binary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">logic</span></strong> gates, and dynamic analog signal-processing functions. To demonstrate the utility of this system, we rationally designed a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> that induces cell death in response to upstream activators of the Ras oncogene. Because CHOMP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s can perform complex functions yet be encoded as single transcripts and delivered without genomic integration, they offer a scalable platform to facilitate protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> engineering for biotechno<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">logic</span></strong>al applications.</p>

A neural algorithm for a fundamental computing problem
<p>Similarity search—for example, identifying similar images in a database or similar documents on the web—is a fundamental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>ing problem faced by large-scale information retrieval systems. We discovered that the fruit fly olfactory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> solves this problem with a variant of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>er science algorithm (called locality-sensitive hashing). The fly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> assigns similar neural activity patterns to similar odors, so that behaviors learned from one odor can be applied when a similar odor is experienced. The fly algorithm, however, uses three <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>ational strategies that depart from traditional approaches. These strategies can be translated to improve the performance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>ational similarity searches. This perspective helps illuminate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">logic</span></strong> supporting an important sensory function and provides a conceptually new algorithm for solving a fundamental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>ational problem.</p>

Complex signal processing in synthetic gene circuits using cooperative regulatory assemblies
<p>Eukaryotic genes are regulated by multivalent transcription factor complexes. Through cooperative self-assembly, these complexes perform nonlinear regulatory operations involved in cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decis</span></strong>ion-making and signal processing. In this study, we apply this design principle to synthetic networks, testing whether engineered cooperative assemblies can program nonlinear gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> behavior in yeast. Using a model-guided approach, we show that specifying the strength and number of assembly subunits enables predictive tuning between linear and nonlinear regulatory responses for single- and multi-input <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s. We demonstrate that assemblies can be adjusted to control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> dynamics. We harness this capability to engineer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s that perform dynamic filtering, enabling frequency-dependent decoding in cell populations. Programmable cooperative assembly provides a versatile way to tune the nonlinearity of network connections, markedly expanding the engineerable behaviors available to synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s.</p>

Using neuroscience to develop artificial intelligence
<p>When the mathematician Alan Turing posed the question “Can machines think?” in the first line of his seminal 1950 paper that ushered in the quest for artificial intelligence (AI) (<i>1</i>), the only known systems carrying out complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>ations were bio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">logic</span></strong>al nervous systems. It is not surprising, therefore, that scientists in the nascent field of AI turned to brain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s as a source for guidance. One path that was taken since the early attempts to perform intelligent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>ation by brain-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s (<i>2</i>), and which led recently to remarkable successes, can be described as a highly reductionist approach to model cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>ry. In its basic current form, known as a “deep network” (or deep net) architecture, this brain-inspired model is built from successive layers of neuron-like elements, connected by adjustable weights, called “synapses” after their bio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">logic</span></strong>al counterparts (<i>3</i>). The application of deep nets and related methods to AI systems has been transformative. They proved superior to previously known methods in central areas of AI research, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>er vision, speech recognition and production, and playing complex games. Practical applications are already in broad use, in areas such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>er vision and speech and text translation, and large-scale efforts are under way in many other areas. Here, I discuss how additional aspects of brain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>ry could supply cues for guiding network models toward broader aspects of cognition and general AI.</p>

An Evidence-Based Medicine Approach to Antihyperglycemic Therapy in Diabetes Mellitus to Overcome Overtreatment
<p>Overtreatment is pervasive in medicine and leads to potential patient harms and excessive costs in health care. Although evidence-based medicine is often derided as practice by rote algorithmic medicine, the appropriate application of key evidence-based medicine principles in clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decis</span></strong>ion making is fundamental to preventing overtreatment and promoting high-value, individualized patient-centered care. Specifically, this article discusses the importance of (1) using absolute rather than relative estimates of benefits to inform treatment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decis</span></strong>ions; (2) considering the time horizon to benefit of treatments; (3) balancing potential harms and benefits; and (4) using shared <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decis</span></strong>ion making by physicians to incorporate the patient’s values and preferences into treatment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decis</span></strong>ions. Here, we illustrate the application of these principles to considering the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decis</span></strong>ion of whether or not to recommend intensive glycemic control to patients to minimize microvascular and cardiovascular complications in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Through this lens, this example will illustrate how an evidence-based medicine approach can be used to individualize glycemic goals and prevent overtreatment, and can serve as a template for applying evidence-based medicine to inform treatment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decis</span></strong>ions for other conditions to optimize health and individualize patient care.</p>

Cellular checkpoint control using programmable sequential logic
<p>Bio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">logic</span></strong>al processes that require orderly progression, such as growth and differentiation, proceed via regulatory checkpoints where the cell waits for signals before continuing to the next state. Implementing such control would allow genetic engineers to divide complex tasks into stages. We present genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s that encode sequential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">logic</span></strong> to instruct <i>Escherichia coli</i> to proceed through a linear or cyclical sequence of states. These are built with 11 set-reset latches, designed with repressor-based NOR gates, which can connect to each other and sensors. The performance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s with up to three latches and four sensors, including a gated D latch, closely match predictions made by using nonlinear dynamics. Checkpoint control is demonstrated by switching cells between multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> states in response to external signals over days.</p>

Shouldering responsibility
<p>A key element of leadership is the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decis</span></strong>ion to shoulder responsibility for the welfare of others, whether they are one's family, a political party, or, as with heads of state, the entire country. In animal groups such as fish shoals or bird flocks, leadership may passively result from simple coordination principles (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). By contrast, human leaders often actively make <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decis</span></strong>ions on behalf of others. Although previous work has identified factors that predict those who will end up as leaders (<i>3</i>), it remains unclear how leaders decide to shoulder responsibility. On page 467 of this issue, Edelson <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) provide further understanding on the psycho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">logic</span></strong>al and neural processes engaged when someone decides to lead.

Fault-tolerant detection of a quantum error
<p>A critical component of any quantum error–correcting scheme is detection of errors by using an ancilla system. However, errors occurring in the ancilla can propagate onto the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">logic</span></strong>al qubit, irreversibly corrupting the encoded information. We demonstrate a fault-tolerant error-detection scheme that suppresses spreading of ancilla errors by a factor of 5, while maintaining the assignment fidelity. The same method is used to prevent propagation of ancilla excitations, increasing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">logic</span></strong>al qubit dephasing time by an order of magnitude. Our approach is hardware-efficient, as it uses a single multilevel transmon ancilla and a cavity-encoded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">logic</span></strong>al qubit, whose interaction is engineered in situ by using an off-resonant sideband drive. The results demonstrate that hardware-efficient approaches that exploit system-specific error models can yield advances toward fault-tolerant quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>ation.</p>

Sensitivity to “sunk costs” in mice, rats, and humans
<p>Sunk costs are irrecoverable investments that should not influence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decis</span></strong>ions, because <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decis</span></strong>ions should be made on the basis of expected future consequences. Both human and nonhuman animals can show sensitivity to sunk costs, but reports from across species are inconsistent. In a temporal context, a sensitivity to sunk costs arises when an individual resists ending an activity, even if it seems unproductive, because of the time already invested. In two parallel foraging tasks that we designed, we found that mice, rats, and humans show similar sensitivities to sunk costs in their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decis</span></strong>ion-making. Unexpectedly, sensitivity to time invested accrued only after an initial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decis</span></strong>ion had been made. These findings suggest that sensitivity to temporal sunk costs lies in a vulnerability distinct from deliberation processes and that this distinction is present across species.</p>

Precursors of logical reasoning in preverbal human infants
<p>Infants are able to entertain hypotheses about complex events and to modify them rationally when faced with inconsistent evidence. These capacities suggest that infants can use elementary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">logic</span></strong>al representations to frame and prune hypotheses. By presenting scenes containing ambiguities about the identity of an object, here we show that 12- and 19-month-old infants look longer at outcomes that are inconsistent with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">logic</span></strong>al inference necessary to resolve such ambiguities. At the moment of a potential deduction, infants’ pupils dilated, and their eyes moved toward the ambiguous object when inferences could be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>ed, in contrast to transparent scenes not requiring inferences to identify the object. These oculomotor markers resembled those of adults inspecting similar scenes, suggesting that intuitive and stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">logic</span></strong>al structures involved in the interpretation of dynamic scenes may be part of the fabric of the human mind.</p>

FoxP influences the speed and accuracy of a perceptual decision in <i>Drosophila</i>
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decis</span></strong>ions take time if information gradually accumulates to a response threshold, but the neural mechanisms of integration and thresholding are unknown. We characterized a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decis</span></strong>ion process in <i>Drosophila</i> that bears the behavioral signature of evidence accumulation. As stimulus contrast in trained odor discriminations decreased, reaction times increased and perceptual accuracy declined, in quantitative agreement with a drift-diffusion model. <i>FoxP</i> mutants took longer than wild-type flies to form <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decis</span></strong>ions of similar or reduced accuracy, especially in difficult, low-contrast tasks. RNA interference with <i>FoxP</i> expression in αβ core Kenyon cells, or the overexpression of a potassium conductance in these neurons, recapitulated the <i>FoxP</i> mutant phenotype.

Spatially structured cell populations process multiple sensory signals in parallel in intact vascular endothelium
<p>Blood flow, blood clotting, angiogenesis, vascular permeability, and vascular remodeling are each controlled by a large number of variable, noisy, and interacting chemical inputs to the vascular endothelium. The endothelium processes the entirety of the chemical composition to which the cardiovascular system is exposed, carrying out sophisticated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>ations that determine physio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">logic</span></strong>al output. Processing this enormous quantity of information is a major challenge facing the endothelium. We analyzed the responses of hundreds of endothelial cells to carbachol (CCh) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and found that the endothelium segregates the responses to these two distinct components of the chemical environment into separate streams of complementary information that are processed in parallel. Sensitivities to CCh and ATP mapped to different clusters of cells, and each agonist generated distinct signal patterns. The distinct signals were features of agonist activation rather than properties of the cells themselves. When there was more than one stimulus present, the cells communicated and combined inputs to generate new distinct signals that were nonlinear combinations of the inputs. Our results demonstrate that the endothelium is a structured, collaborative sensory network that simplifies the complex environment using separate cell clusters that are sensitive to distinct aspects of the overall biochemical environment and interactively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>e signals from diverse but interrelated chemical inputs. These features enable the endothelium to selectively process separate signals and perform multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>ations in an environment that is noisy and variable.</p>

Modeling chemotherapy-induced stress to identify rational combination therapies in the DNA damage response pathway
<p>Cells respond to DNA damage by activating complex signaling networks that decide cell fate, promoting not only DNA damage repair and survival but also cell death.

The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>ational model was trained and calibrated on extensive data from U2OS osteosarcoma cells, including the cell cycle distribution of the initial cell population, signaling data measured by Western blotting, and cell fate data in response to chemotherapy treatment measured by time-lapse microscopy.

A blueprint for demonstrating quantum supremacy with superconducting qubits

The measured probabilities obey a universal distribution, consistent with uniformly sampling the full Hilbert space. As the number of qubits increases, the system continues to explore the exponentially growing number of states. Extending these results to a system of 50 qubits has the potential to address scientific questions that are beyond the capabilities of any classical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>er.</p>

Glia put visual map in sync
<p>Watching a fireworks display is a breathtaking experience.

This testament to high-acuity vision necessitates the development of neural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s that map visual space. To generate this retinotopy (visual mapping), neurons must differentiate and connect to their synaptic targets with both spatial and temporal precision. How is this achieved? The molecules that regulate neuronal differentiation have been described in detail, as have the cues that allow differentiated neurons to reach and choose their synaptic partners (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). However, the mechanisms that coordinate neuronal specification with the development of retinotopic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> wiring have remained elusive.

Global analysis of protein folding using massively parallel design, synthesis, and testing
<p>Proteins fold into unique native structures stabilized by thousands of weak interactions that collectively overcome the entropic cost of folding. Although these forces are “encoded” in the thousands of known protein structures, “decoding” them is challenging because of the complexity of natural proteins that have evolved for function, not stability. We combined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>ational protein design, next-generation gene synthesis, and a high-throughput protease susceptibility assay to measure folding and stability for more than 15,000 de novo designed miniproteins, 1000 natural proteins, 10,000 point mutants, and 30,000 negative control sequences. This analysis identified more than 2500 stable designed proteins in four basic folds—a number sufficient to enable us to systematically examine how sequence determines folding and stability in uncharted protein space. Iteration between design and experiment increased the design success rate from 6% to 47%, produced stable proteins unlike those found in nature for topologies where design was initially unsuccessful, and revealed subtle contributions to stability as designs became increasingly optimized. Our approach achieves the long-standing goal of a tight feedback cycle between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>ation and experiment and has the potential to transform <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>ational protein design into a data-driven science.</p>

History of winning remodels thalamo-PFC circuit to reinforce social dominance

In vivo optogenetic-based long-term potentiation and depression experiments establish that the mediodorsal thalamic input to the dmPFC mediates long-lasting changes in the social dominance status that are affected by history of winning.

Branch-specific plasticity of a bifunctional dopamine circuit encodes protein hunger

The activity of these neurons increased after substantial protein deprivation. Activation of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> simultaneously promoted protein intake and restricted sugar consumption, via signaling to distinct downstream neurons. Protein starvation triggered branch-specific plastic changes in these dopaminergic neurons, thus enabling sustained protein consumption.

Plasticity in the Neurotransmitter Repertoire
<p>In the earliest days of neuroscience, it was thought that a neuron made and released only a single chemical, known as a neurotransmitter, to send a signal across a synapse to an adjacent neuron (<i>1</i>). At the same time, it was deeply mysterious why so many signaling molecules were used in nervous systems. Subsequently, it became clear that many, if not most, neurons (including those in mammals) make and release two or more neurotransmitters including small-molecules and neuropeptides (<i>2</i>–<i>4</i>). As the list of these potential cotransmitters and their receptors has increased, we are faced with understanding the functional relevance of this embarrassment of riches for neural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s and behavior. Neurotransmitters and neuromodulators (substances often released with small-molecule neurotransmitters) can elicit a variety of different actions on their neuron targets, including directly opening ion channels or acting through signal transduction pathways to alter neuronal excitability or synaptic transmission. Thus, characterizing the mixture of cotransmitters released by a neuron is important for understanding how neuronal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s operate. The mechanisms that change the profile of neurotransmitter release provide opportunities for plastic changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> function, and consequently in organism behavior. On page 449 of this issue, Dulcis <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) report changes in the neurotransmitter profile of neurons that underlie photoperiod-triggered changes in animal behavior. The findings argue that neurotransmitter switching is a new mechanism for neuroplasticity (<i>6</i>) in adult nervous systems.</p>

Moving without a purpose: an experimental study of swarm guidance in the Western honey bee, <i>Apis mellifera</i>
<p>During reproductive swarming, honey bee scouts perform two very important functions. Firstly, they find new nesting locations and return to the swarm cluster to communicate their discoveries. Secondly, once the swarm is ready to depart, informed scout bees act as guides, leading the swarm to its final destination. We have previously hypothesised that the two processes, selecting a new nest site and swarm guidance, are tightly linked in honey bees. When swarms can be <i>laissez faire</i> about where they nest, reaching directional consensus prior to lift off seems unnecessary. If, in contrast, it is essential that the swarm reaches a precise location, either directional consensus must be near unanimous prior to swarm departure or only a select subgroup of the scouts guide the swarm. Here, we tested experimentally whether directional consensus is necessary for the successful guidance of swarms of the Western honey bee <i>Apis mellifera</i> by forcing swarms into the air prior to the completion of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decis</span></strong>ion-making process. Our results show that swarms were unable to guide themselves prior to the swarm reaching the pre-flight buzzing phase of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decis</span></strong>ion-making process, even when directional consensus was high. We therefore suggest that not all scouts involved in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decis</span></strong>ion-making process attempt to guide the swarm.</p>

<sec><title>Aims</title><p>This paper describes the methodology, validation and reliability   of a new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>er-assisted method which uses models of the patient’s   bones and the components to measure their migration and polyethylene   wear from radiographs after total hip arthroplasty (THA).</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Models of the patient’s acetabular and femoral component obtained   from the manufacturer and models of the patient’s pelvis and femur   built from a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>ed tomography (CT) scan, are used by a   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>er program to measure the migration of the components and   the penetration of the femoral head from anteroposterior and lateral radiographs   taken at follow-up visits. The program simulates the radiographic   setup and matches the position and orientation of the models to   outlines of the pelvis, the acetabular and femoral component, and   femur on radiographs. Changes in position and orientation reflect   the migration of the components and the penetration of the femoral   head. Validation was performed using radiographs of phantoms simulating   known migration and penetration, and the clinical feasibility of   measuring migration was assessed in two patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Migration of the acetabular and femoral components can be measured   with limits of agreement (LOA) of 0.37 mm and 0.33 mm, respectively.

Glia relay differentiation cues to coordinate neuronal development in <i>Drosophila</i>
<p>Neuronal birth and specification must be coordinated across the developing brain to generate the neurons that constitute neural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s. We used the <i>Drosophila</i> visual system to investigate how development is coordinated to establish retinotopy, a feature of all visual systems. Photoreceptors achieve retinotopy by inducing their target field in the optic lobe, the lamina neurons, with a secreted differentiation cue, epidermal growth factor (EGF). We find that communication between photoreceptors and lamina cells requires a signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">relay</span></strong> through glia. In response to photoreceptor-EGF, glia produce insulin-like peptides, which induce lamina neuronal differentiation. Our study identifies a role for glia in coordinating neuronal development across distinct brain regions, thus reconciling the timing of column assembly with that of delayed differentiation, as well as the spatiotemporal pattern of lamina neuron differentiation.</p>

A central neural circuit for itch sensation
<p>Although itch sensation is an important protective mechanism for animals, chronic itch remains a challenging clinical problem. Itch processing has been studied extensively at the spinal level. However, how itch information is transmitted to the brain and what central <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s underlie the itch-induced scratching behavior remain largely unknown. We found that the spinoparabrachial pathway was activated during itch processing and that optogenetic suppression of this pathway impaired itch-induced scratching behaviors. Itch-mediating spinal neurons, which express the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor, are disynaptically connected to the parabrachial nucleus via glutamatergic spinal projection neurons. Blockade of synaptic output of glutamatergic neurons in the parabrachial nucleus suppressed pruritogen-induced scratching behavior. Thus, our studies reveal a central neural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> that is critical for itch signal processing.</p>

Pavlovian conditioning–induced hallucinations result from overweighting of perceptual priors
<p>Some people hear voices that others do not, but only some of those people seek treatment. Using a Pavlovian learning task, we induced conditioned hallucinations in four groups of people who differed orthogonally in their voice-hearing and treatment-seeking statuses. People who hear voices were significantly more susceptible to the effect. Using functional neuroimaging and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>ational modeling of perception, we identified processes that differentiated voice-hearers from non–voice-hearers and treatment-seekers from non–treatment-seekers and characterized a brain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> that mediated the conditioned hallucinations. These data demonstrate the profound and sometimes patho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">logic</span></strong>al impact of top-down cognitive processes on perception and may represent an objective means to discern people with a need for treatment from those without.</p>

Reconfiguration of DNA molecular arrays driven by information relay
<p>Information <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">relay</span></strong> at the molecular level is an essential phenomenon in numerous chemical and bio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">logic</span></strong>al processes, such as intricate signaling cascades. One key challenge in synthetic molecular self-assembly is to construct artificial structures that imitate these complex behaviors in controllable systems. We demonstrated prescribed, long-range information <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">relay</span></strong> in an artificial molecular array assembled from modular DNA structural units. The dynamic DNA molecular array exhibits transformations with programmable initiation, propagation, and regulation. The transformation of the array can be initiated at selected units and then propagated, without addition of extra triggers, to neighboring units and eventually the entire array. The specific information pathways by which this transformation occurs can be controlled by altering the design of individual units and the arrays.</p>

Iodide management in formamidinium-lead-halide–based perovskite layers for efficient solar cells
<p>The formation of a dense and uniform thin layer on the substrates is crucial for the fabrication of high-performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs) containing formamidinium with multiple cations and mixed halide anions. The concentration of defect states, which reduce a cell’s performance by decreasing the open-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> voltage and short-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> current density, needs to be as low as possible. We show that the introduction of additional iodide ions into the organic cation solution, which are used to form the perovskite layers through an intramolecular exchanging process, decreases the concentration of deep-level defects. The defect-engineered thin perovskite layers enable the fabrication of PSCs with a certified power conversion efficiency of 22.1% in small cells and 19.7% in 1-square-centimeter cells.</p>

DeepStack: Expert-level artificial intelligence in heads-up no-limit poker
<p>Artificial intelligence has seen several breakthroughs in recent years, with games often serving as milestones. A common feature of these games is that players have perfect information. Poker, the quintessential game of imperfect information, is a long-standing challenge problem in artificial intelligence. We introduce DeepStack, an algorithm for imperfect-information settings. It combines recursive reasoning to handle information asymmetry, decomposition to focus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>ation on the relevant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decis</span></strong>ion, and a form of intuition that is automatically learned from self-play using deep learning. In a study involving 44,000 hands of poker, DeepStack defeated, with statistical significance, professional poker players in heads-up no-limit Texas hold’em. The approach is theoretically sound and is shown to produce strategies that are more difficult to exploit than prior approaches.</p>

Engrams and circuits crucial for systems consolidation of a memory
<p>Episodic memories initially require rapid synaptic plasticity within the hippocampus for their formation and are gradually consolidated in neocortical networks for permanent storage. However, the engrams and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s that support neocortical memory consolidation have thus far been unknown. We found that neocortical prefrontal memory engram cells, which are critical for remote contextual fear memory, were rapidly generated during initial learning through inputs from both the hippocampal–entorhinal cortex network and the basolateral amygdala. After their generation, the prefrontal engram cells, with support from hippocampal memory engram cells, became functionally mature with time. Whereas hippocampal engram cells gradually became silent with time, engram cells in the basolateral amygdala, which were necessary for fear memory, were maintained. Our data provide new insights into the functional reorganization of engrams and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s underlying systems consolidation of memory.</p>

Dynamics of cortical dendritic membrane potential and spikes in freely behaving rats
<p>Neural activity in vivo is primarily measured using extracellular somatic spikes, which provide limited information about neural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>ation. Hence, it is necessary to record from neuronal dendrites, which can generate dendritic action potentials (DAPs) in vitro, which can profoundly influence neural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>ation and plasticity. We measured neocortical sub- and suprathreshold dendritic membrane potential (DMP) from putative distal-most dendrites using tetrodes in freely behaving rats over multiple days with a high degree of stability and submillisecond temporal resolution. DAP firing rates were several-fold larger than somatic rates. DAP rates were also modulated by subthreshold DMP fluctuations, which were far larger than DAP amplitude, indicating hybrid, analog-digital coding in the dendrites. Parietal DAP and DMP exhibited egocentric spatial maps comparable to pyramidal neurons. These results have important implications for neural coding and plasticity.</p>

Demonstration of an ac Josephson junction laser
<p>Superconducting electronic devices have reemerged as contenders for both classical and quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>ing due to their fast operation speeds, low dissipation, and long coherence times. An ultimate demonstration of coherence is lasing. We use one of the fundamental aspects of superconductivity, the ac Josephson effect, to demonstrate a laser made from a Josephson junction strongly coupled to a multimode superconducting cavity. A dc voltage bias applied across the junction provides a source of microwave photons, and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>’s nonlinearity allows for efficient down-conversion of higher-order Josephson frequencies to the cavity’s fundamental mode. The simple fabrication and operation allows for easy integration with a range of quantum devices, allowing for efficient on-chip generation of coherent microwave photons at low temperatures.</p>

The role of dimer asymmetry and protomer dynamics in enzyme catalysis
<p>Freeze-trapping x-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>ational techniques reveal the distribution of states and their interconversion rates along the reaction pathway of a bacterial homodimeric enzyme, fluoroacetate dehalogenase (FAcD). The crystal structure of apo-FAcD exhibits asymmetry around the dimer interface and cap domain, priming one protomer for substrate binding. This asymmetry is dynamically averaged through conformational exchange on a millisecond time scale. During catalysis, the protomer conformational exchange rate becomes enhanced, the empty protomer exhibits increased local disorder, and water egresses. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>ational studies identify allosteric pathways between protomers. Water release and enhanced dynamics associated with catalysis compensate for entropic losses from substrate binding while facilitating sampling of the transition state. The studies provide insights into how substrate-coupled allosteric modulation of structure and dynamics facilitates catalysis in a homodimeric enzyme.</p>

Cognition-mediated evolution of low-quality floral nectars
<p>Plants pollinated by hummingbirds or bats produce dilute nectars even though these animals prefer more concentrated sugar solutions. This mismatch is an unsolved evolutionary paradox. Here we show that lower quality, or more dilute, nectars evolve when the strength of preferring larger quantities or higher qualities of nectar diminishes as magnitudes of the physical stimuli increase. In a virtual evolution experiment conducted in the tropical rainforest, bats visited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>er-automated flowers with simulated genomes that evolved relatively dilute nectars. Simulations replicated this evolution only when value functions, which relate the physical stimuli to subjective sensations, were nonlinear. Selection also depended on the supply/demand ratio; bats selected for more dilute nectar when competition for food was higher. We predict such a pattern to generally occur when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decis</span></strong>ion-makers consider multiple value dimensions simultaneously, and increases of psycho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">logic</span></strong>al value are not fully proportional to increases in physical magnitude.</p>

Quantum optical circulator controlled by a single chirally coupled atom
<p>Integrated nonreciprocal optical components, which have an inherent asymmetry between their forward and backward propagation direction, are key for routing signals in photonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s. Here, we demonstrate a fiber-integrated quantum optical circulator operated by a single atom. Its nonreciprocal behavior arises from the chiral interaction between the atom and the transversally confined light. We demonstrate that the internal quantum state of the atom controls the operation direction of the circulator and that it features a strongly nonlinear response at the single-photon level. This enables, for example, photon number–dependent routing and novel quantum simulation protocols. Furthermore, such a circulator can in principle be prepared in a coherent superposition of its operational states and may become a key element for quantum information processing in scalable integrated optical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s.</p>

β-cell–mimetic designer cells provide closed-loop glycemic control

Implanted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>-carrying cells corrected insulin deficiency and self-sufficiently abolished persistent hyperglycemia in T1D mice. Similarly, glucose-inducible glucagon-like peptide 1 transcription improved endogenous glucose-stimulated insulin release and glucose tolerance in T2D mice.

A Price to Pay for Adult Neurogenesis
<p>We tend to believe that plasticity is what makes brain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s adaptable to continuous changes in environmental demands and that greater brain plasticity should result in a better ability to cope with the surrounding world. To adapt to everyday life, animals explore, learn, and remember, and these tasks make use of various cortical structures, including the hippocampus. The dentate gyrus, part of the hippocampus, is a remarkable structure in that it is one of two areas of the adult mammalian brain, including the human brain, that continue to generate new neurons throughout postnatal life (<i>1</i>). It is well established that adult-born neurons integrate into preexisting neuronal networks and participate in information processing (<i>2</i>). Much evidence accumulated over the past decade supports the hypothesis that adult neurogenesis itself is a type of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> plasticity required for hippocampus-dependent learning and memory recall. The work by Akers <i>et al.</i> on page 598 of this issue (<i>3</i>) now shows that adult hippocampal neurogenesis may also promote forgetting.</p>

A New Wrap for Neuronal Activity?
<p>As we learn and experience the world around us, our brains are remodeling neuronal pathways. Is this remodeling only a property of neurons, or are other brain cell types also adapting and contributing to learning? A substantial proportion of cells in the mammalian brain are oligodendrocytes and their precursors (collectively called oligodendroglia). Oligodendrocytes generate multiple myelin sheaths, lipid-rich extensions of specialized plasma membrane that spirally coat condensed layers around neurons. This insulation facilitates rapid nerve conduction, increasing velocities of neuron signals 10-fold (<i>1</i>) by restricting current flow to the small gaps between sheaths—the nodes of Ranvier. More than half of the human brain is composed of myelinated nerves (“white matter”). With such extensive myelinated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neural net</span></strong>works, it raises the questions: Do the myelin-producing oligodendrocytes in the brain also adapt as neural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s are modified in response to activity, and does adaptation of oligodendrocytes then affect the underlying neural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s? On page 487 of this issue, Gibson <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) provide new evidence to address how neuron activity may promote oligodendroglia changes.</p>

Split-TALE: A TALE-Based Two-Component System for Synthetic Biology Applications in Planta
<p>Transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) are bacterial Type-III effector proteins from phytopathogenic <i>Xanthomonas</i> species that act as transcription factors in plants. The modular DNA-binding domain of TALEs can be reprogrammed to target nearly any DNA sequence. Here, we designed and optimized a two-component AND-gate system for synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s in plants based on TALEs. In this system, named split-TALE (sTALE), the TALE DNA binding domain and the transcription activation domain are separated and each fused to protein interacting domains. Physical interaction of interacting domains leads to TALE-reconstitution and can be monitored by reporter gene induction. This setup was used for optimization of the sTALE scaffolds, which result in an AND-gate system with an improved signal-to-noise ratio. We also provide a toolkit of ready-to-use vectors and single modules compatible with Golden Gate cloning and MoClo syntax. In addition to its implementation in synthetic regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s, the sTALE system allows the analysis of protein-protein interactions in planta.</p>

EZ-Root-VIS: A Software Pipeline for the Rapid Analysis and Visual Reconstruction of Root System Architecture
<p>If we want to understand how the environment has shaped the appearance and behavior of living creatures, we need to compare groups of individuals that differ in genetic makeup and environment experience. For complex phenotypic features, such as body posture or facial expression in humans, comparison is not straightforward because some of the contributing factors cannot easily be quantified or averaged across individuals. Therefore, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>ational methods are used to reconstruct representative prototypes using a range of algorithms for filling in missing information and calculating means. The same problem applies to the root system architecture (RSA) of plants. Several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>er programs are available for extracting numerical data from root images, but they usually do not offer customized data analysis or visual reconstruction of RSA. We developed Root-VIS, a free software tool that facilitates the determination of means and variance of many different RSA features across user-selected sets of root images. Furthermore, Root-VIS offers several options to generate visual reconstructions of root systems from the averaged data to enable screening and modeling. We confirmed the suitability of Root-VIS, combined with a new version of EZ-Rhizo, for the rapid characterization of genotype-environment interactions and gene discovery through genome-wide association studies in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>).</p>

Storage Compartments for Capillary Water Rarely Refill in an Intact Woody Plant
<p>Water storage is thought to play an integral role in the maintenance of whole-plant water balance. The contribution of both living and dead cells to water storage can be derived from rehydration and water-release curves on excised plant material, but the underlying tissue-specific emptying/refilling dynamics remain unclear. Here, we used x-ray <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>ed microtomography to characterize the refilling of xylem fibers, pith cells, and vessels under both excised and in vivo conditions in <i>Laurus nobilis</i>. In excised stems supplied with water, water uptake exhibited a biphasic response curve, and x-ray <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>ed microtomography images showed that high water storage capacitance was associated with fiber and pith refilling as driven by capillary forces: fibers refilled more rapidly than pith cells, while vessel refilling was minimal. In excised stems that were sealed, fiber and pith refilling was associated with vessel emptying, indicating a link between tissue connectivity and water storage. In contrast, refilling of fibers, pith cells, and vessels was negligible in intact saplings over two time scales, 24 h and 3 weeks. However, those compartments did refill slowly when the shoot was covered to prevent transpiration. Collectively, our data (1) provide direct evidence that storage compartments for capillary water refill in excised stems but rarely under in vivo conditions, (2) highlight that estimates of capacitance from excised samples should be interpreted with caution, as certain storage compartments may not be utilized in the intact plant, and (3) question the paradigm that fibers play a substantial role in daily discharge/recharge of stem capacitance in an intact tree.</p>

ChloroKB: A Web Application for the Integration of Knowledge Related to Chloroplast Metabolic Network
<p>Higher plants, as autotrophic organisms, are effective sources of molecules. They hold great promise for metabolic engineering, but the behavior of plant metabolism at the network level is still incompletely described. Although structural models (stoichiometry matrices) and pathway databases are extremely useful, they cannot describe the complexity of the metabolic context, and new tools are required to visually represent integrated biocurated knowledge for use by both humans and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>ers. Here, we describe ChloroKB, a Web application (<ext-link>http://chlorokb.fr/</ext-link>) for visual exploration and analysis of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) metabolic network in the chloroplast and related cellular pathways. The network was manually reconstructed through extensive biocuration to provide transparent traceability of experimental data. Proteins and metabolites were placed in their bio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">logic</span></strong>al context (spatial distribution within cells, connectivity in the network, participation in supramolecular complexes, and regulatory interactions) using CellDesigner software. The network contains 1,147 reviewed proteins (559 localized exclusively in plastids, 68 in at least one additional compartment, and 520 outside the plastid), 122 proteins awaiting biochemical/genetic characterization, and 228 proteins for which genes have not yet been identified. The visual presentation is intuitive and browsing is fluid, providing instant access to the graphical representation of integrated processes and to a wealth of refined qualitative and quantitative data. ChloroKB will be a significant support for structural and quantitative kinetic modeling, for bio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">logic</span></strong>al reasoning, when comparing novel data with established knowledge, for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>er analyses, and for educational purposes.

Quartet-Net: A Quartet-Based Method to Reconstruct Phylogenetic Networks
<p>Phylogenetic networks can model reticulate evolutionary events such as hybridization, recombination, and horizontal gene transfer. However, reconstructing such networks is not trivial. Popular character-based methods are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>ationally inefficient, whereas distance-based methods cannot guarantee reconstruction accuracy because pairwise genetic distances only reflect partial information about a reticulate phylogeny. To balance accuracy and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>ational efficiency, here we introduce a quartet-based method to construct a phylogenetic network from a multiple sequence alignment. Unlike distances that only reflect the relationship between a pair of taxa, quartets contain information on the relationships among four taxa; these quartets provide adequate capacity to infer a more accurate phylogenetic network. In applications to simulated and bio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">logic</span></strong>al data sets, we demonstrate that this novel method is robust and effective in reconstructing reticulate evolutionary events and it has the potential to infer more accurate phylogenetic distances than other conventional phylogenetic network construction methods such as Neighbor-Joining, Neighbor-Net, and Split Decomposition. This method can be used in constructing phylogenetic networks from simple evolutionary events involving a few reticulate events to complex evolutionary histories involving a large number of reticulate events. A software called “Quartet-Net” is implemented and available at <ext-link>http://sysbio.cvm.msstate.edu/QuartetNet/</ext-link>.</p>

Ultrafast Approximation for Phylogenetic Bootstrap
<p>Nonparametric bootstrap has been a widely used tool in phylogenetic analysis to assess the clade support of phylogenetic trees. However, with the rapidly growing amount of data, this task remains a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>ational bottleneck. Recently, approximation methods such as the RAxML rapid bootstrap (RBS) and the Shimodaira–Hasegawa-like approximate likelihood ratio test have been introduced to speed up the bootstrap. Here, we suggest an ultrafast bootstrap approximation approach (UFBoot) to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>e the support of phylogenetic groups in maximum likelihood (ML) based trees. To achieve this, we combine the resampling estimated log-likelihood method with a simple but effective collection scheme of candidate trees. We also propose a stopping rule that assesses the convergence of branch support values to automatically determine when to stop collecting candidate trees. UFBoot achieves a median speed up of 3.1 (range: 0.66–33.3) to 10.2 (range: 1.32–41.4) compared with RAxML RBS for real DNA and amino acid alignments, respectively. Moreover, our extensive simulations show that UFBoot is robust against moderate model violations and the support values obtained appear to be relatively unbiased compared with the conservative standard bootstrap. This provides a more direct interpretation of the bootstrap support. We offer an efficient and easy-to-use software (available at <ext-link>http://www.cibiv.at/software/iqtree</ext-link>) to perform the UFBoot analysis with ML tree inference.</p>

<p><bold>Highlighted Article:</bold> Bats base roost emergence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decis</span></strong>ions on the acoustic component of rainfall, indicating that noise can serve as an important informational cue in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decis</span></strong>ion-making.</p>

Evolution of vocal patterns: tuning hindbrain circuits during species divergence
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> Courtship song dynamics arise from finely tuned motor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s. Alterations in the activity of a key nucleus of the hindbrain vocal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> accompany call pattern divergence during speciation in African clawed frogs.</p>

Archerfish fast-start decisions can take an additional variable into account
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> Speed and accuracy of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decis</span></strong>ion typically decline when the number of alternatives increases. The fast-start <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decis</span></strong>ions of hunting archerfish appear to break this rule and are robust against massively increasing complexity.</p>

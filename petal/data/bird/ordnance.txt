Single-cell reconstruction of developmental trajectories during zebrafish embryogenesis
<p>During embryogenesis, cells acquire distinct fates by transitioning through transcriptional states. To uncover these transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">trajectori</span></strong>es during zebrafish embryogenesis, we sequenced 38,731 cells and developed URD, a simulated diffusion-based computational reconstruction method. URD identified the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">trajectori</span></strong>es of 25 cell types through early somitogenesis, gene expression along them, and their spatial origin in the blastula. Analysis of Nodal signaling mutants revealed that their transcriptomes were canalized into a subset of wild-type transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">trajectori</span></strong>es. Some wild-type developmental branch points contained cells that express genes characteristic of multiple fates. These cells appeared to trans-specify from one fate to another. These findings reconstruct the transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">trajectori</span></strong>es of a vertebrate embryo, highlight the concurrent canalization and plasticity of embryonic specification, and provide a framework with which to reconstruct complex developmental trees from single-cell transcriptomes.</p>

Spatiotemporal gene expression trajectories reveal developmental hierarchies of the human cortex
<p>Systematic analyses of spatiotemporal gene expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">trajectori</span></strong>es during organogenesis have been challenging because diverse cell types at different stages of maturation and differentiation coexist in the emerging tissues. We identified discrete cell types as well as temporally and spatially restricted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">trajectori</span></strong>es of radial glia maturation and neurogenesis in developing human telencephalon. These lineage-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">trajectori</span></strong>es reveal the expression of neurogenic transcription factors in early radial glia and enriched activation of mammalian target of rapamycin signaling in outer radial glia. Across cortical areas, modest transcriptional differences among radial glia cascade into robust typological distinctions among maturing neurons. Together, our results support a mixed model of topographical, typological, and temporal hierarchies governing cell-type diversity in the developing human telencephalon, including distinct excitatory lineages emerging in rostral and caudal cerebral cortex.</p>

Anti-Müllerian Hormone Trajectories Are Associated With Cardiovascular Disease in Women
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Earlier age at menopause is widely considered to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. However, the underlying mechanisms of this relationship remain undetermined. Indications suggest that anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), an ovarian reserve marker, plays a physiological role outside of the reproductive system. Therefore, we investigated whether longitudinal AMH decline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">trajectori</span></strong>es are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) occurrence.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This study included 3108 female participants between 20 and 60 years of age at baseline of the population-based Doetinchem Cohort. Participants completed ≥1 of 5 consecutive quinquennial visits between 1987 and 2010, resulting in a total follow-up time of 20 years. AMH was measured in 8507 stored plasma samples. Information on total CVD, stroke, and coronary heart disease was obtained through a hospital discharge registry linkage. The association of AMH <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">trajectori</span></strong>es with CVD was quantified with joint modeling, with adjustment for age, smoking, oral contraceptive use, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone therapy use, diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and glucose levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>By the end of follow-up, 8.2% of the women had suffered from CVD, 4.9% had suffered from coronary heart disease, and 2.6% had experienced a stroke. After adjustment, each ng/mL lower <sub>log</sub>AMH level was associated with a 21% higher risk of CVD (hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.07–1.36) and a 26% higher risk of coronary heart disease (hazard ratio, 1.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.08–1.46). Each additional ng/mL/year decrease of <sub>log</sub>AMH was associated with a significantly higher risk of CVD (hazard ratio, 1.46; 95% confidence interval, 1.14–1.87) and coronary heart disease (hazard ratio, 1.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.15–2.12). No association between AMH and stroke was found.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These results indicate that AMH <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">trajectori</span></strong>es in women are independently associated with CVD risk. Therefore, we postulate that the decline of circulating AMH levels may be part of the pathophysiology of the increased cardiovascular risk of earlier menopause. Confirmation of this association and elucidation of its underlying mechanisms are needed to place these results in a clinical perspective.</p></sec>

Systolic Blood Pressure Trajectory, Frailty, and All-Cause Mortality >80 Years of Age
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Clinical trials show benefit from lowering systolic blood pressure (SBP) in people ≥80 years of age, but nonrandomized epidemiological studies suggest lower SBP may be associated with higher mortality. This study aimed to evaluate associations of SBP with all-cause mortality by frailty category >80 years of age and to evaluate SBP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">trajectori</span></strong>es before death.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A population-based cohort study was conducted using electronic health records of 144 403 participants ≥80 years of age registered with family practices in the United Kingdom from 2001 to 2014. Participants were followed for ≤5 years. Clinical records of SBP were analyzed. Frailty status was classified using the e-Frailty Index into the categories of fit, mild, moderate, and severe. All-cause mortality was evaluated by frailty status and mean SBP in Cox proportional-hazards models. SBP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">trajectori</span></strong>es were evaluated using person months as observations, with mean SBP and antihypertensive treatment status estimated for each person month. Fractional polynomial models were used to estimate SBP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">trajectori</span></strong>es over 5 years before death.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>During follow-up, 51 808 deaths occurred. Mortality rates increased with frailty level and were greatest at SBP <110 mm Hg. In fit women, mortality was 7.7 per 100 person years at SBP 120 to 139 mm Hg, 15.2 at SBP 110 to 119 mm Hg, and 22.7 at SBP <110 mm Hg. For women with severe frailty, rates were 16.8, 25.2, and 39.6, respectively. SBP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">trajectori</span></strong>es showed an accelerated decline in the last 2 years of life. The relative odds of SBP <120 mm Hg were higher in the last 3 months of life than 5 years previously in both treated (odds ratio, 6.06; 95% confidence interval, 5.40–6.81) and untreated (odds ratio, 6.31; 95% confidence interval, 5.30–7.52) patients. There was no evidence of intensification of antihypertensive therapy in the final 2 years of life.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>A terminal decline of SBP in the final 2 years of life suggests that nonrandomized epidemiological associations of low SBP with higher mortality may be accounted for by reverse causation if participants with lower blood pressure values are closer, on average, to the end of life.</p></sec>

Quantifying reputation and success in art
<p>In areas of human activity where performance is difficult to quantify in an objective fashion, reputation and networks of influence play a key role in determining access to resources and rewards. To understand the role of these factors, we reconstructed the exhibition history of half a million artists, mapping out the coexhibition network that captures the movement of art between institutions. Centrality within this network captured institutional prestige, allowing us to explore the career trajectory of individual artists in terms of access to coveted institutions. Early access to prestigious central institutions offered life-long access to high-prestige venues and reduced dropout rate. By contrast, starting at the network periphery resulted in a high dropout rate, limiting access to central institutions. A Markov model predicts the career trajectory of individual artists and documents the strong path and history dependence of valuation in art.</p>

The rise, collapse, and compaction of Mt. Mantap from the 3 September 2017 North Korean nuclear test
<p>Surveillance of clandestine nuclear tests relies on a global seismic network, but the potential of spaceborne monitoring has been underexploited. We used satellite radar imagery to determine the complete surface displacement field of up to 3.5 meters of divergent horizontal motion with 0.5 meters of subsidence associated with North Korea’s largest underground nuclear test. Combining insight from geodetic and seismological remote sensing, we found that the aftermath of the initial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">explos</span></strong>ive deformation involved subsidence associated with subsurface collapse and aseismic compaction of the damaged rocks of the test site. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">explos</span></strong>ive yield from the nuclear detonation with best-fitting source parameters for 450-meter depth was 191 kilotonnes of TNT equivalent. Our results demonstrate the capability of spaceborne remote sensing to help characterize large underground nuclear tests.</p>

Imaging CF<sub>3</sub>I conical intersection and photodissociation dynamics with ultrafast electron diffraction
<p>Conical intersections play a critical role in excited-state dynamics of polyatomic molecules because they govern the reaction pathways of many nonadiabatic processes. However, ultrafast probes have lacked sufficient spatial resolution to image wave-packet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">trajectori</span></strong>es through these intersections directly. Here, we present the simultaneous experimental characterization of one-photon and two-photon excitation channels in isolated CF<sub>3</sub>I molecules using ultrafast gas-phase electron diffraction. In the two-photon channel, we have mapped out the real-space <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">trajectori</span></strong>es of a coherent nuclear wave packet, which bifurcates onto two potential energy surfaces when passing through a conical intersection. In the one-photon channel, we have resolved excitation of both the umbrella and the breathing vibrational modes in the CF<sub>3</sub> fragment in multiple nuclear dimensions. These findings benchmark and validate ab initio nonadiabatic dynamics calculations.</p>

Chronicling embryos, cell by cell, gene by gene
<p>One of biology's great mysteries is how a single fertilized egg gives rise to the multitude of cell types, tissues, and organs that fit together to make an adult body. Now, a combination of single-cell sequencing technologies and computational tools is providing the most detailed picture yet of this process. Researchers made multiple snapshots of gene activity in most of the cells in developing zebrafish or frog embryos. They then assembled those data, taken at intervals of just minutes to hours, into coherent, cell-by-cell histories of how those embryos take shape. The analyses led to some surprises, including that cells develop cell type–specific gene activity profiles early on, and yet, later, some cells ultimately stray from their developmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">trajectori</span></strong>es. Such studies could also provide a recipe book for stem cell scientists and tissue engineers who want to make various cell types.</p>

Germinal center antibody mutation trajectories are determined by rapid self/foreign discrimination
<p>Antibodies have the specificity to differentiate foreign antigens that mimic self antigens, but it remains unclear how such specificity is acquired. In a mouse model, we generated B cells displaying an antibody that cross-reacts with two related protein antigens expressed on self versus foreign cells. B cell anergy was imposed by self antigen but reversed upon challenge with high-density foreign antigen, leading to germinal center recruitment and antibody gene hypermutation. Single-cell analysis detected rapid selection for mutations that decrease self affinity and slower selection for epistatic mutations that specifically increase foreign affinity. Crystal structures revealed that these mutations exploited subtle topological differences to achieve 5000-fold preferential binding to foreign over self epitopes. Resolution of antigenic mimicry drove the optimal affinity maturation trajectory, highlighting the value of retaining self-reactive clones as substrates for protective antibody responses.</p>

Social place-cells in the bat hippocampus
<p>Social animals have to know the spatial positions of conspecifics. However, it is unknown how the position of others is represented in the brain. We designed a spatial observational-learning task, in which an observer bat mimicked a demonstrator bat while we recorded hippocampal dorsal-CA1 neurons from the observer bat. A neuronal subpopulation represented the position of the other bat, in allocentric coordinates. About half of these “social place-cells” represented also the observer’s own position—that is, were place cells. The representation of the demonstrator bat did not reflect self-movement or trajectory planning by the observer. Some neurons represented also the position of inanimate moving objects; however, their representation differed from the representation of the demonstrator bat. This suggests a role for hippocampal CA1 neurons in social-spatial cognition.</p>

Spatial representations of self and other in the hippocampus
<p>An animal’s awareness of its location in space depends on the activity of place cells in the hippocampus. How the brain encodes the spatial position of others has not yet been identified. We investigated neuronal representations of other animals’ locations in the dorsal CA1 region of the hippocampus with an observational T-maze task in which one rat was required to observe another rat’s trajectory to successfully retrieve a reward. Information reflecting the spatial location of both the self and the other was jointly and discretely encoded by CA1 pyramidal cells in the observer rat. A subset of CA1 pyramidal cells exhibited spatial receptive fields that were identical for the self and the other. These findings demonstrate that hippocampal spatial representations include dimensions for both self and nonself.</p>

Cuban panel claims stress caused mystery illnesses
<p>After a 9-month probe hampered by lack of access to medical records, a panel of Cuban scientists this week declared that U.S. diplomats here likely suffered a "collective psychogenic disorder" earlier this year, not the deliberate "health attack" that the U.S. Department of State has claimed. Based on media reports about the mysterious symptoms, including hearing loss, nausea, vertigo, and memory lapses, some U.S. scientists had already reached similar conclusions. That a panel appointed by the Cuban government dismisses the U.S. claims may not be surprising, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation is still leading what State Department officials have described as a "vigorous" multiagency investigation. But the Cuban report summary, obtained by <i>Science</i>, reveals intriguing details.

Escaping the traps of your own hunters
<p>During the first days of an infection, protection is almost entirely provided by innate immunity, a large part of which consists of one type of immune cell—the neutrophil. Neutrophils form the largest group of immune cells in the body [humans produce ∼10<sup>11</sup> neutrophils daily (<i>1</i>)], and they carry out a number of defense mechanisms, including pathogen ingestion (phagocytosis) and the production of toxic chemicals that kill intruders directly. They can also cause severe hyperinflammatory diseases, such as lethal influenza-associated lung destruction (<i>2</i>, <i>3</i>). In 2004, another neutrophil defense system was discovered. In a final act of protection, dying neutrophils mix their nuclear DNA with toxic components from their cytosolic granules and release it <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">explos</span></strong>ively to form a neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) in the surrounding environment. This process is called NETosis (<i>4</i>). In addition to carrying genetic information, DNA is a very long (each nucleus contains ∼2 m of DNA) and sticky polyanionic molecule. Hence, DNA binds to surfaces such as bacterial cell walls by means of charge interactions (<i>5</i>). Through this immobilization on NETs, pathogens are brought into direct contact with cytotoxic molecules on the NET-DNA complex. However, free extracellular DNA is also a potent trigger of severe side effects in the body, for example, by forming immune complexes with anti nuclear antibodies (antibodies that can bind to DNA) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (<i>6</i>) or by directly clogging blood vessels and establishing vessel-blocking thrombi (<i>7</i>). Consequently, finding mechanisms that mediate the degradation of NETs has been a matter of intense research. On page 1202 of this issue, Jiménez-Alcéázar <i>et al.</i> (<i>8</i>) describe two deoxyribonucleases (DNases) [DNase1 and DNase1-like 3 (DNase1L3)], which cleave DNA and together degrade freshly formed NETs. By doing so, they inhibit otherwise lethal immunopathologies such as thrombus-mediated organ failure.</p>

The fundamental advantages of temporal networks
<p>Most networked systems of scientific interest are characterized by temporal links, meaning the network’s structure changes over time. Link temporality has been shown to hinder many dynamical processes, from information spreading to accessibility, by disrupting network paths. Considering the ubiquity of temporal networks in nature, we ask: Are there any advantages of the networks’ temporality? We use an analytical framework to show that temporal networks can, compared to their static counterparts, reach controllability faster, demand orders of magnitude less control energy, and have control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">trajectori</span></strong>es, that are considerably more compact than those characterizing static networks. Thus, temporality ensures a degree of flexibility that would be unattainable in static networks, enhancing our ability to control them.</p>

Glia put visual map in sync
<p>Watching a fireworks display is a breathtaking experience. As <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">explos</span></strong>ions pattern the sky, the visual system must capture information about the time-varying positions, colors, and contrasts of myriad spots of light. This testament to high-acuity vision necessitates the development of neural circuits that map visual space. To generate this retinotopy (visual mapping), neurons must differentiate and connect to their synaptic targets with both spatial and temporal precision. How is this achieved? The molecules that regulate neuronal differentiation have been described in detail, as have the cues that allow differentiated neurons to reach and choose their synaptic partners (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). However, the mechanisms that coordinate neuronal specification with the development of retinotopic circuit wiring have remained elusive. On page 886 of this issue, Fernandes <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) demonstrate that in the visual system of flies (<i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>), photoreceptors use glial cells as intermediaries to communicate with their neural targets to generate retinotopic circuits.</p>

An unusual white dwarf star may be a surviving remnant of a subluminous Type Ia supernova

These models predict that bound remnants survive such events with, according to some simulations, a high kick velocity. We report the discovery of a high proper motion, low-mass white dwarf (LP 40-365) that travels at a velocity greater than the Galactic escape velocity and whose peculiar atmosphere is dominated by intermediate-mass elements. Strong evidence indicates that this partially burnt remnant was ejected following a subluminous Type Ia supernova event. This supports the viability of single-degenerate supernova progenitors.</p>

The goal is to break the chain of transmission of the debilitating disease, which stubbornly persists in India despite the availability of a drug regimen that can cure it.

<p>We report the discovery of a multiply imaged, gravitationally lensed type Ia supernova, iPTF16geu (SN 2016geu), at redshift <i>z</i> = 0.409. This phenomenon was identified because the light from the stellar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">explos</span></strong>ion was magnified more than 50 times by the curvature of space around matter in an intervening galaxy. We used high-spatial-resolution observations to resolve four images of the lensed supernova, approximately 0.3 arc seconds from the center of the foreground galaxy. The observations probe a physical scale of ~1 kiloparsec, smaller than is typical in other studies of extragalactic gravitational lensing. The large magnification and symmetric image configuration imply close alignment between the lines of sight to the supernova and to the lens. The relative magnifications of the four images provide evidence for substructures in the lensing galaxy.</p>

Real-time spectral interferometry probes the internal dynamics of femtosecond soliton molecules

By means of an emerging time-stretch technique, we resolve the evolution of femtosecond soliton molecules in the cavity of a few-cycle mode-locked laser. We track two- and three-soliton bound states over hundreds of thousands of consecutive cavity roundtrips, identifying fixed points and periodic and aperiodic molecular orbits. A class of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">trajectori</span></strong>es acquires a path-dependent geometrical phase, implying that its dynamics may be topologically protected.

Superficial layers of the medial entorhinal cortex replay independently of the hippocampus
<p>The hippocampus is thought to initiate systems-wide mnemonic processes through the reactivation of previously acquired spatial and episodic memory traces, which can recruit the entorhinal cortex as a first stage of memory redistribution to other brain areas. Hippocampal reactivation occurs during sharp wave–ripples, in which synchronous network firing encodes sequences of places. We investigated the coordination of this replay by recording assembly activity simultaneously in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and superficial layers of the medial entorhinal cortex. We found that entorhinal cell assemblies can replay <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">trajectori</span></strong>es independently of the hippocampus and sharp wave–ripples. This suggests that the hippocampus is not the sole initiator of spatial and episodic memory trace reactivation. Memory systems involved in these processes may include nonhierarchical, parallel components.</p>

Vectorial representation of spatial goals in the hippocampus of bats

We discovered a subpopulation of neurons with angular tuning to the goal direction. Many of these neurons were tuned to an occluded goal, suggesting that goal-direction representation is memory-based. We also found cells that encoded the distance to the goal, often in conjunction with goal direction. The goal-direction and goal-distance signals make up a vectorial representation of spatial goals, suggesting a previously unrecognized neuronal mechanism for goal-directed navigation.</p>

Extensive seismic activity preceding the eruption shows that inflation is accommodated by the reactivation of an outward-dipping caldera ring fault, with strong tidal triggering indicating a critically stressed system. The ring fault accommodated deflation during the eruption and provided a pathway for a dike that propagated south and north beneath the caldera’s east wall. Once north of the caldera, the eruption stepped westward, and a dike propagated along the extensional north rift.</p>

By dispersing swimming <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> in a liquid crystalline environment with spatially varying orientation of the anisotropy axis, we demonstrate control over the distribution of bacterial concentration, as well as the geometry and polarity of their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">trajectori</span></strong>es. Bacteria recognize subtle differences in liquid crystal deformations, engaging in bipolar swimming in regions of pure splay and bend but switching to unipolar swimming in mixed splay-bend regions. They differentiate topological defects, heading toward defects of positive topological charge and avoiding negative charges. Sensitivity of bacteria to preimposed orientational patterns represents a previously unknown facet of the interplay between hydrodynamics and topology of active matter.</p>

Single-particle mapping of nonequilibrium nanocrystal transformations
<p>Chemists have developed mechanistic insight into numerous chemical reactions by thoroughly characterizing nonequilibrium species. Although methods to probe these processes are well established for molecules, analogous techniques for understanding intermediate structures in nanomaterials have been lacking. We monitor the shape evolution of individual anisotropic gold nanostructures as they are oxidatively etched in a graphene liquid cell with a controlled redox environment. Short-lived, nonequilibrium nanocrystals are observed, structurally analyzed, and rationalized through Monte Carlo simulations. Understanding these reaction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">trajectori</span></strong>es provides important fundamental insight connecting high-energy nanocrystal morphologies to the development of kinetically stabilized surface features and demonstrates the importance of developing tools capable of probing short-lived nanoscale species at the single-particle level.</p>

Rapid development of a DNA vaccine for Zika virus
<p>Zika virus (ZIKV) was identified as a cause of congenital disease during the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">explos</span></strong>ive outbreak in the Americas and Caribbean that began in 2015. Because of the ongoing fetal risk from endemic disease and travel-related exposures, a vaccine to prevent viremia in women of childbearing age and their partners is imperative. We found that vaccination with DNA expressing the premembrane and envelope proteins of ZIKV was immunogenic in mice and nonhuman primates, and protection against viremia after ZIKV challenge correlated with serum neutralizing activity. These data not only indicate that DNA vaccination could be a successful approach to protect against ZIKV infection, but also suggest a protective threshold of vaccine-induced neutralizing activity that prevents viremia after acute infection.</p>

Ballistic miniband conduction in a graphene superlattice
<p>Rational design of long-period artificial lattices yields effects unavailable in simple solids. The moiré pattern in highly aligned graphene/hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) heterostructures is a lateral superlattice with high electron mobility and an unusual electronic dispersion whose miniband edges and saddle points can be reached by electrostatic gating. We investigated the dynamics of electrons in moiré minibands by measuring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ballist</span></strong>ic transport between adjacent local contacts in a magnetic field, known as the transverse electron focusing effect. At low temperatures, we observed caustics of skipping orbits extending over hundreds of superlattice periods, reversals of the cyclotron revolution for successive minibands, and breakdown of cyclotron motion near van Hove singularities. At high temperatures, electron-electron collisions suppress focusing. Probing such miniband conduction properties is a necessity for engineering novel transport behaviors in superlattice devices.</p>

Electron optics with p-n junctions in ballistic graphene
<p>Electrons transmitted across a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ballist</span></strong>ic semiconductor junction are expected to undergo refraction, analogous to light rays across an optical boundary. In graphene, the linear dispersion and zero-gap band structure admit highly transparent p-n junctions by simple electrostatic gating. Here, we employ transverse magnetic focusing to probe the propagation of carriers across an electrostatically defined graphene junction. We find agreement with the predicted Snell’s law for electrons, including the observation of both positive and negative refraction. Resonant transmission across the p-n junction provides a direct measurement of the angle-dependent transmission coefficient. Comparing experimental data with simulations reveals the crucial role played by the effective junction width, providing guidance for future device design. Our results pave the way for realizing electron optics based on graphene p-n junctions.</p>

Mandibular Remains Support Taxonomic Validity of <i>Australopithecus sediba</i>
<p>Since the announcement of the species <i>Australopithecus sediba</i>, questions have been raised over whether the Malapa fossils represent a valid taxon or whether inadequate allowance was made for intraspecific variation, in particular with reference to the temporally and geographically proximate species <i>Au</i>. <i>africanus</i>. The morphology of mandibular remains of <i>Au. sediba</i>, including newly recovered material discussed here, shows that it is not merely a late-surviving morph of <i>Au. africanus</i>. Rather—as is seen elsewhere in the cranium, dentition, and postcranial skeleton—these mandibular remains share similarities with other australopiths but can be differentiated from the hypodigm of <i>Au. africanus</i> in both size and shape as well as in their ontogenetic growth trajectory.</p>

Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Resolves Molecular Relationships Among Individual Plant Cells
<p>Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has been used extensively to study cell-specific gene expression in animals, but it has not been widely applied to plants. Here, we describe the use of a commercially available droplet-based microfluidics platform for high-throughput scRNA-seq to obtain single-cell transcriptomes from protoplasts of more than 10,000 Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) root cells. We find that all major tissues and developmental stages are represented in this single-cell transcriptome population. Further, distinct subpopulations and rare cell types, including putative quiescent center cells, were identified. A focused analysis of root epidermal cell transcriptomes defined developmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">trajectori</span></strong>es for individual cells progressing from meristematic through mature stages of root-hair and nonhair cell differentiation. In addition, single-cell transcriptomes were obtained from root epidermis mutants, enabling a comparative analysis of gene expression at single-cell resolution and providing an unprecedented view of the impact of the mutated genes. Overall, this study demonstrates the feasibility and utility of scRNA-seq in plants and provides a first-generation gene expression map of the Arabidopsis root at single-cell resolution.</p>

Natural Variation of Molecular and Morphological Gibberellin Responses

Here, we use genetic perturbation of endogenous gibberellin levels to probe the extent of intraspecific variation in gibberellin responses in natural accessions of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We find that these accessions vary greatly in their ability to buffer the effects of overexpression of <i>GA20ox1</i>, encoding a rate-limiting enzyme for gibberellin biosynthesis, with substantial differences in bioactive gibberellin concentrations as well as transcriptomes and growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">trajectori</span></strong>es.

Talpid Mole Phylogeny Unites Shrew Moles and Illuminates Overlooked Cryptic Species Diversity
<p>The mammalian family Talpidae (moles, shrew moles, desmans) is characterized by diverse ecomorphologies associated with terrestrial, semi-aquatic, semi-fossorial, fossorial, and aquatic-fossorial lifestyles. Prominent specializations involved with these different lifestyles, and the transitions between them, pose outstanding questions regarding the evolutionary history within the family, not only for living but also for fossil taxa. Here, we investigate the phylogenetic relationships, divergence times, and biogeographic history of the family using 19 nuclear and 2 mitochondrial genes (∼16 kb) from ∼60% of described species representing all 17 genera. Our phylogenetic analyses help settle classical questions in the evolution of moles, identify an ancient (mid-Miocene) split within the monotypic genus <i>Scaptonyx</i>, and indicate that talpid species richness may be nearly 30% higher than previously recognized. Our results also uniformly support the monophyly of long-tailed moles with the two shrew mole tribes and confirm that the Gansu mole is the sole living Asian member of an otherwise North American radiation. Finally, we provide evidence that aquatic specializations within the tribes Condylurini and Desmanini evolved along different morphological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">trajectori</span></strong>es, though we were unable to statistically reject monophyly of the strictly fossorial tribes Talpini and Scalopini. </p>

Evolution of Protein Domain Repeats in Metazoa
<p>Repeats are ubiquitous elements of proteins and they play important roles for cellular function and during evolution. Repeats are, however, also notoriously difficult to capture computationally and large scale studies so far had difficulties in linking genetic causes, structural properties and evolutionary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">trajectori</span></strong>es of protein repeats. Here we apply recently developed methods for repeat detection and analysis to a large dataset comprising over hundred metazoan genomes. We find that repeats in larger protein families experience generally very few insertions or deletions (indels) of repeat units but there is also a significant fraction of noteworthy volatile outliers with very high indel rates. Analysis of structural data indicates that repeats with an open structure and independently folding units are more volatile and more likely to be intrinsically disordered. Such disordered repeats are also significantly enriched in sites with a high functional potential such as linear motifs. Furthermore, the most volatile repeats have a high sequence similarity between their units. Since many volatile repeats also show signs of recombination, we conclude they are often shaped by concerted evolution. Intriguingly, many of these conserved yet volatile repeats are involved in host-pathogen interactions where they might foster fast but subtle adaptation in biological arms races.</p><p><bold><i>Key Words</i>:</bold> protein evolution, domain rearrangements, protein repeats, concerted evolution.</p>

Evolution of Digestive Enzymes and RNASE1 Provides Insights into Dietary Switch of Cetaceans
<p>Although cetaceans (whales, porpoises, and dolphins) have multi-chambered stomachs, feeding habits of modern cetaceans have dramatically changed from herbivorous to carnivorous. However, the genetic basis underlying this dietary switch remains unexplored. Here, we present the first systematic investigation of 10 digestive enzymes genes (i.e., <i>CYP7A1</i>, <i>CTRC</i>, <i>LIPC</i>, <i>LIPF</i>, <i>PNLIP</i>, <i>PGC</i>, <i>PRSS1</i>, <i>SI</i>, <i>SLC5A1</i>, and <i>TMPRSS15</i>) of representative cetaceans, and the evolutionary trajectory of <i>RNASE1</i> in cetartiodactylans. Positive selections were detected with proteinases (i.e., <i>CTRC</i>, <i>PRSS1</i>, and <i>TMPRSS15</i>) and lipases (i.e., <i>CYP7A1</i>, <i>LIPF</i>, and <i>PNLIP</i>) suggesting that cetaceans have evolved an enhanced digestion capacity for proteins and lipids, the major nutritional components of their prey (fishes and invertebrates). In addition, it was found that <i>RNASE1</i> gene duplicated after the cetartiodactylan speciation and two independent gene duplication events took place in Camelidae and Ruminantia. Positive selection was detected with <i>RNASE1</i> of Camelidae and Bovidae, suggesting enhanced digestive efficiency in the ruminants. Remarkably, even though the ancestors of cetaceans were terrestrial artiodactyls that are herbivorous, modern cetaceans lost the pancreatic <i>RNASE1</i> copy with digestive function, which is in accordance with the dietary change from herbivorous to carnivorous. In sum, this is the first study that provides new insights into the evolutionary mechanism of dietary switch in cetaceans.</p>

The Evolution of Human Cells in Terms of Protein Innovation
<p>Humans are composed of hundreds of cell types. As the genomic DNA of each somatic cell is identical, cell type is determined by what is expressed and when. Until recently, little has been reported about the determinants of human cell identity, particularly from the joint perspective of gene evolution and expression. Here, we chart the evolutionary past of all documented human cell types via the collective histories of proteins, the principal product of gene expression. FANTOM5 data provide cell-type–specific digital expression of human protein-coding genes and the SUPERFAMILY resource is used to provide protein domain annotation. The evolutionary epoch in which each protein was created is inferred by comparison with domain annotation of all other completely sequenced genomes. Studying the distribution across epochs of genes expressed in each cell type reveals insights into human cellular evolution in terms of protein innovation. For each cell type, its history of protein innovation is charted based on the genes it expresses. Combining the histories of all cell types enables us to create a timeline of cell evolution. This timeline identifies the possibility that our common ancestor Coelomata (cavity-forming animals) provided the innovation required for the innate immune system, whereas cells which now form the brain of human have followed a trajectory of continually accumulating novel proteins since Opisthokonta (boundary of animals and fungi). We conclude that exaptation of existing domain architectures into new contexts is the dominant source of cell-type–specific domain architectures.</p>

Molecular Adaptation during a Rapid Adaptive Radiation
<p>“Explosive” adaptive radiations on islands remain one of the most puzzling evolutionary phenomena and the evolutionary genetic processes behind such radiations remain unclear. Rapid morphological and ecological evolution during island radiations suggests that many genes may be under fairly strong selection, although this remains untested. Here, we report that during a rapid recent diversification in the Hawaiian endemic plant genus <i>Schiedea</i> (<i>Caryophyllaceae</i>), 5 in 36 studied genes evolved under positive selection. Positively selected genes are involved in defence mechanisms, photosynthesis, and reproduction. Comparison with eight mainland plant groups demonstrates both the relaxation of purifying selection and more widespread positive selection in Hawaiian <i>Schiedea</i>. This provides compelling evidence that adaptive evolution of protein-coding genes may play a significant role during island adaptive radiations.</p>

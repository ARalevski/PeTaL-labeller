Mid-term changes in blood metal ion levels after Articular Surface Replacement arthroplasty of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Our first aim was to determine whether there are significant   changes in the level of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> ions in the blood at mid-term follow-up,   in patients with an Articular Surface Replacement (ASR) arthroplasty.   Secondly, we sought to identify risk factors for any increases.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The study involved 435 patients who underwent unilateral, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>-on-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>   (MoM) hip resurfacing (HRA) or total hip arthroplasty (THA). These   patients all had one measurement of the level of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> ions in the   blood before seven years had passed post-operatively (early evaluation)   and one after seven years had passed post-operatively (mid-term evaluation).   Changes in ion levels were tested using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test.   We identified subgroups at the highest risk of increase using a   multivariable linear logistic regression model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were significant increases in the levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> ions   for patients who underwent both MoM HRA (Chromium (Cr): 0.5 parts   per billion (ppb); Cobalt (Co): 1.1 ppb) and MoM THA (Cr: 0.5 ppb;   Co: 0.7 ppb). In a multivariable model considering MoM HRAs, the   change in the levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> ions was influenced by female gender   (Co: Odds Ratio (OR) 1.42; p = 0.002 and Cr: OR 1.08; p = 0.006).   The change was found to be irrespective of the initial level for   the MoM HRAs, whereas there was a negative relationship between   the initial level and the change in the level for those with a MoM   THA (Co: OR -0.43; p < 0.001 and Cr: OR -0.14; p = 0.033).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> ions in the blood increase significantly   over the period until mid-term follow-up in patients with both a   MoM HRA and those with a MoM THA. We recommend that the levels of   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> ions be measured most frequently for women with a MoM HRA.   While those with a MoM THA appear to stabilise at a certain level,   the accuracy of this trend is not yet clear. Vigilant follow-up   is still recommended. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B(4   Supple B):33–40.</p></sec>

Heavy Metals Induce Iron Deficiency Responses at Different Hierarchic and Regulatory Levels
<p>In plants, the excess of several heavy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s mimics iron (Fe) deficiency-induced chlorosis, indicating a disturbance in Fe homeostasis. To examine the level at which heavy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s interfere with Fe deficiency responses, we carried out an in-depth characterization of Fe-related physiological, regulatory, and morphological responses in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) exposed to heavy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s. Enhanced zinc (Zn) uptake closely mimicked Fe deficiency by leading to low chlorophyll but high ferric-chelate reductase activity and coumarin release. These responses were not caused by Zn-inhibited Fe uptake via IRON-REGULATED TRANSPORTER (IRT1). Instead, Zn simulated the transcriptional response of typical Fe-regulated genes, indicating that Zn affects Fe homeostasis at the level of Fe sensing. Excess supplies of cobalt and nickel altered root traits in a different way from Fe deficiency, inducing only transient Fe deficiency responses, which were characterized by a lack of induction of the ethylene pathway. Cadmium showed a rather inconsistent influence on Fe deficiency responses at multiple levels. By contrast, manganese evoked weak Fe deficiency responses in wild-type plants but strongly exacerbated chlorosis in <i>irt1</i> plants, indicating that manganese antagonized Fe mainly at the level of transport. These results show that the investigated heavy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s modulate Fe deficiency responses at different hierarchic and regulatory levels and that the interaction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s with physiological and morphological Fe deficiency responses is uncoupled. Thus, this study not only emphasizes the importance of assessing heavy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> toxicities at multiple levels but also provides a new perspective on how Fe deficiency contributes to the toxic action of individual heavy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s.</p>

Preassembled GPCR signaling complexes mediate distinct cellular responses to ultralow ligand concentrations
<p>G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest class of cell surface signaling proteins, participate in nearly all physiological processes, and are the targets of 30% of marketed drugs. Typically, nanomolar to micromolar concentrations of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong> are used to activate GPCRs in experimental systems. We detected GPCR responses to a wide range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong> concentrations, from attomolar to millimolar, by measuring GPCR-stimulated production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) with high spatial and temporal resolution. Mathematical modeling showed that femtomolar concentrations of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong> activated, on average, 40% of the cells in a population provided that a cell was activated by one to two binding events. Furthermore, activation of the endogenous β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor (β<sub>2</sub>AR) and muscarinic acetylcholine M<sub>3</sub> receptor (M<sub>3</sub>R) by femtomolar concentrations of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong> in cell lines and human cardiac fibroblasts caused sustained increases in nuclear translocation of extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) and cytosolic protein kinase C (PKC) activity, respectively. These responses were spatially and temporally distinct from those that occurred in response to higher concentrations of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong> and resulted in a distinct cellular proteomic profile. This highly sensitive signaling depended on the GPCRs forming preassembled, higher-order signaling complexes at the plasma membrane. Recognizing that GPCRs respond to ultralow concentrations of neurotransmitters and hormones challenges established paradigms of drug action and provides a previously unappreciated aspect of GPCR activation that is quite distinct from that typically observed with higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong> concentrations.</p>

Endogenous retinoid X receptor ligands in mouse hematopoietic cells
<p>The retinoid X receptor α (RXRA) has been implicated in diverse hematological processes. To identify natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong>s of RXRA that are present in hematopoietic cells, we adapted an upstream activation sequence–green fluorescent protein (UAS-GFP) reporter mouse to detect natural RXRA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong>s in vivo. We observed reporter activity in diverse types of hematopoietic cells in vivo. Reporter activity increased during granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)–induced granulopoiesis and after phenylhydrazine (PHZ)–induced anemia, suggesting the presence of dynamically regulated natural RXRA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong>s in hematopoietic cells. Mouse plasma activated Gal4-UAS reporter cells in vitro, and plasma from mice treated with G-CSF or PHZ recapitulated the patterns of reporter activation that we observed in vivo. Plasma from mice with dietary vitamin A deficiency only mildly reduced RXRA reporter activity, whereas plasma from mice on a fatty acid restriction diet reduced reporter activity, implicating fatty acids as plasma RXRA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong>s. Through differential extraction coupled with mass spectrometry, we identified the long-chain fatty acid C24:5 as a natural RXRA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong> that was greatly increased in abundance in response to hematopoietic stress. Together, these data suggest that natural RXRA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong>s are present and dynamically increased in abundance in mouse hematopoietic cells in vivo.</p>

An extracellular region of Serrate is essential for ligand-induced cis-inhibition of Notch signaling
<p>Cell-to-cell communication via the Notch pathway is mediated between the membrane-bound Notch receptor and either of its canonical membrane-bound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong>s Delta or Serrate. Notch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong>s mediate receptor transactivation between cells and also mediate receptor cis-inhibition when Notch and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong> are co-expressed on the same cell. We demonstrate in <i>Drosophila</i> that removal of any of the EGF-like repeats (ELRs) 4, 5 or 6 results in a Serrate molecule capable of transactivating Notch but exhibiting little or no Notch cis-inhibition capacity. These forms of Serrate require Epsin (Liquid facets) to transduce a signal, suggesting that ELR 4-6-deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong>s still require endocytosis for Notch activation. We also demonstrate that ELRs 4-6 are responsible for the dominant-negative effects of Serrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong> forms that lack the intracellular domain and are therefore incapable of endocytosis in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong>-expressing cell. We find that ELRs 4-6 of Serrate are conserved across species but do not appear to be conserved in Delta homologs.</p>

Functional selectivity profiling of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor using pathway-wide BRET signaling sensors
<p>G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) are important therapeutic targets that exhibit functional selectivity (biased signaling), in which different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong>s or receptor variants elicit distinct downstream signaling. Understanding all the signaling events and biases that contribute to both the beneficial and adverse effects of GPCR stimulation by given <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong>s is important for drug discovery. Here, we report the design, validation, and use of pathway-selective bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) biosensors that monitor the engagement and activation of signaling effectors downstream of G proteins, including protein kinase C (PKC), phospholipase C (PLC), p63RhoGEF, and Rho. Combined with G protein and β-arrestin BRET biosensors, our sensors enabled real-time monitoring of GPCR signaling at different levels in downstream pathways in both native and engineered cells. Profiling of the responses to 14 angiotensin II (AngII) type 1 receptor (AT1R) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong>s enabled the clustering of compounds into different subfamilies of biased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong>s and showed that, in addition to the previously reported functional selectivity between Gα<sub>q</sub> and β-arrestin, there are also biases among G protein subtypes. We also demonstrated that biases observed at the receptor and G protein levels propagated to downstream signaling pathways and that these biases could occur through the engagement of different G proteins to activate a common effector. We also used these tools to determine how naturally occurring AT1R variants affected signaling bias. This suite of BRET biosensors provides a useful resource for fingerprinting biased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong>s and mutant receptors and for dissecting functional selectivity at various levels of GPCR signaling.</p>

Single-molecule diffusion-based estimation of ligand effects on G protein–coupled receptors
<p>G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) are major drug targets. Developing a method to measure the activities of GPCRs is essential for pharmacology and drug screening. However, it is difficult to measure the effects of a drug by monitoring the receptor on the cell surface; thus, changes in the concentrations of downstream signaling molecules, which depend on the signaling pathway selectivity of the receptor, are often used as an index of receptor activity. We show that single-molecule imaging analysis provides an alternative method for assessing the effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong>s on GPCRs. Using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM), we monitored the dynamics of the diffusion of metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 (mGluR3), a class C GPCR, under various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong> conditions. Our single-molecule tracking analysis demonstrated that increases and decreases in the average diffusion coefficient of mGluR3 quantitatively reflected the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong>-dependent inactivation and activation of receptors, respectively. Through experiments with inhibitors and dual-color single-molecule imaging analysis, we found that the diffusion of receptor molecules was altered by common physiological events associated with GPCRs, including G protein binding, and receptor accumulation in clathrin-coated pits. We also confirmed that agonist also decreased the average diffusion coefficient for class A and B GPCRs, demonstrating that this parameter is a good index for estimating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong> effects on many GPCRs regardless of their phylogenetic groups, the chemical properties of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong>s, or G protein–coupling selectivity.</p>

Observation of the Wigner-Huntington transition to metallic hydrogen
<p>Producing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>lic hydrogen has been a great challenge in condensed matter physics. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>lic hydrogen may be a room-temperature superconductor and metastable when the pressure is released and could have an important impact on energy and rocketry. We have studied solid molecular hydrogen under pressure at low temperatures. At a pressure of 495 gigapascals, hydrogen becomes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>lic, with reflectivity as high as 0.91. We fit the reflectance using a Drude free-electron model to determine the plasma frequency of 32.5 ± 2.1 electron volts at a temperature of 5.5 kelvin, with a corresponding electron carrier density of 7.7 ± 1.1 × 10<sup>23</sup> particles per cubic centimeter, which is consistent with theoretical estimates of the atomic density. The properties are those of an atomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>.

Metal Tolerance Protein 8 Mediates Manganese Homeostasis and Iron Reallocation during Seed Development and Germination
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> accumulation in seeds is a prerequisite for germination and establishment of plants but also for micronutrient delivery to humans. To investigate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> transport processes and their interactions in seeds, we focused on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> TOLERANCE PROTEIN8 (MTP8), a tonoplast transporter of the manganese (Mn) subclade of cation diffusion facilitators, which in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) is expressed in embryos of seeds. The x-ray fluorescence imaging showed that expression of MTP8 was responsible for Mn localization in subepidermal cells on the abaxial side of the cotyledons and in cortical cells of the hypocotyl. Accordingly, under low Mn availability, MTP8 increased seed stores of Mn, required for efficient seed germination. In mutant embryos lacking expression of <i>VACUOLAR IRON TRANSPORTER1</i> (<i>VIT1</i>), MTP8 built up iron (Fe) hotspots in <i>MTP8</i>-expressing cells types, suggesting that MTP8 transports Fe in addition to Mn. In <i>mtp8 vit1</i> double mutant seeds, Mn and Fe were distributed in all cell types of the embryo. An Fe transport function of MTP8 was confirmed by its ability to complement Fe hypersensitivity of a yeast mutant defective in vacuolar Fe transport. Imbibing <i>mtp8-1</i> mutant seeds in the presence of Mn or subjecting seeds to wet-dry cycles showed that MTP8 conferred Mn tolerance. During germination, MTP8 promoted reallocation of Fe from the vasculature. These results indicate that cell type-specific accumulation of Mn and Fe in seeds depends on MTP8 and that this transporter plays an important role in the generation of seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> stores as well as for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> homeostasis and germination efficiency under challenging environmental conditions.</p>

Ligand-dependent Notch signaling strength orchestrates lateral induction and lateral inhibition in the developing inner ear
<p>During inner ear development, Notch exhibits two modes of operation: lateral induction, which is associated with prosensory specification, and lateral inhibition, which is involved in hair cell determination. These mechanisms depend respectively on two different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong>s, jagged 1 (Jag1) and delta 1 (Dl1), that rely on a common signaling cascade initiated after Notch activation. In the chicken otocyst, expression of Jag1 and the Notch target Hey1 correlates well with lateral induction, whereas both Jag1 and Dl1 are expressed during lateral inhibition, as are Notch targets Hey1 and Hes5. Here, we show that Jag1 drives lower levels of Notch activity than Dl1, which results in the differential expression of Hey1 and Hes5. In addition, Jag1 interferes with the ability of Dl1 to elicit high levels of Notch activity. Modeling the sensory epithelium when the two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong>s are expressed together shows that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong> regulation, differential signaling strength and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong> competition are crucial to allow the two modes of operation and for establishing the alternate pattern of hair cells and supporting cells. Jag1, while driving lateral induction on its own, facilitates patterning by lateral inhibition in the presence of Dl1. This novel behavior emerges from Jag1 acting as a competitive inhibitor of Dl1 for Notch signaling. Both modeling and experiments show that hair cell patterning is very robust. The model suggests that autoactivation of proneural factor Atoh1, upstream of Dl1, is a fundamental component for robustness. The results stress the importance of the levels of Notch signaling and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong> competition for Notch function.</p>

A disease-linked <i>ULBP6</i> polymorphism inhibits NKG2D-mediated target cell killing by enhancing the stability of NKG2D ligand binding
<p>NKG2D (natural killer group 2, member D) is an activating receptor found on the surface of immune cells, including natural killer (NK) cells, which regulates innate and adaptive immunity through recognition of the stress-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong>s ULBP1 (UL16 binding protein 1) to ULBP6 and MICA/B. Similar to class I human leukocyte antigen (HLA), these NKG2D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong>s have a major histocompatibility complex–like fold and exhibit pronounced polymorphism, which influences human disease susceptibility. However, whereas class I HLA polymorphisms occur predominantly in the α1α2 groove and affect antigen binding, the effects of most NKG2D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong> polymorphisms are unclear. We studied the molecular and functional consequences of the two major alleles of <i>ULBP6</i>, the most polymorphic <i>ULBP</i> gene, which are associated with autoimmunity and relapse after stem cell transplantation. Surface plasmon resonance and crystallography studies revealed that the arginine-to-leucine polymorphism within ULBP0602 affected the NKG2D-ULBP6 interaction by generating an energetic hotspot. This resulted in an NKG2D-ULBP0602 affinity of 15.5 nM, which is 10- to 1000-fold greater than the affinities of other ULBP-NKG2D interactions and limited NKG2D-mediated activation. In addition, soluble ULBP0602 exhibited high-affinity competitive binding for NKG2D and partially suppressed NKG2D-mediated activation of NK cells by other NKG2D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong>s. These effects resulted in a decrease in a range of NKG2D-mediated effector functions. Our results reveal that <i>ULBP</i> polymorphisms affect the strength of human lymphocyte responses to cellular stress signals and may offer opportunities for therapeutic intervention.</p>

Isostructural metal-insulator transition in VO<sub>2</sub>
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>-insulator transition in correlated materials is usually coupled to a symmetry-lowering structural phase transition. This coupling not only complicates the understanding of the basic mechanism of this phenomenon but also limits the speed and endurance of prospective electronic devices. We demonstrate an isostructural, purely electronically driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>-insulator transition in epitaxial heterostructures of an archetypal correlated material, vanadium dioxide. A combination of thin-film synthesis, structural and electrical characterizations, and theoretical modeling reveals that an interface interaction suppresses the electronic correlations without changing the crystal structure in this otherwise correlated insulator. This interaction stabilizes a nonequilibrium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>lic phase and leads to an isostructural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>-insulator transition. This discovery will provide insights into phase transitions of correlated materials and may aid the design of device functionalities.</p>

Colossal grain growth yields single-crystal metal foils by contact-free annealing
<p>Single-crystal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s have distinctive properties owing to the absence of grain boundaries and strong anisotropy. Commercial single-crystal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s are usually synthesized by bulk crystal growth or by deposition of thin films onto substrates, and they are expensive and small. We prepared extremely large single-crystal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> foils by “contact-free annealing” from commercial polycrystalline foils. The colossal grain growth (up to 32 square centimeters) is achieved by minimizing contact stresses, resulting in a preferred in-plane and out-of-plane crystal orientation, and is driven by surface energy minimization during the rotation of the crystal lattice followed by “consumption” of neighboring grains. Industrial-scale production of single-crystal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> foils is possible as a result of this discovery.</p>

Heterobiaryl synthesis by contractive C–C coupling via P(V) intermediates

The process starts by regioselective phosphorus substitution of the C–H bonds para to nitrogen in two successive heterocycles; <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong> coupling is then triggered via acidic alcohol solutions to form the heterobiaryl bond. Mechanistic studies imply that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong> coupling is an asynchronous process involving migration of one heterocycle to the ipso position of the other around a central pentacoordinate P(V) atom. The strategy can be applied to complex drug-like molecules containing multiple reactive sites and polar functional groups, and also enables convergent coupling of drug fragments and late-stage heteroarylation of pharmaceuticals.</p>

<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alkalin</span></strong>e earth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr), and barium (Ba) typically engage in chemical bonding as classical main-group elements through their <i>n</i>s and <i>n</i>p valence orbitals, where <i>n</i> is the principal quantum number. Here we report the isolation and spectroscopic characterization of eight-coordinate carbonyl complexes M(CO)<sub>8</sub> (where M = Ca, Sr, or Ba) in a low-temperature neon matrix. Analysis of the electronic structure of these cubic <i>O<sub>h</sub></i>-symmetric complexes reveals that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>–carbon monoxide (CO) bonds arise mainly from [M(d<sub>π</sub>)] → (CO)<sub>8</sub> π backdonation, which explains the strong observed red shift of the C-O stretching frequencies. The corresponding radical cation complexes were also prepared in gas phase and characterized by mass-selected infrared photodissociation spectroscopy, confirming adherence to the 18-electron rule more conventionally associated with transition <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> chemistry.</p>

Insulator-metal transition in dense fluid deuterium
<p>Dense fluid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>lic hydrogen occupies the interiors of Jupiter, Saturn, and many extrasolar planets, where pressures reach millions of atmospheres. Planetary structure models must describe accurately the transition from the outer molecular envelopes to the interior <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>lic regions. We report optical measurements of dynamically compressed fluid deuterium to 600 gigapascals (GPa) that reveal an increasing refractive index, the onset of absorption of visible light near 150 GPa, and a transition to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>-like reflectivity (exceeding 30%) near 200 GPa, all at temperatures below 2000 kelvin. Our measurements and analysis address existing discrepancies between static and dynamic experiments for the insulator-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> transition in dense fluid hydrogen isotopes. They also provide new benchmarks for the theoretical calculations used to construct planetary models.</p>

Probing the ultimate plasmon confinement limits with a van der Waals heterostructure
<p>The ability to confine light into tiny spatial dimensions is important for applications such as microscopy, sensing, and nanoscale lasers. Although plasmons offer an appealing avenue to confine light, Landau damping in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s imposes a trade-off between optical field confinement and losses. We show that a graphene-insulator-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> heterostructure can overcome that trade-off, and demonstrate plasmon confinement down to the ultimate limit of the length scale of one atom. This is achieved through far-field excitation of plasmon modes squeezed into an atomically thin hexagonal boron nitride dielectric spacer between graphene and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> rods. A theoretical model that takes into account the nonlocal optical response of both graphene and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> is used to describe the results. These ultraconfined plasmonic modes, addressed with far-field light excitation, enable a route to new regimes of ultrastrong light-matter interactions.</p>

Catalytic molten metals for the direct conversion of methane to hydrogen and separable carbon
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s that are active catalysts for methane (Ni, Pt, Pd), when dissolved in inactive low–melting temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s (In, Ga, Sn, Pb), produce stable molten <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> alloy catalysts for pyrolysis of methane into hydrogen and carbon. All solid catalysts previously used for this reaction have been deactivated by carbon deposition. In the molten alloy system, the insoluble carbon floats to the surface where it can be skimmed off. A 27% Ni–73% Bi alloy achieved 95% methane conversion at 1065°C in a 1.1-meter bubble column and produced pure hydrogen without CO<sub>2</sub> or other by-products. Calculations show that the active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s in the molten alloys are atomically dispersed and negatively charged. There is a correlation between the amount of charge on the atoms and their catalytic activity.</p>

Large gem diamonds from metallic liquid in Earth’s deep mantle
<p>The redox state of Earth’s convecting mantle, masked by the lithospheric plates and basaltic magmatism of plate tectonics, is a key unknown in the evolutionary history of our planet. Here we report that large, exceptional gem diamonds like the Cullinan, Constellation, and Koh-i-Noor carry direct evidence of crystallization from a redox-sensitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>lic liquid phase in the deep mantle. These sublithospheric diamonds contain inclusions of solidified iron-nickel-carbon-sulfur melt, accompanied by a thin fluid layer of methane ± hydrogen, and sometimes majoritic garnet or former calcium silicate perovskite. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>-dominated mineral assemblages and reduced volatiles in large gem diamonds indicate formation under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>-saturated conditions. We verify previous predictions that Earth has highly reducing deep mantle regions capable of precipitating a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>lic iron phase that contains dissolved carbon and hydrogen.</p>

Coordination-induced weakening of ammonia, water, and hydrazine X–H bonds in a molybdenum complex
<p>Although scores of transition <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> complexes incorporating ammonia or water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong>s have been characterized over the past century, little is known about how coordination influences the strength of the nitrogen-hydrogen and oxygen-hydrogen bonds. Here we report the synthesis of a molybdenum ammonia complex supported by terpyridine and phosphine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong>s that lowers the nitrogen-hydrogen bond dissociation free energy from 99.5 (gas phase) to an experimentally measured value of 45.8 kilocalories per mole (agreeing closely with a value of 45.1 kilocalories per mole calculated by density functional theory). This bond weakening enables spontaneous dihydrogen evolution upon gentle heating, as well as the hydrogenation of styrene. Analogous molybdenum complexes promote dihydrogen evolution from coordinated water and hydrazine. Electrochemical and theoretical studies elucidate the contributions of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> redox potential and ammonia acidity to this effect.</p>

Photochemical Route for Accessing Amorphous Metal Oxide Materials for Water Oxidation Catalysis
<sec><title>Amorphous and More Active</title><p>The electrochemical generation of hydrogen from water could help in the storage of energy generated by renewable resources at off-peak times.

Evolution of human, chicken, alligator, frog, and zebrafish mineralocorticoid receptors: Allosteric influence on steroid specificity
<p>Although multiple steroid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong>s of the glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid, and progestin families bind to and regulate the activity of mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs), the responses to these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong>s differ across species. To understand how the different domains of MRs contribute to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong>-induced activation or inhibition of MR activity, we studied the response to eight steroids (aldosterone, 11-deoxycorticosterone, 11-deoxycortisol, cortisol, corticosterone, progesterone, 19-norprogesterone, and spironolactone) of human, chicken, alligator, frog, and zebrafish full-length MRs and truncated MRs, which lacked the N-terminal domain (NTD) and DNA binding domain (DBD). Compared to full-length MRs, some truncated MRs were not activated by the steroids, and others required higher steroid concentrations for activation. Progesterone, 19-norprogesterone, and spironolactone did not activate full-length or truncated human, alligator, or frog MRs. However, at 10 nM, these steroids activated full-length chicken and zebrafish MRs, whereas at 100 nM, these steroids had little activity for truncated chicken MRs, but they retained activity for truncated zebrafish MRs. This suggests that regulation of the activation of the chicken MR by progestin resides in the NTD-DBD and that of the zebrafish MR resides in the hinge-LBD. Zebrafish and chicken MRs contain a serine corresponding to Ser<sup>810</sup> in human MR, which is required for the antagonist activity of progesterone for human MR, suggesting a previously uncharacterized mechanism of regulation of progestin activation of chicken and zebrafish MRs. These findings suggest that progesterone may be a physiological activator of chicken and zebrafish MRs.</p>

Quantitative single-molecule imaging of TLR4 reveals ligand-specific receptor dimerization
<p>In humans, invading pathogens are recognized by Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Upon recognition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) derived from the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria, TLR4 dimerizes and can stimulate two different signaling pathways, the proinflammatory, MyD88-dependent pathway and the antiviral, MyD88-independent pathway. The balance between these two pathways is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong>-dependent, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong> composition determines whether the invading pathogen activates or evades the host immune response. We investigated the dimerization behavior of TLR4 in intact cells in response to different LPS chemotypes through quantitative single-molecule localization microscopy. Quantitative superresolved data showed that TLR4 was monomeric in the absence of its co-receptors MD2 and CD14 in transfected HEK 293 cells. When TLR4 was present together with MD2 and CD14 but in the absence of LPS, 52% of the receptors were monomeric and 48% were dimeric. LPS from <i>Escherichia coli</i> or <i>Salmonella minnesota</i> caused the formation of dimeric TLR4 complexes, whereas the antagonistic LPS chemotype from <i>Rhodobacter sphaeroides</i> maintained TLR4 in monomeric form at the cell surface. Furthermore, we showed that LPS-dependent dimerization was required for the activation of NF-κB signaling. Together, these data demonstrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong>-dependent dimerization of TLR4 in the cellular environment, which could pave the way for a molecular understanding of biased signaling downstream of the receptor.</p>

A natural ligand for the orphan receptor GPR15 modulates lymphocyte recruitment to epithelia
<p>GPR15 is an orphan G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) that is found in lymphocytes. It functions as a co-receptor of simian immunodeficiency virus and HIV-2 and plays a role in the trafficking of T cells to the lamina propria in the colon and to the skin. We describe the purification from porcine colonic tissue extracts of an agonistic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong> for GPR15 and its functional characterization. In humans, this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong>, which we named GPR15L, is encoded by the gene <i>C10ORF99</i> and has some features similar to the CC family of chemokines. <i>GPR15L</i> was found in some human and mouse epithelia exposed to the environment, such as the colon and skin. In humans, <i>GPR15L</i> was also abundant in the cervix. In skin, <i>GPR15L</i> was readily detected after immunologic challenge and in human disease, for example, in psoriatic lesions. Allotransplantation of skin from <i>Gpr15l</i>-deficient mice onto wild-type mice resulted in substantial graft protection, suggesting nonredundant roles for GPR15 and GPR15L in the generation of effector T cell responses. Together, these data identify a receptor-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong> pair that is required for immune homeostasis at epithelia and whose modulation may represent an alternative approach to treating conditions affecting the skin such as psoriasis.</p>

Ligand-activated Notch undergoes DTX4-mediated ubiquitylation and bilateral endocytosis before ADAM10 processing
<p>The Notch signaling pathway, which is activated by cell-cell contact, is a major regulator of cell fate decisions. Mammalian Notch1 is present at the cell surface as a heterodimer of the Notch extracellular domain associated with the transmembrane and intracellular domains. After <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong> binding, Notch undergoes proteolysis, releasing the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) that regulates gene expression. We monitored the early steps of activation with biochemical analysis, immunofluorescence analysis, and live-cell imaging of Notch1-expressing cells. We found that, upon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong> binding, Notch1 at the cell surface was ubiquitylated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase DTX4. This ubiquitylation event led to the internalization of the Notch1 extracellular domain by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong>-expressing cell and the internalization of the membrane-anchored fragment of Notch1 and DTX4 by the Notch1-expressing cell, which we referred to as bilateral endocytosis. ADAM10 generates a cleavage product of Notch that is necessary for the formation of the NICD, which has been thought to occur at the cell surface. However, we found that blocking dynamin-mediated endocytosis of Notch1 and DTX4 reduced the colocalization of Notch1 with ADAM10 and the formation of the ADAM10-generated cleavage product of Notch1, suggesting that ADAM10 functions in an intracellular compartment to process Notch. Thus, this study suggests that a specific pool of ADAM10 acts on Notch in an endocytic compartment, rather than at the cell surface.</p>

<i>Arabidopsis</i> pollen tube integrity and sperm release are regulated by RALF-mediated signaling
<p>In flowering plants, fertilization requires complex cell-to-cell communication events between the pollen tube and the female reproductive tissues, which are controlled by extracellular signaling molecules interacting with receptors at the pollen tube surface. We found that two such receptors in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, BUPS1 and BUPS2, and their peptide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong>s, RALF4 and RALF19, are pollen tube–expressed and are required to maintain pollen tube integrity. BUPS1 and BUPS2 interact with receptors ANXUR1 and ANXUR2 via their ectodomains, and both sets of receptors bind RALF4 and RALF19. These receptor-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong> interactions are in competition with the female-derived <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong> RALF34, which induces pollen tube bursting at nanomolar concentrations. We propose that RALF34 replaces RALF4 and RALF19 at the interface of pollen tube–female gametophyte contact, thereby deregulating BUPS-ANXUR signaling and in turn leading to pollen tube rupture and sperm release.</p>

Synthesis of ultrasmall, homogeneously alloyed, bimetallic nanoparticles on silica supports
<p>Supported nanoparticles containing more than one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> have a variety of applications in sensing, catalysis, and biomedicine. Common synthesis techniques for this type of material often result in large, unalloyed nanoparticles that lack the interactions between the two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s that give the particles their desired characteristics. We demonstrate a relatively simple, effective, generalizable method to produce highly dispersed, well-alloyed bi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>lic nanoparticles. Ten permutations of noble and base <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s (platinum, palladium, copper, nickel, and cobalt) were synthesized with average particle sizes from 0.9 to 1.4 nanometers, with tight size distributions. High-resolution imaging and x-ray analysis confirmed the homogeneity of alloying in these ultrasmall nanoparticles.</p>

The structural basis of flagellin detection by NAIP5: A strategy to limit pathogen immune evasion
<p>Robust innate immune detection of rapidly evolving pathogens is critical for host defense. Nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins function as cytosolic innate immune sensors in plants and animals. However, the structural basis for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong>-induced NLR activation has so far remained unknown. NAIP5 (NLR family, apoptosis inhibitory protein 5) binds the bacterial protein flagellin and assembles with NLRC4 to form a multiprotein complex called an inflammasome. Here we report the cryo–electron microscopy structure of the assembled ~1.4-megadalton flagellin-NAIP5-NLRC4 inflammasome, revealing how a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong> activates an NLR. Six distinct NAIP5 domains contact multiple conserved regions of flagellin, prying NAIP5 into an open and active conformation. We show that innate immune recognition of multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong> surfaces is a generalizable strategy that limits pathogen evolution and immune escape.</p>

A liquid metal reaction environment for the room-temperature synthesis of atomically thin metal oxides
<p>Two-dimensional (2D) oxides have a wide variety of applications in electronics and other technologies. However, many oxides are not easy to synthesize as 2D materials through conventional methods. We used nontoxic eutectic gallium-based alloys as a reaction solvent and co-alloyed desired <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s into the melt. On the basis of thermodynamic considerations, we predicted the composition of the self-limiting interfacial oxide. We isolated the surface oxide as a 2D layer, either on substrates or in suspension. This enabled us to produce extremely thin subnanometer layers of HfO<sub>2</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and Gd<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. The liquid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>–based reaction route can be used to create 2D materials that were previously inaccessible with preexisting methods. The work introduces room-temperature liquid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s as a reaction environment for the synthesis of oxide nanomaterials with low dimensionality.</p>

Mechanism of transmembrane signaling by sensor histidine kinases
<p>One of the major and essential classes of transmembrane (TM) receptors, present in all domains of life, is sensor histidine kinases, parts of two-component signaling systems (TCSs). The structural mechanisms of TM signaling by these sensors are poorly understood. We present crystal structures of the periplasmic sensor domain, the TM domain, and the cytoplasmic HAMP domain of the <i>Escherichia coli</i> nitrate/nitrite sensor histidine kinase NarQ in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong>-bound and mutated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong>-free states. The structures reveal that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong> binding induces rearrangements and pistonlike shifts of TM helices. The HAMP domain protomers undergo leverlike motions and convert these pistonlike motions into helical rotations. Our findings provide the structural framework for complete understanding of TM TCS signaling and for development of antimicrobial treatments targeting TCSs.</p>

A parity-breaking electronic nematic phase transition in the spin-orbit coupled metal Cd<sub>2</sub>Re<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>
<p>Strong electron interactions can drive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>lic systems toward a variety of well-known symmetry-broken phases, but the instabilities of correlated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s with strong spin-orbit coupling have only recently begun to be explored. We uncovered a multipolar nematic phase of matter in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>lic pyrochlore Cd<sub>2</sub>Re<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> using spatially resolved second-harmonic optical anisotropy measurements. Like previously discovered electronic nematic phases, this multipolar phase spontaneously breaks rotational symmetry while preserving translational invariance. However, it has the distinguishing property of being odd under spatial inversion, which is allowed only in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. By examining the critical behavior of the multipolar nematic order parameter, we show that it drives the thermal phase transition near 200 kelvin in Cd<sub>2</sub>Re<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> and induces a parity-breaking lattice distortion as a secondary order.</p>

Grain boundary stability governs hardening and softening in extremely fine nanograined metals
<p>Conventional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s become harder with decreasing grain sizes, following the classical Hall-Petch relationship. However, this relationship fails and softening occurs at some grain sizes in the nanometer regime for some alloys. In this study, we discovered that plastic deformation mechanism of extremely fine nanograined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s and their hardness are adjustable through tailoring grain boundary (GB) stability. The electrodeposited nanograined nickel-molybdenum (Ni–Mo) samples become softened for grain sizes below 10 nanometers because of GB-mediated processes. With GB stabilization through relaxation and Mo segregation, ultrahigh hardness is achieved in the nanograined samples with a plastic deformation mechanism dominated by generation of extended partial dislocations. Grain boundary stability provides an alternative dimension, in addition to grain size, for producing novel nanograined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s with extraordinary properties.</p>

Root diffusion barrier control by a vasculature-derived peptide binding to the SGN3 receptor
<p>The root endodermis forms its extracellular diffusion barrier by developing ringlike impregnations called Casparian strips. A factor responsible for their establishment is the SCHENGEN3/GASSHO1 (SGN3/GSO1) receptor-like kinase. Its loss of function causes discontinuous Casparian strips. SGN3 also mediates endodermal overlignification of other Casparian strip mutants. Yet, without <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong>, SGN3 function remained elusive. Here we report that <i>schengen2 (sgn2)</i> is defective in an enzyme sulfating peptide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong>s. On the basis of this observation, we identified two stele-expressed peptides (CASPARIAN STRIP INTEGRITY FACTORS, CIF1/2) that complement <i>sgn2</i> at nanomolar concentrations and induce Casparian strip mislocalization as well as overlignification—all of which depend on SGN3. Direct peptide binding to recombinant SGN3 identifies these peptides as SGN3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong>s. We speculate that CIF1/2-SGN3 is part of a barrier surveillance system, evolved to guarantee effective sealing of the supracellular Casparian strip network.</p>

Principles for designing proteins with cavities formed by curved β sheets
<p>Active sites and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong>-binding cavities in native proteins are often formed by curved β sheets, and the ability to control β-sheet curvature would allow design of binding proteins with cavities customized to specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong>s. Toward this end, we investigated the mechanisms controlling β-sheet curvature by studying the geometry of β sheets in naturally occurring protein structures and folding simulations. The principles emerging from this analysis were used to design, de novo, a series of proteins with curved β sheets topped with α helices. Nuclear magnetic resonance and crystal structures of the designs closely match the computational models, showing that β-sheet curvature can be controlled with atomic-level accuracy. Our approach enables the design of proteins with cavities and provides a route to custom design <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong>-binding and catalytic sites.</p>

Braiding a molecular knot with eight crossings
<p>Knots may ultimately prove just as versatile and useful at the nanoscale as at the macroscale. However, the lack of synthetic routes to all but the simplest molecular knots currently prevents systematic investigation of the influence of knotting at the molecular level. We found that it is possible to assemble four building blocks into three braided <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong> strands. Octahedral iron(II) ions control the relative positions of the three strands at each crossing point in a circular triple helicate, while structural constraints on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ligand</span></strong>s determine the braiding connections. This approach enables two-step assembly of a molecular 8<sub>19</sub> knot featuring eight nonalternating crossings in a 192-atom closed loop ~20 nanometers in length. The resolved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>-free 8<sub>19</sub> knot enantiomers have pronounced features in their circular dichroism spectra resulting solely from topological chirality.</p>

Which factors influence the rate of failure following metal-on-metal hip arthroplasty revision surgery performed for adverse reactions to metal debris?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To determine the outcomes following revision surgery of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>-on-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>   hip arthroplasties (MoMHA) performed for adverse reactions to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>   debris (ARMD), and to identify factors predictive of re-revision.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We performed a retrospective observational study using National   Joint Registry (NJR) data on 2535 MoMHAs undergoing revision surgery   for ARMD between 2008 and 2014. The outcomes studied following revision were   intra-operative complications, mortality and re-revision surgery.   Predictors of re-revision were identified using competing-risk regression   modelling.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Intra-operative complications occurred in 40 revisions (1.6%).   The cumulative five-year patient survival rate was 95.9% (95% confidence   intervals (CI) 92.3 to 97.8). Re-revision surgery was performed   in 192 hips (7.6%). The cumulative five-year implant survival rate   was 89.5% (95% CI 87.3 to 91.3). Predictors of re-revision were   high body mass index at revision (subhazard ratio (SHR) 1.06 per   kg/m<sup>2 </sup>increase, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.09), modular component   only revisions (head and liner with or without taper adapter; SHR   2.01, 95% CI 1.19 to 3.38), ceramic-on-ceramic revision bearings   (SHR 1.86, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.80), and acetabular bone grafting (SHR   2.10, 95% CI 1.43 to 3.07).

Extracellular Matrix Proteomics Reveals Interplay of Aggrecan and Aggrecanases in Vascular Remodeling of Stented Coronary Arteries
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling contributes to in-stent restenosis and thrombosis. Despite its important clinical implications, little is known about ECM changes post–stent implantation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Bare-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> and drug-eluting stents were implanted in pig coronary arteries with an overstretch under optical coherence tomography guidance. Stented segments were harvested 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28 days post-stenting for proteomics analysis of the media and neointima.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 151 ECM and ECM-associated proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. After stent implantation, proteins involved in regulating calcification were upregulated in the neointima of drug-eluting stents. The earliest changes in the media were proteins involved in inflammation and thrombosis, followed by changes in regulatory ECM proteins. By day 28, basement membrane proteins were reduced in drug-eluting stents in comparison with bare-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> stents. In contrast, the large aggregating proteoglycan aggrecan was increased. Aggrecanases of the ADAMTS (a disintegrin and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>loproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) family contribute to the catabolism of vascular proteoglycans. An increase in ADAMTS-specific aggrecan fragments was accompanied by a notable shift from <i>ADAMTS1</i> and <i>ADAMTS5</i> to <i>ADAMTS4</i> gene expression after stent implantation. Immunostaining in human stented coronary arteries confirmed the presence of aggrecan and aggrecan fragments, in particular, at the contacts of the stent struts with the artery. Further investigation of aggrecan presence in the human vasculature revealed that aggrecan and aggrecan cleavage were more abundant in human arteries than in human veins. In addition, aggrecan synthesis was induced on grafting a vein into the arterial circulation, suggesting an important role for aggrecan in vascular plasticity. Finally, lack of ADAMTS-5 activity in mice resulted in an accumulation of aggrecan and a dilation of the thoracic aorta, confirming that aggrecanase activity regulates aggrecan abundance in the arterial wall and contributes to vascular remodeling.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Significant differences were identified by proteomics in the ECM of coronary arteries after bare-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> and drug-eluting stent implantation, most notably an upregulation of aggrecan, a major ECM component of cartilaginous tissues that confers resistance to compression. The accumulation of aggrecan coincided with a shift in <i>ADAMTS</i> gene expression. This study provides the first evidence implicating aggrecan and aggrecanases in the vascular injury response after stenting.</p></sec>

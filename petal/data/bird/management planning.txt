<i>ELIGULUM-A</i> Regulates Lateral Branch and Leaf Development in Barley
<p>The shoot apical and axillary meristems control shoot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, effectively influencing lateral branch and leaf formation. The barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) <i>uniculm2</i> (<i>cul2</i>) mutation blocks axillary meristem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, and mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts lack lateral branches (tillers) that normally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong> from the crown. A genetic screen for <i>cul2</i> suppressors recovered two recessive alleles of <i>ELIGULUM-A</i> (<i>ELI-A</i>) that partially rescued the <i>cul2</i> tillering phenotype. Mutations in <i>ELI-A</i> produce shorter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts with fewer tillers and disrupt the leaf blade-sheath boundary, producing liguleless leaves and reduced secondary cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in stems and leaves. <i>ELI-A</i> is predicted to encode an unannotated protein containing an RNaseH-like domain that is conserved in land <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts. <i>ELI-A</i> transcripts accumulate at the preligule boundary, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing ligule, leaf margins, cells destined to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong> secondary cell walls, and cells surrounding leaf vascular bundles. Recent studies have identified regulatory similarities between boundary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in leaves and lateral organs. Interestingly, we observed <i>ELI-A</i> transcripts at the preligule boundary, suggesting that <i>ELI-A</i> contributes to boundary formation between the blade and sheath. However, we did not observe <i>ELI-A</i> transcripts at the axillary meristem boundary in leaf axils, suggesting that <i>ELI-A</i> is not involved in boundary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment for axillary meristem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Our results show that <i>ELI-A</i> contributes to leaf and lateral branch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment by acting as a boundary gene during ligule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment but not during lateral branch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment.</p>

Transcription Factor OsTGA10 Is a Target of the MADS Protein OsMADS8 and Is Required for Tapetum Development
<p>This study aimed at elucidating regulatory components behind floral organ identity determination and tissue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. It remains unclear how organ identity proteins facilitate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of organ primordia into tissues with a determined identity, even though it has long been accepted that floral organ identity is genetically determined by interaction of identity genes according to the ABC model. Using the chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing technique, we identified <i>OsTGA10</i>, encoding a bZIP transcription factor, as a target of the MADS box protein OsMADS8, which is annotated as an E-class organ identity protein. We characterized the function of OsTGA10 using genetic and molecular analyses. <i>OsTGA10</i> was preferentially expressed during stamen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, and mutation of <i>OsTGA10</i> resulted in male sterility. OsTGA10 was required for tapetum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and functioned by interacting with known tapetum genes. In addition, in <i>ostga10</i> stamens, the hallmark cell wall thickening of the endothecium was defective. Our findings suggest that OsTGA10 plays a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mediat</span></strong>or role between organ identity determination and tapetum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in rice stamen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, between tapetum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and microspore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, and between various regulatory components required for tapetum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Furthermore, the defective endothecium in <i>ostga10</i> implies that cell wall thickening of endothecium is dependent on tapetum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment.</p>

<i>PINOID</i> Is Required for Formation of the Stigma and Style in Rice
<p>The stigma is the entry point for sexual reproduction in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts, but the mechanisms underlying stigma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment are largely unknown. Here, we disrupted putative auxin biosynthetic and signaling genes to evaluate their roles in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Disruption of the rice <i>PINOID</i> (<i>OsPID</i>) gene completely eliminated the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of stigmas, and overexpression of <i>OsPID</i> led to overproliferation of stigmas, suggesting that <i>OsPID</i> is a key determinant for stigma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Interestingly, <i>ospid</i> mutants did not display defects in flower initiation, nor did they <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong> any pin-like inflorescences, a characteristic phenotype observed in <i>pid</i> mutants in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). We constructed double mutants of <i>OsPID</i> and its closest homolog, <i>OsPIDb</i>, yet the double mutants still did not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong> any pin-like inflorescences, indicating that either <i>ospid</i> is compensated by additional homologous genes or <i>OsPID</i> has different functions in rice compared with <i>PID</i> in other organisms. We then knocked out one of the <i>NAKED PINS IN YUC MUTANTS</i> (<i>NPY</i>) genes, which cause the formation of pin-like inflorescences in Arabidopsis when compromised, in the <i>ospid</i> background. The <i>ospid osnpy2</i> double mutants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ed pin-like inflorescences, which were phenotypically similar to <i>pid</i> mutants in Arabidopsis and maize, demonstrating that the roles of <i>OsPID</i> in inflorescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment are likely masked by redundant partners. This work identified a key determinant for stigma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in rice and revealed a complex picture of the <i>PID</i> gene in rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Furthermore, the stigma-less <i>ospid</i> mutants are potentially useful in producing hybrid rice.</p>

Importin β4 Mediates Nuclear Import of GRF-Interacting Factors to Control Ovule Development in Arabidopsis
<p>Ovule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment is critical for seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t reproduction. Multiple transcription factors (TFs) have been reported to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mediat</span></strong>e ovule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. However, it is not clear which intracellular components regulate these TFs during ovule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. After their synthesis, TFs are transported into the nucleus a process regulated by karyopherins commonly known as importin alpha and β. Around half of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) importin β-coding genes have been functionally characterized but only two with specific cargos have been identified. We report here that Arabidopsis IMPORTIN β4 (IMB4) regulates ovule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment through nucleocytoplasmic transport of transcriptional coactivator growth regulating factors–interacting factors (GIFs). Mutations in <i>IMB4</i> impaired ovule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment by affecting integument growth. <i>imb4</i> mutants were also defective in embryo sac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, leading to partial female sterility. IMB4 directly interacts with GIFs and is critical for the nucleocytoplasmic transport of GIF1. Finally, functional loss of <i>GIF</i>s resulted in ovule defects similar to those in <i>imb4</i> mutants, whereas enhanced expression of <i>GIF1</i> partially restored the fertility of <i>imb4</i>. The results presented here uncover a novel genetic pathway regulating ovule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and reveal the upstream regulator of GIFs.</p>

Jasmonate Negatively Regulates Stomatal Development in Arabidopsis Cotyledons
<p>Stomata are ports that facilitate gas and water vapor exchange between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts and their environment. Stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment is strictly regulated by endogenous signals and environmental cues. Jasmonate is an important signal that modulates multiple physiological processes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying its interactions with other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>mental signaling pathways remain poorly understood. Here, we show that jasmonate negatively regulates stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) cotyledons. Cotyledons of the wild type and stomata-overproliferating mutants (such as <i>too many mouths-1</i> and <i>stomatal density and distribution1-1</i>) treated with methyl jasmonate exhibit a clear reduction in stomata number. By contrast, blocking endogenous jasmonate biosynthesis or perception enhanced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Moreover, three MYC transcription factors involved in jasmonate signaling, MYC2, MYC3, and MYC4, were found to redundantly modulate jasmonate-inhibited stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. A genetic analysis showed that these MYC proteins act upstream of the SPEECHLESS and FAMA transcription factors to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mediat</span></strong>e stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Furthermore, jasmonate repression of stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment is dependent on these three MYC transcription factors, as stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of the <i>myc2 myc3 myc4</i> triple mutant was insensitive to methyl jasmonate treatment. Collectively, our study demonstrates that jasmonate and MYC transcription factors negatively regulate stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in Arabidopsis cotyledons.</p>

Fasting Versus Nonfasting and Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Accuracy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Recent recommendations favoring nonfasting lipid assessment may affect low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ation. The novel method of LDL-C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ation (LDL-C<sub>N</sub>) uses a flexible approach to derive patient-specific ratios of triglycerides to very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. This adaptability may confer an accuracy advantage in nonfasting patients over the fixed approach of the classic Friedewald method (LDL-C<sub>F</sub>).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used a US cross-sectional sample of 1 545  634 patients (959 153 fasting ≥10–12 hours; 586 481 nonfasting) from the second harvest of the Very Large Database of Lipids study to assess for the first time the impact of fasting status on novel LDL-C accuracy. Rapid ultracentrifugation was used to directly measure LDL-C content (LDL-C<sub>D</sub>). Accuracy was defined as the percentage of LDL-C<sub>D</sub> falling within an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated LDL-C (LDL-C<sub>N</sub> or LDL-C<sub>F</sub>) category by clinical cut points. For low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated LDL-C (<70 mg/dL), we evaluated accuracy by triglyceride levels. The magnitude of absolute and percent differences between LDL-C<sub>D</sub> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated LDL-C (LDL-C<sub>N</sub> or LDL-C<sub>F</sub>) was stratified by LDL-C and triglyceride categories.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In both fasting and nonfasting samples, accuracy was higher with the novel method across all clinical LDL-C categories (range, 87%–94%) compared with the Friedewald <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ation (range, 71%–93%; <i>P</i>≤0.001). With LDL-C <70 mg/dL, nonfasting LDL-C<sub>N</sub> accuracy (92%) was superior to LDL-C<sub>F</sub> accuracy (71%; <i>P</i><0.001). In this LDL-C range, 19% of fasting and 30% of nonfasting patients had differences ≥10 mg/dL between LDL-C<sub>F</sub> and LDL-C<sub>D</sub>, whereas only 2% and 3% of patients, respectively, had similar differences with novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ation. Accuracy of LDL-C <70 mg/dL further decreased as triglycerides increased, particularly for Friedewald <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ation (range, 37%–96%) versus the novel method (range, 82%–94%). With triglycerides of 200 to 399 mg/dL in nonfasting patients, LDL-C<sub>N</sub> <70 mg/dL accuracy (82%) was superior to LDL-C<sub>F</sub> (37%; <i>P</i><0.001). In this triglyceride range, 73% of fasting and 81% of nonfasting patients had ≥10 mg/dL differences between LDL-C<sub>F</sub> and LDL-C<sub>D</sub> compared with 25% and 20% of patients, respectively, with LDL-C<sub>N</sub>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Novel adaptable LDL-C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ation performs better in nonfasting samples than the fixed Friedewald <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ation, with a particular accuracy advantage in settings of low LDL-C and high triglycerides.

MONENSIN SENSITIVITY1 (MON1)/CALCIUM CAFFEINE ZINC SENSITIVITY1 (CCZ1)-Mediated Rab7 Activation Regulates Tapetal Programmed Cell Death and Pollen Development
<p>Programmed cell death (PCD)-triggered degradation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t tapetum is essential for microspore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and pollen coat formation; however, little is known about the cellular mechanism regulating tapetal PCD. Here, we demonstrate that Rab7-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mediat</span></strong>ed vacuolar transport of tapetum degradation-related cysteine proteases is crucial for tapetal PCD and pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), with the following evidence: (1) The <i>monensin sensitivity1</i> (<i>mon1</i>) mutants, which are defective in Rab7 activation, showed impaired male fertility due to a combined defect in both tapetum and male gametophyte <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. (2) In anthers, <i>MON1</i> showed preferential high level expression in tapetal cell layers and pollen. (3) The <i>mon1</i> mutants exhibited delayed tapetum degeneration and tapetal PCD, resulting in abnormal pollen coat formation and decreased male fertility. (4) MON1/CALCIUM CAFFEINE ZINC SENSITIVITY1 (CCZ1)-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mediat</span></strong>ed Rab7 activation was indispensable for vacuolar trafficking of tapetum degradation-related cysteine proteases, supporting that PCD-triggered tapetum degeneration requires Rab7-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mediat</span></strong>ed vacuolar trafficking of these cysteine proteases. (5) <i>MON1</i> mutations also resulted in defective pollen germination and tube growth. Taken together, tapetal PCD and pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment require successful MON1/CCZ1-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mediat</span></strong>ed vacuolar transport in Arabidopsis.</p>

Non-invasive long-term fluorescence live imaging of <i>Tribolium castaneum</i> embryos
<p>Insect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment has contributed significantly to our understanding of metazoan <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. However, most information has been obtained by analyzing a single species, the fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Embryonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of the red flour beetle <i>Tribolium castaneum</i> differs fundamentally from that of <i>Drosophila</i> in aspects such as short-germ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, embryonic leg <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, extensive extra-embryonic membrane formation and non-involuted head <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Although <i>Tribolium</i> has become the second most important insect model organism, previous live imaging attempts have addressed only specific questions and no long-term live imaging data of <i>Tribolium</i> embryogenesis have been available. By combining light sheet-based fluorescence microscopy with a novel mounting method, we achieved complete, continuous and non-invasive fluorescence live imaging of <i>Tribolium</i> embryogenesis at high spatiotemporal resolution. The embryos survived the 2-day or longer imaging process, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ed into adults and produced fertile progeny. Our data document all morphogenetic processes from the rearrangement of the uniform blastoderm to the onset of regular muscular movement in the same embryo and in four orientations, contributing significantly to the understanding of <i>Tribolium</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Furthermore, we created a comprehensive chronological table of <i>Tribolium</i> embryogenesis, integrating most previous work and providing a reference for future studies. Based on our observations, we provide evidence that serosa window closure and serosa opening, although deferred by more than 1 day, are linked. All our long-term imaging datasets are available as a resource for the community. <i>Tribolium</i> is only the second insect species, after <i>Drosophila</i>, for which non-invasive long-term fluorescence live imaging has been achieved.</p>

WT1 regulates the development of the posterior taste field
<p>Despite the importance of taste in determining nutrient intake, our understanding of the processes that control the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of the peripheral taste system is lacking. Several early regulators of taste <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment have been identified, including sonic hedgehog, bone morphogenetic protein 4 and multiple members of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. However, the regulation of these factors, including their induction, remains poorly understood. Here, we identify a crucial role for the Wilms' tumor 1 protein (WT1) in circumvallate (CV) papillae <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. WT1 is a transcription factor that is important in the normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of multiple tissues, including both the olfactory and visual systems. In mice, WT1 expression is detectable by E12.5, when the CV taste placode begins to form. In mice lacking WT1, the CV fails to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong> normally and markers of early taste <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment are dysregulated compared with wild type. We demonstrate that expression of the WT1 target genes <i>Lef1</i>, <i>Ptch1</i> and <i>Bmp4</i> is significantly reduced in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing tongue tissue derived from <i>Wt1</i> knockout mice and that, in normal tongue, WT1 is bound to the promoter regions of these genes. Moreover, siRNA knockdown of WT1 in cultured taste cells leads to a reduction in the expression of <i>Lef1</i> and <i>Ptch1</i>. Our data identify WT1 as a crucial transcription factor in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of the CV through the regulation of multiple signaling pathways that have established roles in the formation and patterning of taste placodes.</p>

Toward a chemical vaccine for malaria
<p>Despite considerable progress in combating malaria, it remains one of the world's most important infectious diseases, with 50% of the world population at risk of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing the disease and a mortality rate of ∼0.5 million annually (<i>1</i>). The lack of an effective vaccine and the relentless ability of the <i>Plasmodium</i> parasite responsible for malaria to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong> drug resistance has contributed to the continuing disease burden (<i>2</i>–<i>4</i>). Artemisinin-combination therapies (ACTs) are the mainstay of current treatment regimens, but decreased effectiveness, particularly in Southeast Asia, threatens our ability to control this disease. A global effort to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong> new drugs for the treatment and prevention of malaria is under way but not guaranteed to succeed (<i>3</i>, <i>5</i>, <i>6</i>). These efforts include a systematic attempt to target all life-cycle stages of the parasite to allow combination therapies to be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ed, which are also likely to reduce the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of resistance. High-throughput screens (HTSs) designed to identify small drug-like molecules that prevent growth of blood-stage parasites (<i>7</i>, <i>8</i>) and target-based approaches have identified new compounds that are currently in preclinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and/or various stages of human clinical trials for treatment of malaria (<i>3</i>). Missing from these efforts has been a high-throughput technology to find liver stage–specific chemotypes. On page 1129 of this issue, Antonova-Koch <i>et al.</i> (<i>9</i>) report an HTS effort that has filled this gap. They identify a substantial number of new chemical starting points with potent liver-stage antimalarial activity, promising a new capacity to feed compounds through the drug <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment pipeline for chemoprotection.</p>

A High-Throughput, Field-Based Phenotyping Technology for Tall Biomass Crops
<p>Recent advances in omics technologies have not been accompanied by equally efficient, cost-effective, and accurate phenotyping methods required to dissect the genetic architecture of complex traits. Even though high-throughput phenotyping platforms have been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ed for controlled environments, field-based aerial and ground technologies have only been designed and deployed for short-stature crops. Therefore, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ed and tested Phenobot 1.0, an auto-steered and self-propelled field-based high-throughput phenotyping platform for tall dense canopy crops, such as sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>). Phenobot 1.0 was equipped with laterally positioned and vertically stacked stereo RGB cameras. Images collected from 307 diverse sorghum lines were reconstructed in 3D for feature extraction. User <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interfac</span></strong>es were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ed, and multiple algorithms were evaluated for their accuracy in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t height and stem diameter. Tested feature extraction methods included the following: (1) User-interactive Individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t Height Extraction (UsIn-PHe) based on dense stereo three-dimensional reconstruction; (2) Automatic Hedge-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t Height Extraction (Auto-PHe) based on dense stereo 3D reconstruction; (3) User-interactive Dense Stereo Matching Stem Diameter Extraction; and (4) User-interactive Image Patch Stereo Matching Stem Diameter Extraction (IPaS-Di). Comparative genome-wide association analysis and ground-truth validation demonstrated that both UsIn-PHe and Auto-PHe were accurate methods to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t height, while Auto-PHe had the additional advantage of being a completely automated process. For stem diameter, IPaS-Di generated the most accurate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ates of this biomass-related architectural trait.

<p>Early reproductive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in cereals is crucial for final grain number per spike and hence the yield potential of the crop. To date, however, no systematic analyses of gene expression profiles during this important process have been conducted for common wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>). Here, we studied the transcriptome profiles at four stages of early wheat reproductive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, from spikelet initiation to floral organ differentiation. <i>K</i>-means clustering and stage-specific transcript identification detected dynamically expressed homeologs of important transcription regulators in spikelet and floral meristems that may be involved in spikelet initiation, floret meristem specification, and floral organ patterning, as inferred from their homologs in model <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts. Small RNA transcriptome sequencing discovered key microRNAs that were differentially expressed during wheat inflorescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment alongside their target genes, suggesting that miRNA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mediat</span></strong>ed regulatory mechanisms for floral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment may be conserved in cereals and Arabidopsis. Our analysis was further substantiated by the functional characterization of the <i>ARGONAUTE1d</i> (<i>AGO1d</i>) gene, which was initially expressed in stamen primordia and later in the tapetum during anther maturation. In agreement with its stage-specific expression pattern, the loss of function of the predominantly expressed B homeolog of <i>AGO1d</i> in a tetraploid durum wheat mutant resulted in smaller anthers with more infertile pollens than the wild type and a reduced grain number per spike. Together, our work provides a first glimpse of the gene regulatory networks in wheat inflorescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment that may be pivotal for floral and grain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, highlighting potential targets for genetic manipulation to improve future wheat yields.</p>

Shoot Removal Induces Chloroplast Development in Roots via Cytokinin Signaling
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t chloroplasts is regulated by various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>mental, environmental, and hormonal cues. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment is repressed in roots via auxin signaling. However, roots <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong> chloroplasts when they are detached from the shoot. In contrast to auxin, cytokinin positively affects chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in roots, but the role and signaling pathway of cytokinin in the root greening response remain unclear. To understand the regulatory pathways of chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t stress response, we examined the mechanisms underlying the conditional greening of detached roots. In wild-type Arabidopsis roots, shoot removal activates type B ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR (ARR)-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mediat</span></strong>ed cytokinin signaling and induces chlorophyll accumulation and photosynthetic remodeling. ARR1 and ARR12 are essential for up-regulating nucleus- and plastid-encoded genes associated with chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in detached roots. In this process, WOUND INDUCED DEDIFFERENTIATION1 and class B GATA transcription factors (B-GATAs) act upstream and downstream of ARRs, respectively. Overexpression of B-GATAs promotes root greening, as does shoot removal, dependent on a light signaling transcription factor, LONG HYPOCOTYL5. Auxin represses the root greening response independent of ARR signaling. <i>GNC-LIKE</i> (<i>GNL</i>), a B-GATA, is strongly up-regulated in detached roots via ARR1 and ARR12 but is repressed by auxin, so <i>GNL</i> may function at the point of convergence of cytokinin and auxin signaling in the root greening response.</p>

<i>De novo</i> formation of nucleoli in developing mouse embryos originating from enucleolated zygotes
<p>The large, compact oocyte nucleoli, sometimes referred to as nucleolus precursor bodies (NPBs), are essential for embryonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in mammals; in their absence, the oocytes complete maturation and can be fertilized, but no nucleoli are formed in the zygote or embryo, leading to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>mental failure. It has been convincingly documented that zygotes inherit the oocyte nucleolar material and form NPBs again in pronuclei. It is commonly accepted that during early embryonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, the original compact zygote NPBs gradually transform into reticulated nucleoli of somatic cells. Here, we show that zygote NPBs are not required for embryonic and full-term <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in the mouse. When NPBs were removed from late-stage zygotes by micromanipulation, the enucleolated zygotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ed to the blastocyst stage and, after transfer to recipients, live pups were obtained. We also describe <i>de novo</i> formation of nucleoli in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing embryos. After removal of NPBs from zygotes, they formed new nucleoli after several divisions. These results indicate that the zygote NPBs are not used in embryonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and that the nucleoli in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing embryos originate from <i>de novo</i> synthesized materials.</p>

Lack of Concordance Between Empirical Scores and Physician Assessments of Stroke and Bleeding Risk in Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Physicians treating patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) must weigh the benefits of anticoagulation in preventing stroke versus the risk of bleeding. Although empirical models have been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ed to predict such risks, the degree to which these coincide with clinicians’ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ates is unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We examined 10 094 AF patients enrolled in the Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of AF (ORBIT-AF) registry between June 2010 and August 2011.

Separately, physicians were asked to categorize their patients’ stroke and bleeding risks: low risk (<3%); inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mediat</span></strong>e risk (3%–6%); and high risk (>6%). Overall, 72% (n=7251) in ORBIT-AF had high-risk CHADS<sub>2</sub> scores (≥2). However, only 16% were assessed as high stroke risk by physicians. Although 17% (n=1749) had high ATRIA bleeding risk (score ≥5), only 7% (n=719) were considered so by physicians.

Generation of specific inhibitors of SUMO-1– and SUMO-2/3–mediated protein-protein interactions using Affimer (Adhiron) technology
<p>Because protein-protein interactions underpin most biological processes, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing tools that target them to understand their function or to inform the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of therapeutics is an important task. SUMOylation is the posttranslational covalent attachment of proteins in the SUMO family (SUMO-1, SUMO-2, or SUMO-3), and it regulates numerous cellular pathways. SUMOylated proteins are recognized by proteins with SUMO-interaction motifs (SIMs) that facilitate noncovalent interactions with SUMO. We describe the use of the Affimer system of peptide display for the rapid isolation of synthetic binding proteins that inhibit SUMO-dependent protein-protein interactions <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mediat</span></strong>ed by SIMs both in vitro and in cells. Crucially, these synthetic proteins did not prevent SUMO conjugation either in vitro or in cell-based systems, enabling the specific analysis of SUMO-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mediat</span></strong>ed protein-protein interactions. Furthermore, through structural analysis and molecular modeling, we explored the molecular mechanisms that may underlie their specificity in interfering with either SUMO-1–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mediat</span></strong>ed interactions or interactions <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mediat</span></strong>ed by either SUMO-2 or SUMO-3. Not only will these reagents enable investigation of the biological roles of SUMOylation, but the Affimer technology used to generate these synthetic binding proteins could also be exploited to design or validate reagents or therapeutics that target other protein-protein interactions.</p>

A systems approach for discovering linoleic acid derivatives that potentially mediate pain and itch
<p>Chronic pain and itch are common hypersensitivity syndromes that are affected by endogenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mediat</span></strong>ors. We applied a systems-based, translational approach to predict, discover, and characterize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mediat</span></strong>ors of pain and itch that are regulated by diet and inflammation. Profiling of tissue-specific precursor abundance and biosynthetic gene expression predicted that inflamed skin would be abundant in four previously unknown 11-hydroxy-epoxy- or 11-keto-epoxy-octadecenoate linoleic acid derivatives and four previously identified 9- or 13-hydroxy-epoxy- or 9- or 13-keto-epoxy-octadecenoate linoleic acid derivatives. All of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mediat</span></strong>ors were confirmed to be abundant in rat and human skin by mass spectrometry. However, only the two 11-hydroxy-epoxy-octadecenoates sensitized rat dorsal root ganglion neurons to release more calcitonin gene–related peptide (CGRP), which is involved in pain transmission, in response to low pH (which mimics an inflammatory state) or capsaicin (which activates ion channels involved in nociception). The two 11-hydroxy-epoxy-octadecenoates share a 3-hydroxy-<i>Z</i>-pentenyl-<i>E</i>-epoxide moiety, thus suggesting that this substructure could <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mediat</span></strong>e nociceptor sensitization. In rats, intradermal hind paw injection of 11-hydroxy-12,13-<i>trans</i>-epoxy-(9<i>Z</i>)-octadecenoate elicited C-fiber–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mediat</span></strong>ed sensitivity to thermal pain. In a randomized trial testing adjunctive strategies to manage refractory chronic headaches, reducing the dietary intake of linoleic acid was associated with decreases in plasma 11-hydroxy-12,13-<i>trans</i>-epoxy-(9<i>Z</i>)-octadecenoate, which correlated with clinical pain reduction. Human psoriatic skin had 30-fold higher 9-keto-12,13-<i>trans</i>-epoxy-(10<i>E</i>)-octadecenoate compared to control skin, and intradermal injection of this compound induced itch-related scratching behavior in mice. Collectively, these findings define a family of endogenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mediat</span></strong>ors with potential roles in pain and itch.</p>

The SUMO E3 Ligase MdSIZ1 Targets MdbHLH104 to Regulate Plasma Membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase Activity and Iron Homeostasis
<p>SIZ1 (a SIZ/PIAS-type SUMO E3 ligase)-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mediat</span></strong>ed small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) modification of target proteins is important for various biological processes related to abiotic stress resistance in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts; however, little is known about its role in resistance toward iron (Fe) deficiency. Here, the SUMO E3 ligase MdSIZ1 was shown to be involved in the plasma membrane (PM) H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mediat</span></strong>ed response to Fe deficiency. Subsequently, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, MdbHLH104 (a homolog of Arabidopsis bHLH104 in apple), which acts as a key component in regulating PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mediat</span></strong>ed rhizosphere acidification and Fe uptake in apples (<i>Malus domestica</i>), was identified as a direct target of MdSIZ1. MdSIZ1 directly sumoylated MdbHLH104 both in vitro and in vivo, especially under conditions of Fe deficiency, and this sumoylation was required for MdbHLH104 protein stability. Double substitution of K139R and K153R in MdbHLH104 blocked MdSIZ1-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mediat</span></strong>ed sumoylation in vitro and in vivo, indicating that the K139 and K153 residues were the principal sites of SUMO conjugation. Moreover, the transcript level of the <i>MdSIZ1</i> gene was substantially induced following Fe deficiency. <i>MdSIZ1</i> overexpression exerted a positive influence on PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mediat</span></strong>ed rhizosphere acidification and Fe uptake. Our findings reveal an important role for sumoylation in the regulation of PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mediat</span></strong>ed rhizosphere acidification and Fe uptake during Fe deficiency in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts.</p>

Timing and Order of the Molecular Events Marking the Onset of Berry Ripening in Grapevine
<p>Grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) is a model for the investigation of physiological and biochemical changes during the formation and ripening of nonclimacteric fleshy fruits. However, the order and complexity of the molecular events during fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment remain poorly understood. To identify the key molecular events controlling berry formation and ripening, we created a highly detailed transcriptomic and metabolomic map of berry <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, based on samples collected every week from fruit set to maturity in two grapevine genotypes for three consecutive years, resulting in 219 samples. Major transcriptomic changes were represented by coordinated waves of gene expression associated with early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, veraison (onset of ripening)/midripening, and late-ripening and were consistent across vintages. The two genotypes were clearly distinguished by metabolite profiles and transcriptional changes occurring primarily at the veraison/midripening phase. Coexpression analysis identified a core network of transcripts as well as variations in the within-module connections representing varietal differences. By focusing on transcriptome rearrangements close to veraison, we identified two rapid and successive shared transitions involving genes whose expression profiles precisely locate the timing of the molecular reprogramming of berry <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Functional analyses of two transcription factors, markers of the first transition, suggested that they participate in a hierarchical cascade of gene activation at the onset of ripening. This study defined the initial transcriptional events that mark and trigger the onset of ripening and the molecular network that characterizes the whole process of berry <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, providing a framework to model fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and maturation in grapevine.</p>

FLOURY SHRUNKEN ENDOSPERM1 Connects Phospholipid Metabolism and Amyloplast Development in Rice
<p>Starch synthesized and stored in amyloplasts serves as the major energy storage molecule in cereal endosperm. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying amyloplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and starch synthesis, we isolated a series of floury endosperm mutants in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). We identified the rice mutant <i>floury shrunken endosperm1</i> (<i>fse1</i>), which exhibited obvious defects in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of compound starch grains, decreased starch content, and altered starch physicochemical features. Map-based cloning showed that <i>FSE1</i> encodes a phospholipase-like protein homologous to phosphatidic acid-preferring phospholipase A<sub>1</sub>. <i>FSE1</i> was expressed ubiquitously with abundant levels observed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing seeds and roots. FSE1 was localized to both the cytosol and intracellular membranes. Lipid profiling indicated that total extra-plastidic lipids and phosphatidic acid were increased in <i>fse1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts, suggesting that FSE1 may exhibit in vivo phospholipase A<sub>1</sub> activity on phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidyl-Ser, phosphatidylethanolamine, and, in particular, phosphatidic acid. Additionally, the total galactolipid content in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing <i>fse1</i> endosperm was significantly reduced, which may cause abnormal amyloplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Our results identify FSE1 as a phospholipase-like protein that controls the synthesis of galactolipids in rice endosperm and provide a novel connection between lipid metabolism and starch synthesis in rice grains during endosperm <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment.</p>

Transcriptomic Insights into Phenological Development and Cold Tolerance of Wheat Grown in the Field
<p>Cold acclimation and winter survival in cereal species is determined by complicated environmentally regulated gene expression. However, studies investigating these complex cold responses are mostly conducted in controlled environments that only consider the responses to single environmental variables. In this study, we have comprehensively profiled global transcriptional responses in crowns of field-grown spring and winter wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) genotypes and their near-isogenic lines with the <i>VRN-A1</i> alleles swapped. This in-depth analysis revealed multiple signaling, interactive pathways that influence cold tolerance and phenological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment to optimize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t growth and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in preparation for a wide range of over-winter stresses. Investigation of genetic differences at the <i>VRN-A1</i> locus revealed that a vernalization requirement maintained a higher level of cold response pathways while <i>VRN-A1</i> genetically promoted floral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Our results also demonstrated the influence of genetic background on the expression of cold and flowering pathways. The link between delayed shoot apex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and the induction of cold tolerance was reflected by the gradual up-regulation of abscisic acid-dependent and C-REPEAT-BINDING FACTOR pathways. This was accompanied by the down-regulation of key genes involved in meristem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment as the autumn progressed. The chromosome location of differentially expressed genes between the winter and spring wheat genetic backgrounds showed a striking pattern of biased gene expression on chromosomes 6A and 6D, indicating a transcriptional regulation at the genome level. This finding adds to the complexity of the genetic cascades and gene interactions that determine the evolutionary patterns of both phenological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and cold tolerance traits in wheat.</p>

The transcription of <i>PHO1</i> was obviously enhanced during seed germination and early seedling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and repressed by exogenous ABA. The <i>pho1</i> mutants (<i>pho1-2</i>, <i>pho1-4</i>, and <i>pho1-5</i>) showed ABA-hypersensitive phenotypes, whereas the <i>PHO1</i>-overexpressing lines were ABA-insensitive during seed germination and early seedling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. The expression of <i>PHO1</i> was repressed in the <i>ABI5</i>-overexpressing line and elevated in the <i>abi5</i> mutant, and ABI5 can bind to the <i>PHO1</i> promoter in vitro and in vivo, indicating that ABI5 directly down-regulated <i>PHO1</i> expression.

In animals, these proteins serve as adapter molecules to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mediat</span></strong>e signal transduction from Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor to downstream effector molecules. A seed-sterile mutant with a disrupted TRAF-like gene (<i>At5g26290</i>) exhibiting aberrant gametogenesis led us to investigate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>mental role of this gene in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The mutation was semidominant and resulted in pleiotropic phenotypes with such features as short siliques with fewer ovules, pollen and seed sterility, altered Megaspore Mother Cell (MMC) specification, and delayed programmed cell death in megaspores and the tapetum, features that overlapped those in other well-characterized mutants. Seed sterility and reduced transmission frequency of the mutant alleles pointed to a dual role, sporophytic and gametophytic, for the gene on the male side. The mutant also showed altered expression of various genes involved in such cellular and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>mental pathways as regulation of transcription, biosynthesis and transport of lipids, hormone-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mediat</span></strong>ed signaling, and gametophyte <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. The diverse phenotypes of the mutant and the altered expression of key genes related to gametophyte and seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment could be explained based on the functional similarly between <i>At5g26290</i> and MATH-BTB domain proteins that modulate gene expression through the ubiquitin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mediat</span></strong>ed proteasome system.

SCYL2 Genes Are Involved in Clathrin-Mediated Vesicle Trafficking and Essential for Plant Growth
<p>Protein transport between organelles is an essential process in all eukaryotic cells and is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mediat</span></strong>ed by the regulation of processes such as vesicle formation, transport, docking, and fusion. In animals, SCY1-LIKE2 (SCYL2) binds to clathrin and has been shown to play roles in trans-Golgi network-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mediat</span></strong>ed clathrin-coated vesicle trafficking. Here, we demonstrate that SCYL2A and SCYL2B, which are Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) homologs of animal SCYL2, are vital for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t cell growth and root hair <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Studies of the SCYL2 isoforms using multiple single or double loss-of-function alleles show that SCYL2B is involved in root hair <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and that SCYL2A and SCYL2B are essential for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t growth and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and act redundantly in those processes. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and a β-glucuronidase-aided promoter assay show that <i>SCYL2A</i> and <i>SCYL2B</i> are differentially expressed in various tissues. We also show that SCYL2 proteins localize to the Golgi, trans-Golgi network, and prevacuolar compartment and colocalize with Clathrin Heavy Chain1 (CHC1). Furthermore, bimolecular fluorescence complementation and coimmunoprecipitation data show that SCYL2B interacts with CHC1 and two Soluble NSF Attachment Protein Receptors (SNAREs): Vesicle Transport through t-SNARE Interaction11 (VTI11) and VTI12. Finally, we present evidence that the root hair tip localization of Cellulose Synthase-Like D3 is dependent on SCYL2B. These findings suggest the role of SCYL2 genes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>mental processes via clathrin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mediat</span></strong>ed vesicle membrane trafficking.</p>

Adaptor Protein-3-Dependent Vacuolar Trafficking Involves a Subpopulation of COPII and HOPS Tethering Proteins
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t vacuoles are versatile organelles critical for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t growth and responses to environment. Vacuolar proteins are transported from the endoplasmic reticulum via multiple routes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts. Two classic routes bear great similarity to other phyla with major regulators known, such as COPII and Rab5 GTPases. By contrast, vacuolar trafficking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mediat</span></strong>ed by adaptor protein-3 (AP-3) or that independent of the Golgi has few recognized cargos and none of the regulators. In search of novel regulators for vacuolar trafficking routes and by using a fluorescence-based forward genetic screen, we demonstrated that the multispan transmembrane protein, Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) PROTEIN <i>S</i>-ACYL TRANSFERASE10 (PAT10), is an AP-3-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mediat</span></strong>ed vacuolar cargo. We show that the tonoplast targeting of PAT10 is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mediat</span></strong>ed by the AP-3 complex but independent of the Rab5-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mediat</span></strong>ed post-Golgi trafficking route. We also report that AP-3-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mediat</span></strong>ed vacuolar trafficking involves a subpopulation of COPII and requires the vacuolar tethering complex HOPS. In addition, we have identified two novel mutant alleles of <i>AP-3δ</i>, whose point mutations interfered with the formation of the AP-3 complex as well as its membrane targeting. The results presented here shed new light on the vacuolar trafficking route <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mediat</span></strong>ed by AP-3 in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t cells.</p>

<i>Small kernel2</i> Encodes a Glutaminase in Vitamin B<sub>6</sub> Biosynthesis Essential for Maize Seed Development
<p>Vitamin B<sub>6</sub>, an essential cofactor for a range of biochemical reactions and a potent antioxidant, plays important roles in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t growth, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, and stress tolerance. Vitamin B<sub>6</sub> deficiency causes embryo lethality in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), but the specific role of vitamin B<sub>6</sub> biosynthesis in endosperm <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment has not been fully addressed, especially in monocot crops, where endosperm constitutes the major portion of the grain. Through molecular characterization of a <i>small kernel2</i> (<i>smk2</i>) mutant in maize, we reveal that vitamin B<sub>6</sub> has differential effects on embryogenesis and endosperm <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in maize. The B<sub>6</sub> vitamer pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) is drastically reduced in both the <i>smk2</i> embryo and the endosperm. However, whereas embryogenesis of the <i>smk2</i> mutant is arrested at the transition stage, endosperm formation is nearly normal. Cloning reveals that <i>Smk2</i> encodes the glutaminase subunit of the PLP synthase complex involved in vitamin B<sub>6</sub> biosynthesis de novo. <i>Smk2</i> partially complements the Arabidopsis vitamin B<sub>6</sub>-deficient mutant <i>pdx2.1</i> and <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> pyridoxine auxotrophic mutant MML21. <i>Smk2</i> is constitutively expressed in the maize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing embryos. Analysis of B<sub>6</sub> vitamers indicates that the endosperm accumulates a large amount of pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate (PMP). These results indicate that vitamin B<sub>6</sub> is essential to embryogenesis but has a reduced role in endosperm <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in maize. The vitamin B<sub>6</sub> required for seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment is synthesized in the seed, and the endosperm accumulates PMP probably as a storage form of vitamin B<sub>6</sub>.</p>

Jasmonic Acid Enhances Al-Induced Root Growth Inhibition<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>Phytohormones such as ethylene and auxin are involved in the regulation of the aluminum (Al)-induced root growth inhibition. Although jasmonate (JA) has been reported to play a crucial role in the regulation of root growth and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in response to environmental stresses through interplay with ethylene and auxin, its role in the regulation of root growth response to Al stress is not yet known. In an attempt to elucidate the role of JA, we found that exogenous application of JA enhanced the Al-induced root growth inhibition. Furthermore, phenotype analysis with mutants defective in either JA biosynthesis or signaling suggests that JA is involved in the regulation of Al-induced root growth inhibition. The expression of the JA receptor CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 (COI1) and the key JA signaling regulator MYC2 was up-regulated in response to Al stress in the root tips. This process together with COI1-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mediat</span></strong>ed Al-induced root growth inhibition under Al stress was controlled by ethylene but not auxin. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that many responsive genes under Al stress were regulated by JA signaling. The differential responsive of microtubule organization-related genes between the wild-type and <i>coi1-2</i> mutant is consistent with the changed depolymerization of cortical microtubules in <i>coi1</i> under Al stress. In addition, ALMT-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mediat</span></strong>ed malate exudation and thus Al exclusion from roots in response to Al stress was also regulated by COI1-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mediat</span></strong>ed JA signaling. Together, this study suggests that root growth inhibition is regulated by COI1-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mediat</span></strong>ed JA signaling independent from auxin signaling and provides novel insights into the phytohormone-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mediat</span></strong>ed root growth inhibition in response to Al stress.</p>

The Genetic Control of Reproductive Development under High Ambient Temperature<xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>Ambient temperature has a large impact on reproductive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and grain yield in temperate cereals. However, little is known about the genetic control of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment under different ambient temperatures. Here, we demonstrate that in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), high ambient temperatures accelerate or delay reproductive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment depending on the photoperiod response gene <i>PHOTOPERIOD1</i> (<i>Ppd-H1</i>) and its upstream regulator <i>EARLY FLOWERING3</i> (<i>HvELF3</i>). A natural mutation in <i>Ppd-H1</i> prevalent in spring barley delayed floral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and reduced the number of florets and seeds per spike, while the wild-type <i>Ppd-H1</i> or a mutant <i>Hvelf3</i> allele accelerated floral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and maintained the seed number under high ambient temperatures. High ambient temperature delayed the expression phase and reduced the amplitude of clock genes and repressed the floral integrator gene <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T1</i> independently of the genotype. <i>Ppd-H1</i>-dependent variation in flowering time under different ambient temperatures correlated with relative expression levels of the <i>BARLEY MADS</i>-box genes <i>VERNALIZATION1</i> (<i>HvVRN1</i>), <i>HvBM3</i>, and <i>HvBM8</i> in the leaf. Finally, we show that <i>Ppd-H1</i> interacts with regulatory variation at <i>HvVRN1. Ppd-H1</i> only accelerated floral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in the background of a spring <i>HvVRN1</i> allele with a deletion in the regulatory intron. The full-length winter <i>Hvvrn1</i> allele was strongly down-regulated, and flowering was delayed by high temperatures irrespective of <i>Ppd-H1</i>. Our findings demonstrate that the photoperiodic and vernalization pathways interact to control flowering time and floret fertility in response to ambient temperature in barley.</p>

Two SERK Receptor-Like Kinases Interact with EMS1 to Control Anther Cell Fate Determination
<p>Cell signaling pathways <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mediat</span></strong>ed by leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs) are essential for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t growth, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, and defense. The EMS1 (EXCESS MICROSPOROCYTES1) LRR-RLK and its small protein ligand TPD1 (TAPETUM DETERMINANT1) play a fundamental role in somatic and reproductive cell differentiation during early anther <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). However, it is unclear whether other cell surface molecules serve as coregulators of EMS1. Here, we show that SERK1 (SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE1) and SERK2 LRR-RLKs act redundantly as coregulatory and physical partners of EMS1. The <i>SERK1</i>/<i>2</i> genes function in the same genetic pathway as <i>EMS1</i> in anther <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation, Forster resonance energy transfer, and coimmunoprecipitation approaches revealed that SERK1 interacted biochemically with EMS1. Transphosphorylation of EMS1 by SERK1 enhances EMS1 kinase activity. Among 12 in vitro autophosphorylation and transphosphorylation sites identified by tandem mass spectrometry, seven of them were found to be critical for EMS1 autophosphorylation activity. Furthermore, complementation test results suggest that phosphorylation of EMS1 is required for its function in anther <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Collectively, these data provide genetic and biochemical evidence of the interaction and phosphorylation between SERK1/2 and EMS1 in anther <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment.</p>

Gibberellins Regulate Ovule Integument Development by Interfering with the Transcription Factor ATS
<p>Gibberellins (GAs) are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t hormones that regulate most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t life cycle aspects, including flowering and fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Here, we demonstrate the implication of GAs in ovule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. DELLA proteins, negative GA response regulators, act as positive factors for ovule integument <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in a mechanism that involves transcription factor ABERRANT TESTA SHAPE (ATS). The seeds of the <i>della global</i> mutant, a complete loss-of-function of DELLA, and the <i>ats-1</i> mutant are remarkably similar, with a round shape, a disorganized testa, and viviparism. These defects are the result of an alteration in integuments that fail to fully <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong> and are shorter than in wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts. <i>ats-1</i> also shows some GA-related phenotypes, for example, higher germination rates and early flowering. In fact, <i>ats-1</i> has elevated GA levels due to the activation of GA biosynthesis genes, which indicates that ATS inhibits GA biosynthesis. Moreover, DELLAs and ATS proteins interact, which suggests the formation of a transcriptional complex that regulates the expression of genes involved in integument growth. Therefore, the repression of GA biosynthesis by ATS would result in the stabilization of DELLAs to ensure correct ATS-DELLA complex formation. The requirement of both activities to coordinate proper ovule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment strongly argues that the ATS-DELLA complex acts as a key molecular factor. This work provides the first evidence for a role of GAs in ovule and seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment.</p>

A Rice Ca<sup>2+</sup> Binding Protein Is Required for Tapetum Function and Pollen Formation
<p>In flowering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts, successful male reproduction requires the sophisticated interaction between somatic anther wall layers and reproductive cells. Timely degradation of the innermost tissue of the anther wall layer, the tapetal layer, is critical for pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a well-known stimulus for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, but whether it plays a role in affecting male reproduction remains elusive. Here we report a role of Defective in Exine Formation 1 (OsDEX1) in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), a Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding protein, in regulating rice tapetal cell degradation and pollen formation. In <i>osdex1</i> anthers, tapetal cell degeneration is delayed and degradation of the callose wall surrounding the microspores is compromised, leading to aborted pollen formation and complete male sterility. <i>OsDEX1</i> is expressed in tapetal cells and microspores during early anther <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Recombinant OsDEX1 is able to bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> and regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in vitro, and <i>osdex1</i> exhibited disturbed Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in tapetal cells. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that OsDEX1 may have a conserved function in binding Ca<sup>2+</sup> in flowering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts, and genetic complementation of pollen wall defects of an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>dex1</i> mutant confirmed its evolutionary conservation in pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Collectively, these findings suggest that OsDEX1 plays a fundamental role in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of tapetal cells and pollen formation, possibly via modulating the Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis during pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment.</p>

Direct Determination of the Mutation Rate in the Bumblebee Reveals Evidence for Weak Recombination-Associated Mutation and an Approximate Rate Constancy in Insects
<p>Accurate knowledge of the mutation rate provides a base line for inferring expected rates of evolution, for testing evolutionary hypotheses and for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ation of key parameters. Advances in sequencing technology now permit direct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ates of the mutation rate from sequencing of close relatives. Within insects there have been three prior such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ates, two in nonsocial insects (<i>Drosophila</i>: 2.8 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> per bp per haploid genome per generation; <i>Heliconius</i>: 2.9 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>) and one in a social species, the honeybee (3.4 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>). Might the honeybee’s rate be ∼20% higher because it has an exceptionally high recombination rate and recombination may be directly or indirectly mutagenic? To address this possibility, we provide a direct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ate of the mutation rate in the bumblebee (<i>Bombus terrestris</i>), this being a close relative of the honeybee but with a much lower recombination rate. We confirm that the crossover rate of the bumblebee is indeed much lower than honeybees (8.7 cM/Mb vs. 37 cM/Mb). Importantly, we find no significant difference in the mutation rates: we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ate for bumblebees a rate of 3.6 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> per haploid genome per generation (95% confidence intervals 2.38 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> and 5.37 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>) which is just 5% higher than the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ate that of honeybees. Both genomes have approximately one new mutation per haploid genome per generation. While we find evidence for a direct coupling between recombination and mutation (also seen in honeybees), the effect is so weak as to leave almost no footprint on any between-species differences. The similarity in mutation rates suggests an approximate constancy of the mutation rate in insects.</p>

A disynaptic feedback network activated by experience promotes the integration of new granule cells
<p>Experience shapes the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and connectivity of adult-born granule cells (GCs) through mechanisms that are poorly understood. We examined the remodeling of dentate gyrus microcircuits in mice in an enriched environment (EE). Short exposure to EE during early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of new GCs accelerated their functional integration. This effect was mimicked by in vivo chemogenetic activation of a limited population of mature GCs. Slice recordings showed that mature GCs recruit parvalbumin γ-aminobutyric acid–releasing interneurons (PV-INs) that feed back onto <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing GCs. Accordingly, chemogenetic stimulation of PV-INs or direct depolarization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing GCs accelerated GC integration, whereas inactivation of PV-INs prevented the effects of EE. Our results reveal a mechanism for dynamic remodeling in which experience activates dentate networks that “prime” young GCs through a disynaptic feedback loop <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mediat</span></strong>ed by PV-INs.</p>

An Essential Role for miRNA167 in Maternal Control of Embryonic and Seed Development
<p>Maternal cells play a critical role in ensuring the normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of embryos, endosperms, and seeds. Mutations that disrupt the maternal control of embryogenesis and seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment are difficult to identify. Here, we completely deleted four <i>MICRORNA167</i> (<i>MIR167</i>) genes in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) using a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein9 (Cas9) genome-editing technology. We found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts with a deletion of <i>MIR167A</i> phenocopied <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts overexpressing miRNA167-resistant versions of <i>Auxin Response Factor6</i> (<i>ARF6</i>) or <i>ARF8</i>, two miRNA167 targets. Both the <i>mir167a</i> mutant and the <i>ARF</i> overexpression lines were defective in anther dehiscence and ovule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Serendipitously, we found that the <i>mir167a</i> (♀) × wild type (♂) crosses failed to produce normal embryos and endosperms, despite the findings that embryos with either <i>mir167a<sup>+/−</sup></i> or <i>mir167a<sup>−/−</sup></i> genotypes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ed normally when <i>mir167a<sup>+/−</sup></i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts were self-pollinated, revealing a central role of <i>MIR167A</i> in maternal control of seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. The <i>mir167a</i> phenotype is 100% penetrant, providing a great genetic tool for studying the roles of miRNAs and auxin in maternal control. Moreover, we found that <i>mir167a</i> mutants flowered significantly later than wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts, a phenotype that was not observed in the <i>ARF</i> overexpression lines. We show that the reproductive defects of <i>mir167a</i> mutants were suppressed by a decrease of activities of <i>ARF6</i>, <i>ARF8</i>, or both. Our results clearly demonstrate that <i>MIR167A</i> is the predominant <i>MIR167</i> member in regulating Arabidopsis reproduction and that <i>MIR167A</i> acts as a maternal gene that functions largely through <i>ARF6</i> and <i>ARF8</i>.</p>

Diffusion of CO<sub>2</sub> across the Mesophyll-Bundle Sheath Cell Interface in a C<sub>4</sub> Plant with Genetically Reduced PEP Carboxylase Activity
<p>Phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), localized to the cytosol of the mesophyll cell, catalyzes the first carboxylation step of the C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic pathway. Here, we used RNA interference to target the cytosolic photosynthetic PEPC isoform in <i>Setaria viridis</i> and isolated independent transformants with very low PEPC activities. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts required high ambient CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations for growth, consistent with the essential role of PEPC in C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. The combination of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ating direct CO<sub>2</sub> fixation by the bundle sheath using gas-exchange measurements and modeling C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis with low PEPC activity allowed the calculation of bundle sheath conductance to CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion (<i>g<sub>bs</sub></i>) in the progeny of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts. Measurements made at a range of temperatures suggested no or negligible effect of temperature on <i>g<sub>bs</sub></i> depending on the technique used to calculate <i>g<sub>bs</sub></i>. Anatomical measurements revealed that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts with reduced PEPC activity had reduced cell wall thickness and increased plasmodesmata (PD) density at the mesophyll-bundle sheath (M-BS) cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interfac</span></strong>e, whereas we observed little difference in these parameters at the mesophyll-mesophyll cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interfac</span></strong>e. The increased PD density at the M-BS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interfac</span></strong>e was largely driven by an increase in the number of PD pit fields (cluster of PDs) rather than an increase in PD per pit field or the size of pit fields. The correlation of <i>g<sub>bs</sub></i> with bundle sheath surface area per leaf area and PD area per M-BS area showed that these parameters and cell wall thickness are important determinants of <i>g<sub>bs</sub></i>. It is intriguing to speculate that PD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment is responsive to changes in C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic flux.</p>

Consensus Coexpression Network Analysis Identifies Key Regulators of Flower and Fruit Development in Wild Strawberry

We then applied a post-hoc consensus clustering approach and used bootstrapping to demonstrate consensus clustering’s ability to produce robust and reproducible clusters. Further, we experimentally tested hypotheses based on the networks, including increased iron transport from the receptacle to the seed postfertilization and characterized a <i>F. vesca</i> floral mutant and its candidate gene. To increase their utility, the networks are presented in a web <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interfac</span></strong>e (<ext-link>www.fv.rosaceaefruits.org</ext-link>) for easy exploration and identification of coexpressed genes.

Development Defects of Hydroxy-Fatty Acid-Accumulating Seeds Are Reduced by Castor Acyltransferases
<p>Researchers have long endeavored to produce modified fatty acids in easily managed crop <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts where they are not natively found. An important step toward this goal has been the biosynthesis of these valuable products in model oilseeds. The successful production of such fatty acids has revealed barriers to the broad application of this technology, including low seed oil and low proportion of the introduced fatty acid and reduced seed vigor. Here, we analyze the impact of producing hydroxy-fatty acids on seedling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. We show that germinating seeds of a hydroxy-fatty acid-accumulating Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) line produce chlorotic cotyledons and suffer reduced photosynthetic capacity. These seedlings retain hydroxy-fatty acids in polar lipids, including chloroplast lipids, and exhibit decreased fatty acid synthesis. Triacylglycerol mobilization in seedling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment also is reduced, especially for lipids that include hydroxy-fatty acid moieties. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>mental defects are ameliorated by increased flux of hydroxy-fatty acids into seed triacylglycerol created through the expression of either castor (<i>Ricinus communis</i>) acyltransferase enzyme ACYL-COA:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE2 or PHOSPHOLIPID:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1A. Such expression increases both the level of total stored triacylglycerol and the rate at which it is mobilized, fueling fatty acid synthesis and restoring photosynthetic capacity. Our results suggest that further improvements in seedling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment may require the specific mobilization of triacylglycerol-containing hydroxy-fatty acids. Understanding the defects in early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment caused by the accumulation of modified fatty acids and providing mechanisms to circumvent these defects are vital steps in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of tailored oil crops.</p>

Efficient ER Fusion Requires a Dimerization and a C-Terminal Tail Mediated Membrane Anchoring of RHD3
<p>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a network of tubules and sheets stretching throughout the eukaryotic cells. The formation of the ER requires homotypic membrane fusion, which is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mediat</span></strong>ed by a family of Dynamin-like Atlastin GTPase proteins. The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) member ROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE3 (RHD3) has been demonstrated to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mediat</span></strong>e ER membrane fusion, but how exactly RHD3 is involved in the process is still unknown. Here we conducted systemic structure-function analyses of roles of different RHD3 domains in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mediat</span></strong>ing ER fusion. We showed that efficient ER membrane fusion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mediat</span></strong>ed by RHD3 requires a proper dimerization of RHD3 through the GTPase domain (GD) and the first and second three helix bundles (3HBs) in the middle domain. RHD3 has a 3HB-enriched middle domain longer than that of Atlastins, and we revealed that the third and fourth 3HBs are required for the stability of RHD3. The transmembrane segments of RHD3 are essential for targeting and retention of RHD3 in the ER and can also facilitate an oligomerization of RHD3. Furthermore, we showed that an amphipathic helix in the C-terminal cytosolic tail of RHD3 has a membrane anchoring ability that is required for efficient ER membrane fusion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mediat</span></strong>ed by RHD3. This work contributes to a better understanding of a coordinated action of RHD3 in the fusion of ER membranes.</p>

Balance between Cytosolic and Chloroplast Translation Affects Leaf Variegation
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of functional chloroplasts relies on the fine coordination of expressions of both nuclear and chloroplast genomes. We have been using the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>yellow variegated</i> (<i>var2</i>) leaf variegation mutant as a tool to dissect the regulation of chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. In this work, we screened for <i>var2</i> genetic enhancer modifiers termed <i>enhancer of variegation</i> (<i>evr</i>) mutants and report the characterization of the first <i>EVR</i> locus, <i>EVR1</i>. We showed that <i>EVR1</i> encodes the cytosolic 80S ribosome 40S small subunit protein RPS21B and the loss of <i>EVR1</i> causes the enhancement of <i>var2</i> leaf variegation. We further demonstrated that combined S21 activities from EVR1 and its close homolog, EVR1L1, are essential for Arabidopsis, and they act redundantly in regulating leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and <i>var2</i> leaf variegation. Moreover, using additional cytosolic ribosomal protein mutants, we showed that although mutations in cytosolic ribosomal proteins all enhance <i>var2</i> leaf variegation to varying degrees, the 40S subunit appears to have a more profound role over the 60S subunit in regulating VAR2-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mediat</span></strong>ed chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Comprehensive genetic analyses with <i>var2</i> suppressors that are defective in chloroplast translation established that the enhancement of <i>var2</i> leaf variegation by cytosolic ribosomal protein mutants is dependent on chloroplast translation. Based on our data, we propose a model that incorporates the suppression and enhancement of <i>var2</i> leaf variegation, and hypothesize that VAR2/AtFtsH2 may be intimately involved in the balancing of cytosolic and chloroplast translation programs during chloroplast biogenesis.</p>

Two SUMO Proteases SUMO PROTEASE RELATED TO FERTILITY1 and 2 Are Required for Fertility in Arabidopsis
<p>In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts, the posttranslational modification small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) is involved in regulating several important <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>mental and cellular processes, including flowering time control and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. Here, we report two proteases, SUMO PROTEASE RELATED TO FERTILITY1 (SPF1) and SPF2, that regulate male and female gamete and embryo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and remove SUMO from proteins in vitro and in vivo. <i>spf1</i> mutants exhibit abnormal floral structures and embryo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, while <i>spf2</i> mutants exhibit largely a wild-type phenotype. However, <i>spf1 spf2</i> double mutants exhibit severe abnormalities in microgametogenesis, megagametogenesis, and embryo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, suggesting that the two genes are functionally redundant. Mutation of <i>SPF1</i> and <i>SPF2</i> genes also results in misexpression of generative- and embryo-specific genes. In vitro, SPF1 and SPF2 process SUMO1 precursors into a mature form, and as expected in vivo, <i>spf1</i> and <i>spf2</i> mutants accumulate SUMO conjugates. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified EMBRYO SAC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>MENT ARREST9 (EDA9) as an SPF1-interacting protein. In vivo, we demonstrate that EDA9 is sumolyated and that, in <i>spf1</i> mutants, EDA9-SUMO conjugates increase in abundance, demonstrating that EDA9 is a substrate of SPF1. Together, our results demonstrate that SPF1 and SPF2 are two SUMO proteases important for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>).</p>

Arabidopsis <i>LORELEI</i>, a Maternally Expressed Imprinted Gene, Promotes Early Seed Development
<p>In flowering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts, the female gametophyte controls pollen tube reception im<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mediat</span></strong>ely before fertilization and regulates seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment im<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mediat</span></strong>ely after fertilization, although the controlling mechanisms remain poorly understood. Previously, we showed that <i>LORELEI</i> (<i>LRE</i>), which encodes a putative glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane protein, is critical for pollen tube reception by the female gametophyte before fertilization and the initiation of seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment after fertilization. Here, we show that <i>LRE</i> is expressed in the synergid, egg, and central cells of the female gametophyte and in the zygote and proliferating endosperm of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed. Interestingly, <i>LRE</i> expression in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing seeds was primarily from the matrigenic <i>LRE</i> allele, indicating that <i>LRE</i> expression is imprinted. However, <i>LRE</i> was biallelically expressed in 8-d-old seedlings, indicating that the patrigenic allele does not remain silenced throughout the sporophytic generation. Regulation of imprinted <i>LRE</i> expression is likely novel, as <i>LRE</i> was not expressed in pollen or pollen tubes of mutants defective for MET1, DDM1, RNA-dependent DNA methylation, or MSI-dependent histone methylation. Additionally, the patrigenic <i>LRE</i> allele inherited from these mutants was not expressed in seeds. Surprisingly, and contrary to the predictions of the parental conflict hypothesis, LRE promotes growth in seeds, as loss of the matrigenic but not the patrigenic <i>LRE</i> allele caused delayed initiation of seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Our results showed that <i>LRE</i> is a rare imprinted gene that functions im<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mediat</span></strong>ely after double fertilization and supported the model that a passage through the female gametophyte establishes monoalleleic expression of <i>LRE</i> in seeds and controls early seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment.</p>

Gametophyte Development Needs Mitochondrial Coproporphyrinogen III Oxidase Function
<p>Tetrapyrrole biosynthesis is one of the most essential metabolic pathways in almost all organisms. Coproporphyrinogen III oxidase (CPO) catalyzes the conversion of coproporphyrinogen III into protoporphyrinogen IX in this pathway. Here, we report that mutation in the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) CPO-coding gene <i>At5g63290</i> (<i>AtHEMN1</i>) adversely affects silique length, ovule number, and seed set. <i>Athemn1</i> mutant alleles were transmitted via both male and female gametes, but homozygous mutants were never recovered. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts carrying <i>Athemn1</i> mutant alleles showed defects in gametophyte <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, including nonviable pollen and embryo sacs with unfused polar nuclei. Improper differentiation of the central cell led to defects in endosperm <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Consequently, embryo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment was arrested at the globular stage. The mutant phenotype was completely rescued by transgenic expression of <i>AtHEMN1</i>. Promoter and transcript analyses indicated that <i>AtHEMN1</i> is expressed mainly in floral tissues and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing seeds. AtHEMN1-green fluorescent protein fusion protein was found targeted to mitochondria. Loss of <i>AtHEMN1</i> function increased coproporphyrinogen III level and reduced protoporphyrinogen IX level, suggesting the impairment of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis. Blockage of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis in the <i>AtHEMN1</i> mutant led to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation in anthers and embryo sacs, as evidenced by nitroblue tetrazolium staining. Our results suggest that the accumulated ROS disrupts mitochondrial function by altering their membrane polarity in floral tissues. This study highlights the role of mitochondrial ROS homeostasis in gametophyte and seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and sheds new light on tetrapyrrole/heme biosynthesis in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>t mitochondria.</p>

Chloroplast Preproteins Bind to the Dimer Interface of the Toc159 Receptor during Import
<p>Most chloroplast proteins are synthesized in the cytosol as higher molecular weight preproteins and imported via the translocons in the outer (TOC) and inner (TIC) envelope membranes of chloroplasts. Toc159 functions as a primary receptor and directly binds preproteins through its dimeric GTPase domain. As a first step toward a molecular understanding of how Toc159 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mediat</span></strong>es preprotein import, we mapped the preprotein-binding regions on the Toc159 GTPase domain (Toc159G) of pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) using cleavage by bound preproteins conjugated with the artificial protease FeBABE and cysteine-cysteine cross-linking. Our results show that residues at the dimer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interfac</span></strong>e and the switch II region of Toc159G are in close proximity to preproteins. The mature portion of preproteins was observed preferentially at the dimer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interfac</span></strong>e, whereas the transit peptide was found at both regions equally. Chloroplasts from transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plan</span></strong>ts expressing engineered Toc159 with a cysteine placed at the dimer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interfac</span></strong>e showed increased cross-linking to bound preproteins. Our data suggest that, during preprotein import, the Toc159G dimer disengages and the dimer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interfac</span></strong>e contacts translocating preproteins, which is consistent with a model in which conformational changes induced by dimer-monomer conversion in Toc159 play a direct role in facilitating preprotein import.</p>

Does osteofibrous dysplasia progress to adamantinoma and how should they be treated?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to identify any progression between   benign osteofibrous dysplasia (OFD), OFD-like adamantinoma and malignant   adamantinoma, and to investigate the rates of local recurrence,   metastases and survival, in order to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong> treatment algorithms   for each.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A single institution retrospective review of all patients presenting   with OFD, OFD-like adamantinoma and adamantinoma between 1973 and   2012 was undertaken. Complete data were available for 73 patients   (42 with OFD; ten with an OFD-like adamantinoma and 21 with an adamantinoma).   The mean follow-up was 10.3 years (3 to 25) for OFD, 9.2 years (3.0   to 26.3) for OFD-like and 11.6 years (0.25 to 33) for adamantinoma.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean age at diagnosis for OFD was 13.5 years (1 to 49), 10.5   years (6 to 28) for OFD-like and 34 years (14 to 86) for adamantinoma.   A total of 24 of the 42 patients with OFD (57%) have not required   any treatment and have been managed with observation. A total of   18 of the 42 patients with OFD underwent surgery, 13 with curettage   and five with resection. In all, three patients <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ed recurrence   following curettage (23%) but none following resection. All these   patients were cured with further limited surgery. A total of six   patients initially diagnosed with OFD were subsequently found to   have OFD-like adamantinoma. Of the ten patients initially diagnosed   with OFD-like adamantinoma, three (30%) were managed with observation   alone and seven underwent surgery, two with curettage and five with   resection. Local recurrence arose in two patients, one each after   curettage and resection. No patients with either OFD or an OFD-like   adamantinoma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ed metastases or had progression to adamantinoma.

Role of insulin signaling impairment, adiponectin and dyslipidemia in peripheral and central neuropathy in mice
<p>One of the tissues or organs affected by diabetes is the nervous system, predominantly the peripheral system (peripheral polyneuropathy and/or painful peripheral neuropathy) but also the central system with impaired learning, memory and mental flexibility. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the pre-diabetic or diabetic condition caused by a high-fat diet (HFD) can damage both the peripheral and central nervous systems. Groups of C57BL6 and Swiss Webster mice were fed a diet containing 60% fat for 8 months and compared to control and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic groups that were fed a standard diet containing 10% fat. Aspects of peripheral nerve function (conduction velocity, thermal sensitivity) and central nervous system function (learning ability, memory) were measured at assorted times during the study. Both strains of mice on HFD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ed impaired glucose tolerance, indicative of insulin resistance, but only the C57BL6 mice showed statistically significant hyperglycemia. STZ-diabetic C57BL6 mice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ed learning deficits in the Barnes maze after 8 weeks of diabetes, whereas neither C57BL6 nor Swiss Webster mice fed a HFD showed signs of defects at that time point. By 6 months on HFD, Swiss Webster mice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ed learning and memory deficits in the Barnes maze test, whereas their peripheral nervous system remained normal. In contrast, C57BL6 mice fed the HFD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ed peripheral nerve dysfunction, as indicated by nerve conduction slowing and thermal hyperalgesia, but showed normal learning and memory functions. Our data indicate that STZ-induced diabetes or a HFD can damage both peripheral and central nervous systems, but learning deficits <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong> more rapidly in insulin-deficient than in insulin-resistant conditions and only in Swiss Webster mice. In addition to insulin impairment, dyslipidemia or adiponectinemia might determine the neuropathy phenotype.</p>

Atrial Fibrillation Burden in Young Patients With Congenital Heart Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) are assumed to be vulnerable to atrial fibrillation (AF) as a result of residual shunts, anomalous vessel anatomy, progressive valvulopathy, hy<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pert</span></strong>ension, and atrial scars from previous heart surgery. However, the risk of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing AF and the complications associated with AF in children and young adults with CHD have not been compared with those in control subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data from the Swedish Patient and Cause of Death registers were used to identify all patients with a diagnosis of CHD who were born from 1970 to 1993.

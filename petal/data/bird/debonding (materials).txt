Experimentally realized mechanochemistry distinct from force-accelerated scission of loaded bonds
<p>Stretching polymer chains accelerates dissociation of a variety of internal covalent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>s, to an extent that correlates well with the force experienced by the scissile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>. Recent theory has also predicted scenarios in which applied force accelerates dissociation of unloaded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>s and kinetically strengthens strained <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>s. We report here unambiguous experimental validation of this hypothesis: Detailed kinetic measurements demonstrate that stretching phosphotriesters accelerates dissociation of the unloaded phosphorus-oxygen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> orthogonal to the pulling axis, whereas stretching organosiloxanes inhibits dissociation of the aligned loaded silicon-oxygen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>s. Qualitatively, the outcome is determined by phosphoester elongation and siloxane contraction along the pulling axis in the respective rate-determining transition states. Quantitatively, the results agree with a simple mechanochemical kinetics model.</p>

Organometallic and radical intermediates reveal mechanism of diphthamide biosynthesis
<p>Diphthamide biosynthesis involves a carbon-carbon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>-forming reaction catalyzed by a radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) enzyme that cleaves a carbon-sulfur (C–S) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> in SAM to generate a 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl (ACP) radical. Using rapid freezing, we have captured an organometallic intermediate with an iron-carbon (Fe–C) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> between ACP and the enzyme’s [4Fe-4S] cluster. In the presence of the substrate protein, elongation factor 2, this intermediate converts to an organic radical, formed by addition of the ACP radical to a histidine side chain. Crystal structures of archaeal diphthamide biosynthetic radical SAM enzymes reveal that the carbon of the SAM C–S <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> being cleaved is positioned near the unique cluster Fe, able to react with the cluster. Our results explain how selective C–S <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> cleavage is achieved in this radical SAM enzyme.</p>

Metalloprotein entatic control of ligand-metal bonds quantified by ultrafast x-ray spectroscopy
<p>The multifunctional protein cytochrome c (cyt c) plays key roles in electron transport and apoptosis, switching function by modulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>ing between a heme iron and the sulfur in a methionine residue. This Fe–S(Met) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> is too weak to persist in the absence of protein constraints. We ruptured the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> in ferrous cyt c using an optical laser pulse and monitored the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> reformation within the protein active site using ultrafast x-ray pulses from an x-ray free-electron laser, determining that the Fe–S(Met) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> enthalpy is ~4 kcal/mol stronger than in the absence of protein constraints. The 4 kcal/mol is comparable with calculations of stabilization effects in other systems, demonstrating how biological systems use an entatic state for modest yet accessible energetics to modulate chemical function.</p>

Ethane/ethylene separation in a metal-organic framework with iron-peroxo sites
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of ethane from its corresponding ethylene is an important, challenging, and energy-intensive process in the chemical industry.

Structural insights into ion conduction by channelrhodopsin 2
<p>The light-gated ion channel channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2) from <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> is a major optogenetic tool. Photon absorption starts a well-characterized photocycle, but the structural basis for the regulation of channel opening remains unclear. We present high-resolution structures of ChR2 and the C128T mutant, which has a markedly increased open-state lifetime. The structure reveals two cavities on the intracellular side and two cavities on the extracellular side. They are connected by extended hydrogen-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>ing networks involving water molecules and side-chain residues. Central is the retinal Schiff base that controls and synchronizes three gates that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate the cavities. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate from this network is the DC gate that comprises a water-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> between C128 and D156 and interacts directly with the retinal Schiff base. Comparison with the C128T structure reveals a direct connection of the DC gate to the central gate and suggests how the gating mechanism is affected by subtle tuning of the Schiff base’s interactions.</p>

Control of zeolite framework flexibility and pore topology for separation of ethane and ethylene

Here we describe the synthesis and structural determination of a flexible pure silica zeolite (ITQ-55). This material can kinetically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate ethylene from ethane with an unprecedented selectivity of ~100, owing to its distinctive pore topology with large heart-shaped cages and framework flexibility.

Vinculin forms a directionally asymmetric catch bond with F-actin
<p>Vinculin is an actin-binding protein thought to reinforce cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesions. However, how mechanical load affects the vinculin–F-actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> is unclear. Using a single-molecule optical trap assay, we found that vinculin forms a force-dependent catch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> with F-actin through its tail domain, but with lifetimes that depend strongly on the direction of the applied force. Force toward the pointed (–) end of the actin filament resulted in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> that was maximally stable at 8 piconewtons, with a mean lifetime (12 seconds) 10 times as long as the mean lifetime when force was applied toward the barbed (+) end. A computational model of lamellipodial actin dynamics suggests that the directionality of the vinculin–F-actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> could establish long-range order in the actin cytoskeleton. The directional and force-stabilized binding of vinculin to F-actin may be a mechanism by which adhesion complexes maintain front-rear asymmetry in migrating cells.</p>

Real-space imaging of molecular structure and chemical bonding by single-molecule inelastic tunneling probe

Spatially structured cell populations process multiple sensory signals in parallel in intact vascular endothelium
<p>Blood flow, blood clotting, angiogenesis, vascular permeability, and vascular remodeling are each controlled by a large number of variable, noisy, and interacting chemical inputs to the vascular endothelium. The endothelium processes the entirety of the chemical composition to which the cardiovascular system is exposed, carrying out sophisticated computations that determine physiological output. Processing this enormous quantity of information is a major challenge facing the endothelium. We analyzed the responses of hundreds of endothelial cells to carbachol (CCh) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and found that the endothelium segregates the responses to these two distinct components of the chemical environment into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate streams of complementary information that are processed in parallel. Sensitivities to CCh and ATP mapped to different clusters of cells, and each agonist generated distinct signal patterns. The distinct signals were features of agonist activation rather than properties of the cells themselves. When there was more than one stimulus present, the cells communicated and combined inputs to generate new distinct signals that were nonlinear combinations of the inputs. Our results demonstrate that the endothelium is a structured, collaborative sensory network that simplifies the complex environment using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate cell clusters that are sensitive to distinct aspects of the overall biochemical environment and interactively compute signals from diverse but interrelated chemical inputs. These features enable the endothelium to selectively process <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate signals and perform multiple computations in an environment that is noisy and variable.</p>

Large-area graphene-nanomesh/carbon-nanotube hybrid membranes for ionic and molecular nanofiltration

Site-selective enzymatic C‐H amidation for synthesis of diverse lactams

Self-assembly of lattices with high structural complexity from a geometrically simple molecule

This complicated porous structure consists of only one type of fully aromatic multijoint molecule carrying three identical dipyridylphenyl wedges. Despite its high symmetry, this molecule accomplishes difficult tasks by using two of its three wedges for roof-floor formation and using its other wedge for wall formation. Although a C–H···N <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> is extremely labile, the porous crystal maintains its porosity until thermal breakdown of the C–H···N <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>s at 202°C occurs, affording a nonporous polymorph.

DNA-induced liquid phase condensation of cGAS activates innate immune signaling
<p>The binding of DNA to cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS) leads to the production of the secondary messenger cyclic GMP–AMP (cGAMP), which activates innate immune responses.

The disordered and positively charged cGAS N terminus enhanced cGAS-DNA phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation by increasing the valencies of DNA binding. Long DNA was more efficient in promoting cGAS liquid phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation and cGAS enzyme activity than short DNA. Moreover, free zinc ions enhanced cGAS enzyme activity both in vitro and in cells by promoting cGAS-DNA phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation.

Asymmetric nucleophilic fluorination under hydrogen bonding phase-transfer catalysis

Phase separation of a yeast prion protein promotes cellular fitness
<p>Despite the important role of prion domains in neurodegenerative disease, their physiological function has remained enigmatic.

In stressed conditions, Sup35 formed protective gels via pH-regulated liquid-like phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation followed by gelation. Phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation was mediated by the N-terminal prion domain and regulated by the adjacent pH sensor domain.

Mechanically robust, readily repairable polymers via tailored noncovalent cross-linking
<p>Expanding the range of healable materials is an important challenge for sustainable societies. Noncrystalline, high-molecular-weight polymers generally form mechanically robust materials, which, however, are difficult to repair once they are fractured. This is because their polymer chains are heavily entangled and diffuse too sluggishly to unite fractured surfaces within reasonable time scales. Here we report that low-molecular-weight polymers, when cross-linked by dense hydrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>s, yield mechanically robust yet readily repairable materials, despite their extremely slow diffusion dynamics. A key was to use thiourea, which anomalously forms a zigzag hydrogen-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>ed array that does not induce unfavorable crystallization. Another key was to incorporate a structural element for activating the exchange of hydrogen-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>ed pairs, which enables the fractured portions to rejoin readily upon compression.</p>

Lewis acid enhancement by hydrogen-bond donors for asymmetric catalysis

However, these catalysts are only weakly acidic and therefore require highly reactive electrophilic substrates to be effective. We introduce here a mode of catalytic activity with chiral H-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> donors that enables enantioselective reactions of relatively unreactive electrophiles. Squaramides are shown to interact with silyl triflates by binding the triflate counterion to form a stable, yet highly Lewis acidic, complex. The silyl triflate-chiral squaramide combination promotes the generation of oxocarbenium intermediates from acetal substrates at low temperatures. Enantioselectivity in nucleophile additions to the cationic intermediates is then controlled through a network of noncovalent interactions between the squaramide catalyst and the oxocarbenium triflate.</p>

<p>Methane undergoes highly facile C–H <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> cleavage on the stoichiometric IrO<sub>2</sub>(110) surface.

The initial dissociation probability of methane on IrO<sub>2</sub>(110) decreased from 80 to 20% with increasing surface temperature from 175 to 300 K. We estimate that the activation energy for methane C–H <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> cleavage is 9.5 kilojoule per mole (kJ/mol) lower than the binding energy of the adsorbed precursor on IrO<sub>2</sub>(110), and equal to a value of ~28.5 kJ/mol.

An artificial metalloenzyme with the kinetics of native enzymes

Protein Phosphatase 2A B'α and B'β Protect Centromeric Cohesion during Meiosis I
<p>During meiosis, the stepwise release of sister chromatid cohesion is crucial for the equal distribution of genetic material to daughter cells, enabling generation of fertile gametophytes. However, the molecular mechanism that protects centromeric cohesion from release at meiosis I is unclear in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Here, we report that the protein phosphatase 2A regulatory subunits B'α and B'β participate in the control of sister chromatid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation. The double mutant <i>b'αβ</i> exhibited severe male and female sterility, caused by the lack of a nucleus or presence of an abnormal nucleus in mature microspores and embryo sacs. 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole staining revealed unequal amounts of DNA in the mononuclear microspores. Transverse sections of the anthers revealed unevenly sized tetrads with or without a nucleus, suggesting a defect in meiocyte meiosis. An analysis of chromosome spreads showed that the sister chromatids <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated prematurely at anaphase I in <i>b'αβ</i>. Immunoblotting showed that AtRECOMBINATION DEFECTIVE8 (AtREC8), a key member of the cohesin complex, was hyperphosphorylated in <i>b'αβ</i> anthers and pistils during meiosis but hypophosphorylated in the wild type. Furthermore, yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays showed that B'α and B'β interact specifically with AtREC8, AtSHUGOSHIN1 (AtSGO1), AtSGO2, and PATRONUS1. Given that B'α was reported to localize to the centromere in meiotic cells, we propose that protein phosphatase 2A B'α and B'β are recruited by AtSGO1/2 and PATRONUS1 to dephosphorylate AtREC8 at the site of centromere cohesion to shield it from cleavage until anaphase II, contributing to the balanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of sister chromatids at meiosis.</p>

Observation of alkaline earth complexes M(CO)<sub>8</sub> (M = Ca, Sr, or Ba) that mimic transition metals

Analysis of the electronic structure of these cubic <i>O<sub>h</sub></i>-symmetric complexes reveals that the metal–carbon monoxide (CO) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>s arise mainly from [M(d<sub>π</sub>)] → (CO)<sub>8</sub> π backdonation, which explains the strong observed red shift of the C-O stretching frequencies.

Phase separation focuses DNA sensing
<p>The presence of any double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) in the cytosol is a potent trigger for the activation of innate immune responses. In the context of an infection, immunorecognition of “foreign” dsDNA serves as a central host strategy to detect the presence of pathogens. Under certain conditions, however, sensing of aberrant cytosolic self-dsDNA can also promote destructive inflammation in autoinflammatory diseases. A fundamental question is how cells spatially organize and biochemically regulate the recognition of intracellular dsDNA in the vast cytosolic space of a cell. On page 704 in this issue, Du and Chen (<i>1</i>) introduce an elegant explanation by demonstrating that phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of the dsDNA sensor cGAS [cyclic GMP (guanosine monophosphate)–AMP (adenosine monophosphate) synthase] enables this central task. This adds to the cellular processes that are facilitated by phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation.</p>

Coactivator condensation at super-enhancers links phase separation and gene control
<p>Super-enhancers (SEs) are clusters of enhancers that cooperatively assemble a high density of the transcriptional apparatus to drive robust expression of genes with prominent roles in cell identity. Here we demonstrate that the SE-enriched transcriptional coactivators BRD4 and MED1 form nuclear puncta at SEs that exhibit properties of liquid-like condensates and are disrupted by chemicals that perturb condensates. The intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of BRD4 and MED1 can form phase-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated droplets, and MED1-IDR droplets can compartmentalize and concentrate the transcription apparatus from nuclear extracts. These results support the idea that coactivators form phase-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated condensates at SEs that compartmentalize and concentrate the transcription apparatus, suggest a role for coactivator IDRs in this process, and offer insights into mechanisms involved in the control of key cell-identity genes.</p>

Teaching an old carbocation new tricks: Intermolecular C–H insertion reactions of vinyl cations
<p>Vinyl carbocations have been the subject of extensive experimental and theoretical studies over the past five decades. Despite this long history in chemistry, the utility of vinyl cations in chemical synthesis has been limited, with most reactivity studies focusing on solvolysis reactions or intramolecular processes. Here we report synthetic and mechanistic studies of vinyl cations generated through silylium–weakly coordinating anion catalysis. We find that these reactive intermediates undergo mild intermolecular carbon-carbon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>–forming reactions, including carbon-hydrogen (C–H) insertion into unactivated sp<sup>3</sup> C–H <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>s and reductive Friedel-Crafts reactions with arenes.

This reaction manifold provides a framework for the catalytic functionalization of hydrocarbons using simple ketone derivatives.</p>

RNA buffers the phase separation behavior of prion-like RNA binding proteins
<p>Prion-like RNA binding proteins (RBPs) such as TDP43 and FUS are largely soluble in the nucleus but form solid pathological aggregates when mislocalized to the cytoplasm. What keeps these proteins soluble in the nucleus and promotes aggregation in the cytoplasm is still unknown. We report here that RNA critically regulates the phase behavior of prion-like RBPs. Low RNA/protein ratios promote phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation into liquid droplets, whereas high ratios prevent droplet formation in vitro. Reduction of nuclear RNA levels or genetic ablation of RNA binding causes excessive phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation and the formation of cytotoxic solid-like assemblies in cells. We propose that the nucleus is a buffered system in which high RNA concentrations keep RBPs soluble. Changes in RNA levels or RNA binding abilities of RBPs cause aberrant phase transitions.</p>

Spatially distributed multipartite entanglement enables EPR steering of atomic clouds

However, the robust generation and detection of entanglement between spatially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated regions of an ultracold atomic system remain a challenge. We used spin mixing in a tightly confined Bose-Einstein condensate to generate an entangled state of indistinguishable particles in a single spatial mode. We show experimentally that this entanglement can be spatially distributed by self-similar expansion of the atomic cloud. We used spatially resolved spin read-out to reveal a particularly strong form of quantum correlations known as Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering between distinct parts of the expanded cloud. Based on the strength of EPR steering, we constructed a witness, which confirmed genuine 5-partite entanglement.</p>

Molecular mechanism of extreme mechanostability in a pathogen adhesin
<p>High resilience to mechanical stress is key when pathogens adhere to their target and initiate infection. Using atomic force microscopy–based single-molecule force spectroscopy, we explored the mechanical stability of the prototypical staphylococcal adhesin SdrG, which targets a short peptide from human fibrinogen β. Steered molecular dynamics simulations revealed, and single-molecule force spectroscopy experiments confirmed, the mechanism by which this complex withstands forces of over 2 nanonewtons, a regime previously associated with the strength of a covalent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>. The target peptide, confined in a screwlike manner in the binding pocket of SdrG, distributes forces mainly toward the peptide backbone through an intricate hydrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> network. Thus, these adhesins can attach to their target with exceptionally resilient mechanostability, virtually independent of peptide side chains.</p>

A liquid-liquid transition in supercooled aqueous solution related to the HDA-LDA transition
<p>Simulations and theory suggest that the thermodynamic anomalies of water may be related to a phase transition between two supercooled liquid states, but so far this phase transition has not been observed experimentally because of preemptive ice crystallization. We used calorimetry, infrared spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate a water-rich hydrazinium trifluoroacetate solution in which the local hydrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> structure surrounding a water molecule resembles that in neat water at elevated pressure, but which does not crystallize upon cooling. Instead, this solution underwent a sharp, reversible phase transition between two homogeneous liquid states. The hydrogen-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> structures of these two states are similar to those established for high- and low-density amorphous (HDA and LDA) water. Such structural similarity supports theories that predict a similar sharp transition in pure water under pressure if ice crystallization could be suppressed.</p>

Organocalcium-mediated nucleophilic alkylation of benzene

Calcium <i>n</i>-alkyl derivatives—synthesized by reaction of ethene, but-1-ene, and hex-1-ene with a dimeric calcium hydride—react with protio and deutero benzene at 60°C through nucleophilic substitution of an aromatic C–D/H <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>. These reactions produce the <i>n-</i>alkyl benzenes with regeneration of the calcium hydride.

Enhanced water permeability and tunable ion selectivity in subnanometer carbon nanotube porins
<p>Fast water transport through carbon nanotube pores has raised the possibility to use them in the next generation of water treatment technologies.

Intermolecular hydrogen-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> rearrangement, required for entry into the nanotube, dominates the energy barrier and can be manipulated to enhance water transport rates. CNTPs block anion transport, even at salinities that exceed seawater levels, and their ion selectivity can be tuned to configure them into switchable ionic diodes.

Revealing hidden antiferromagnetic correlations in doped Hubbard chains via string correlators

Direction-specific van der Waals attraction between rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> nanocrystals
<p>Mutual lattice orientations dictate the types and magnitudes of forces between crystalline particles.

At tens of nanometers of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation, the attraction is weak and shows no dependence on azimuthal alignment or surface hydration. At <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ations of approximately one hydration layer, the attraction is strongly dependent on azimuthal alignment and systematically decreases as intervening water density increases.

Mechanism of Activation of Protein Kinase JAK2 by the Growth Hormone Receptor
<p>Signaling from JAK (Janus kinase) protein kinases to STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) transcription factors is key to many aspects of biology and medicine, yet the mechanism by which cytokine receptors initiate signaling is enigmatic. We present a complete mechanistic model for activation of receptor-bound JAK2, based on an archetypal cytokine receptor, the growth hormone receptor. For this, we used fluorescence resonance energy transfer to monitor positioning of the JAK2 binding motif in the receptor dimer, substitution of the receptor extracellular domains with Jun zippers to control the position of its transmembrane (TM) helices, atomistic modeling of TM helix movements, and docking of the crystal structures of the JAK2 kinase and its inhibitory pseudokinase domain with an opposing kinase-pseudokinase domain pair. Activation of the receptor dimer induced a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of its JAK2 binding motifs, driven by a ligand-induced transition from a parallel TM helix pair to a left-handed crossover arrangement. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation leads to removal of the pseudokinase domain from the kinase domain of the partner JAK2 and pairing of the two kinase domains, facilitating trans-activation. This model may well generalize to other class I cytokine receptors.</p>

<p>The correct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis I, and sister chromatids during meiosis II, relies on the tight control of the cohesion complex. The phosphorylation and subsequent cleavage of the meiotic recombination protein REC8 (REC8-like family protein [SYN1] in Arabidopsis [<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>]), the α-kleisin subunit of the cohesion ring, along the chromosome arms at meiosis I allows crossovers and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of homologous chromosomes without chromatid dissociation. REC8 continues to localize and function at the centromeres up to metaphase II and, in yeast and vertebrates, is protected from cleavage by means of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)-mediated dephosphorylation. Here, we show that, in plants, centromeric sister chromatid cohesion until meiosis II also requires the activity of a PP2A-type phosphatase complex. The combined absence of the regulatory subunits PP2AB′α and PP2AB′β leads to the premature loss of chromosome cohesion in meiosis I. Male meiocytes of the <i>pp2ab′αβ</i> double mutant display premature depletion of SYN1. The PP2AA1 structural and B′α regulatory subunit localize specifically to centromeres until metaphase II, supporting a role for the PP2A complex in the SYN1-mediated maintenance of centromeric cohesion in plant meiosis.</p>

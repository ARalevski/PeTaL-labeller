The Non-Mendelian Green Cotyledon Gene in Soybean Encodes a Small Subunit of Photosystem II
<p>Chlorophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation plays important roles in leaf senescence including regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of chlorophyll-binding proteins. Although most genes encoding enzymes of the chlorophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation pathway have been identified, the regulation of their activity has not been fully understood. Green cotyledon mutants in legume are stay-green mutants, in which chlorophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation is impaired during leaf senescence and seed maturation. Among them, the soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) green cotyledon gene <i>cytG</i> is unique because it is maternally inherited. To isolate <i>cytG</i>, we extensively sequenced the soybean chloroplast genome, and detected a 5-bp insertion causing a frame-shift in <i>psbM</i>, which encodes one of the small subunits of photosystem II. Mutant tobacco plants (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) with a disrupted <i>psbM</i> generated using a chloroplast transformation technique had green senescent leaves, confirming that <i>cytG</i> encodes PsbM. The phenotype of <i>cytG</i> was very similar to that of mutant of chlorophyll <i>b</i> reductase catalyzing the first step of chlorophyll <i>b</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation. In fact, chlorophyll <i>b</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ing activity in dark-grown <i>cytG</i> and <i>psbM</i>-knockout seedlings was significantly lower than that of wild-type plants. Our results suggest that PsbM is a unique protein linking photosynthesis in presenescent leaves with chlorophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation during leaf senescence and seed maturation. Additionally, we discuss the origin of <i>cytG</i>, which may have been selected during domestication of soybean.</p>

Distinct control of PERIOD2 degradation and circadian rhythms by the oncoprotein and ubiquitin ligase MDM2
<p>The circadian clock relies on posttranslational modifications to set the timing for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of core regulatory components, which drives clock progression. Ubiquitin-modifying enzymes that target clock components for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation mainly recognize phosphorylated substrates. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of the circadian clock component PERIOD 2 (PER2) is mediated by its phospho-specific recognition by β-transducin repeat–containing proteins (β-TrCPs), which are F-box–containing proteins that function as substrate recognition subunits of the SCF<sup>β-TRCP</sup> ubiquitin ligase complex. However, this mode of regulating PER2 stability falls short of explaining the persistent oscillatory phenotypes reported in biological systems lacking functional elements of the phospho-dependent PER2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation machinery. We identified PER2 as a previously uncharacterized substrate for the ubiquitin ligase mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2) and found that MDM2 targeted PER2 for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation in a manner independent of PER2 phosphorylation. Deregulation of MDM2 plays a major role in oncogenesis by contributing to the accumulation of genomic and epigenomic alterations that favor tumor development. MDM2-mediated PER2 turnover was important for defining the circadian period length in mammalian cells, a finding that emphasizes the connection between the circadian clock and cancer. Our results not only broaden the range of specific substrates of MDM2 beyond the cell cycle to include circadian components but also identify a previously unknown regulator of the clock as a druggable node that is often found to be deregulated during tumorigenesis.</p>

Transcriptome Analysis Identifies a Zinc Finger Protein Regulating Starch Degradation in Kiwifruit
<p>Ripening, including softening, is a critical factor in determining the postharvest shelf-life of fruit and is controlled by enzymes involved in cell wall metabolism, starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation, and hormone metabolism. Here, we used a transcriptomics-based approach to identify transcriptional regulatory components associated with texture, ethylene, and starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation in ripening kiwifruit (<i>Actinidia deliciosa</i>). Twelve differentially expressed structural genes, including seven involved in cell wall metabolism, four in ethylene biosynthesis, and one in starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation, and 14 transcription factors (TFs) induced by exogenous ethylene treatment and inhibited by the ethylene signaling inhibitor 1-methylcyclopropene were identified as changing in transcript levels during ripening. Moreover, analysis of the regulatory effects of differentially expressed genes identified a zinc finger TF, DNA BINDING WITH ONE FINGER (AdDof3), which showed significant transactivation on the <i>AdBAM3L</i> (β-amylase) promoter. AdDof3 interacted physically with the <i>AdBAM3L</i> promoter, and stable overexpression of <i>AdBAM3L</i> resulted in lower starch content in transgenic kiwifruit leaves, suggesting that <i>AdBAM3L</i> is a key gene for starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation. Moreover, transient overexpression analysis showed that AdDof3 up-regulated <i>AdBAM3L</i> expression in kiwifruit. Thus, transcriptomics analysis not only allowed the prediction of some ripening-regulating genes but also facilitated the characterization of a TF, AdDof3, and a key structural gene, <i>AdBAM3L</i>, in starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation.</p>

The Ubiquitin E3 Ligase RHA2b Promotes Degradation of MYB30 in Abscisic Acid Signaling
<p>The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) is critical for plants encountering abiotic stress. We reported previously that the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) transcription factor MYB30 participates in ABA responses via SUMO ligase SAP-MIZ Domain-Containing SIZ1-mediated sumoylation. Here, we show that the RING-type ubiquitin E3 ligase RHA2b, which positively regulates ABA signaling, interacted with and ubiquitinated MYB30 to modulate MYB30 stability through the 26S proteasome pathway. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation rate of MYB30 was repressed significantly in the <i>rha2b-1</i> mutant. Phenotypic analyses showed that <i>MYB30</i> acts genetically downstream of <i>RHA2b</i> in ABA signaling. Substitutions of lysine-283 (K283) and K165 blocked ubiquitination, suggesting that these residues are sites of ubiquitination. K283 residue substitution significantly inhibited the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of MYB30 induced by ABA. The K165 site functioned additively with K283 in ABA-induced MYB30 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation and ABA responses. At the same time, sumoylation protected MYB30 from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation under cycloheximide and ABA treatment. Compared with MYB30, overexpression of MYB30-SUMO1 partially recovered the ABA sensitivity of <i>siz1-2</i>. But MYB30-SUMO1 exhibited similar localization with MYB30 in nuclei. Overall, our results suggest that RHA2b targets MYB30 for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation to modulate ABA signaling. Considering that the K283 residue also is the major site for sumoylation, we propose that sumoylation and ubiquitination act antagonistically in the ABA response to regulate the stability of MYB30 by occupying the same residue.</p>

Leaf Starch Turnover Occurs in Long Days and in Falling Light at the End of the Day
<p>We investigated whether starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation occurs at the same time as starch synthesis in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves in the light. Starch accumulated in a linear fashion for about 12 h after dawn, then accumulation slowed and content plateaued. Following decreases in light intensity, the rate of accumulation of starch declined in proportion to the decline in photosynthesis if the decrease occurred <10 h after dawn, but accumulation ceased or loss of starch occurred if the same decrease in light intensity was imposed more than 10 h after dawn. These changes in starch accumulation patterns after prolonged periods in the light occurred at both high and low starch contents and were not related to time-dependent changes in either the rate of photosynthesis or the partitioning of assimilate between starch and Suc, as assessed from metabolite measurements and <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> pulse experiments. Instead, measurements of incorporation of <sup>13</sup>C from <sup>13</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> into starch and of levels of the starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation product maltose showed that substantial starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation occurred simultaneously with synthesis at time points >14 h after dawn and in response to decreases in light intensity that occurred >10 h after dawn. Starch measurements in circadian clock mutants suggested that the clock influences the timing of onset of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation. We conclude that the propensity for leaf starch to be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ed increases with time after dawn. The importance of this phenomenon for efficient use of carbon for growth in long days and for prevention of starvation during twilight is discussed.</p>

Functional degradation: A mechanism of NLRP1 inflammasome activation by diverse pathogen enzymes
<p>Inflammasomes are multiprotein platforms that initiate innate immunity by recruitment and activation of caspase-1. The NLRP1B inflammasome is activated upon direct cleavage by the anthrax lethal toxin protease. However, the mechanism by which cleavage results in NLRP1B activation is unknown. In this study, we find that cleavage results in proteasome-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of the amino-terminal domains of NLRP1B, liberating a carboxyl-terminal fragment that is a potent caspase-1 activator. Proteasome-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of NLRP1B is both necessary and sufficient for NLRP1B activation. Consistent with our functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation model, we identify IpaH7.8, a <i>Shigella flexneri</i> ubiquitin ligase secreted effector, as an enzyme that induces NLRP1B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation and activation. Our results provide a unified mechanism for NLRP1B activation by diverse pathogen-encoded enzymatic activities.</p>

N-terminal degradation activates the NLRP1B inflammasome
<p>Intracellular pathogens and danger signals trigger the formation of inflammasomes, which activate inflammatory caspases and induce pyroptosis. The anthrax lethal factor metalloprotease and small-molecule DPP8/9 inhibitors both activate the NLRP1B inflammasome, but the molecular mechanism of NLRP1B activation is unknown. In this study, we used genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screens to identify genes required for NLRP1B-mediated pyroptosis. We discovered that lethal factor induces cell death via the N-end rule proteasomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation pathway. Lethal factor directly cleaves NLRP1B, inducing the N-end rule–mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of the NLRP1B N terminus and freeing the NLRP1B C terminus to activate caspase-1. DPP8/9 inhibitors also induce proteasomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of the NLRP1B N terminus but not via the N-end rule pathway. Thus, N-terminal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation is the common activation mechanism of this innate immune sensor.</p>

Structure basis for RNA-guided DNA degradation by Cascade and Cas3
<p>Type I CRISPR-Cas system features a sequential target-searching and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation process on double-stranded DNA by the RNA-guided Cascade (CRISPR associated complex for antiviral defense) complex and the nuclease-helicase fusion enzyme Cas3, respectively. Here, we present a 3.7-angstrom-resolution cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the Type I-E Cascade/R-loop/Cas3 complex, poised to initiate DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation. Cas3 distinguishes Cascade conformations and only captures the R-loop–forming Cascade, to avoid cleaving partially complementary targets. Its nuclease domain recruits the nontarget strand (NTS) DNA at a bulged region for the nicking of single-stranded DNA. An additional 4.7-angstrom-resolution cryo-EM structure captures the postnicking state, in which the severed NTS retracts to the helicase entrance, to be threaded for adenosine 5′-triphosphate–dependent processive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation.

Reactivation of recall-induced neurons contributes to remote fear memory attenuation
<p>Whether fear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ation is mediated by inhibition of the original memory trace of fear with a new memory trace of safety or by updating of the original fear trace toward safety has been a long-standing question in neuroscience and psychology alike. In particular, which of the two scenarios underlies the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ation of remote (month-old) fear memories is completely unknown, despite the impetus to better understand this process against the backdrop of enduring traumata. We found—chemogenetically and in an engram-specific manner—that effective remote fear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ation is accompanied by the reactivation of memory recall–induced neurons in the dentate gyrus and that the continued activity of these neurons is critical for fear reduction. This suggests that the original memory trace of fear actively contributes to remote fear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ation.</p>

Determination of intrinsic attenuation in the oceanic lithosphere-asthenosphere system

The strong intrinsic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ation in the asthenosphere obtained at higher frequency (~3 hertz) is comparable to that constrained at lower frequency (~100 seconds) by surface waves and suggests frequency-independent anelasticity, whereas the intrinsic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ation in the lithosphere is frequency dependent. This difference in frequency dependence indicates that the strong and broad peak dissipation recently observed in the laboratory exists only in the asthenosphere and provides new insight into what distinguishes the asthenosphere from the lithosphere.</p>

CAT-tailing as a fail-safe mechanism for efficient degradation of stalled nascent polypeptides
<p>Ribosome stalling leads to recruitment of the ribosome quality control complex (RQC), which targets the partially synthesized polypeptide for proteasomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation through the action of the ubiquitin ligase Ltn1p. A second core RQC component, Rqc2p, modifies the nascent polypeptide by adding a carboxyl-terminal alanine and threonine (CAT) tail through a noncanonical elongation reaction. Here we examined the role of CAT-tailing in nascent-chain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation in budding yeast. We found that Ltn1p efficiently accessed only nascent-chain lysines immediately proximal to the ribosome exit tunnel. For substrates without Ltn1p-accessible lysines, CAT-tailing enabled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation by exposing lysines sequestered in the ribosome exit tunnel. Thus, CAT-tails do not serve as a degron, but rather provide a fail-safe mechanism that expands the range of RQC-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>able substrates.</p>

Nitric Oxide Remodels the Photosynthetic Apparatus upon S-Starvation in <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>
<p>Many photosynthetic autotrophs have evolved responses that adjust their metabolism to limitations in nutrient availability. Here we report a detailed characterization of the remodeling of photosynthesis upon sulfur starvation under heterotrophy and photo-autotrophy in the green alga (<i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>). Photosynthetic inactivation under low light and darkness is achieved through specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of Rubisco and cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub><i>f</i> and occurs only in the presence of reduced carbon in the medium. The process is likely regulated by nitric oxide (NO), which is produced 24 h after the onset of starvation, as detected with NO-sensitive fluorescence probes visualized by fluorescence microscopy. We provide pharmacological evidence that intracellular NO levels govern this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation pathway: the addition of a NO scavenger decreases the rate of cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub><i>f</i> and Rubisco <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation, whereas NO donors accelerate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation. Based on our analysis of the relative contribution of the different NO synthesis pathways, we conclude that the NO<sub>2</sub>-dependent nitrate reductase-independent pathway is crucial for NO production under sulfur starvation. Our data argue for an active role for NO in the remodeling of thylakoid protein complexes upon sulfur starvation.</p>

The Potato MAP3K StVIK Is Required for the <i>Phytophthora infestans</i> RXLR Effector Pi17316 to Promote Disease
<p>Plant pathogens deliver effectors to manipulate processes in their hosts, creating a suitable environment for invasion and proliferation. Yet, little is known about the host proteins that are targeted by effectors from filamentous pathogens. Here, we show that stable transgenic expression in potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>) and transient expression in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> of the arginine-any amino acid-leucine-arginine effector Pi17316 enhances leaf colonization by the late blight pathogen <i>Phytophthora infestans</i>. Expression of Pi17316 also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ates cell death triggered by the pathogen-associated molecular pattern Infestin1 (INF1), indicating that the effector suppresses pattern-triggered immunity. However, this effector does not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ate cell death triggered by a range of resistance proteins, showing that it specifically suppresses INF1-triggered cell death (ICD). In yeast two-hybrid assays, Pi17316 interacts directly with the potato ortholog of VASCULAR HIGHWAY1-interacting kinase (StVIK), encoding a predicted MEK kinase (MAP3K). Interaction in planta was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and occurs at the plant plasma membrane. Virus-induced gene silencing of <i>VIK</i> in <i>N. benthamiana</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ated <i>P. infestans</i> colonization, whereas transient overexpression of <i>StVIK</i> enhanced colonization, indicating that this host protein acts as a susceptibility factor. Moreover, <i>VIK</i> overexpression specifically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ated ICD, indicating that it is a negative regulator of immunity. The abilities of Pi17316 to enhance <i>P. infestans</i> colonization or suppress ICD were compromised significantly in <i>NbVIK</i>-silenced plants, demonstrating that the effector activity of Pi17316 is mediated by this MAP3K. Thus, StVIK is exploited by <i>P. infestans</i> as a susceptibility factor to promote late blight disease.</p>

Control of Retrograde Signaling by Rapid Turnover of GENOMES UNCOUPLED1
<p>The exchange of signals between cellular compartments coordinates development and differentiation, modulates metabolic pathways, and triggers responses to environmental conditions. The proposed central regulator of plastid-to-nucleus retrograde signaling, GENOMES UNCOUPLED1 (GUN1), is present at very low levels, which has hampered the discovery of its precise molecular function. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) GUN1 protein accumulates to detectable levels only at very early stages of leaf development, where it functions in the regulation of chloroplast biogenesis. <i>GUN1</i> mRNA is present at high levels in all tissues, but GUN1 protein undergoes rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation (with an estimated half-life of ∼4 h) in all tissues where chloroplast biogenesis has been completed. The rapid turnover of GUN1 is controlled mainly by the chaperone ClpC1, suggesting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of GUN1 by the Clp protease. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of GUN1 slows under stress conditions that alter retrograde signaling, thus ensuring that the plant has sufficient GUN1 protein. We also find that the pentatricopeptide repeat motifs of GUN1 are important determinants of GUN1 stability. Moreover, overexpression of <i>GUN1</i> causes an early flowering phenotype, suggesting a function of GUN1 in developmental phase transitions beyond chloroplast biogenesis. Taken together, our results provide new insight into the regulation of GUN1 by proteolytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation, uncover its function in early chloroplast biogenesis, and suggest a role in developmental phase transitions.</p>

Higher Novel L-Cys Degradation Activity Results in Lower Organic-S and Biomass in <i>Sarcocornia</i> than the Related Saltwort, <i>Salicornia</i>
<p><i>Salicornia</i> and <i>Sarcocornia</i> are almost identical halophytes whose edible succulent shoots hold promise for commercial production in saline water. Enhanced sulfur nutrition may be beneficial to crops naturally grown on high sulfate. However, little is known about sulfate nutrition in halophytes. Here we show that <i>Salicornia europaea</i> (ecotype RN) exhibits a significant increase in biomass and organic-S accumulation in response to supplemental sulfate, whereas <i>Sarcocornia fruticosa</i> (ecotype VM) does not, instead exhibiting increased sulfate accumulation. We investigated the role of two pathways on organic-S and biomass accumulation in <i>Salicornia</i> and <i>Sarcoconia</i>: the sulfate reductive pathway that generates Cys and <sc>l</sc>-Cys desulfhydrase that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>es Cys to H<sub>2</sub>S, NH<sub>3</sub>, and pyruvate. The major function of <i>O</i>-acetyl-Ser-(thiol) lyase (OAS-TL; EC 2.5.1.47) is the formation of <sc>l</sc>-Cys, but our study shows that the OAS-TL A and OAS-TL B of both halophytes are enzymes that also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>e <sc>l</sc>-Cys to H<sub>2</sub>S. This activity was significantly higher in <i>Sarcocornia</i> than in <i>Salicornia</i>, especially upon sulfate supplementation. The activity of the sulfate reductive pathway key enzyme, adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate reductase (APR, EC 1.8.99.2), was significantly higher in <i>Salicornia</i> than in <i>Sarcocornia</i>. These results suggest that the low organic-S level in <i>Sarcocornia</i> is the result of high <sc>l</sc>-Cys <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation rate by OAS-TLs, whereas the greater organic-S and biomass accumulation in <i>Salicornia</i> is the result of higher APR activity and low <sc>l</sc>-Cys <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation rate, resulting in higher net Cys biosynthesis. These results present an initial road map for halophyte growers to attain better growth rates and nutritional value of <i>Salicornia</i> and <i>Sarcocornia</i>.</p>

Suppressor of Overexpression of CO 1 Negatively Regulates Dark-Induced Leaf Degreening and Senescence by Directly Repressing Pheophytinase and Other Senescence-Associated Genes in Arabidopsis
<p>Although the biochemical pathway of chlorophyll (Chl) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation has been largely elucidated, how Chl is rapidly yet coordinately <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ed during leaf senescence remains elusive. Pheophytinase (PPH) is the enzyme for catalyzing the removal of the phytol group from pheophytin <i>a</i>, and <i>PPH</i> expression is significantly induced during leaf senescence. To elucidate the transcriptional regulation of <i>PPH</i>, we used a yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) one-hybrid system to screen for its trans-regulators. SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CO 1 (SOC1), a key flowering pathway integrator, was initially identified as one of the putative trans-regulators of <i>PPH</i>. After dark treatment, leaves of an <i>SOC1</i> knockdown mutant (<i>soc1-6</i>) showed an accelerated yellowing phenotype, whereas those of <i>SOC1</i>-overexpressing lines exhibited a partial stay-green phenotype. <i>SOC1</i> and <i>PPH</i> expression showed a negative correlation during leaf senescence. Substantially, SOC1 protein could bind specifically to the CArG box of the <i>PPH</i> promoter in vitro and in vivo, and overexpression of <i>SOC1</i> significantly inhibited the transcriptional activity of the <i>PPH</i> promoter in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) protoplasts. Importantly, <i>soc1-6 pph-1</i> (a <i>PPH</i> knockout mutant) double mutant displayed a stay-green phenotype similar to that of <i>pph-1</i> during dark treatment. These results demonstrated that SOC1 inhibits Chl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation via negatively regulating <i>PPH</i> expression. In addition, measurement of the Chl content and the maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II of <i>soc1-6</i> and <i>SOC1-OE</i> leaves after dark treatment suggested that SOC1 also negatively regulates the general senescence process. Seven <i>SENESCENCE-ASSOCIATED GENES</i> (<i>SAGs</i>) were thereafter identified as its potential target genes, and <i>NONYELLOWING1</i> and <i>SAG113</i> were experimentally confirmed. Together, we reveal that SOC1 represses dark-induced leaf Chl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation and senescence in general in Arabidopsis.</p>

We generated cardiac-specific <i>Tmbim1</i> knockout mice and cardiac-specific <i>Tmbim1</i>-overexpressing transgenic mice and then challenged them with AB surgery. We used microarray, confocal image, and coimmunoprecipitation analyses to identify the downstream targets of TMBIM1 in cardiac hypertrophy. <i>Tmbim1</i>/<i>Tlr4</i> double-knockout mice were generated to investigate whether the effects of TMBIM1 on cardiac hypertrophy were Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) dependent. Finally, lentivirus-mediated <i>TMBIM1</i> overexpression in a monkey AB model was performed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of TMBIM1.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>TMBIM1 expression was significantly downregulated on hypertrophic stimuli in both human and mice heart samples. Silencing cardiac <i>Tmbim1</i> aggravated AB-induced cardiac hypertrophy. This effect was blunted by <i>Tmbim1</i> overexpression. Transcriptome profiling revealed that the TLR4 signaling pathway was disrupted dramatically by manipulation of <i>Tmbim1</i>. The effects of TMBIM1 on cardiac hypertrophy were shown to be dependent on TLR4 in double-knockout mice.

Noncanonical NF-κB Activation by the Oncoprotein Tio Occurs Through a Nonconserved TRAF3-Binding Motif
<sec><title>Preventing NF-κB Pathway Crosstalk</title><p>The transcription factor NF-κB (nuclear factor κB) can be activated by so-called canonical and noncanonical pathways. Activation of the noncanonical NF-κB pathway blocks the constitutive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of the kinase NIK (NF-κB–inducing kinase), which leads to the generation of an NF-κB subunit required for target gene expression. The viral oncoprotein Tio mimics a constitutively active receptor upstream of NF-κB signaling, and de Jong <i>et al</i>. found that it contains a binding motif not conserved in other proteins that bind to TRAF3 (tumor necrosis factor receptor–associated factor 3), an inhibitor of noncanonical NF-κB signaling. This TRAF3-binding motif enabled Tio to specifically activate noncanonical NF-κB signaling without triggering crosstalk with the canonical pathway. Tio signaling did not result in TRAF3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation; rather, it induced the sequestration of a TRAF3-containing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ative complex from NIK to stimulate the noncanonical pathway. These data suggest that Tio might be used as a tool to examine the specific activation of genes targeted by noncanonical NF-κB signaling in the context of viral transformation. </p></sec>

Regulation of the ubiquitylation and deubiquitylation of CREB-binding protein modulates histone acetylation and lung inflammation
<p>Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element–binding protein (CREB)–binding protein (CBP) is a histone acetyltransferase that plays a pivotal role in the control of histone modification and the expression of cytokine-encoding genes in inflammatory diseases, including sepsis and lung injury. We found that the E3 ubiquitin ligase subunit FBXL19 targeted CBP for site-specific ubiquitylation and proteasomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation. The ubiquitylation-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of CBP reduced the extent of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)–dependent histone acetylation and cytokine release in mouse lung epithelial cells and in a mouse model of sepsis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the deubiquitylating enzyme USP14 (ubiquitin-specific peptidase 14) stabilized CBP by reducing its ubiquitylation. LPS increased the stability of CBP by reducing the association between CBP and FBXL19 and by activating USP14. Inhibition of USP14 reduced CBP protein abundance and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ated LPS-stimulated histone acetylation and cytokine release. Together, our findings delineate the molecular mechanisms through which CBP stability is regulated by FBXL19 and USP14, which results in the modulation of chromatin remodeling and the expression of cytokine-encoding genes.</p>

RIT1 oncoproteins escape LZTR1-mediated proteolysis
<p>RIT1 oncoproteins have emerged as an etiologic factor in Noonan syndrome and cancer. Despite the resemblance of RIT1 to other members of the Ras small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases), mutations affecting RIT1 are not found in the classic hotspots but rather in a region near the switch II domain of the protein. We used an isogenic germline knock-in mouse model to study the effects of RIT1 mutation at the organismal level, which resulted in a phenotype resembling Noonan syndrome. By mass spectrometry, we detected a RIT1 interactor, leucine zipper–like transcription regulator 1 (LZTR1), that acts as an adaptor for protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation. Pathogenic mutations affecting either RIT1 or LZTR1 resulted in incomplete <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of RIT1. This led to RIT1 accumulation and dysregulated growth factor signaling responses. Our results highlight a mechanism of pathogenesis that relies on impaired protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of the Ras GTPase RIT1.</p>

Genome-wide identification of interferon-sensitive mutations enables influenza vaccine design
<p>In conventional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ated viral vaccines, immunogenicity is often suboptimal. Here we present a systematic approach for vaccine development that eliminates interferon (IFN)–modulating functions genome-wide while maintaining virus replication fitness. We applied a quantitative high-throughput genomics system to influenza A virus that simultaneously measured the replication fitness and IFN sensitivity of mutations across the entire genome. By incorporating eight IFN-sensitive mutations, we generated a hyper–interferon-sensitive (HIS) virus as a vaccine candidate. HIS virus is highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ated in IFN-competent hosts but able to induce transient IFN responses, elicits robust humoral and cellular immune responses, and provides protection against homologous and heterologous viral challenges. Our approach, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ates the virus and promotes immune responses concurrently, is broadly applicable for vaccine development against other pathogens.</p>

Observation of mean path length invariance in light-scattering media
<p>The microstructure of a medium strongly influences how light propagates through it. The amount of disorder it contains determines whether the medium is transparent or opaque. Theory predicts that exciting such a medium homogeneously and isotropically makes some of its optical properties depend only on the medium’s outer geometry. Here, we report an optical experiment demonstrating that the mean path length of light is invariant with respect to the microstructure of the medium it <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scatter</span></strong>s through. Using colloidal solutions with varying concentration and particle size, the invariance of the mean path length is observed over nearly two orders of magnitude in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scatter</span></strong>ing strength.

Quantum control of molecular collisions at 1 kelvin
<p>Measurement of vector correlations in molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scatter</span></strong>ing is an indispensable tool for mapping out interaction potentials. In a coexpanded supersonic beam, we have studied the rotationally inelastic process wherein deuterium hydride (HD) (<i>v </i>= 1, <i>j </i>= 2) collides with molecular deuterium (D<sub>2</sub>) to form HD (<i>v </i>= 1, <i>j </i>= 1), where <i>v</i> and <i>j</i> are the vibrational and rotational quantum numbers, respectively. HD (<i>v </i>= 1, <i>j </i>= 2) was prepared by Stark-induced adiabatic Raman passage, with its bond axis aligned preferentially parallel or perpendicular to the lab-fixed relative velocity. The coexpansion brought the collision temperature down to 1 kelvin, restricting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scatter</span></strong>ing to s and p partial waves. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scatter</span></strong>ing angular distributions showed a dramatic stereodynamic preference (~3:1) for perpendicular versus parallel alignment.

A cyclic oligonucleotide signaling pathway in type III CRISPR-Cas systems
<p>Type III CRISPR-Cas systems in prokaryotes provide immunity against invading nucleic acids through the coordinated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of transcriptionally active DNA and its transcripts by the Csm effector complex.

New developments for protein quality control
<p>The cellular proteome is maintained by a dynamic balance between protein synthesis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation, known as proteostasis. An imperative of successful proteostasis is the detection and removal of misfolded proteins by quality control pathways. Proteins that result from translation errors, misfolding, or age-induced or chemical damage, as well as orphan proteins (which result from inappropriate stoichiometry of multiprotein complexes), are all subject to a variety of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ative pathways to limit their cellular accumulation, which can be toxic (<i>1</i>). One of the striking features of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ative quality control is the juxtaposition of high specificity for misfolded versions of normal proteins with the very broad range of substrates that can be accommodated by each pathway. On pages 472 and 471 of this issue, Yanagitani <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) and Nguyen <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>), respectively, show that a newly discovered quality control pathway is used to bring about the sweeping changes in proteome content that are observed in the differentiation of relatively “cellular” reticulocytes to the highly specialized hemoglobin-rich red blood cells (erythrocytes) (<i>4</i>, <i>5</i>).</p>

Early Senescence in Older Leaves of Low Nitrate-Grown <i>Atxdh1</i> Uncovers a Role for Purine Catabolism in N Supply
<p>The nitrogen (N)-rich ureides allantoin and allantoate, which are products of purine catabolism, play a role in N delivery in Leguminosae. Here, we examined their role as an N source in nonlegume plants using Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants mutated in XANTHINE DEHYDROGENASE1 (AtXDH1), a catalytic bottleneck in purine catabolism. Older leaves of the <i>Atxdh1</i> mutant exhibited early senescence, lower soluble protein, and lower organic N levels as compared with wild-type older leaves when grown with 1 m<sc>m</sc> nitrate but were comparable to the wild type under 5 m<sc>m</sc> nitrate. Similar nitrate-dependent senescence phenotypes were evident in the older leaves of <i>allantoinase</i> (<i>Ataln</i>) and <i>allantoate amidohydrolase</i> (<i>Ataah</i>) mutants, which also are impaired in purine catabolism. Under low-nitrate conditions, xanthine accumulated in older leaves of <i>Atxdh1</i>, whereas allantoin accumulated in both older and younger leaves of <i>Ataln</i> but not in wild-type leaves, indicating the remobilization of xanthine-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ed products from older to younger leaves. Supporting this notion, ureide transporter expression was enhanced in older leaves of the wild type in low-nitrate as compared with high-nitrate conditions. Elevated transcripts and proteins of AtXDH and AtAAH were detected in low-nitrate-grown wild-type plants, indicating regulation at protein and transcript levels. The higher nitrate reductase activity in <i>Atxdh1</i> leaves compared with wild-type leaves indicated a need for nitrate assimilation products. Together, these results indicate that the absence of remobilized purine-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ed N from older leaves of <i>Atxdh1</i> caused senescence symptoms, a result of higher chloroplastic protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation in older leaves of low-nitrate-grown plants.</p>

Decoys Untangle Complicated Redundancy and Reveal Targets of Circadian Clock F-Box Proteins
<p>Eukaryotic circadian clocks utilize the ubiquitin proteasome system to precisely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>e clock proteins. In plants, the F-box-type E3 ubiquitin ligases ZEITLUPE (ZTL), FLAVIN-BINDING, KELCH REPEAT, F-BOX1 (FKF1), and LOV KELCH PROTEIN2 (LKP2) regulate clock period and couple the clock to photoperiodic flowering in response to end-of-day light conditions. To better understand their functions, we expressed decoy ZTL, FKF1, and LKP2 proteins that associate with target proteins but are unable to ubiquitylate their targets in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). These dominant-negative forms of the proteins inhibit the ubiquitylation of target proteins and allow for the study of ubiquitylation-independent and -dependent functions of ZTL, FKF1, and LKP2. We demonstrate the effects of expressing ZTL, FKF1, and LKP2 decoys on the circadian clock and flowering time. Furthermore, the decoy E3 ligases trap substrate interactions, and using immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry, we identify interacting partners. We focus studies on the clock transcription factor CCA1 HIKING EXPEDITION (CHE) and show that ZTL interacts directly with CHE and can mediate CHE ubiquitylation. We also demonstrate that CHE protein is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ed in the dark and that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation is reduced in a <i>ztl</i> mutant plant, showing that CHE is a bona fide ZTL target protein. This work increases our understanding of the genetic and biochemical roles for ZTL, FKF1, and LKP2 and also demonstrates an effective methodology for studying complicated genetic redundancy among E3 ubiquitin ligases.</p>

Boron-Dependent Translational Suppression of the Borate Exporter <i>BOR1</i> Contributes to the Avoidance of Boron Toxicity
<p>Boron (B) is an essential element for plants; however, as high B concentrations are toxic, B transport must be tightly regulated. BOR1 is a borate exporter in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) that facilitates B translocation into shoots under B deficiency conditions. When the B supply is sufficient, <i>BOR1</i> expression is down-regulated by selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of BOR1 protein, while additional <i>BOR1</i> regulatory mechanisms are proposed to exist. In this study, we identified a novel B-dependent <i>BOR1</i> translational suppression mechanism. In vivo and in vitro reporter assays demonstrated that <i>BOR1</i> translation was reduced in a B-dependent manner and that the 5′-untranslated region was both necessary and sufficient for this process. Mutational analysis revealed that multiple upstream open reading frames in the 5′-untranslated region were required for <i>BOR1</i> translational suppression, and this process depended on the efficiency of translational reinitiation at the <i>BOR1</i> open reading frame after translation of the upstream open reading frames. To understand the physiological significance of <i>BOR1</i> regulation, we characterized transgenic plants defective in either one or both of the <i>BOR1</i> regulation mechanisms. <i>BOR1</i> translational suppression was induced at higher B concentrations than those triggering BOR1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation. Plants lacking both regulation mechanisms exhibited more severe shoot growth reduction under high-B conditions than did plants lacking BOR1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation alone, thus demonstrating the importance of <i>BOR1</i> translational suppression. This study demonstrates that two mechanisms of posttranscriptional <i>BOR1</i> regulation, each induced under different B concentrations, contribute to the avoidance of B toxicity in plants.</p>

The Kinase OsCPK4 Regulates a Buffering Mechanism That Fine-Tunes Innate Immunity
<p>The calcium-dependent protein kinase OsCPK4 has been demonstrated to play important roles in salt and drought tolerance, plant growth, and development in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). However, little is known about molecular mechanisms underlying OsCPK4 function in rice immunity. In this study, we demonstrated that the generation of oxidative burst and pathogenesis-related gene expression triggered by microbe-associated molecular patterns were significantly enhanced in the <i>oscpk4</i> mutants. These mutant lines are more resistant to bacterial blight and fungal blast diseases than the wild-type plants, indicating that OsCPK4 negatively regulates innate immunity in rice. OsCPK4 was further identified to interact with a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase OsRLCK176. OsRLCK176 accumulation is negatively regulated by OsCPK4. Interestingly, the kinase-dead OsCPK4 promotes OsRLCK176 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation more strongly than the wild-type protein. OsCPK4 and OsRLCK176 mutually phosphorylate each other and form a feedback loop. Moreover, the kinase activity and phosphorylation of OsCPK4 and OsRLCK176 contribute to the stability of OsRLCK176. These findings indicate that the kinase-inactive OsCPK4 promotes OsRLCK176 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation and restricts plant defenses, whereas the activation of OsCPK4-OsRLCK176 phosphorylation circuit invalidates the OsRLCK176 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation machinery, thus enhancing plant immunity. Collectively, the study proposes a novel defense buffering mechanism mediated by OsCPK4, which fine-tunes microbe-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity in rice.</p>

Arabidopsis β-Amylase2 Is a K<sup>+</sup>-Requiring, Catalytic Tetramer with Sigmoidal Kinetics
<p>The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) genome contains nine β-amylase (<i>BAM</i>) genes, some of which play important roles in starch hydrolysis. However, little is known about BAM2, a plastid-localized enzyme reported to have extremely low catalytic activity. Using conservation of intron positions, we determined that the nine Arabidopsis <i>BAM</i> genes fall into two distinct subfamilies. A similar pattern was found in each major lineage of land plants, suggesting that these subfamilies diverged prior to the origin of land plants. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis indicated that <i>BAM2</i> is the ancestral member of one of these subfamilies. This finding, along with the conservation of amino acids in the active site of BAM2, suggested that it might be catalytically active. We then identified KCl as necessary for BAM2 activity. Unlike BAM1, BAM3, and BAM5, three Arabidopsis BAMs that all exhibited hyperbolic kinetics, BAM2 exhibited sigmoidal kinetics with a Hill coefficient of over 3. Using multi-angle light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scatter</span></strong>ing, we determined that BAM2 was a tetramer, whereas BAM5 was a monomer. Conserved residues from a diverse set of BAM2 orthologs were mapped onto a homology model of the protein, revealing a large, conserved surface away from the active site that we hypothesize is a secondary carbohydrate-binding site. Introduction of bulky methionine for glycine at two points on this surface reduced catalytic activity significantly without disrupting the tetrameric structure. Expression analysis indicated that BAM2 is more closely coexpressed with other starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation enzymes than any other BAM, suggesting that BAM2 may play an important role in starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation in plants.</p>

The E3 Ligase TaSAP5 Alters Drought Stress Responses by Promoting the Degradation of DRIP Proteins
<p>In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants growing under normal conditions, DEHYDRATION-RESPONSIVE ELEMENT BINDING PROTEIN2A (DREB2A) is present at low levels because it is ubiquitinated and destabilized by DREB2A INTERACTING PROTEIN1 (DRIP1) and DRIP2 through 26S proteasome-mediated proteolysis. Drought stress counteracts the ubiquitination and proteolysis of DREB2A, thus allowing the accumulation of sufficient amounts of DREB2A protein to activate downstream gene expression. The mechanisms leading to drought stress-mediated DREB2A accumulation are still unclear. Here, we report that the wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) TaSAP5 protein, which contains an A20/AN1 domain, acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to mediate DRIP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation and thus increase DREB2A protein levels. Drought induces <i>TaSAP5</i> expression in wheat, and <i>TaSAP5</i> overexpression in Arabidopsis and wheat seedlings increased their drought tolerance, as measured by survival rate and grain yield under severe drought stress. TaSAP5 can interact with and ubiquitinate TaDRIP, as well as AtDRIP1 and AtDRIP2, leading to their subsequent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation through the 26S proteasome pathway. Consistent with this, <i>TaSAP5</i> overexpression enhances DRIP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation and increases the levels of DREB2A protein and its downstream targets. These results suggest that TaSAP5 acts to link drought with DREB2A accumulation and illustrate the molecular mechanisms involved in this process.</p>

The RING-Type E3 Ligase XBAT35.2 Is Involved in Cell Death Induction and Pathogen Response
<p>XBAT35 belongs to a subfamily of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) RING-type E3s that are similar in domain architecture to the rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) XA21 Binding Protein3, a defense protein. The <i>XBAT35</i> transcript undergoes alternative splicing to produce two protein isoforms, XBAT35.1 and XBAT35.2. Here, we demonstrate that XBAT35.2 localizes predominantly to the Golgi and is involved in cell death induction and pathogen response. XBAT35.2, but not XBAT35.1, was found to trigger cell death when overexpressed in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>) leaves and does so in a manner that requires its RING domain. Loss of <i>XBAT35</i> gene function disrupts the plant’s ability to defend against pathogen attack, whereas overexpression of <i>XBAT35.2</i> enhances resistance to pathogens. XBAT35.2 was found to be unstable and promotes its own <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation, suggesting self-regulation. Inoculation with virulent and avirulent strains of the bacterial pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>tomato</i> DC3000 results in a drastic reduction in the levels of ubiquitinated XBAT35.2 and an increase in the abundance of the E3. This implies that pathogen infection prohibits XBAT35.2 self-regulation and stabilizes the E3. In agreement with a role in defending against pathogens, XBAT35.2 interacts with defense-related Accelerated Cell Death11 (ACD11) in planta and promotes the proteasome-dependent turnover of ACD11 in cell-free <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation assays. In accordance with regulation by a stabilized XBAT35.2, the levels of ubiquitinated ACD11 increased considerably, and the abundance of ACD11 was reduced following pathogen infection. In addition, treatment of transgenic seedlings with a proteasome inhibitor results in the accumulation of ACD11, confirming proteasome-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation. Collectively, these results highlight a novel role for XBAT35.2 in cell death induction and defense against pathogens.</p>

5′ to 3′ mRNA Decay Contributes to the Regulation of Arabidopsis Seed Germination by Dormancy
<p>The regulation of plant gene expression, necessary for development and adaptive responses, relies not only on RNA transcription but also on messenger RNA (mRNA) fate. To understand whether seed germination relies on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of specific subsets of mRNA, we investigated whether the 5′ to 3′ RNA decay machinery participated in the regulation of this process. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seeds of <i>exoribonuclease4</i> (<i>xrn4</i>) and <i>varicose</i> (<i>vcs</i>) mutants displayed distinct dormancy phenotypes. Transcriptome analysis <i>of xrn4-5</i> and <i>vcs-8</i> mutant seeds allowed us to identify genes that are likely to play a role in the control of germination. Study of 5′ untranslated region features of these transcripts revealed that specific motifs, secondary energy, and GC content could play a role in their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation by XRN4 and VCS, and Gene Ontology clustering revealed novel actors of seed dormancy and germination.

Plants exploit induced defense mechanisms based on biochemical modification of the CW components to protect themselves from enzymatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation. The pectin matrix is the main CW target of <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>, and pectin methylesterification status is strongly altered in response to infection. The methylesterification of pectin is controlled mainly by pectin methylesterases (PMEs), whose activity is posttranscriptionally regulated by endogenous protein inhibitors (PMEIs). Here, AtPMEI10, AtPMEI11, and AtPMEI12 are identified as functional PMEIs induced in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) during <i>B. cinerea</i> infection. AtPMEI expression is strictly regulated by jasmonic acid and ethylene signaling, while only AtPMEI11 expression is controlled by PME-related damage-associated molecular patterns, such as oligogalacturonides and methanol. The decrease of pectin methylesterification during infection is higher and the immunity to <i>B. cinerea</i> is compromised in <i>pmei10</i>, <i>pmei11</i>, and <i>pmei12</i> mutants with respect to the control plants. A higher stimulation of the fungal oxalic acid biosynthetic pathway also can contribute to the higher susceptibility of <i>pmei</i> mutants. The lack of <i>PMEI</i> expression does not affect hemicellulose strengthening, callose deposition, and the synthesis of structural defense proteins, proposed as CW-remodeling mechanisms exploited by Arabidopsis to resist CW <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation upon <i>B. cinerea</i> infection. We show that PME activity and pectin methylesterification are dynamically modulated by PMEIs during <i>B. cinerea</i> infection. Our findings point to AtPMEI10, AtPMEI11, and AtPMEI12 as mediators of CW integrity maintenance in plant immunity.</p>

MONENSIN SENSITIVITY1 (MON1)/CALCIUM CAFFEINE ZINC SENSITIVITY1 (CCZ1)-Mediated Rab7 Activation Regulates Tapetal Programmed Cell Death and Pollen Development
<p>Programmed cell death (PCD)-triggered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of plant tapetum is essential for microspore development and pollen coat formation; however, little is known about the cellular mechanism regulating tapetal PCD. Here, we demonstrate that Rab7-mediated vacuolar transport of tapetum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation-related cysteine proteases is crucial for tapetal PCD and pollen development in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), with the following evidence: (1) The <i>monensin sensitivity1</i> (<i>mon1</i>) mutants, which are defective in Rab7 activation, showed impaired male fertility due to a combined defect in both tapetum and male gametophyte development. (2) In anthers, <i>MON1</i> showed preferential high level expression in tapetal cell layers and pollen. (3) The <i>mon1</i> mutants exhibited delayed tapetum degeneration and tapetal PCD, resulting in abnormal pollen coat formation and decreased male fertility. (4) MON1/CALCIUM CAFFEINE ZINC SENSITIVITY1 (CCZ1)-mediated Rab7 activation was indispensable for vacuolar trafficking of tapetum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation-related cysteine proteases, supporting that PCD-triggered tapetum degeneration requires Rab7-mediated vacuolar trafficking of these cysteine proteases. (5) <i>MON1</i> mutations also resulted in defective pollen germination and tube growth. Taken together, tapetal PCD and pollen development require successful MON1/CCZ1-mediated vacuolar transport in Arabidopsis.</p>

An E3 Ligase Affects the NLR Receptor Stability and Immunity to Powdery Mildew
<p>Following the detection of pathogen cognate effectors, plant Nod-like receptors (NLRs) trigger isolate-specific immunity that is generally associated with cell death. The regulation of NLR stability is important to ensure effective immunity. In barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), the allelic Mildew locus A (MLA) receptors mediate isolate-specific disease resistance against powdery mildew fungus (<i>Blumeria graminis</i> f. sp. <i>hordei</i>). Currently, how MLA stability is controlled remains unknown. Here, we identified an MLA-interacting RING-type E3 ligase, MIR1, that interacts with several MLAs. We showed that the carboxyl-terminal TPR domain of MIR1 mediates the interaction with the coiled-coil domain-containing region of functional MLAs, such as MLA1, MLA6, and MLA10, but not with that of the nonfunctional MLA18-1. MIR1 can ubiquitinate the amino-terminal region of MLAs in vitro and promotes the proteasomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of MLAs in vitro and in planta. Both proteasome inhibitor treatment and virus-induced gene silencing-mediated <i>MIR1</i> silencing significantly increased MLA abundance in barley transgenic lines. Furthermore, overexpression of MIR1 specifically compromised MLA-mediated disease resistance in barley, while coexpression of MIR1 and MLA10 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ated MLA10-induced cell death signaling in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>.

Ubiquitination-Related MdBT Scaffold Proteins Target a bHLH Transcription Factor for Iron Homeostasis
<p>Iron (Fe) homeostasis is crucial for plant growth and development. A network of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors positively regulates Fe uptake during iron deficiency. However, their up-regulation or overexpression leads to Fe overload and reactive oxygen species generation, thereby damaging the plants. Here, we found that two BTB/TAZ proteins, MdBT1 and MdBT2, interact with the MbHLH104 protein in apple. In addition, the function of MdBT2 was characterized as a regulator of MdbHLH104 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation via ubiquitination and the 26S proteasome pathway, thereby controlling the activity of plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases and the acquisition of iron. Furthermore, MdBT2 interacted with MdCUL3 proteins, which were required for the MdBT2-mediated ubiquitination modification of MdbHLH104 and its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation. In sum, our findings demonstrate that MdBT proteins interact with MdCUL3 to bridge the formation of the MdBTs<sup>MdCUL3</sup> complex, which negatively modulates the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of the MdbHLH104 protein in response to changes in Fe status to maintain iron homeostasis in plants.</p>

A Rice Ca<sup>2+</sup> Binding Protein Is Required for Tapetum Function and Pollen Formation
<p>In flowering plants, successful male reproduction requires the sophisticated interaction between somatic anther wall layers and reproductive cells. Timely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of the innermost tissue of the anther wall layer, the tapetal layer, is critical for pollen development. Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a well-known stimulus for plant development, but whether it plays a role in affecting male reproduction remains elusive. Here we report a role of Defective in Exine Formation 1 (OsDEX1) in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), a Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding protein, in regulating rice tapetal cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation and pollen formation. In <i>osdex1</i> anthers, tapetal cell degeneration is delayed and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of the callose wall surrounding the microspores is compromised, leading to aborted pollen formation and complete male sterility. <i>OsDEX1</i> is expressed in tapetal cells and microspores during early anther development. Recombinant OsDEX1 is able to bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> and regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in vitro, and <i>osdex1</i> exhibited disturbed Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in tapetal cells. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that OsDEX1 may have a conserved function in binding Ca<sup>2+</sup> in flowering plants, and genetic complementation of pollen wall defects of an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>dex1</i> mutant confirmed its evolutionary conservation in pollen development. Collectively, these findings suggest that OsDEX1 plays a fundamental role in the development of tapetal cells and pollen formation, possibly via modulating the Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis during pollen development.</p>

The NAC Transcription Factor SlNAP2 Regulates Leaf Senescence and Fruit Yield in Tomato
<p>Leaf senescence is an essential physiological process in plants that supports the recycling of nitrogen and other nutrients to support the growth of developing organs, including young leaves, seeds, and fruits. Thus, the regulation of senescence is crucial for evolutionary success in wild populations and for increasing yield in crops. Here, we describe the influence of a NAC transcription factor, SlNAP2 (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i> NAC-like, activated by Apetala3/Pistillata), that controls both leaf senescence and fruit yield in tomato (<i>S. lycopersicum</i>). <i>SlNAP2</i> expression increases during age-dependent and dark-induced leaf senescence. We demonstrate that SlNAP2 activates <i>SlSAG113</i> (<i>S. lycopersicum SENESCENCE-ASSOCIATED GENE113</i>), a homolog of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>SAG113</i>, chlorophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation genes such as <i>SlSGR1</i> (<i>S. lycopersicum</i> senescence-inducible chloroplast stay-green protein 1) and <i>SlPAO</i> (<i>S. lycopersicum</i> pheide <i>a</i> oxygenase), and other downstream targets by directly binding to their promoters, thereby promoting leaf senescence. Furthermore, SlNAP2 directly controls the expression of genes important for abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis, <i>S. lycopersicum</i> 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase 1 (<i>SlNCED1</i>); transport, <i>S. lycopersicum</i> ABC transporter G family member 40 (<i>SlABCG40</i>); and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation, <i>S. lycopersicum</i> ABA 8′-hydroxylase (<i>SlCYP707A2</i>), indicating that SlNAP2 has a complex role in establishing ABA homeostasis during leaf senescence. Inhibiting <i>SlNAP2</i> expression in transgenic tomato plants impedes leaf senescence but enhances fruit yield and sugar content likely due to prolonged leaf photosynthesis in aging tomato plants. Our data indicate that SlNAP2 has a central role in controlling leaf senescence and fruit yield in tomato.</p>

Molecular Mechanisms Preventing Senescence in Response to Prolonged Darkness in a Desiccation-Tolerant Plant
<p>The desiccation-tolerant plant <i>Haberlea rhodopensis</i> can withstand months of darkness without any visible senescence. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of this adaptation to prolonged (30 d) darkness and subsequent return to light. <i>H. rhodopensis</i> plants remained green and viable throughout the dark treatment. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that darkness regulated several transcription factor (TF) genes. Stress- and autophagy-related TFs such as <i>ERF8</i>, <i>HSFA2b</i>, <i>RD26</i>, <i>TGA1</i>, and <i>WRKY33</i> were up-regulated, while chloroplast- and flowering-related TFs such as <i>ATH1</i>, <i>COL2</i>, <i>COL4</i>, <i>RL1</i>, and <i>PTAC7</i> were repressed. <i>PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR4</i>, a negative regulator of photomorphogenesis and promoter of senescence, also was down-regulated. In response to darkness, most of the photosynthesis- and photorespiratory-related genes were strongly down-regulated, while genes related to autophagy were up-regulated. This occurred concomitant with the induction of SUCROSE NON-FERMENTING1-RELATED PROTEIN KINASES (SnRK1) signaling pathway genes, which regulate responses to stress-induced starvation and autophagy. Most of the genes associated with chlorophyll catabolism, which are induced by darkness in dark-senescing species, were either unregulated (<i>PHEOPHORBIDE A OXYGENASE, PAO; RED CHLOROPHYLL CATABOLITE REDUCTASE, RCCR</i>) or repressed (<i>STAY GREEN-LIKE</i>, <i>PHEOPHYTINASE</i>, and <i>NON-YELLOW COLORING1</i>). Metabolite profiling revealed increases in the levels of many amino acids in darkness, suggesting increased protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation. In darkness, levels of the chloroplastic lipids digalactosyldiacylglycerol, monogalactosyldiacylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, and sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol decreased, while those of storage triacylglycerols increased, suggesting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of chloroplast membrane lipids and their conversion to triacylglycerols for use as energy and carbon sources. Collectively, these data show a coordinated response to darkness, including repression of photosynthetic, photorespiratory, flowering, and chlorophyll catabolic genes, induction of autophagy and SnRK1 pathways, and metabolic reconfigurations that enable survival under prolonged darkness.</p>

<i>Medicago</i> Plants Control Nodulation by Regulating Proteolysis of the Receptor-Like Kinase DMI2
<p>Plants use receptor-like kinases to monitor environmental changes and transduce signals into plant cells. The <i>Medicago truncatula</i> (hereafter <i>M</i>. <i>truncatula</i>) DOES NOT MAKE INFECTIONS2 (DMI2) protein functions as a coreceptor of rhizobial signals to initiate nodule development and rhizobial infection during nitrogen-fixing symbiosis, but the mechanisms regulating DMI2 protein level and folding are still unknown. Here, we report that DMI2 protein abundance changes during nitrogen-fixing symbiosis. DMI2 accumulates in the nodules and is induced by rhizobia treatment through a posttranscriptional process. However, DMI2 induction is independent of the perception of Nod factor, a group of lipochitooligosaccharides secreted by rhizobia. The stability of the DMI2 protein is controlled by the proteasome pathway: in rhizobia-free environments, DMI2 is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ed by the proteasome, but during rhizobial infection, DMI2 is protected from the proteasome, resulting in protein accumulation. Furthermore, proteasome inhibitor-promoted accumulation of DMI2 protein in <i>Medicago</i> roots induces the expression of two early nodulation marker genes, supporting the hypothesis that DMI2 accumulation activates downstream symbiosis signaling. The extracellular region of DMI2 contains two malectin-like domains (MLDs) and a leucine-rich repeat. When conserved amino acids in the MLDs are mutated, DMI2 fails to restore nodule development in <i>dmi2</i> mutants, and point-mutated MLD proteins are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ed constitutively, suggesting that the MLD may be vital for the accumulation of DMI2. Our findings suggest that legumes control nodule development through modulating the protein level of DMI2, revealing a layer of regulation in the interaction between plants and rhizobia in nitrogen-fixing symbiosis.</p>

Natural Variation Underlies Differences in ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR17 Activity in Fruit Peel Degreening
<p>Through natural or human selection, many fleshy fruits have evolved vivid external or internal coloration, which often develops during ripening. Such developmental changes in color are associated with the biosynthesis of pigments as well as with degreening through chlorophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation. Here, we demonstrated that natural variation in the coding region of the gene <i>ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR17</i> (<i>ERF17</i>) contributes to apple (<i>Malus domestica</i>) fruit peel degreening. Specifically, <i>ERF17</i> mutant alleles with different serine (Ser) repeat insertions in the coding region exhibited enhanced transcriptional regulation activity in a dual-luciferase reporter assay when more Ser repeats were present. Notably, surface plasmon resonance analysis showed that the number of Ser repeats affected the binding activity of ERF17 to the promoter sequences of chlorophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation-related genes. In addition, overexpression of <i>ERF17</i> in evergreen apples altered the accumulation of chlorophyll. Furthermore, we demonstrated that <i>ERF17</i> has been under selection since the origin of apple tree cultivation. Taken together, these results reveal allelic variation underlying an important fruit quality trait and a molecular genetic mechanism associated with apple domestication.</p>

The Cytokinin Oxidase/Dehydrogenase CKX1 Is a Membrane-Bound Protein Requiring Homooligomerization in the Endoplasmic Reticulum for Its Cellular Activity
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of the plant hormone cytokinin is controlled by cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase (CKX) enzymes. The molecular and cellular behavior of these proteins is still largely unknown. In this study, we show that CKX1 is a type II single-pass membrane protein that localizes predominantly to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). This indicates that this CKX isoform is a bona fide ER protein directly controlling the cytokinin, which triggers the signaling from the ER. By using various approaches, we demonstrate that CKX1 forms homodimers and homooligomers in vivo. The amino-terminal part of CKX1 was necessary and sufficient for the protein oligomerization as well as for targeting and retention in the ER. Moreover, we show that protein-protein interaction is largely facilitated by transmembrane helices and depends on a functional GxxxG-like interaction motif. Importantly, mutations rendering CKX1 monomeric interfere with its steady-state localization in the ER and cause a loss of the CKX1 biological activity by increasing its ER-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation. Therefore, our study provides evidence that oligomerization is a crucial parameter regulating CKX1 biological activity and the cytokinin concentration in the ER. The work also lends strong support for the cytokinin signaling from the ER and for the functional relevance of the cytokinin pool in this compartment.</p>

The Transcription Factor COL12 Is a Substrate of the COP1/SPA E3 Ligase and Regulates Flowering Time and Plant Architecture<sup>1</sup>
<p>The ambient light environment controls many aspects of plant development throughout a plant’s life cycle. Such complex control is achieved because a key repressor of light signaling, the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) COP1/SPA E3 ubiquitin ligase causes the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of multiple regulators of endogenous developmental pathways. This includes the CONSTANS (CO) transcription factor that is responsible for photoperiodic control of flowering time. There are 16 CO-like proteins whose functions are only partly understood. Here, we show that 14 CO-like (COL) proteins bind CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 (COP1) and SUPPRESSOR OF PHYTOCHROME A-105 (SPA)1 in vitro. We subsequently focused on COL12 and show that COL12 binds COP1 and SPA proteins in vivo. The COL12 protein is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ed in darkness in a COP1-dependent fashion, indicating that COL12 is a substrate of the COP1/SPA ubiquitin ligase. Overexpression of COL12 causes late flowering specifically in long day conditions by decreasing the expression of <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T</i>. This phenotype is genetically dependent on <i>CO.</i> Consistent with this finding, COL12 physically interacts with CO in vivo, suggesting that COL12 represses flowering by inhibiting CO protein function. We show that COL12 overexpression did not alter CO protein stability. It is therefore likely that COL12 represses the activity of CO rather than CO levels. Overexpression of COL12 also affects plant architecture by increasing the number of rosette branches and reducing inflorescence height. These phenotypes are <i>CO</i> independent. Hence, we suggest that COL12 affects plant development through CO-dependent and CO-independent mechanisms.</p>

Light Signaling-Dependent Regulation of Photoinhibition and Photoprotection in Tomato<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Photoreceptor-mediated light signaling plays a critical role in plant growth, development, and stress responses but its contribution to the spatial regulation of photoinhibition and photoprotection within the canopy remains unclear. Here, we show that low-red/far-red (<i>L</i>-<i>R</i>/<i>FR</i>) ratio light conditions significantly alleviate PSII and PSI photoinhibition in the shade leaves of tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) plants. This protection is accompanied by a phytochrome A-dependent induction of LONG HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5). HY5 binds to the promoter of <i>ABA INSENSITIVE</i>5 (<i>ABI5</i>), triggering <i>RESPIRATORY BURST OXIDASE HOMOLOG1</i> (<i>RBOH1</i>)-dependent H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production in the apoplast. Decreased levels of <i>HY5</i>, <i>ABI5</i>, and <i>RBOH1</i> transcripts increased cold-induced photoinhibition and abolished <i>L</i>-<i>R</i>/<i>FR</i>-induced alleviation of photoinhibition. <i>L</i>-<i>R</i>/<i>FR</i> illumination induced nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) of chlorophyll <i>a</i> fluorescence and increased the activities of Foyer-Halliwell-Asada cycle enzymes and cyclic electron flux (CEF) around PSI. In contrast, decreased <i>HY5</i>, <i>ABI5</i>, and <i>RBOH1</i> transcript levels abolished the positive effect of <i>L</i>-<i>R</i>/<i>FR</i> on photoprotection. Loss of <i>PROTON GRADIENT REGULATION5</i>-dependent CEF led to increased photoinhibition and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ated <i>L</i>-<i>R</i>/<i>FR</i>-dependent NPQ. These data demonstrate that HY5 is an important hub in the cross talk between light and cold response pathways, integrating ABA and reactive oxygen species signaling, leading to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ation of photoinhibition by enhanced induction of photoprotection in shade leaves.</p>

Extracellular ATP Acts on Jasmonate Signaling to Reinforce Plant Defense
<p>Damaged cells send various signals to stimulate defense responses. Recent identification and genetic studies of the plant purinoceptor, P2K1 (also known as DORN1), have demonstrated that extracellular ATP is a signal involved in plant stress responses, including wounding, perhaps to evoke plant defense. However, it remains largely unknown how extracellular ATP induces plant defense responses. Here, we demonstrate that extracellular ATP induces plant defense mediated through activation of the intracellular signaling of jasmonate (JA), a well-characterized defense hormone. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves, ATP pretreatment induced resistance against the necrotrophic fungus, <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>. The induced resistance was enhanced in the P2K1 receptor overexpression line, but reduced in the receptor mutant, <i>dorn1</i>-<i>3</i>. Mining the transcriptome data revealed that ATP induces a set of JA-induced genes. In addition, the P2K1-associated coexpression network contains defense-related genes, including those encoding jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins, which play key roles as repressors of JA signaling. We examined whether extracellular ATP impacts the stability of JAZ1 in Arabidopsis. The results showed that the JAZ1 stability decreased in response to ATP addition in a proteasome-dependent manner. This reduction required intracellular signaling via second messengers—cytosolic calcium, reactive oxygen species, and nitric oxide. Interestingly, the ATP-induced JAZ1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ated in the JA receptor mutant, <i>coi1</i>, but not in the JA biosynthesis mutant, <i>aos</i>, or upon addition of JA biosynthesis inhibitors. Immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that ATP increases the interaction between COI1 and JAZ1, suggesting direct cross talk between extracellular ATP and JA in intracellular signaling events. Taken together, these results suggest that extracellular ATP signaling directly impacts the JA signaling pathway to maximize plant defense responses.</p>

Gradients in Wall Mechanics and Polysaccharides along Growing Inflorescence Stems
<p>At early stages of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) flowering, the inflorescence stem undergoes rapid growth, with elongation occurring predominantly in the apical ∼4 cm of the stem. We measured the spatial gradients for elongation rate, osmotic pressure, cell wall thickness, and wall mechanical compliances and coupled these macroscopic measurements with molecular-level characterization of the polysaccharide composition, mobility, hydration, and intermolecular interactions of the inflorescence cell wall using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and small-angle neutron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scatter</span></strong>ing. Force-extension curves revealed a gradient, from high to low, in the plastic and elastic compliances of cell walls along the elongation zone, but plots of growth rate versus wall compliances were strikingly nonlinear. Neutron-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scatter</span></strong>ing curves showed only subtle changes in wall structure, including a slight increase in cellulose microfibril alignment along the growing stem. In contrast, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectra showed substantial decreases in pectin amount, esterification, branching, hydration, and mobility in an apical-to-basal pattern, while the cellulose content increased modestly. These results suggest that pectin structural changes are connected with increases in pectin-cellulose interaction and reductions in wall compliances along the apical-to-basal gradient in growth rate. These pectin structural changes may lessen the ability of the cell wall to undergo stress relaxation and irreversible expansion (e.g. induced by expansins), thus contributing to the growth kinematics of the growing stem.</p>

A Violaxanthin Deepoxidase Interacts with a Viral Suppressor of RNA Silencing to Inhibit Virus Amplification
<p>RNA silencing plays a critical role against viral infection. To counteract this antiviral silencing, viruses have evolved various RNA silencing suppressors. Meanwhile, plants have evolved counter-counter defense strategies against RNA silencing suppression (RSS). In this study, the violaxanthin deepoxidase protein of maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), ZmVDE, was shown to interact specifically with the helper component-proteinase (HC-Pro; a viral RNA silencing suppressor) of <i>Sugarcane mosaic virus</i> (SCMV) via its mature protein region by yeast two-hybrid assay, which was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> cells. It was demonstrated that amino acids 101 to 460 in HC-Pro and the amino acid glutamine-292 in ZmVDE mature protein were essential for this interaction. The mRNA levels of <i>ZmVDE</i> were down-regulated 75% to 65% at an early stage of SCMV infection. Interestingly, ZmVDE, which normally localized in the chloroplasts and cytoplasm, could relocalize to HC-Pro-containing aggregate bodies in the presence of HC-Pro alone or SCMV infection. In addition, ZmVDE could <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ate the RSS activity of HC-Pro in a specific protein interaction-dependent manner. Subsequently, transient silencing of the <i>ZmVDE</i> gene facilitated SCMV RNA and coat protein accumulation. Taken together, our results suggest that ZmVDE interacts with SCMV HC-Pro and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ates its RSS activity, contributing to decreased SCMV accumulation. This study demonstrates that a host factor can be involved in secondary defense responses against viral infection in monocot plants.</p>

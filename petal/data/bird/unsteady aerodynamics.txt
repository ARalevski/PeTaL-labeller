Particulate Matter Exposure and Stress Hormone Levels
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Exposure to ambient particulate matter (PM) is associated with a number of adverse health outcomes, but potential mechanisms are largely unknown. Metabolomics represents a powerful approach to study global metabolic changes in response to environmental exposures. We therefore conducted this study to investigate changes in serum metabolites in response to the reduction of PM exposure among healthy college students.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a randomized, double-blind crossover trial in 55 healthy college students in Shanghai, China. Real and sham air purifiers were placed in participants’ dormitories in random order for 9 days with a 12-day washout period. Serum metabolites were quantified by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Between-treatment differences in metabolites were examined using orthogonal partial least square-discriminant analysis and mixed-effect models. Secondary outcomes include blood pressure, corticotropin-releasing hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, insulin resistance, and biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The average personal exposure to PMs with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aerodynam</span></strong>ic diameters ≤2.5 μm was 24.3 μg/m<sup>3</sup> during the real purification and 53.1 μg/m<sup>3</sup> during the sham purification. Metabolomics analysis showed that higher exposure to PMs with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aerodynam</span></strong>ic diameters ≤2.5 μm led to significant increases in cortisol, cortisone, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. Between-treatment differences were also observed for glucose, amino acids, fatty acids, and lipids. We found significantly higher blood pressure, hormones, insulin resistance, and biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation among individuals exposed to higher PMs with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aerodynam</span></strong>ic diameters ≤2.5 μm.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This study suggests that higher PM may induce metabolic alterations that are consistent with activations of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal and sympathetic-adrenal-medullary axes, adding potential mechanistic insights into the adverse health outcomes associated with PM. Furthermore, our study demonstrated short-term reductions in stress hormone following indoor air purification.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Aerodynamic characteristics along the wing span of a dragonfly <i>Pantala flavescens</i>
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> Interwing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aerodynam</span></strong>ic interactions vary across the span of the high aspect ratio wings of dragonflies. This spanwise variation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aerodynam</span></strong>ics could be exploited in the design of micro-air vehicles.</p>

A tailless aerial robotic flapper reveals that flies use torque coupling in rapid banked turns
<p>Insects are among the most agile natural flyers. Hypotheses on their flight control cannot always be validated by experiments with animals or tethered robots. To this end, we developed a programmable and agile autonomous free-flying robot controlled through bio-inspired motion changes of its flapping wings. Despite being 55 times the size of a fruit fly, the robot can accurately mimic the rapid escape maneuvers of flies, including a correcting yaw rotation toward the escape heading. Because the robot’s yaw control was turned off, we showed that these yaw rotations result from passive, translation-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aerodynam</span></strong>ic coupling between the yaw torque and the roll and pitch torques produced throughout the maneuver. The robot enables new methods for studying animal flight, and its flight characteristics allow for real-world flight missions.</p>

Potential Cardiovascular and Total Mortality Benefits of Air Pollution Control in Urban China
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Outdoor air pollution ranks fourth among preventable causes of China’s burden of disease. We hypothesized that the magnitude of health gains from air quality improvement in urban China could compare with achieving recommended blood pressure or smoking control goals.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The Cardiovascular Disease Policy Model–China projected coronary heart disease, stroke, and all-cause deaths in urban Chinese adults 35 to 84 years of age from 2017 to 2030 if recent air quality (particulate matter with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aerodynam</span></strong>ic diameter ≤2.5 µm, PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and traditional cardiovascular risk factor trends continue. We projected life-years gained if urban China were to reach 1 of 3 air quality goals: Beijing Olympic Games level (mean PM<sub>2.5</sub>, 55 μg/m<sup>3</sup>), China Class II standard (35 μg/m<sup>3</sup>), or World Health Organization standard (10 μg/m<sup>3</sup>). We compared projected air pollution reduction control benefits with potential benefits of reaching World Health Organization hypertension and tobacco control goals.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Mean PM<sub>2.5</sub> reduction to Beijing Olympic levels by 2030 would gain ≈241,000 (95% uncertainty interval, 189 000–293 000) life-years annually. Achieving either the China Class II or World Health Organization PM<sub>2.5</sub> standard would yield greater health benefits (992 000 [95% uncertainty interval, 790 000–1 180 000] or 1 827 000 [95% uncertainty interval, 1 481 00–2 129 000] annual life-years gained, respectively) than World Health Organization–recommended goals of 25% improvement in systolic hypertension control and 30% reduction in smoking combined (928 000 [95% uncertainty interval, 830 000–1 033 000] life-years).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Air quality improvement in different scenarios could lead to graded health benefits ranging from 241 000 life-years gained to much greater benefits equal to or greater than the combined benefits of 25% improvement in systolic hypertension control and 30% smoking reduction.</p></sec>

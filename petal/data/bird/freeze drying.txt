SENSITIVE TO FREEZING2 Aides in Resilience to Salt and Drought in Freezing-Sensitive Tomato
<p>SENSITIVE TO <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">freez</span></strong>ING2 (SFR2) is crucial for protecting chloroplast membranes following <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">freez</span></strong>ing in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). It has been shown that SFR2 homologs are present in all land plants, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">freez</span></strong>ing-sensitive species, raising the question of SFR2 function beyond <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">freez</span></strong>ing tolerance. Similar to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">freez</span></strong>ing, salt and drought can cause <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dehydr</span></strong>ation. Thus, it is hypothesized that in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">freez</span></strong>ing-sensitive plants SFR2 may play roles in their resilience to salt or drought. To test this hypothesis, <i>SlSFR2</i> RNAi lines were generated in the cold/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">freez</span></strong>ing-sensitive species tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i> [M82 <i>cv</i>]). Hypersensitivity to salt and drought of <i>SlSFR2</i>-RNAi lines was observed. Higher tolerance of wild-type tomatoes was correlated with the production of trigalactosyldiacylglycerol, a product of SFR2 activity. Tomato SFR2 in vitro activity is Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and its optimal pH is 7.5, similar to that of Arabidopsis SFR2, but the specific activity of tomato SFR2 in vitro is almost double that of Arabidopsis SFR2. When salt and drought stress were applied to Arabidopsis, no conditions could be identified at which SFR2 was induced prior to irreversibly impacting plant growth, suggesting that SFR2 protects Arabidopsis primarily against <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">freez</span></strong>ing. Discovery of tomato SFR2 function in drought and salt resilience provides further insights into general membrane lipid remodeling-based stress tolerance mechanisms and together with protection against <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">freez</span></strong>ing in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">freez</span></strong>ing-resistant plants such as Arabidopsis, it adds lipid remodeling as a possible target for the engineering of abiotic stress-resilient crops.</p>

Monitoring of Freezing Dynamics in Trees: A Simple Phase Shift Causes Complexity
<p>During winter, trees have to cope with harsh conditions, including extreme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">freez</span></strong>e-thaw stress. This study focused on ice nucleation and propagation, related water shifts and xylem cavitation, as well as cell damage and was based on in situ monitoring of xylem (thermocouples) and surface temperatures (infrared imaging), ultrasonic emissions, and dendrometer analysis. Field experiments during late winter on <i>Picea abies</i> growing at the alpine timberline revealed three distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">freez</span></strong>ing patterns: (1) from the top of the tree toward the base, (2) from thin branches toward the main stem’s top and base, and (3) from the base toward the top. Infrared imaging showed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">freez</span></strong>ing within branches from their base toward distal parts. Such complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">freez</span></strong>ing causes dynamic and heterogenous patterns in water potential and probably in cavitation. This study highlights the interaction between environmental conditions upon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">freez</span></strong>ing and thawing and demonstrates the enormous complexity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">freez</span></strong>ing processes in trees. Diameter shrinkage, which indicated water fluxes within the stem, and acoustic emission analysis, which indicated cavitation events near the ice front upon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">freez</span></strong>ing, were both related to minimum temperature and, upon thawing, related to vapor pressure deficit and soil temperature. These complex patterns, emphasizing the common mechanisms between frost and drought stress, shed new light on winter tree physiology.</p>

The Causes of Leaf Hydraulic Vulnerability and Its Influence on Gas Exchange in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>The influence of the dynamics of leaf hydraulic conductance (<i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub>) diurnally and during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dehydr</span></strong>ation on stomatal conductance and photosynthesis remains unclear. Using the model species Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> ecotype Columbia-0), we applied a multitiered approach including physiological measurements, high-resolution x-ray microcomputed tomography, and modeling at a range of scales to characterize (1) <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> decline during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dehydr</span></strong>ation; (2) its basis in the hydraulic conductances of leaf xylem and outside-xylem pathways (<i>K</i><sub>ox</sub>); (3) the dependence of its dynamics on irradiance; (4) its impact on diurnal patterns of stomatal conductance and photosynthetic rate; and (5) its influence on gas exchange and survival under simulated drought regimes. Arabidopsis leaves showed strong vulnerability to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dehydr</span></strong>ation diurnally in both gas exchange and hydraulic conductance, despite lack of xylem embolism or conduit collapse above the turgor loss point, indicating a pronounced sensitivity of <i>K</i><sub>ox</sub> to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dehydr</span></strong>ation. <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> increased under higher irradiance in well-hydrated leaves across the full range of water potential, but no shift in <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> vulnerability was observed. Modeling indicated that responses to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dehydr</span></strong>ation and irradiance are likely attributable to changes in membrane permeability and that a dynamic <i>K</i><sub>ox</sub> would contribute strongly to stomatal closure, improving performance, survival, and efficient water use during drought. These findings for Columbia-0 provide a baseline for assessing variation across genotypes in hydraulic traits and their influence on gas exchange during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dehydr</span></strong>ation.</p>

Sugar Potentiation of Fatty Acid and Triacylglycerol Accumulation
<p>Photosynthetically derived sugar provides carbon skeletons for lipid biosynthesis. We used mutants of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and the expression of oleogenic factors to investigate relationships among sugar availability, lipid synthesis, and the accumulation of triacylglycerol (TAG) in leaf tissue. The <i>adg1</i> mutation disables the small subunit of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, the first step in starch synthesis, and the <i>suc2</i> mutation disables a sucrose/proton symporter that facilitates sucrose loading from leaves into phloem. The <i>adg1suc2</i> double mutant increases glucose plus sucrose content in leaves 80-fold relative to the wild type, total fatty acid (FA) content 1.8-fold to 8.3% dry weight, and TAG more than 10-fold to 1.2% dry weight. The WRINKLED1 transcription factor also accumulates to higher levels in these leaves, and the rate of FA synthesis increases by 58%. Adding <i>tt4</i>, which disables chalcone synthase, had little effect, but adding the <i>tgd1</i> mutation, which disables an importer of lipids into plastids to create <i>adg1suc2tt4tgd1</i>, increased total leaf FA to 13.5% dry weight and TAG to 3.8% dry weight, demonstrating a synergistic effect upon combining these mutations. Combining <i>adg1suc2</i> with the <i>sdp1</i> mutation, deficient in the predominant TAG lipase, had little effect on total FA content but increased the TAG accumulation by 66% to 2% dry weight. Expression of the <i>WRINKLED1</i> transcription factor, along with <i>DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1</i> and the <i>OLEOSIN1</i> oil body-associated protein, in the <i>adg1suc2</i> mutant doubled leaf FA content and increased TAG content to 2.3% dry weight, a level 4.6-fold higher than that resulting from expression of the same factors in the wild type.</p>

DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE and DIACYLGLYCEROL KINASE Modulate Triacylglycerol and Phosphatidic Acid Production in the Plant Response to Freezing Stress
<p>Plants accumulate the lipids phosphatidic acid (PA), diacylglycerol (DAG), and triacylglycerol (TAG) during cold stress, but how plants balance the levels of these lipids to mediate cold responses remains unknown. The enzymes ACYL-COENZYME A:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE (DGAT) and DIACYLGLYCEROL KINASE (DGK) catalyze the conversion of DAG to TAG and PA, respectively. Here, we show that DGAT1, DGK2, DGK3, and DGK5 contribute to the response to cold in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). With or without cold acclimation, the <i>dgat1</i> mutants exhibited higher sensitivity upon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">freez</span></strong>ing exposure compared with the wild type. Under cold conditions, the <i>dgat1</i> mutants showed reduced expression of <i>C-REPEAT/DRE BINDING FACTOR2</i> and its regulons, which are essential for the acquisition of cold tolerance. Lipid profiling revealed that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">freez</span></strong>ing significantly increased the levels of PA and DAG while decreasing TAG in the rosettes of <i>dgat1</i> mutant plants. During <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">freez</span></strong>ing stress, the accumulation of PA in <i>dgat1</i> plants stimulated NADPH oxidase activity and enhanced RbohD-dependent hydrogen peroxide production compared with the wild type. Moreover, the cold-inducible transcripts of <i>DGK2</i>, <i>DGK3</i>, and <i>DGK5</i> were significantly more up-regulated in the <i>dgat1</i> mutants than in the wild type during cold stress. Consistent with this observation, <i>dgk2</i>, <i>dgk3</i>, and <i>dgk5</i> knockout mutants showed improved tolerance and attenuated PA production in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">freez</span></strong>ing temperatures. Our findings demonstrate that the conversion of DAG to TAG by <i>DGAT1</i> is critical for plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">freez</span></strong>ing tolerance, acting by balancing TAG and PA production in Arabidopsis.</p>

Outside-Xylem Vulnerability, Not Xylem Embolism, Controls Leaf Hydraulic Decline during Dehydration<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[CC-BY]</sup></xref>
<p>Leaf hydraulic supply is crucial to maintaining open stomata for CO<sub>2</sub> capture and plant growth. During drought-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dehydr</span></strong>ation, the leaf hydraulic conductance (<i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub>) declines, which contributes to stomatal closure and, eventually, to leaf death. Previous studies have tended to attribute the decline of <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> to embolism in the leaf vein xylem. We visualized at high resolution and quantified experimentally the hydraulic vulnerability of xylem and outside-xylem pathways and modeled their respective influences on plant water transport. Evidence from all approaches indicated that the decline of <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dehydr</span></strong>ation arose first and foremost due to the vulnerability of outside-xylem tissues. In vivo x-ray microcomputed tomography of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dehydr</span></strong>ating leaves of four diverse angiosperm species showed that, at the turgor loss point, only small fractions of leaf vein xylem conduits were embolized, and substantial xylem embolism arose only under severe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dehydr</span></strong>ation. Experiments on an expanded set of eight angiosperm species showed that outside-xylem hydraulic vulnerability explained 75% to 100% of <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> decline across the range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dehydr</span></strong>ation from mild water stress to beyond turgor loss point. Spatially explicit modeling of leaf water transport pointed to a role for reduced membrane conductivity consistent with published data for cells and tissues. Plant-scale modeling suggested that outside-xylem hydraulic vulnerability can protect the xylem from tensions that would induce embolism and disruption of water transport under mild to moderate soil and atmospheric droughts. These findings pinpoint outside-xylem tissues as a central locus for the control of leaf and plant water transport during progressive drought.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Disclosing the Molecular Basis of the Postharvest Life of Berry in Different Grapevine Genotypes
<p>The molecular events that characterize postripening grapevine berries have rarely been investigated and are poorly defined. In particular, a detailed definition of changes occurring during the postharvest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dehydr</span></strong>ation, a process undertaken to make some particularly special wine styles, would be of great interest for both winemakers and plant biologists. We report an exhaustive survey of transcriptomic and metabolomic responses in berries representing six grapevine genotypes subjected to postharvest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dehydr</span></strong>ation under identical controlled conditions. The modulation of phenylpropanoid metabolism clearly distinguished the behavior of genotypes, with stilbene accumulation as the major metabolic event, although the transient accumulation/depletion of anthocyanins and flavonols was the prevalent variation in genotypes that do not accumulate stilbenes. The modulation of genes related to phenylpropanoid/stilbene metabolism highlighted the distinct metabolomic plasticity of genotypes, allowing for the identification of candidate structural and regulatory genes. In addition to genotype-specific responses, a core set of genes was consistently modulated in all genotypes, representing the common features of berries undergoing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dehydr</span></strong>ation and/or commencing senescence. This included genes controlling ethylene and auxin metabolism as well as genes involved in oxidative and osmotic stress, defense responses, anaerobic respiration, and cell wall and carbohydrate metabolism. Several transcription factors were identified that may control these shared processes in the postharvest berry. Changes representing both common and genotype-specific responses to postharvest conditions shed light on the cellular processes taking place in harvested berries stored under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dehydr</span></strong>ating conditions for several months.</p>

Tree Physiology
Temperate tree species show identical response in tree water deficit but different sensitivities in sap flow to summer soil drying
<p>Temperate forests are expected to be particularly vulnerable to drought and soil drying because they are not adapted to such conditions and perform best in mesic environments. Here we ask (i) how sensitively four common temperate tree species (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i>, <i>Picea abies</i>, <i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i> and <i>Fraxinus excelsior</i>) respond in their water relations to summer soil drying and seek to determine (ii) if species-specific responses to summer soil drying are related to the onset of declining water status across the four species. Throughout 2012 and 2013 we determined tree water deficit (TWD) as a proxy for tree water status from recorded stem radius changes and monitored sap flow rates with sensors on 16 mature trees studied in the field at Lageren, Switzerland. All tree species responded equally in their relative maximum TWD to the onset of declining soil moisture. This implies that the water supply of all tree species was affected by declining soil moisture and that none of the four species was able to fully maintain its water status, e.g., by access to alternative water sources in the soil. In contrast we found strong and highly species-specific responses of sap flow to declining soil moisture with the strongest decline in <i>P. abies</i> (92%), followed by <i>F. sylvatica</i> (53%) and <i>A. pseudoplatanus</i> (48%). <i>F. excelsior</i> did not significantly reduce sap flow. We hypothesize the species-specific responses in sap flow to declining soil moisture that occur despite a simultaneous increase in relative TWD in all species reflect how fast these species approach critical levels of their water status, which is most likely influenced by species-specific traits determining the hydraulic properties of the species tree.</p>

Super-dry reforming of methane intensifies CO<sub>2</sub> utilization via Le Chatelier’s principle
<p>Efficient CO<sub>2</sub> transformation from a waste product to a carbon source for chemicals and fuels will require reaction conditions that effect its reduction. We developed a “super-dry” CH<sub>4</sub> reforming reaction for enhanced CO production from CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>. We used Ni/MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> as a CH<sub>4</sub>-reforming catalyst, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> as a solid oxygen carrier, and CaO/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> as a CO<sub>2</sub> sorbent. The isothermal coupling of these three different processes resulted in higher CO production as compared with that of conventional dry reforming, by avoiding back reactions with water. The reduction of iron oxide was intensified through CH<sub>4</sub> conversion to syngas over Ni and CO<sub>2</sub> extraction and storage as CaCO<sub>3</sub>. CO<sub>2</sub> is then used for iron reoxidation and CO production, exploiting equilibrium shifts effected with inert gas sweeping (Le Chatelier’s principle). Super-dry reforming uses up to three CO<sub>2</sub> molecules per CH<sub>4</sub> and offers a high CO space-time yield of 7.5 millimole CO per second per kilogram of iron at 1023 kelvin.</p>

Plant diversity patterns in neotropical dry forests and their conservation implications
<p>Seasonally dry tropical forests are distributed across Latin America and the Caribbean and are highly threatened, with less than 10% of their original extent remaining in many countries. Using 835 inventories covering 4660 species of woody plants, we show marked floristic turnover among inventories and regions, which may be higher than in other neotropical biomes, such as savanna. Such high floristic turnover indicates that numerous conservation areas across many countries will be needed to protect the full diversity of tropical dry forests. Our results provide a scientific framework within which national decision-makers can contextualize the floristic significance of their dry forest at a regional and continental scale.</p>

Stomatal Closure, Basal Leaf Embolism, and Shedding Protect the Hydraulic Integrity of Grape Stems
<p>The time scale of stomatal closure and xylem cavitation during plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dehydr</span></strong>ation, as well as the fate of embolized organs, are under debate, largely due to methodological limitations in the evaluation of embolism. While some argue that complete stomatal closure precedes the occurrence of embolism, others believe that the two are contemporaneous processes that are accompanied by daily xylem refilling. Here, we utilize an optical light transmission method to continuously monitor xylem cavitation in leaves of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dehydr</span></strong>ating grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) in concert with stomatal conductance and stem and petiole hydraulic measurements. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to continuously monitor xylem cavitation and flow rates in the stem of an intact vine during 10 d of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dehydr</span></strong>ation. The results showed that complete stomatal closure preceded the appearance of embolism in the leaves and the stem by several days. Basal leaves were more vulnerable to xylem embolism than apical leaves and, once embolized, were shed, thereby preventing further water loss and protecting the hydraulic integrity of younger leaves and the stem. As a result, embolism in the stem was minimal even when drought led to complete leaf shedding. These findings suggest that grapevine avoids xylem embolism rather than tolerates it.</p>

Integrated Noninvasive Physiological Assessment of Coronary Circulatory Function and Impact on Cardiovascular Mortality in Patients With Stable Coronary Artery Disease

Because management decisions are predicated on clinical risk, we sought to determine the independent and integrated value of maximal MBF and CFR for predicting cardiovascular death.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>MBF and CFR were quantified in 4029 consecutive patients (median age 66 years, 50.5% women) referred for rest/stress myocardial perfusion positron emission tomography scans from January 2006 to December 2013. The primary outcome was cardiovascular mortality. Maximal MBF <1.8 mL·g<sup>−1</sup>·min<sup>−1</sup> and CFR<2 were considered impaired.

Limited acclimation in leaf anatomy to experimental drought in tropical rainforest trees
<p>Dry periods are predicted to become more frequent and severe in the future in some parts of the tropics, including Amazonia, potentially causing reduced productivity, higher tree mortality and increased emissions of stored carbon. Using a long-term (12 year) through-fall exclusion (TFE) experiment in the tropics, we test the hypothesis that trees produce leaves adapted to cope with higher levels of water stress, by examining the following leaf characteristics: area, thickness, leaf mass per area, vein density, stomatal density, the thickness of palisade mesophyll, spongy mesophyll and both of the epidermal layers, internal cavity volume and the average cell sizes of the palisade and spongy mesophyll. We also test whether differences in leaf anatomy are consistent with observed differential drought-induced mortality responses among taxa, and look for relationships between leaf anatomy, and leaf water relations and gas exchange parameters. Our data show that trees do not produce leaves that are more xeromorphic in response to 12 years of soil moisture deficit. However, the drought treatment did result in increases in the thickness of the adaxial epidermis (TFE: 20.5 ± 1.5 µm, control: 16.7 ± 1.0 µm) and the internal cavity volume (TFE: 2.43 ± 0.50 mm<sup>3</sup> cm<sup>−2</sup>, control: 1.77 ± 0.30 mm<sup>3 </sup>cm<sup>−2</sup>). No consistent differences were detected between drought-resistant and drought-sensitive taxa, although interactions occurred between drought-sensitivity status and drought treatment for the palisade mesophyll thickness (<i>P</i> = 0.034) and the cavity volume of the leaves (<i>P</i> = 0.025). The limited response to water deficit probably reflects a tight co-ordination between leaf morphology, water relations and photosynthetic properties. This suggests that there is little plasticity in these aspects of plant anatomy in these taxa, and that phenotypic plasticity in leaf traits may not facilitate the acclimation of Amazonian trees to the predicted future reductions in dry season water availability.</p>

Carbon dynamics of <i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i> seedlings under drought and complete darkness
<p>Carbon (C) storage is considered a key component to plant survival under drought and shade, although the combined effects of these factors on survival remain poorly understood. We investigated how drought and shade alter the C dynamics and survival of tree seedlings, and whether drought limits the access to or usage of stored C. We experimentally applied two levels of soil humidity (well-watered versus drought, the latter induced by dry-down) and light availability (light versus complete darkness) on 1-year-old seedlings of <i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i> L. for 3 months. We quantified the survival, biomass, growth rate and non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) of seedlings at their time of death or at the end of the experiment for those that survived. We found that the soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dri</span></strong>ed out faster when drought was combined with light than when it was combined with complete darkness. Seedlings subjected to both drought and light showed reduced growth and reached 100% mortality earlier than any other treatment, with the highest NSC concentrations at the time of death. Seedlings exposed to both drought and complete darkness died significantly earlier than seedlings exposed to complete darkness only, but had similar NSC concentrations at time of their death, suggesting that drought accelerated the use of stored C under complete darkness. Complete darkness significantly reduced seedling growth and whole-plant NSC concentrations regardless of soil humidity, while root NSC concentrations were significantly more reduced when complete darkness was combined with drought conditions. Thus, the C dynamics in <i>A. pseudoplatanus</i> seedlings under complete darkness was not hindered by drought, i.e., the access and use of stored C was not limited by drought. The contrasting growth and C storage responses <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dri</span></strong>ven by drought under light versus complete darkness are consistent with a key role of the drought progression in the C dynamics of trees.</p>

Highly variable chemical signatures over short spatial distances among Scots pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i>) populations
<p>Understanding within-species variability in terpenoid content and composition is highly relevant for predicting species adaptive potential to biotic stresses, but there is still limited information on terpene variations even for widespread species. We studied the foliage content and composition of terpenoids, foliage structure, and carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) contents in <i>Pinus sylvestris</i> L. in four Estonian sites ranging from dry forest to raised bog. In the bogs, samples were taken along the environmental gradient from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dri</span></strong>er margins towards wetter central parts. A chiral column was used to gain insight into the variation in terpene composition. We hypothesized that terpene contents increase and the composition becomes more diverse in more strongly N-limited sites (greater C/N ratio) and that terpene signatures cluster together in sub-sites with similar conditions (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dri</span></strong>er/wetter). Altogether 37 terpenes were quantified across the sites. Extremely large variability of terpene contents, 48–62% for monoterpenes and 61–89% for sesquiterpenes, was observed. According to the amounts of α-pinenes and (+)-3-carene, we distinguished two different ‘pine chemotypes’. Contrary to the hypothesis, terpene contents and variability were the greatest in the dry site with the lowest C/N ratio. However, individual terpenoids correlated differently with C or N in different sites, indicating site effects on terpene composition. Moreover, correlations between the terpenoids and C or N depended on the pine chemotype. The sub-sites with different water regime were more strongly clustered together within the site than across the sites. The study demonstrates extensive variations in terpene contents and composition among the populations and over short spatial distances within the populations, suggesting a large among- and within-population adaptive capacity of <i>P. sylvestris</i>.</p>

Organic matter preserved in 3-billion-year-old mudstones at Gale crater, Mars
<p>Establishing the presence and state of organic matter, including its possible biosignatures, in martian materials has been an elusive quest, despite limited reports of the existence of organic matter on Mars. We report the in situ detection of organic matter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">preserv</span></strong>ed in lacustrine mudstones at the base of the ~3.5-billion-year-old Murray formation at Pahrump Hills, Gale crater, by the Sample Analysis at Mars instrument suite onboard the Curiosity rover. Diverse pyrolysis products, including thiophenic, aromatic, and aliphatic compounds released at high temperatures (500° to 820°C), were directly detected by evolved gas analysis. Thiophenes were also observed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. Their presence suggests that sulfurization aided organic matter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">preserv</span></strong>ation. At least 50 nanomoles of organic carbon persists, probably as macromolecules containing 5% carbon as organic sulfur molecules.</p>

Piezo2 channel–Merkel cell signaling modulates the conversion of touch to itch
<p>The somatosensory system relays many signals ranging from light touch to pain and itch. Touch is critical to spatial awareness and communication. However, in disease states, innocuous mechanical stimuli can provoke pathologic sensations such as mechanical itch (alloknesis). The molecular and cellular mechanisms that govern this conversion remain unknown. We found that in mice, alloknesis in aging and dry skin is associated with a loss of Merkel cells, the touch receptors in the skin. Targeted genetic deletion of Merkel cells and associated mechanosensitive Piezo2 channels in the skin was sufficient to produce alloknesis. Chemogenetic activation of Merkel cells protected against alloknesis in dry skin. This study reveals a previously unknown function of the cutaneous touch receptors and may provide insight into the development of alloknesis.</p>

Five-dimensional imaging of freezing emulsions with solute effects

We showed that the solute induces long-range interactions that determine the solidification microstructure. The local increase of solute concentration enhances premelting, which controls the engulfment of droplets by the front and the evolution of grain boundaries. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">freez</span></strong>ing emulsions may be a good analog of many solidification systems where objects interact with a solidification interface.</p>

Toughening elastomers using mussel-inspired iron-catechol complexes
<p>Materials often exhibit a trade-off between stiffness and extensibility; for example, strengthening elastomers by increasing their cross-link density leads to embrittlement and decreased toughness. Inspired by cuticles of marine mussel byssi, we circumvent this inherent trade-off by incorporating sacrificial, reversible iron-catechol cross-links into a dry, loosely cross-linked epoxy network. The iron-containing network exhibits two to three orders of magnitude increases in stiffness, tensile strength, and tensile toughness compared to its iron-free precursor while gaining recoverable hysteretic energy dissipation and maintaining its original extensibility. Compared to previous realizations of this chemistry in hydrogels, the dry nature of the network enables larger property enhancement owing to the cooperative effects of both the increased cross-link density given by the reversible iron-catecholate complexes and the chain-restricting ionomeric nanodomains that they form.</p>

Thirst-associated preoptic neurons encode an aversive motivational drive
<p>Water deprivation produces a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dri</span></strong>ve to seek and consume water. How neural activity creates this motivation remains poorly understood.

Single-cell transcriptional profiling revealed that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dehydr</span></strong>ation-activated MnPO neurons consist of a single excitatory cell type. After optogenetic activation of these neurons, mice drank water and performed an operant lever-pressing task for water reward with rates that scaled with stimulation frequency. This stimulation was aversive, and instrumentally pausing stimulation could reinforce lever-pressing. Activity of these neurons gradually decreased over the course of an operant session. Thus, the activity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dehydr</span></strong>ation-activated MnPO neurons establishes a scalable, persistent, and aversive internal state that dynamically controls thirst-motivated behavior.</p>

Release of mineral-bound water prior to subduction tied to shallow seismogenic slip off Sumatra

Visualizing Embolism Propagation in Gas-Injected Leaves
<p>Because the xylem in leaves is thought to be at the greatest risk of cavitation, reliable and efficient methods to characterize leaf xylem vulnerability are of interest. We report a method to generate leaf xylem vulnerability curves (VCs) by gas injection. Using optical light transmission, we visualized embolism propagation in grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) and red oak (<i>Quercus rubra</i>) leaves injected with positive gas pressure. This resulted in a rapid, stepwise reduction of transmitted light, identical to that observed during leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dehydr</span></strong>ation, confirming that the optical method detects gas bubbles and provides insights into the air-seeding hypothesis. In red oak, xylem VCs generated using gas injection were similar to those generated using bench <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dehydr</span></strong>ation, but indicated 50% loss of conductivity at lower tension (∼0.4 MPa) in grapevine. In determining VC, this method eliminates the need to ascertain xylem tension, thus avoiding potential errors in water potential estimations. It is also much faster (1 h per VC). However, severing the petiole and applying high-pressure gas could affect air-seeding and the generated VC. We discuss potential artifacts arising from gas injection and recommend comparison of this method with a more standard procedure before it is assumed to be suitable for a given species.</p>

Massive Tandem Proliferation of ELIPs Supports Convergent Evolution of Desiccation Tolerance across Land Plants
<p>Desiccation tolerance was a critical adaptation for the colonization of land by early nonvascular plants. Resurrection plants have maintained or rewired these ancestral protective mechanisms, and desiccation-tolerant species are dispersed across the land plant phylogeny. Although common physiological, biochemical, and molecular signatures are observed across resurrection plant lineages, features underlying the recurrent evolution of desiccation tolerance are unknown. Here we used a comparative approach to identify patterns of genome evolution and gene duplication associated with desiccation tolerance. We identified a single gene family with dramatic expansion in all sequenced resurrection plant genomes and no expansion in desiccation-sensitive species. This gene family of early light-induced proteins (ELIPs) expanded in resurrection plants convergent through repeated tandem gene duplication. ELIPs are universally highly expressed during desiccation in all surveyed resurrection plants and may play a role in protecting against photooxidative damage of the photosynthetic apparatus during prolonged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dehydr</span></strong>ation. Photosynthesis is particularly sensitive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dehydr</span></strong>ation, and the increased abundance of ELIPs may help facilitate the rapid recovery observed for most resurrection plants. Together, these observations support convergent evolution of desiccation tolerance in land plants through tandem gene duplication.</p>

Candidate Enzymes for Saffron Crocin Biosynthesis Are Localized in Multiple Cellular Compartments
<p>Saffron is the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dri</span></strong>ed stigmas of <i>Crocus sativus</i> and is the most expensive spice in the world. Its red color is due to crocins, which are apocarotenoid glycosides that accumulate in the vacuole to a level up to 10% of the stigma dry weight. Previously, we characterized the first dedicated enzyme in the crocin biosynthetic pathway, carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase2 (CsCCD2), which cleaves zeaxanthin to yield crocetin dialdehyde. In this work, we identified six putative <i>aldehyde <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dehydr</span></strong>ogenase</i> (<i>ALDH</i>) genes expressed in <i>C. sativus</i> stigmas. Heterologous expression in <i>Escherichia coli</i> showed that only one of corresponding proteins (CsALDH3I1) was able to convert crocetin dialdehyde into the crocin precursor crocetin. CsALDH3I1 carries a carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic domain, similar to that of the <i>Neurospora crassa</i> membrane-associated apocarotenoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dehydr</span></strong>ogenase YLO-1. We also characterized the UDP-glycosyltransferase CsUGT74AD1, which converts crocetin to crocins 1 and 2′. In vitro assays revealed high specificity of CsALDH3I1 for crocetin dialdehyde and long-chain apocarotenals and of CsUGT74AD1 for crocetin. Following extract fractionation, CsCCD2, CsALDH3I1, and CsUGT74AD1 were found in the insoluble fraction, suggesting their association with membranes or large insoluble complexes. Analysis of protein localization in both <i>C. sativus</i> stigmas and following transgene expression in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaves revealed that CsCCD2, CsALDH3I, and CsUGT74AD1 were localized to the plastids, the endoplasmic reticulum, and the cytoplasm, respectively, in association with cytoskeleton-like structures. Based on these findings and current literature, we propose that the endoplasmic reticulum and cytoplasm function as transit centers for metabolites whose biosynthesis starts in the plastid and are accumulated in the vacuole.</p>

Hornwort Stomata: Architecture and Fate Shared with 400-Million-Year-Old Fossil Plants without Leaves
<p>As one of the earliest plant groups to evolve stomata, hornworts are key to understanding the origin and function of stomata. Hornwort stomata are large and scattered on sporangia that grow from their bases and release spores at their tips. We present data from development and immunocytochemistry that identify a role for hornwort stomata that is correlated with sporangial and spore maturation. We measured guard cells across the genera with stomata to assess developmental changes in size and to analyze any correlation with genome size. Stomata form at the base of the sporophyte in the green region, where they develop differential wall thickenings, form a pore, and die. Guard cells collapse inwardly, increase in surface area, and remain perched over a substomatal cavity and network of intercellular spaces that is initially fluid filled. Following pore formation, the sporophyte <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dri</span></strong>es from the outside inwardly and continues to do so after guard cells die and collapse. Spore tetrads develop in spore mother cell walls within a mucilaginous matrix, both of which progressively dry before sporophyte dehiscence. A lack of correlation between guard cell size and DNA content, lack of arabinans in cell walls, and perpetually open pores are consistent with the inactivity of hornwort stomata. Stomata are expendable in hornworts, as they have been lost twice in derived taxa. Guard cells and epidermal cells of hornworts show striking similarities with the earliest plant fossils. Our findings identify an architecture and fate of stomata in hornworts that is ancient and common to plants without sporophytic leaves.</p>

Mechanical Failure of Fine Root Cortical Cells Initiates Plant Hydraulic Decline during Drought
<p>Root systems perform the crucial task of absorbing water from the soil to meet the demands of a transpiring canopy. Roots are thought to operate like electrical fuses, which break when carrying an excessive load under conditions of drought stress. Yet the exact site and sequence of this dysfunction in roots remain elusive. Using in vivo x-ray computed microtomography, we found that drought-induced mechanical failure (i.e. lacunae formation) in fine root cortical cells is the initial and primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dri</span></strong>ver of reduced fine root hydraulic conductivity (Lp<sub>r</sub>) under mild to moderate drought stress. Cortical lacunae started forming under mild drought stress (−0.6 MPa Ψ<sub>stem</sub>), coincided with a dramatic reduction in Lp<sub>r</sub>, and preceded root shrinkage or significant xylem embolism. Only under increased drought stress was embolism formation observed in the root xylem, and it appeared first in the fine roots (50% loss of hydraulic conductivity [P<sub>50</sub>] reached at −1.8 MPa) and then in older, coarse roots (P<sub>50</sub> = −3.5 MPa). These results suggest that cortical cells in fine roots function like hydraulic fuses that decouple plants from drying soil, thus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">preserv</span></strong>ing the hydraulic integrity of the plant’s vascular system under early stages of drought stress. Cortical lacunae formation led to permanent structural damage of the root cortex and nonrecoverable Lp<sub>r</sub>, pointing to a role in fine root mortality and turnover under drought stress.</p>

<p>The mammalian evolutionary tree has lost several major clades through recent human-caused extinctions. This process of historical biodiversity loss has particularly affected tropical island regions such as the Caribbean, an area of great evolutionary diversification but poor molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">preserv</span></strong>ation. The most enigmatic of the recently extinct endemic Caribbean mammals are the Nesophontidae, a family of morphologically plesiomorphic lipotyphlan insectivores with no consensus on their evolutionary affinities, and which constitute the only major recent mammal clade to lack any molecular information on their phylogenetic placement. Here, we use a palaeogenomic approach to place Nesophontidae within the phylogeny of recent Lipotyphla. We recovered the near-complete mitochon<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dri</span></strong>al genome and sequences for 17 nuclear genes from a ∼750-year-old Hispaniolan <i>Nesophontes</i> specimen, and identify a divergence from their closest living relatives, the Solenodontidae, more than 40 million years ago. Nesophontidae is thus an older distinct lineage than many extant mammalian orders, highlighting not only the role of island systems as “museums” of diversity that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">preserv</span></strong>e ancient lineages, but also the major human-caused loss of evolutionary history.</p>

Fast, Accurate and Automatic Ancient Nucleosome and Methylation Maps with epiPALEOMIX
<p>The first epigenomes from archaic hominins (AH) and ancient anatomically modern humans (AMH) have recently been characterized, based, however, on a limited number of samples. The extent to which ancient genome-wide epigenetic landscapes can be reconstructed thus remains contentious. Here, we present epiPALEOMIX, an open-source and user-friendly pipeline that exploits post-mortem DNA degradation patterns to reconstruct ancient methylomes and nucleosome maps from shotgun and/or capture-enrichment data. Applying epiPALEOMIX to the sequence data underlying 35 ancient genomes including AMH, AH, equids and aurochs, we investigate the temporal, geographical and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">preserv</span></strong>ation range of ancient epigenetic signatures. We first assess the quality of inferred ancient epigenetic signatures within well-characterized genomic regions. We find that tissue-specific methylation signatures can be obtained across a wider range of DNA preparation types than previously thought, including when no particular experimental procedures have been used to remove deaminated cytosines prior to sequencing. We identify a large subset of samples for which DNA associated with nucleosomes is protected from post-mortem degradation, and nucleosome positioning patterns can be reconstructed. Finally, we describe parameters and conditions such as DNA damage levels and sequencing depth that limit the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">preserv</span></strong>ation of epigenetic signatures in ancient samples. When such conditions are met, we propose that epigenetic profiles of CTCF binding regions can be used to help data authentication. Our work, including epiPALEOMIX, opens for further investigations of ancient epigenomes through time especially aimed at tracking possible epigenetic changes during major evolutionary, environmental, socioeconomic, and cultural shifts.</p>

Seasonal accumulation of acetylated triacylglycerols by a freeze-tolerant insect
<p>Most animals store energy as long-chain triacylglycerols (lcTAGs). Trace amounts of acetylated triacylglycerols (acTAGs) have been reported in animals, but are not accumulated, likely because they have lower energy density than lcTAGs. Here we report that acTAGs comprise 36% of the neutral lipid pool of overwintering prepupae of the goldenrod gall fly, <i>Eurosta solidaginis</i>, while only 17% of the neutral lipid pool is made up of typical lcTAGs. These high concentrations of acTAGs, present only during winter, appear to be synthesized by <i>E. solidaginis</i> and are not found in other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">freez</span></strong>e-tolerant insects, nor in the plant host. The mixture of acTAGs found in <i>E. solidaginis</i> has a significantly lower melting point than equivalent lcTAGs, and thus remains liquid at temperatures at which <i>E. solidaginis</i> is frozen in the field, and depresses the melting point of aqueous solutions in a manner unusual for neutral lipids. We note that accumulation of acTAGs coincides with preparation for overwintering and the seasonal acquisition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">freez</span></strong>e tolerance. This is the first observation of accumulation of acTAGs by an animal, and the first evidence of dynamic interconversion between acTAGs and lcTAGs during development and in response to stress.</p>

Is gastrointestinal plasticity in king quail (<i>Coturnix chinensis</i>) elicited by diet-fibre or diet-energy dilution?
<p>Phenotypic plasticity of organ size allows some animals to manage fluctuations of resource quality or availability. Here, we examined the phenotypic plasticity of the gastrointestinal tract of king quail (<i>Coturnix chinensis</i>) in a diet-fibre manipulation study. Quail were offered either a control low-fibre (high-quality) food (8.5% neutral-detergent fibre; NDF), or one of two experimental diets of higher fibre contents of 16% NDF (i.e. low-quality food). To examine whether phenotypic plasticity of organ size was associated with the fibre content per se, or as a consequence of diluting the diet energy contents by adding fibre, one of the high-fibre feeds was ‘balanced’ with additional energy to match that of the low-fibre control diet. Total empty dry mass of the gastrointestinal tract was significantly heavier among birds offered the unbalanced high-fibre diet as compared with those offered the control diet, with birds offered the fibrous but energy-balanced diet having guts of intermediate size. The heavier entire-gut mass (dry) of quail offered the unbalanced high-fibre diet was associated mainly with these birds having significantly heavier gizzards. Notably, the larger gizzard in the birds offered the unbalanced high-fibre diet was associated with marked increases in their metabolisability (digestion) of diet fibre. Our findings suggest that the available energy in the diet may be more important for eliciting phenotypic changes in the gut of these herbivorous birds rather than simple physical effects of diet fibre on feed intakes or on muscular compensation to fibrous ingesta.</p>

Antifreeze proteins in the primary urine of larvae of the beetle <i>Dendroides canadensis</i>
<p>To avoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">freez</span></strong>ing while overwintering beneath the bark of fallen trees, <i>Dendroides canadensis</i> (Coleoptera: Pyrochroidae) larvae produce a family of anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">freez</span></strong>e proteins (DAFPs) that are transcribed in specific tissues and have specific compartmental fates. DAFPs and associated thermal hysteresis activity (THA) have been shown previously in hemolymph and midgut fluid, but the presence of DAFPs has not been explored in primary urine, a potentially important site that can contain endogenous ice-nucleating compounds that could induce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">freez</span></strong>ing. A maximum mean THA of 2.65±0.33°C was observed in primary urine of winter-collected <i>D. canadensis</i> larvae. THA in primary urine increased significantly through autumn, peaked in the winter and decreased through spring to levels of 0.2–0.3°C in summer, in a pattern similar to that of hemolymph and midgut fluid. THA was also found in hindgut fluid and excreted rectal fluid, suggesting that these larvae not only concentrate AFPs in the hindgut, but also excrete AFPs from the rectal cavity. Based on <i>dafp</i> transcripts isolated from Malpighian tubule epithelia, cDNAs were cloned and sequenced, identifying the presence of transcripts encoding 24 DAFP isoforms. Six of these Malpighian tubule DAFPs were known previously, but 18 are new. We also provide functional evidence that DAFPs can inhibit ice nucleators present in insect primary urine. This is potentially critical because <i>D. canadensis</i> larvae die if frozen, and therefore ice formation in any body fluid, including the urine, would be lethal.</p>

Runx1 Deficiency Protects Against Adverse Cardiac Remodeling After Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Myocardial infarction (MI) is a leading cause of heart failure and death worldwide. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">preserv</span></strong>ation of contractile function and protection against adverse changes in ventricular architecture (cardiac remodeling) are key factors to limiting progression of this condition to heart failure. Consequently, new therapeutic targets are urgently required to achieve this aim. Expression of the Runx1 transcription factor is increased in adult cardiomyocytes after MI; however, the functional role of Runx1 in the heart is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To address this question, we have generated a novel tamoxifen-inducible cardiomyocyte-specific <i>Runx1</i>-deficient mouse. Mice were subjected to MI by means of coronary artery ligation. Cardiac remodeling and contractile function were assessed extensively at the whole-heart, cardiomyocyte, and molecular levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p><i>Runx1</i>-deficient mice were protected against adverse cardiac remodeling after MI, maintaining ventricular wall thickness and contractile function. Furthermore, these mice lacked eccentric hypertrophy, and their cardiomyocytes exhibited markedly improved calcium handling. At the mechanistic level, these effects were achieved through increased phosphorylation of phospholamban by protein kinase A and relief of sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase inhibition. Enhanced sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase activity in Runx1-deficient mice increased sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium content and sarcoplasmic reticulum–mediated calcium release, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">preserv</span></strong>ing cardiomyocyte contraction after MI.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our data identified Runx1 as a novel therapeutic target with translational potential to counteract the effects of adverse cardiac remodeling, thereby improving survival and quality of life among patients with MI.</p></sec>

Delayed Repolarization Underlies Ventricular Arrhythmias in Rats With Heart Failure and Preserved Ejection Fraction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Heart failure with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">preserv</span></strong>ed ejection fraction (HFpEF) represents approximately half of heart failure, and its incidence continues to increase. The leading cause of mortality in HFpEF is sudden death, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Dahl salt-sensitive rats were fed a high-salt diet (8% NaCl) from 7 weeks of age to induce HFpEF (n=38). Rats fed a normal-salt diet (0.3% NaCl) served as controls (n=13). Echocardiograms were performed to assess systolic and diastolic function from 14 weeks of age. HFpEF-verified and control rats underwent programmed electrical stimulation. Corrected QT interval was measured by surface ECG. The mechanisms of ventricular arrhythmias (VA) were probed by optical mapping, whole-cell patch clamp to measure action potential duration and ionic currents, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting to investigate changes in ion channel expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>After 7 weeks of a high-salt diet, 31 of 38 rats showed diastolic dysfunction and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">preserv</span></strong>ed ejection fraction along with signs of heart failure and hence were diagnosed with HFpEF. Programmed electric stimulation demonstrated increased susceptibility to VA in HFpEF rats (<i>P</i><0.001 versus controls). The arrhythmogenicity index was increased (<i>P</i><0.001) and the corrected QT interval on ECG was prolonged (<i>P</i><0.001) in HFpEF rats. Optical mapping of HFpEF hearts demonstrated prolonged action potentials (<i>P</i><0.05) and multiple reentry circuits during induced VA. Single-cell recordings of cardiomyocytes isolated from HFpEF rats confirmed a delay of repolarization (<i>P</i>=0.001) and revealed downregulation of transient outward potassium current (<i>I</i><sub>to</sub>; <i>P</i><0.05). The rapid components of the delayed rectifier potassium current (<i>I</i><sub>Kr</sub>) and the inward rectifier potassium current (<i>I</i><sub>K1</sub>) were also downregulated (<i>P</i><0.05), but the current densities were much lower than for <i>I</i><sub>to</sub>. In accordance with the reduction of <i>I</i><sub>to</sub>, both <i>Kcnd3</i> transcript and Kv4.3 protein levels were decreased in HFpEF rat hearts.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Susceptibility to VA was markedly increased in rats with HFpEF. Underlying abnormalities include QT prolongation, delayed repolarization from downregulation of potassium currents, and multiple reentry circuits during VA. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that potassium current downregulation leads to abnormal repolarization in HFpEF, which in turn predisposes to VA and sudden cardiac death.</p></sec>

Left Ventricular Structure and Function in Transthyretin-Related Versus Light-Chain Cardiac Amyloidosis
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Immunoglobulin amyloid light-chain (AL)-related cardiac amyloidosis (CA) has a worse prognosis than either wild-type (ATTRwt) or mutant (ATTRm) transthyretin (TTR) CA. Detailed echocardiographic studies have been performed in AL amyloidosis but not in TTR amyloidosis and might give insight into this difference. We assessed cardiac structure and function and outcome in a large population of patients with CA and compared findings in TTR and AL-related disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We analyzed 172 patients with CA (AL amyloidosis, n=80; ATTRm, n=36; ATTRwt, n=56) by standard echocardiography and 2-dimensional speckle-tracking imaging-derived left ventricular (LV) longitudinal (LS), radial, and circumferential strains. Despite a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">preserv</span></strong>ed LV ejection fraction (55±12%), LS was severely impaired in CA. Standard measures of LV function and speckle-tracking imaging worsened as wall thickness increased, whereas apical LS was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">preserv</span></strong>ed regardless of the pathogenesis of CA and the degree of wall thickening. Compared with ATTRm and AL amyloidosis, ATTRwt was characterized by greater LV wall thickness and lower ejection fraction. LS was more depressed in both ATTRwt and AL amyloidosis (−11±3% and −12±4%, respectively, <i>P</i>=0.54) than in ATTRm (−15±4%, <i>P</i><0.01 versus AL amyloidosis and ATTRwt). TTR-related causes were favorable predictors of survival, whereas LS and advanced New York Heart Association class were negative predictors.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>In patients with CA, worsening LV function correlated with increasing wall thickness regardless of pathogenesis. Patients with ATTRwt had a statistically greater wall thickness but lesser mortality than those with AL amyloidosis, despite very similar degrees of LS impairment. This paradox suggests an additional mechanism for LV dysfunction in AL amyloidosis, such as previously demonstrated light-chain toxicity.</p></sec>

Artemin, a diapause-specific chaperone, contributes to the stress tolerance of <i>Artemia franciscana</i> cysts and influences their release from females
<p>Females of the crustacean <i>Artemia franciscana</i> produce either motile nauplii or gastrula stage embryos enclosed in a shell impermeable to nonvolatile compounds and known as cysts. The encysted embryos enter diapause, a state of greatly reduced metabolism and profound stress tolerance. Artemin, a diapause-specific ferritin homolog in cysts has molecular chaperone activity <i>in vitro</i>. Artemin represents 7.2% of soluble protein in cysts, approximately equal to the amount of p26, a small heat shock protein. However, there is almost twice as much artemin mRNA in cysts as compared with p26 mRNA, suggesting that artemin mRNA is translated less efficiently. RNA interference employing the injection of artemin double-stranded RNA into the egg sacs of <i>A. franciscana</i> females substantially reduced artemin mRNA and protein in cysts. Decreasing artemin diminished desiccation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">freez</span></strong>ing tolerance of cysts, demonstrating a role for this protein in stress resistance. Knockdown of artemin increased the time required for complete discharge of a brood of cysts carried within a female from a few hours up to 4 days, an effect weakened in successive broods. Artemin, an abundant molecular chaperone, contributes to stress tolerance of <i>A. franciscana</i> cysts while influencing their development and/or exit from females.</p>

The Chinese soft-shelled turtle, <i>Pelodiscus sinensis</i>, decreases nitrogenous excretion, reduces urea synthesis and suppresses ammonia production during emersion
<p>The objective of this study was to examine the effects of 6 days of emersion on nitrogen metabolism and excretion in the Chinese soft-shelled turtle, <i>Pelodiscus sinensis</i>. Despite having a soft shell with a cutaneous surface that is known to be water permeable, <i>P. sinensis</i> lost only ~2% of body mass and was able to maintain its hematocrit and plasma osmolality, [Na<sup>+</sup>] and [Cl<sup>−</sup>] during 6 days of emersion. During emersion, it ameliorated water loss by reducing urine output, which led to a reduction (by 29–76%) in ammonia excretion. In comparison, there was a more prominent reduction (by 82–99%) in urea excretion during emersion due to a lack of water to flush the buccopharyngeal epithelium, which is known to be the major route of urea excretion. Consequently, emersion resulted in an apparent shift from ureotely to ammonotely in <i>P. sinensis</i>. Although urea concentration increased in several tissues, the excess urea accumulated could only account for 13–22% of the deficit in urea excretion. Hence, it can be concluded that a decrease (~80%) in urea synthesis occurred in <i>P. sinensis</i> during the 6 days of emersion. Indeed, emersion led to significant decreases in the activity of some ornithine–urea cycle enzymes (argininosuccinate synthetase/argininosuccinate lyase and arginase) from the liver of <i>P. sinensis</i>. As a decrease in urea synthesis occurred without the accumulation of ammonia and total free amino acids, it can be deduced that ammonia production through amino acid catabolism was suppressed with a proportional reduction in proteolysis in <i>P. sinensis</i> during emersion. Indeed, calculated results revealed that there could be a prominent decrease (~88%) in ammonia production in turtles after 6 days of emersion. In summary, despite being ureogenic and ureotelic in water, <i>P. sinensis</i> adopted a reduction in ammonia production, instead of increased urea synthesis, as the major strategy to ameliorate ammonia toxicity and problems associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dehydr</span></strong>ation during terrestrial exposure.</p>

Rapid cold hardening improves recovery of ion homeostasis and chill coma recovery time in the migratory locust, <i>Locusta migratoria</i>
<p>Chill tolerance of insects is defined as the ability to tolerate low temperature under circumstances not involving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">freez</span></strong>ing of intracellular or extracellular fluids. For many insects chill tolerance is crucial for their ability to persist in cold environments and mounting evidence indicates that chill tolerance is associated with the ability to maintain ion and water homeostasis, thereby ensuring muscular function and preventing chill injury at low temperature. The present study describes the relationship between muscle and haemolymph ion homeostasis and time to regain posture following cold shock (CS, 2 h at −4°C) in the chill-susceptible locust <i>Locusta migratoria</i>. This relationship was examined in animals with and without a prior rapid cold-hardening treatment (RCH, 2 h at 0°C) to investigate the physiological underpinnings of RCH. CS elicited a doubling of haemolymph [K<sup>+</sup>] and this disturbance was greater in locusts pre-exposed to RCH. Recovery of ion homeostasis was, however, markedly faster in RCH-treated animals, which correlated well with whole-organism performance as hardened individuals regained posture faster than non-hardened individuals following CS. The present study indicates that loss and recovery of muscular function are associated with the resting membrane potential of excitable membranes as attested by the changes in the equilibrium potential for K<sup>+</sup> (<i>E</i><sub>K</sub>) following CS. Both hardened and non-hardened animals regained movement once K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis had recovered to a fixed level (<i>E</i><sub>K</sub>≈−41 mV). RCH is therefore not associated with altered sensitivity to ion disturbance but instead is correlated to a faster recovery of haemolymph [K<sup>+</sup>].</p>

Invasion and adaptation of a warm-adapted species to montane localities: effect of acclimation potential
<p><i>Drosophila ananassae</i> has successfully invaded the cold and dry montane localities of the Western Himalayas in recent years. The ability of this desiccation- and cold-sensitive tropical species to evolve in response to seasonal changes in montane localities is largely unknown. Here, we investigated how this sensitive species adapt to seasonally varying environmental conditions that are lethal to its survival. We observed change in the frequency of dark and light morphs of <i>D. ananassae</i> in five mid-altitude localities during the last decade (2000–2010). We document invasion of <i>D. ananassae</i> to montane localities and increase in frequency of the dark morph. The stress tolerance of morphs (dark and light) remained unaffected of developmental acclimation. However, adult acclimation has shown significant effects on tolerance to various environmental stresses in morphs and effect of this acclimation persist for long durations. Desiccation and cold stress tolerance was increased after adult acclimation for respective stress in the dark morph; while tolerance of the light morph was not affected. Further, heat tolerance of the light morph was increased after adult heat acclimation with no influence on heat tolerance of the dark morph. Our results suggest a possible role of adult acclimation in successful invasion and adaptation of <i>D. ananassae</i> to montane localities. Future experiments should be carried out to determine whether the survival in adverse conditions of low <i>versus</i> high temperature and humidity during seasonal changes is assisted by different acclimation abilities of the two morphs of <i>D. ananassae</i>.</p>

Gastrointestinal and renal responses to variable water intake in whitebellied sunbirds and New Holland honeyeaters
<p>Nectarivores face a constant challenge in terms of water balance, experiencing water loading or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dehydr</span></strong>ation when switching between food plants or between feeding and fasting. To understand how whitebellied sunbirds and New Holland honeyeaters meet the challenges of varying preformed water load, we used the elimination of intramuscular-injected [<sup>14</sup>C]-<sc>l</sc>-glucose and <sup>3</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O to quantify intestinal and renal water handling on diets varying in sugar concentration. Both sunbirds and honeyeaters showed significant modulation of intestinal water absorption, allowing excess water to be shunted through the intestine when on dilute diets. Despite reducing their fractional water absorption, both species showed linear increases in water flux and fractional body water turnover as water intake increased (both afternoon and morning), suggesting that the modulation of fractional water absorption was not sufficient to completely offset dietary water loads. In both species, glomerular filtration rate was independent of water gain (but was higher for the afternoon), as was renal fractional water reabsorption (measured in the afternoon). During the natural overnight fast, both sunbirds and honeyeaters arrested whole kidney function. Evaporative water loss in sunbirds was variable but correlated with water gain. Both sunbirds and honeyeaters appear to modulate intestinal water absorption as an important component of water regulation to help deal with massive preformed water loads. Shutting down glomerular filtration rate during the overnight fast is another way of saving energy for osmoregulatory function. Birds maintain osmotic balance on diets varying markedly in preformed water load by varying both intestinal water absorption and excretion through the intestine and kidneys.</p>

Is it safe to preserve the deltoid when resecting the proximal humerus for a primary malignant bone tumour?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Resection of the proximal humerus for the primary malignant bone   tumour sometimes requires <i>en bloc</i> resection of the   deltoid. However, there is no information in the literature which   helps a surgeon decide whether to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">preserv</span></strong>e the deltoid or not. The   aim of this study was to determine whether retaining the deltoid   at the time of resection would increase the rate of local recurrence.   We also sought to identify the variables that persuade expert surgeons   to choose a deltoid sparing rather than deltoid resecting procedure.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We reviewed 45 patients who had undergone resection of a primary   malignant tumour of the proximal humerus. There were 29 in the deltoid   sparing group and 16 in the deltoid resecting group. Imaging studies   were reviewed to assess tumour extension and soft-tissue involvement.   The presence of a fat rim separating the tumour from the deltoid   on MRI was particularly noted. The cumulative probability of local   recurrence was calculated in a competing risk scenario.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was no significant difference (adjusted p = 0.89) in the   cumulative probability of local recurrence between the deltoid sparing   (7%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1 to 20) and the deltoid resecting   group (26%, 95% CI 8 to 50). Patients were more likely to be selected   for a deltoid sparing procedure if they presented with a small tumour   (p = 0.0064) with less bone involvement (p = 0.032) and a continuous   fat rim on MRI (p = 0.002) and if the axillary nerve could be identified   (p = 0.037).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>A deltoid sparing procedure can provide good local control after   resection of the proximal humerus for a primary malignant bone tumour.   A smaller tumour, the presence of a continuous fat rim and the identification   of the axillary nerve on pre-operative MRI will persuade surgeons   to opt for a deltoid resecting procedure.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1244–9.</p></sec>

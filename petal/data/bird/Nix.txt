<i>Hydra myc2</i>, a unique pre-bilaterian member of the <i>myc</i> gene family, is activated in cell proliferation and gametogenesis
<p>The <i>myc</i> protooncogene encodes the Myc transcription factor which is the essential part of the Myc–Max network controlling fundamental cellular processes. Deregulation of <i>myc</i> leads to tumorigenesis and is a hallmark of many human cancers. We have recently identified homologs of <i>myc</i> (<i>myc1</i>, <i>myc2</i>) and <i>max</i> in the early diploblastic cnidarian <i>Hydra</i> and have characterized <i>myc1</i> in detail. Here we show that <i>myc2</i> is transcriptionally activated in the interstitial stem cell system. Furthermore, in contrast to <i>myc1</i>, <i>myc2</i> expression is also detectable in proliferating epithelial stem cells throughout the gastric region. <i>myc2</i> but not <i>myc1</i> is activated in cycling precursor cells during early oogenesis and spermatogenesis, suggesting that the <i>Hydra</i> Myc2 protein has a possible non-redundant function in cell cycle progression. The Myc2 protein displays the principal design and properties of vertebrate Myc proteins. In complex with Max, Myc2 binds to DNA with similar affinity as Myc1–Max heterodimers. Immunoprecipitation of <i>Hydra</i> chromatin revealed that both Myc1 and Myc2 bind to the enhancer region of <i>CAD</i>, a classical Myc target gene in mammals. Luciferase reporter gene assays showed that Myc1 but not Myc2 transcriptionally activates the <i>CAD</i> promoter. Myc2 has oncogenic potential when tested in primary avian fibroblasts but to a lower degree as compared to Myc1. The identification of an additional <i>myc</i> gene in Cnidaria, a phylum that diverged prior to bilaterians, with characteristic expression patterns in tissue homeostasis and developmental processes suggests that principle functions of <i>myc</i> genes have arisen very early in metazoan evolution.</p>

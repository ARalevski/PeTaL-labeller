Ser<sup>1928</sup> phosphorylation by PKA stimulates the L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 and vasoconstriction during acute hyperglycemia and diabetes
<p>Hypercontractility of arterial myocytes and enhanced vascular tone during diabetes are, in part, attributed to the effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed glucose (hyperglycemia) on L-type Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels. In murine arterial myocytes, kinase-dependent mechanisms mediate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e in Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 activity in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed extracellular glucose. We identified a subpopulation of the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel pore-forming subunit (α1<sub>C</sub>) within nanometer proximity of protein kinase A (PKA) at the sarcolemma of murine and human arterial myocytes. This arrangement depended upon scaffolding of PKA by an A-kinase anchoring protein 150 (AKAP150) in mice. Glucose-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>es in Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel activity were associated with PKA activity, leading to α1<sub>C</sub> phosphorylation at Ser<sup>1928</sup>. Compared to arteries from low-fat diet (LFD)–fed mice and nondiabetic patients, arteries from high-fat diet (HFD)–fed mice and from diabetic patients had <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed Ser<sup>1928</sup> phosphorylation and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 activity. Arterial myocytes and arteries from mice lacking AKAP150 or expressing mutant AKAP150 unable to bind PKA did not exhibit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed Ser<sup>1928</sup> phosphorylation and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 current density in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed glucose or to HFD. Consistent with a functional role for Ser<sup>1928</sup> phosphorylation, arterial myocytes and arteries from knockin mice expressing a Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 with Ser<sup>1928</sup> mutated to alanine (S1928A) lacked glucose-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>es in Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 activity and vasoconstriction. Furthermore, the HFD-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>es in Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 current density and myogenic tone were prevented in S1928A knockin mice. These findings reveal an essential role for α1<sub>C</sub> phosphorylation at Ser<sup>1928</sup> in stimulating Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel activity and vasoconstriction by AKAP-targeted PKA upon exposure to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed glucose and in diabetes.</p>

An increase in minimum metabolic rate and not activity explains field metabolic rate changes in a breeding seabird
<p>The field metabolic rate (FMR) of a free-ranging animal can be considered as the sum of its maintenance costs (minimum metabolic rate, MMR) and additional costs associated with thermoregulation, digestion, production and activity. However, the relationships between FMR and BMR and how they relate to behaviour and extrinsic influences is not clear. In seabirds, FMR has been shown to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e during the breeding season. This is presumed to be the result of an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e in foraging activity, stimulated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed food demands from growing chicks, but few studies have investigated in detail the factors that underlie these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>es. We studied free-ranging Australasian gannets (<i>Morus serrator</i>) throughout their 5 month breeding season, and evaluated FMR, MMR and activity-related metabolic costs on a daily basis using the heart rate method. In addition, we simultaneously recorded behaviour (flying and diving) in the same individuals. FMR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed steadily throughout the breeding season, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ing by 11% from the incubation period to the long chick-brooding period. However, this was not accompanied by either an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e in flying or diving behaviour, or an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e in the energetic costs of activity. Instead, the changes in FMR could be explained exclusively by a progressive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e in MMR. Seasonal changes in MMR could be due to a change in body composition or a decrease in body condition associated with changing the allocation of resources between provisioning adults and growing chicks. Our study highlights the importance of measuring physiological parameters continuously in free-ranging animals in order to understand fully the mechanisms underpinning seasonal changes in physiology and behaviour.</p>

Cell structural changes in the mesophyll of Norway spruce needles by elevated ozone and elevated temperature in open-field exposure during cold acclimation
<p>The effects of elevated ozone (1.4× ambient) and temperature (ambient +1.3 °C) alone and in combination were studied on the needle cell structure of soil-grown Norway spruce seedlings in the late growing season and winter. Temperature treatment continued over winter and lengthened the snow-free period. Elevated temperature caused microscopic changes related to photosynthesis (decreased chloroplast size and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed number), carbon storage (reduced starch and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed cytoplasmic lipids) and defence (decreased mitochondrial size and proportion per cytoplasm, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed peroxisomes and plastoglobuli, altered appearance of tannins). The results suggest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed oxidative stress by elevated temperature and altered allocation of limited carbon reserve to defence. The number of peroxisomes and plastoglobuli remained high in the outer cells of needles of ozone-exposed seedlings but decreased in the inner cells. This may indicate defence allocation to cells close to the stomata and surface, which are experiencing more oxidative stress. Ozone reduced winter hardiness based on seasonal changes in chloroplast shape and location in the cells. The effects of ozone became evident at the end of the growing season, indicating the effect of cumulative ozone dose or that the seedlings were vulnerable to ozone at the later phases of winter hardening. Elevated temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed cellular damage in early winter and visible damage in spring, and the damage was enhanced by ozone. In conclusion, the study suggests that modest air temperature elevation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>es stress at the cell structural level in spruce seedlings and is enhanced by low ozone elevation. Future climatic conditions where snow cover is formed later or is lacking but temperatures are low can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e the risk of severe seedling damage, and current and future predicted ozone concentrations <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e this risk.</p>

Risk of early mortality after cemented compared with cementless total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>It has been suggested that cemented fixation of total hip arthroplasty   (THA) is associated with an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed peri-operative mortality compared   with cementless THA.

Information about the causes of death, comorbidities, and socioeconomic   background was obtained. Mortality within the first 90 days after   the operation was the primary outcome measure.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Patients who underwent cemented THA had an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed risk of   death during the first 14 days compared with the controls (hazard   ratio (HR) 1.3, confidence interval (CI) 1.11 to 1.44), corresponding   to an absolute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e in risk of five deaths per 10 000 observations.   No such early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e of risk was seen in those who underwent cementless THA.   Between days 15 and 29 the risk of mortality was decreased for those   with cemented THA (HR 0.7, CI 0.62 to 0.87). Between days 30 and   90 all patients undergoing THA, irrespective of the mode of fixation,   had a lower risk of death than controls. Patients selected for cementless   fixation were younger, healthier and had a higher level of education   and income than those selected for cemented THA.

Effects of PCSK9 Inhibition With Alirocumab on Lipoprotein Metabolism in Healthy Humans
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Alirocumab, a monoclonal antibody to proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), lowers plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and apolipoprotein B100 (apoB). Although studies in mice and cells have identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed hepatic LDL receptors as the basis for LDL lowering by PCSK9 inhibitors, there have been no human studies characterizing the effects of PCSK9 inhibitors on lipoprotein metabolism. In particular, it is not known whether inhibition of PCSK9 has any effects on very low-density lipoprotein or intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL) metabolism. Inhibition of PCSK9 also results in reductions of plasma lipoprotein (a) levels. The regulation of plasma Lp(a) levels, including the role of LDL receptors in the clearance of Lp(a), is poorly defined, and no mechanistic studies of the Lp(a) lowering by alirocumab in humans have been published to date.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Eighteen (10 F, 8 mol/L) participants completed a placebo-controlled, 2-period study. They received 2 doses of placebo, 2 weeks apart, followed by 5 doses of 150 mg of alirocumab, 2 weeks apart. At the end of each period, fractional clearance rates (FCRs) and production rates (PRs) of apoB and apo(a) were determined. In 10 participants, postprandial triglycerides and apoB48 levels were measured.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Alirocumab reduced ultracentrifugally isolated LDL-C by 55.1%, LDL-apoB by 56.3%, and plasma Lp(a) by 18.7%. The fall in LDL-apoB was caused by an 80.4% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e in LDL-apoB FCR and a 23.9% reduction in LDL-apoB PR. The latter was due to a 46.1% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e in IDL-apoB FCR coupled with a 27.2% decrease in conversion of IDL to LDL. The FCR of apo(a) tended to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e (24.6%) without any change in apo(a) PR. Alirocumab had no effects on FCRs or PRs of very low-density lipoproteins-apoB and very low-density lipoproteins triglycerides or on postprandial plasma triglycerides or apoB48 concentrations.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Alirocumab decreased LDL-C and LDL-apoB by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ing IDL- and LDL-apoB FCRs and decreasing LDL-apoB PR. These results are consistent with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>es in LDL receptors available to clear IDL and LDL from blood during PCSK9 inhibition. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e in apo(a) FCR during alirocumab treatment suggests that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed LDL receptors may also play a role in the reduction of plasma Lp(a).</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Patients With Long-QT Syndrome Caused by Impaired <i>hERG</i>-Encoded K<sub>v</sub>11.1 Potassium Channel Have Exaggerated Endocrine Pancreatic and Incretin Function Associated With Reactive Hypoglycemia
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Loss-of-function mutations in <i>hERG</i> (encoding the K<sub>v</sub>11.1 voltage-gated potassium channel) cause long-QT syndrome type 2 (LQT2) because of prolonged cardiac repolarization. However, K<sub>v</sub>11.1 is also present in pancreatic α and β cells and intestinal L and K cells, secreting glucagon, insulin, and the incretins glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide), respectively. These hormones are crucial for glucose regulation, and long-QT syndrome may cause disturbed glucose regulation. We measured secretion of these hormones and cardiac repolarization in response to glucose ingestion in LQT2 patients with functional mutations in <i>hERG</i> and matched healthy participants, testing the hypothesis that LQT2 patients have <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed incretin and β-cell function and decreased α-cell function, and thus lower glucose levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Eleven patients with LQT2 and 22 sex-, age-, and body mass index–matched control participants underwent a 6-hour 75-g oral glucose tolerance test with ECG recording and blood sampling for measurements of glucose, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, GLP-1, and GIP.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In comparison with matched control participants, LQT2 patients had 56% to 78% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed serum insulin, serum C-peptide, plasma GLP-1, and plasma GIP responses (<i>P</i>=0.03–0.001) and decreased plasma glucose levels after glucose ingestion (<i>P</i>=0.02) with more symptoms of hypoglycemia (<i>P</i>=0.04). Sixty-three percent of LQT2 patients developed hypoglycemic plasma glucose levels (<70 mg/dL) versus 36% control participants (<i>P</i>=0.16), and 18% patients developed serious hypoglycemia (<50 mg/dL) versus none of the controls. LQT2 patients had defective glucagon responses to low glucose, <i>P</i>=0.008. β-Cell function (Insulin Secretion Sensitivity Index-2) was 2-fold higher in LQT2 patients than in controls (4398 [95% confidence interval, 2259–8562] versus 2156 [1961–3201], <i>P</i>=0.03).

Size-dependent enhancement of water relations during post-fire resprouting
<p>In resprouting species, fire-induced topkill causes a reduction in height and leaf area without a comparable reduction in the size of the root system, which should lead to an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e in the efficiency of water transport after fire. However, large plants undergo a greater relative reduction in size, compared with small plants, so we hypothesized that this enhancement in hydraulic efficiency would be greatest among large growth forms. In the ecotone between long-leaf pine (<i>Pinus palustris</i> Mill.) savannas and wetlands, we measured stomatal conductance (<i>g</i><sub>s</sub>), mid-day leaf water potential (<i>Ψ</i><sub>leaf</sub>), leaf-specific whole-plant hydraulic conductance (<i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub>), leaf area and height of 10 species covering a range of growth forms in burned and unburned sites. As predicted, <i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub> was higher in post-fire resprouts than in unburned plants, and the post-fire <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e in <i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub> was positively related to plant size. Specifically, large-statured species tended to undergo the greatest relative reductions in leaf area and height, and correspondingly experienced the greatest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>es in <i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub>. The post-fire <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e in <i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub> was smaller than expected, however, due to a decrease in absolute root hydraulic conductance (i.e., not scaled to leaf area). The higher <i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub> in burned sites was manifested as an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e in <i>g</i><sub>s</sub> rather than an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e in <i>Ψ</i><sub>leaf</sub>. Post-fire <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>es in <i>g</i><sub>s</sub> should promote high rates of photosynthesis for recovery of carbohydrate reserves and aboveground biomass, which is particularly important for large-statured species that require more time to recover their pre-fire size.</p>

Variable Mesophyll Conductance among Soybean Cultivars Sets a Tradeoff between Photosynthesis and Water-Use-Efficiency
<p>Photosynthetic efficiency is a critical determinant of crop yield potential, although it remains below the theoretical optimum in modern crop varieties. Enhancing mesophyll conductance (i.e. the rate of carbon dioxide diffusion from substomatal cavities to the sites of carboxylation) may <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e photosynthetic and water use efficiencies. To improve water use efficiency, mesophyll conductance should be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed without concomitantly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ing stomatal conductance. Here, we partition the variance in mesophyll conductance to within- and among-cultivar components across soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) grown under both controlled and field conditions and examine the covariation of mesophyll conductance with photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, water use efficiency, and leaf mass per area. We demonstrate that mesophyll conductance varies more than 2-fold and that 38% of this variation is due to cultivar identity. As expected, mesophyll conductance is positively correlated with photosynthetic rates. However, a strong positive correlation between mesophyll and stomatal conductance among cultivars apparently impedes positive scaling between mesophyll conductance and water use efficiency in soybean. Contrary to expectations, photosynthetic rates and mesophyll conductance both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ing leaf mass per area. The presence of genetic variation for mesophyll conductance suggests that there is potential to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e photosynthesis and mesophyll conductance by selecting for greater leaf mass per area. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ing water use efficiency, though, is unlikely unless there is simultaneous stabilizing selection on stomatal conductance.</p>

Effects of dormancy progression and low-temperature response on changes in the sorbitol concentration in xylem sap of Japanese pear during winter season
<p>In order to elucidate which physiological event(s) are involved in the seasonal changes of carbohydrate dynamics during winter, we examined the effects of different low temperatures on the carbohydrate concentrations of Japanese pear (<i>Pyrus pyrifolia</i> (Burm.) Nakai). For four winter seasons, large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>es in the sorbitol concentration of shoot xylem sap occurred during mid- to late December, possibly due to the endodormancy completion and low-temperature responses. When trees were kept at 15 °C from 3 November to 3 December in order to postpone the initiation and completion of chilling accumulation that would break endodormancy, sorbitol accumulation in xylem sap was always higher from trees with sufficient chilling accumulation than from trees that received insufficient chilling. However, an additional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e in xylem sap sorbitol occurred around late December in trees regardless of whether their chilling accumulation naturally progressed or was postponed. To examine different temperature effects more closely, we compared the carbohydrate concentrations of trees subjected to either 6 or 0 °C treatment. The sorbitol concentration in xylem sap tremendously <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed at 0 °C treatment compared with 6 °C treatment. However, an additional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e in xylem sap sorbitol occurred at both the temperatures when sufficient chilling accumulated with a peak coinciding with the peak expression in shoots of the sorbitol transporter gene (<i>PpSOT2</i>). Interestingly, the total carbohydrate concentration of shoots tremendously <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed with exposure to 0 °C compared with exposure to 6 °C, but was not affected by the amount of accumulated chilling. Instead, as chilling accumulated the ratio of sorbitol to total soluble sugars in shoots <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed. We presumed that carbohydrates in the shoot tissues may be converted to sorbitol and loaded into the xylem sap so that the sorbitol accumulation patterns were synchronized with the progression of dormancy, whereas the total carbohydrate transported into shoots from other storage organs may be related to freezing tolerance acquisition independent of dormancy progression. We thus propose that there are different effects of dormancy progression and low-temperature responses on carbohydrate dynamics in Japanese pear.</p>

AMPK directly activates mTORC2 to promote cell survival during acute energetic stress
<p>AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) senses energetic stress and, in turn, promotes catabolic and suppresses anabolic metabolism coordinately to restore energy balance. We found that a diverse array of AMPK activators <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) signaling in an AMPK-dependent manner in cultured cells. Activation of AMPK with the type 2 diabetes drug metformin (GlucoPhage) also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed mTORC2 signaling in liver in vivo and in primary hepatocytes in an AMPK-dependent manner. AMPK-mediated activation of mTORC2 did not result from AMPK-mediated suppression of mTORC1 and thus reduced negative feedback on PI3K flux. Rather, AMPK associated with and directly phosphorylated mTORC2 (mTOR in complex with rictor). As determined by two-stage in vitro kinase assay, phosphorylation of mTORC2 by recombinant AMPK was sufficient to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e mTORC2 catalytic activity toward Akt. Hence, AMPK phosphorylated mTORC2 components directly to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e mTORC2 activity and downstream signaling.

RSK2 contributes to myogenic vasoconstriction of resistance arteries by activating smooth muscle myosin and the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger
<p>Smooth muscle contraction is triggered when Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) phosphorylates the regulatory light chain of myosin (RLC<sub>20</sub>). However, blood vessels from <i>Mlck</i>-deficient mouse embryos retain the ability to contract, suggesting the existence of additional regulatory mechanisms. We showed that the p90 ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (RSK2) also phosphorylated RLC<sub>20</sub> to promote smooth muscle contractility. Active, phosphorylated RSK2 was present in mouse resistance arteries under normal basal tone, and phosphorylation of RSK2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed with myogenic vasoconstriction or agonist stimulation. Resistance arteries from <i>Rsk2</i>-deficient mice were dilated and showed reduced myogenic tone and RLC<sub>20</sub> phosphorylation. RSK2 phosphorylated Ser<sup>19</sup> in RLC in vitro. In addition, RSK2 phosphorylated an activating site in the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger (NHE-1), resulting in cytosolic alkalinization and an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> that promotes vasoconstriction. NHE-1 activity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed upon myogenic constriction, and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e in intracellular pH was suppressed in <i>Rsk2</i>-deficient mice. In pressured arteries, RSK2-dependent activation of NHE-1 was associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, which would be expected to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e MLCK activity, thereby contributing to basal tone and myogenic responses. Accordingly, <i>Rsk2</i>-deficient mice had lower blood pressure than normal littermates. Thus, RSK2 mediates a procontractile signaling pathway that contributes to the regulation of basal vascular tone, myogenic vasoconstriction, and blood pressure and may be a potential therapeutic target in smooth muscle contractility disorders.</p>

Functional changes of AMPA responses in human induced pluripotent stem cell–derived neural progenitors in fragile X syndrome
<p>Altered neuronal network formation and function involving dysregulated excitatory and inhibitory circuits are associated with fragile X syndrome (FXS). We examined functional maturation of the excitatory transmission system in FXS by investigating the response of FXS patient–derived neural progenitor cells to the glutamate analog (AMPA). Neural progenitors derived from induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines generated from boys with FXS had augmented intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses to AMPA and kainate that were mediated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs) lacking the GluA2 subunit. Together with the enhanced differentiation of glutamate-responsive cells, the proportion of CP-AMPAR and <i>N</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate (NMDA) receptor–coexpressing cells was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed in human FXS progenitors. Differentiation of cells lacking GluA2 was also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed and paralleled the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed inward rectification in neural progenitors derived from <i>Fmr1</i>-knockout mice (the FXS mouse model). Human FXS progenitors had <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed the expression of the precursor and mature forms of miR-181a, a microRNA that represses translation of the transcript encoding GluA2. Blocking GluA2-lacking, CP-AMPARs reduced the neurite length of human iPSC-derived control progenitors and further reduced the shortened length of neurites in human FXS progenitors, supporting the contribution of CP-AMPARs to the regulation of progenitor differentiation. Furthermore, we observed reduced expression of <i>Gria2</i> (the GluA2-encoding gene) in the frontal lobe of FXS mice, consistent with functional changes of AMPARs in FXS. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through CP-AMPARs may <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e the vulnerability and affect the differentiation and migration of distinct cell populations, which may interfere with normal circuit formation in FXS.</p>

Increased homeothermy during reproduction in a basal placental mammal
<p>Homeothermic endothermy, the maintenance of a high and stable body temperature (<i>T</i><sub>b</sub>) using heat produced by elevated metabolism, is energetically expensive. There is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ing evidence that the earliest endotherms were heterotherms that, rather than maintaining strict homeothermy, allowed <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> to fluctuate with large variations between active and rest-phase <i>T</i><sub>b</sub>. The high level of homeothermy observed in modern mammals is therefore likely to have evolved from an ancestral heterothermic state. One of the hypotheses for the evolution of endothermy is that homeothermy allows for greater energetic output during reproduction (parental care model). We tested this hypothesis by measuring metabolic rates over a range of ambient temperatures in both reproductive and non-reproductive greater hedgehog tenrecs (<i>Setifer setosus</i>), a physiologically primitive mammal from Madagascar. Tenrecs have some of the lowest metabolic rates and highest levels of <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> variability of any mammal and are therefore good models of the ancestral eutherian state. During pregnancy and lactation, there was an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e in metabolism and <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> below the thermoneutral zone, accompanied by a decrease in <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> variability. The lower critical limit of the thermoneutral zone was estimated at ~25°C. However, whereas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>es in resting metabolism were substantial below 20°C (up to 150% higher during reproduction), daytime rest-phase ambient temperatures at the study site rarely reached equivalent low levels. Thus, <i>S. setosus</i> provide an example for how relatively low-cost <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>es in homeothermy could have led to substantial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>es in fitness by allowing for the faster production of young. The mechanisms necessary for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>es in thermogenesis during reproduction would have further benefited the development of homeothermy in mammals.</p>

Augmentation of Muscle Blood Flow by Ultrasound Cavitation Is Mediated by ATP and Purinergic Signaling

We hypothesized that purinergic signaling is responsible for shear-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>es in muscle perfusion during therapeutic cavitation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Unilateral exposure of the proximal hindlimb of mice (with or without ischemia produced by iliac ligation) to therapeutic ultrasound (1.3 MHz, mechanical index 1.3) was performed for 10 minutes after intravenous injection of 2×10<sup>8</sup> lipid microbubbles. Microvascular perfusion was evaluated by low-power contrast ultrasound perfusion imaging. In vivo muscle ATP release and in vitro ATP release from endothelial cells or erythrocytes were assessed by a luciferin-luciferase assay. Purinergic signaling pathways were assessed by studying interventions that (1) accelerated ATP degradation; (2) inhibited P2Y receptors, adenosine receptors, or K<sub>ATP</sub> channels; or (3) inhibited downstream signaling pathways involving endothelial nitric oxide synthase or prostanoid production (indomethacin). Augmentation in muscle perfusion by ultrasound cavitation was assessed in a proof-of-concept clinical trial in 12 subjects with stable sickle cell disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Therapeutic ultrasound cavitation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed muscle perfusion by 7-fold in normal mice, reversed tissue ischemia for up to 24 hours in the murine model of peripheral artery disease, and doubled muscle perfusion in patients with sickle cell disease. Augmentation in flow extended well beyond the region of ultrasound exposure. Ultrasound cavitation produced an ≈40-fold focal and sustained <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e in ATP, the source of which included both endothelial cells and erythrocytes. Inhibitory studies indicated that ATP was a critical mediator of flow augmentation that acts primarily through either P2Y receptors or adenosine produced by ectonucleotidase activity.

Moderate excess of pyruvate augments osteoclastogenesis
<p>Cell differentiation leads to adaptive changes in energy metabolism. Conversely, hyperglycemia induces malfunction of many body systems, including bone, suggesting that energy metabolism reciprocally affects cell differentiation. We investigated how the differentiation of bone-resorbing osteoclasts, large polykaryons formed through fusion and growth of cells of monocytic origin, is affected by excess of energy substrate pyruvate and how energy metabolism changes during osteoclast differentiation. Surprisingly, small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>es in pyruvate (1–2 mM above basal levels) augmented osteoclastogenesis <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, while larger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>es were not effective <i>in vitro</i>. Osteoclast differentiation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed cell mitochondrial activity and ATP levels, which were further augmented in energy-rich conditions. Conversely, the inhibition of respiration significantly reduced osteoclast number and size. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) acts as a metabolic sensor, which is inhibited in energy-rich conditions. We found that osteoclast differentiation was associated with an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e in AMPK levels and a change in AMPK isoform composition. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed osteoclast size induced by pyruvate (1 mM above basal levels) was prevented in the presence of AMPK activator 5-amino-4-imidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR). In keeping, inhibition of AMPK using dorsomorphin or siRNA to AMPKγ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed osteoclast size in control cultures to the level observed in the presence of pyruvate. Thus, we have found that a moderate excess of pyruvate enhances osteoclastogenesis, and that AMPK acts to tailor osteoclastogenesis to a cell's bioenergetics capacity.</p>

Organ-coordinated response of early post-germination mahogany seedlings to drought
<p>Water deficit tolerance during post-germination stages is critical for seedling recruitment.

The root : shoot ratio <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed under water deficit. The leaf number and water potential were not altered, although reductions in leaf area and stomatal conductance were observed. Osmotic potential became more negative in leaves of seedlings under severe stress. Water deficit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed fructose, glucose, sucrose and myo-inositol levels in leaves. Stems accumulated fructose, glucose and <sc>l</sc>-proline. Nitric oxide (NO) levels <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed in the vascular cylinder of roots under severe stress while superoxide anion levels decreased due to augmented superoxide dismutase activity in this organ. Water deficit induced glutathione reductase activity in both roots and stems. Upon moderate or severe stress, catalase activity decreased in leaves and remained unaffected in the other seedling organs, allowing for an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) levels in leaves. Overall, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e of signaling molecules in distinct organs—NO in roots, <sc>l</sc>-proline in stems and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and myo-inositol in leaves—contributed to the response of mahogany seedlings to water deficit by triggering biochemical processes that resulted in the attenuation of oxidative stress and the establishment of osmotic adjustment. Therefore, this body of evidence reveals that the development of newly germinated mahogany seedlings may occur in both natural habitats and crop fields even when water availability is greatly limited.</p>

Differential radial growth patterns between beech (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i> L.) and oak (<i>Quercus robur</i> L.) on periodically waterlogged soils
<p>Climate scenarios for northern Central Europe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">project</span></strong> rising temperatures and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ing frequency and intensity of droughts but also a shift in precipitation pattern with more humid winters. This in turn may result in soil waterlogging during the following spring, leading to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ing stress for trees growing on hydric sites. The influence of waterlogging on growth of common beech and pedunculate oak has been studied intensively on seedlings under experimental conditions. However, the question remains whether results of these studies can be transferred to mature trees growing under natural conditions. To test this, we investigated general growth patterns and climate–growth relationships in four mature stands of beech and oak growing on hydromorphic soils (Stagnosols) in northeast Germany using dendrochronological methods. Our results confirmed the expected tolerance of oak to strong water-level fluctuations. Neither extremely wet conditions during spring nor summer droughts significantly affected its radial growth. Oak growth responded positively to warmer temperatures during previous year October and March of the current year of ring formation. Contrary to our expectations, also beech showed relatively low sensitivity to periods of high soil water saturation. Instead, summer drought turned out to be the main climatic factor influencing ring width of beech even under the specific periodically wet soil conditions of our study. This became evident from general climate–growth correlations over the last century as well as from discontinuous (pointer year) analysis with summer drought being significantly correlated to the occurrence of growth depressions. As ring width of the two species is affected by differing climate parameters, species-specific chronologies show no coherence in high-frequency variations even for trees growing in close proximity. We assume differences in rooting depth as the main reason for the differing growth patterns and climate correlations of the two species under study. Our results indicate that under the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">project</span></strong>ed future climate scenarios, beech may suffer from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ing drought stress even on hydromorphic soils. Oak might be able to maintain a sufficient hydraulic status during summer droughts by reaching water in deeper soil strata with its root system. Wet phases with waterlogged soil conditions during spring or summer appear to have only a little direct influence on radial growth of both species.</p>

Polycystin 2 regulates mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, bioenergetics, and dynamics through mitofusin 2
<p>Mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) have an intimate functional relationship due to tethering proteins that bring their membranes in close (~30 nm) apposition. One function of this interorganellar junction is to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e the efficiency of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer into mitochondria, thus stimulating mitochondrial respiration. Here, we showed that the ER cation-permeant channel polycystin 2 (PC2) functions to reduce mitochondria-ER contacts. In cell culture models, PC2 knockdown led to a 50% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e in mitofusin 2 (MFN2) expression, an outer mitochondrial membrane GTPase. Live-cell super-resolution and electron microscopy analyses revealed enhanced MFN2-dependent tethering between the ER and mitochondria in PC2 knockdown cells. PC2 knockdown also led to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed ER-mediated mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, bioenergetic activation, and mitochondrial density. Mutation or deletion of the gene encoding for PC2 results in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), a condition characterized by numerous fluid-filled cysts. In cell culture models and mice with kidney-specific PC2 knockout, knockdown of MFN2 rescued defective mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer and diminished cell proliferation in kidney cysts. Consistent with these results, cyst-lining epithelial cells from human ADPKD kidneys had a twofold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e in mitochondria and MFN2 expression. Our data suggest that PC2 normally serves to limit key mitochondrial proteins at the ER-mitochondrial interface and acts as a checkpoint for mitochondrial biogenesis and bioenergetics. Loss of this regulation may contribute to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed oxidative metabolism and aberrant cell proliferation typical of kidney cysts in ADPKD.</p>

A role for corticotropin-releasing factor signaling in the lateral habenula and its modulation by early-life stress
<p>Centrally released corticotropin-releasing factor or hormone (extrahypothalamic CRF or CRH) in the brain is involved in the behavioral and emotional responses to stress. The lateral habenula (LHb) is an epithalamic brain region involved in value-based decision-making and stress evasion. Through its inhibition of dopamine-mediated reward circuitry, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed activity of the LHb is associated with addiction, depression, schizophrenia, and behavioral disorders. We found that extrahypothalamic CRF neurotransmission <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed neuronal excitability in the LHb. Through its receptor CRFR1 and subsequently protein kinase A (PKA), CRF application <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed the intrinsic excitability of LHb neurons by affecting changes in small-conductance SK-type and large-conductance BK-type K<sup>+</sup> channels. CRF also reduced inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid–containing (GABAergic) synaptic transmission onto LHb neurons through endocannabinoid-mediated retrograde signaling. Maternal deprivation is a severe early-life stress that alters CRF neural circuitry and is likewise associated with abnormal mental health later in life. LHb neurons from pups deprived of maternal care exhibited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed intrinsic excitability, reduced GABAergic transmission, decreased abundance of SK2 channel protein, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed activity of PKA, without any substantial changes in <i>Crh</i> or <i>Crhr1</i> expression. Furthermore, maternal deprivation blunted the response of LHb neurons to subsequent, acute CRF exposure.

The matricellular protein TSP1 promotes human and mouse endothelial cell senescence through CD47 and Nox1
<p>Senescent cells withdraw from the cell cycle and do not proliferate. The prevalence of senescent compared to normally functioning parenchymal cells <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>es with age, impairing tissue and organ homeostasis. A contentious principle governing this process has been the redox theory of aging. We linked matricellular protein thrombospondin 1 (TSP1) and its receptor CD47 to the activation of NADPH oxidase 1 (Nox1), but not of the other closely related Nox isoforms, and associated oxidative stress, and to senescence in human cells and aged tissue. In human endothelial cells, TSP1 promoted senescence and attenuated cell cycle progression and proliferation. At the molecular level, TSP1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed Nox1-dependent generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed abundance of the transcription factor p53. p53 mediated a DNA damage response that led to senescence through Rb and p21<sup>cip</sup>, both of which inhibit cell cycle progression.

Finally, genetic ablation or pharmacological blockade of Nox1 in human endothelial cells attenuated TSP1-mediated ROS generation, restored cell cycle progression, and protected against senescence. Together, our results provide insights into the functional interplay between TSP1 and Nox1 in the regulation of endothelial senescence and suggest potential targets for controlling the aging process at the molecular level.</p>

The transcription factor C/EBPβ in the dorsal root ganglion contributes to peripheral nerve trauma–induced nociceptive hypersensitivity

We report that peripheral nerve trauma caused by chronic constriction injury (CCI) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed the abundance of the transcription factor C/EBPβ (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β) in the DRG. Blocking this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e mitigated the development and maintenance of CCI-induced mechanical, thermal, and cold pain hypersensitivities without affecting basal responses to acute pain and locomotor activity. Conversely, mimicking this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e produced hypersensitivity to mechanical, thermal, or cold pain. In the ipsilateral DRG, C/EBPβ promoted a decrease in the abundance of the voltage-gated potassium channel subunit Kv1.2 and μ opioid receptor (MOR) at the mRNA and protein levels, which would be predicted to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e excitability in the ipsilateral DRG neurons and reduce the efficacy of morphine analgesia. These effects required C/EPBβ-mediated transcriptional activation of <i>Ehmt2</i> (euchromatic histone-lysine <i>N</i>-methyltransferase 2), which encodes G9a, an epigenetic silencer of the genes encoding Kv1.2 and MOR. Blocking the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e in C/EBPβ in the DRG improved morphine analgesia after CCI.

Climate model shows large-scale wind and solar farms in the Sahara increase rain and vegetation

Eutrophication will increase during the 21st century as a result of precipitation changes
<p>Eutrophication, or excessive nutrient enrichment, threatens water resources across the globe. We show that climate change–induced precipitation changes alone will substantially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e (19 ± 14%) riverine total nitrogen loading within the continental United States by the end of the century for the “business-as-usual” scenario. The impacts, driven by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">project</span></strong>ed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>es in both total and extreme precipitation, will be especially strong for the Northeast and the corn belt of the United States. Offsetting this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e would require a 33 ± 24% reduction in nitrogen inputs, representing a massive management challenge. Globally, changes in precipitation are especially likely to also exacerbate eutrophication in India, China, and Southeast Asia. It is therefore imperative that water quality management strategies account for the impact of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">project</span></strong>ed future changes in precipitation on nitrogen loading.</p>

iPTF16geu: A multiply imaged, gravitationally lensed type Ia supernova
<p>We report the discovery of a multiply imaged, gravitationally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lens</span></strong>ed type Ia supernova, iPTF16geu (SN 2016geu), at redshift <i>z</i> = 0.409. This phenomenon was identified because the light from the stellar explosion was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnifi</span></strong>ed more than 50 times by the curvature of space around matter in an intervening galaxy. We used high-spatial-resolution observations to resolve four images of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lens</span></strong>ed supernova, approximately 0.3 arc seconds from the center of the foreground galaxy. The observations probe a physical scale of ~1 kiloparsec, smaller than is typical in other studies of extragalactic gravitational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lens</span></strong>ing. The large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnifi</span></strong>cation and symmetric image configuration imply close alignment between the lines of sight to the supernova and to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lens</span></strong>. The relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnifi</span></strong>cations of the four images provide evidence for substructures in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lens</span></strong>ing galaxy.</p>

Light Acclimation of the Colonial Green Alga <i>Botryococcus braunii</i> Strain Showa
<p>In contrast to single cellular species, detailed information is lacking on the processes of photosynthetic acclimation for colonial algae, although these algae are important for biofuel production, ecosystem biodiversity, and wastewater treatment. To investigate differences between single cellular and colonial species, we studied the regulation of photosynthesis and photoprotection during photoacclimation for the colonial green alga <i>Botryococcus braunii</i> and made a comparison with the properties of the single cellular species <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>. We show that <i>B. braunii</i> shares some high-light (HL) photoacclimation strategies with <i>C. reinhardtii</i> and other frequently studied green algae: decreased chlorophyll content, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed free carotenoid content, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ). Additionally, <i>B. braunii</i> has unique HL photoacclimation strategies, related to its colonial form: strong internal shading by an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e of the colony size and the accumulation of extracellular echinenone (a ketocarotenoid). HL colonies are larger and more spatially heterogenous than low-light colonies. Compared with surface cells, cells deeper inside the colony have <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed pigmentation and larger photosystem II antenna size. The core of the largest of the HL colonies does not contain living cells. In contrast with <i>C. reinhardtii</i>, but similar to other biofilm-forming algae, NPQ capacity is substantial in low light. In HL, NPQ amplitude <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>es, but kinetics are unchanged. We discuss possible causes of the different acclimation responses of <i>C. reinhardtii</i> and <i>B. braunii</i>. Knowledge of the specific photoacclimation processes for this colonial green alga further extends the view of the diversity of photoacclimation strategies in photosynthetic organisms.</p>

Sugar Potentiation of Fatty Acid and Triacylglycerol Accumulation
<p>Photosynthetically derived sugar provides carbon skeletons for lipid biosynthesis. We used mutants of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and the expression of oleogenic factors to investigate relationships among sugar availability, lipid synthesis, and the accumulation of triacylglycerol (TAG) in leaf tissue. The <i>adg1</i> mutation disables the small subunit of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, the first step in starch synthesis, and the <i>suc2</i> mutation disables a sucrose/proton symporter that facilitates sucrose loading from leaves into phloem. The <i>adg1suc2</i> double mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>es glucose plus sucrose content in leaves 80-fold relative to the wild type, total fatty acid (FA) content 1.8-fold to 8.3% dry weight, and TAG more than 10-fold to 1.2% dry weight. The WRINKLED1 transcription factor also accumulates to higher levels in these leaves, and the rate of FA synthesis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>es by 58%. Adding <i>tt4</i>, which disables chalcone synthase, had little effect, but adding the <i>tgd1</i> mutation, which disables an importer of lipids into plastids to create <i>adg1suc2tt4tgd1</i>, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed total leaf FA to 13.5% dry weight and TAG to 3.8% dry weight, demonstrating a synergistic effect upon combining these mutations. Combining <i>adg1suc2</i> with the <i>sdp1</i> mutation, deficient in the predominant TAG lipase, had little effect on total FA content but <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed the TAG accumulation by 66% to 2% dry weight. Expression of the <i>WRINKLED1</i> transcription factor, along with <i>DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1</i> and the <i>OLEOSIN1</i> oil body-associated protein, in the <i>adg1suc2</i> mutant doubled leaf FA content and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed TAG content to 2.3% dry weight, a level 4.6-fold higher than that resulting from expression of the same factors in the wild type.</p>

Root Tip Shape Governs Root Elongation Rate under Increased Soil Strength
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed soil strength due to soil compaction or soil drying is a major limitation to root growth and crop productivity. Roots need to exert higher penetration force, resulting in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed penetration stress when elongating in soils of greater strength. This study aimed to quantify how the genotypic diversity of root tip geometry and root diameter influences root elongation under different levels of soil strength and to determine the extent to which roots adjust to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed soil strength. Fourteen wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) varieties were grown in soil columns packed to three bulk densities representing low, moderate, and high soil strength. Under moderate and high soil strength, smaller root tip radius-to-length ratio was correlated with higher genotypic root elongation rate, whereas root diameter was not related to genotypic root elongation. Based on cavity expansion theory, it was found that smaller root tip radius-to-length ratio reduced penetration stress, thus enabling higher root elongation rates in soils with greater strength. Furthermore, it was observed that roots could only partially adjust to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed soil strength. Root thickening was bounded by a maximum diameter, and root tips did not become more acute in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed soil strength. The obtained results demonstrated that root tip geometry is a pivotal trait governing root penetration stress and root elongation rate in soils of greater strength. Hence, root tip shape needs to be taken into account when selecting for crop varieties that may tolerate high soil strength.</p>

TATA Box Insertion Provides a Selection Mechanism Underpinning Adaptations to Fe Deficiency
<p>Intraspecific genetic variation is essential for the responses and adaption of plants to evolutionary challenges, such as changing environmental conditions. The development of the Earth’s aerobic atmosphere has <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed the demand for iron (Fe) in organisms, and Fe deficiency has become a limiting environmental factor for plant growth. Here, we demonstrate that genus <i>Malus</i> adapt to Fe deficiency through modification of the <i>Iron-Regulated Transporter1</i> (<i>IRT1</i>) promoter. Specifically, an <i>IRT1</i> mutant allele with a TATA-box insertion in the promoter region upstream of the coding region exhibited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed <i>IRT1</i> expression. The altered <i>IRT1</i> promoter is responsible for enhancing Fe uptake. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ing the number of synthetic repeat TATA-boxes correlates with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed promoter activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the insertion of the TATA-box correlates with an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e in transcriptional activation via specific binding of the transcription factor IID (MDP0000939369). Taken together, these results indicate that an allelic insertion of a TATA-box in a gene promoter has allowed apple to adapt to the selective pressure posed by Fe deficiency. More broadly, this study reveals a new mechanism for enhancing gene expression to help plants adapt to different environments, providing new insights into molecular genetic divergence in plants.</p>

Deep-diving sea lions exhibit extreme bradycardia in long-duration dives
<p>Heart rate and peripheral blood flow distribution are the primary determinants of the rate and pattern of oxygen store utilisation and ultimately breath-hold duration in marine endotherms. Despite this, little is known about how otariids (sea lions and fur seals) regulate heart rate (<i>f</i><sub>H</sub>) while diving. We investigated dive <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> in five adult female California sea lions (<i>Zalophus californianus</i>) during foraging trips by instrumenting them with digital electrocardiogram (ECG) loggers and time depth recorders. In all dives, dive <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> (number of beats/duration; 50±9 beats min<sup>−1</sup>) decreased compared with surface rates (113±5 beats min<sup>−1</sup>), with all dives exhibiting an instantaneous <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> below resting (<54 beats min<sup>−1</sup>) at some point during the dive. Both dive <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> and minimum instantaneous <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> significantly decreased with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ing dive duration. Typical instantaneous <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> profiles of deep dives (>100 m) consisted of: (1) an initial rapid decline in <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> resulting in the lowest instantaneous <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> of the dive at the end of descent, often below 10 beats min<sup>−1</sup> in dives longer than 6 min in duration; (2) a slight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e in <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> to ~10–40 beats min<sup>−1</sup> during the bottom portion of the dive; and (3) a gradual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e in <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> during ascent with a rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e prior to surfacing. Thus, <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> regulation in deep-diving sea lions is not simply a progressive bradycardia. Extreme bradycardia and the presumed associated reductions in pulmonary and peripheral blood flow during late descent of deep dives should (a) contribute to preservation of the lung oxygen store, (b) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e dependence of muscle on the myoglobin-bound oxygen store, (c) conserve the blood oxygen store and (d) help limit the absorption of nitrogen at depth. This <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> profile during deep dives of sea lions may be characteristic of deep-diving marine endotherms that dive on inspiration as similar <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> profiles have been recently documented in the emperor penguin, another deep diver that dives on inspiration.</p>

Physiological correlates of symbiont migration during bleaching of two octocoral species
<p>Perturbed colonies of <i>Phenganax parrini</i> and <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. exhibit migration of symbionts of <i>Symbiodinium</i> spp. into the stolons. Densitometry and visual inspection indicated that polyps bleached while stolons did not. When migration was triggered by temperature, light and confinement, colonies of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. decreased rates of oxygen formation in the light (due to the effects of perturbation on photosynthesis and respiration) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed rates of oxygen uptake in the dark (due to the effects of perturbation on respiration alone). Colonies of <i>P. parrini</i>, by contrast, showed no significant changes in either aspect of oxygen metabolism. When migration was triggered by light and confinement, colonies of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. showed decreased rates of oxygen formation in the light and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed rates of oxygen uptake in the dark, while colonies of <i>P. parrini</i> maintained the former and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed the latter. During symbiont migration into their stolons, colonies of both species showed dramatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>es in reactive oxygen species (ROS), as visualized with a fluorescent probe, with stolons of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. exhibiting a nearly immediate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e of ROS. Differences in symbiont type may explain the greater sensitivity of colonies of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. Using fluorescent probes, direct measurements of migrating symbionts in the stolons of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. showed higher levels of reactive nitrogen species and lower levels of ROS than the surrounding host tissue. As measured by native fluorescence, levels of NAD(P)H in the stolons were unaffected by perturbation. Symbiont migration thus correlates with dramatic physiological changes and may serve as a marker for coral condition.</p>

Mouse models of telomere dysfunction phenocopy skeletal changes found in human age-related osteoporosis
<p>A major medical challenge in the elderly is osteoporosis and the high risk of fracture. Telomere dysfunction is a cause of cellular senescence and telomere shortening, which occurs with age in cells from most human tissues, including bone. Telomere defects contribute to the pathogenesis of two progeroid disorders characterized by premature osteoporosis, Werner syndrome and dyskeratosis congenital. It is hypothesized that telomere shortening contributes to bone aging. We evaluated the skeletal phenotypes of mice with disrupted telomere maintenance mechanisms as models for human bone aging, including mutants in Werner helicase (<i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup></i>), telomerase (<i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i>) and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> double mutants. Compared with young wild-type (WT) mice, micro-computerized tomography analysis revealed that young <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> mice have decreased trabecular bone volume, trabecular number and trabecular thickness, as well as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed trabecular spacing. In cortical bone, young <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> mice have <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed cortical thinning, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed porosity relative to age-matched WT mice. These trabecular and cortical changes were accelerated with age in <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> mice compared with older WT mice. Histological quantification of osteoblasts in aged mice showed a similar number of osteoblasts in all genotypes; however, significant decreases in osteoid, mineralization surface, mineral apposition rate and bone formation rate in older <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> bone suggest that osteoblast dysfunction is a prominent feature of precocious aging in these mice. Except in the <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup></i> single mutant, osteoclast number did not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e in any genotype. Significant alterations in mechanical parameters (structure model index, degree of anistrophy and moment of inertia) of the <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> femurs compared with WT mice were also observed. Young <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> mice had a statistically significant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e in bone-marrow fat content compared with young WT mice, which remained elevated in aged double mutants. Taken together, our results suggest that <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> mutants recapitulate the human bone aging phenotype and are useful models for studying age-related osteoporosis.</p>

Human Plasma Thioredoxin-80 Increases With Age and in ApoE<sup>−/−</sup> Mice Induces Inflammation, Angiogenesis, and Atherosclerosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Thioredoxin (TRX)-1, a ubiquitous 12-kDa protein, exerts antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. In contrast, the truncated form, called TRX80, produced by macrophages induces upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines. TRX80 also promotes the differentiation of mouse peritoneal and human macrophages toward a proinflammatory M1 phenotype.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>TRX1 and TRX80 plasma levels were determined with a specific ELISA. A disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein (ADAM)-10, ADAM-17, and ADAM-10 activities were measured with SensoLyte 520 ADAM10 Activity Assay Kit, Fluorimetric, and InnoZyme TACE Activity Kit, respectively. Western immunoblots were performed with specific antibodies to ADAM-10 or ADAM-17. Angiogenesis study was evaluated in vitro with human microvascular endothelial cells-1 and in vivo with the Matrigel plug angiogenesis assay in mice. The expression of macrophage phenotype markers was investigated with real-time polymerase chain reaction. Phosphorylation of Akt, mechanistic target of rapamycin, and 70S6K was determined with specific antibodies. The effect of TRX80 on NLRP3 inflammasome activity was evaluated by measuring the level of interleukin-1β and -18 in the supernatants of activated macrophages with ELISA. Hearts were used for lesion surface evaluation and immunohistochemical studies, and whole descending aorta were stained with Oil Red O. For transgenic mice generation, the human scavenger receptor (SR-A) promoter/enhancer was used to drive macrophage-specific expression of human TRX80 in mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In this study, we observed a significant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e of plasma levels of TRX80 in old subjects compared with healthy young subjects. In parallel, an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e in expression and activity of ADAM-10 and ADAM-17 in old peripheral blood mononuclear cells compared with those of young subjects was observed. Furthermore, TRX80 was found to colocalize with tumor necrosis factor-α, a macrophage M1 marker, in human atherosclerotic plaque. In addition, TRX80 induced the expression of murine M1 macrophage markers through Akt2/mechanistic target of rapamycin–C1/70S6K pathway and activated the inflammasome NLRP3, leading to the release of interleukin-1β and -18, potent atherogenic cytokines. Moreover, TRX80 exerts a powerful angiogenic effect in both in vitro and in vivo mouse studies. Finally, transgenic mice that overexpress human TRX80 specifically in macrophages of apoE<sup>−/−</sup> mice have a significant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e of aortic atherosclerotic lesions.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>TRX80 showed an age-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e in human plasma. In mouse models, TRX80 was associated with a proinflammatory status and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed atherosclerosis.</p></sec>

Risk of Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction in Older Women After Contemporary Radiotherapy for Breast Cancer
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiomyocytes are resistant to radiation. However, cardiac radiation exposure causes coronary microvascular endothelial inflammation, a perturbation implicated in the pathogenesis of heart failure (HF) and particularly HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Radiotherapy for breast cancer results in variable cardiac radiation exposure and may <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e the risk of HF.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a population-based case-control study of incident HF in 170 female residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota (59 cases and 111 controls), who underwent contemporary (1998–2013) radiotherapy for breast cancer with computed tomography–assisted radiotherapy planning. Controls were matched to cases for age, tumor side, chemotherapy use, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. Mean cardiac radiation dose (MCRD) in each patient was calculated from the patient’s computed tomography images and radiotherapy plan.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Mean age at radiotherapy was 69±9 years. Of HF cases, 38 (64%) had EF≥50% (HFpEF), 18 (31%) had EF<50% (HF with reduced EF), and 3 (5%) did not have EF measured. The EF was ≥40% in 50 of the 56 HF cases (89%) with an EF measurement. The mean interval from radiotherapy to HF was 5.8±3.4 years. The odds of HF was higher in patients with a history of ischemic heart disease or atrial fibrillation. The MCRD was 2.5 Gy (range, 0.2–13.1 Gy) and higher in cases (3.3±2.7 Gy) than controls (2.1±2.0 Gy; <i>P</i>=0.004). The odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for HF per log MCRD was 9.1 (3.4–24.4) for any HF, 16.9 (3.9–73.7) for HFpEF, and 3.17 (0.8–13.0) for HF with reduced EF.

The main objective was to examine the association of bystander CPR with survival as time to advanced treatment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>es.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied 7623 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients between 2005 and 2011, identified through the nationwide Danish Cardiac Arrest Registry. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between time from 911 call to emergency medical service arrival (response time) and survival according to whether bystander CPR was provided (yes or no). Reported are 30-day survival chances with 95% bootstrap confidence intervals.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>With <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ing response times, adjusted 30-day survival chances decreased for both patients with bystander CPR and those without. However, the contrast between the survival chances of patients with versus without bystander CPR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed over time: within 5 minutes, 30-day survival was 14.5% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 12.8–16.4) versus 6.3% (95% CI: 5.1–7.6), corresponding to 2.3 times higher chances of survival associated with bystander CPR; within 10 minutes, 30-day survival chances were 6.7% (95% CI: 5.4–8.1) versus 2.2% (95% CI: 1.5–3.1), corresponding to 3.0 times higher chances of 30-day survival associated with bystander CPR. The contrast in 30-day survival became statistically insignificant when response time was >13 minutes (bystander CPR vs no bystander CPR: 3.7% [95% CI: 2.2–5.4] vs 1.5% [95% CI: 0.6–2.7]), but 30-day survival was still 2.5 times higher associated with bystander CPR.

Different Routes for Conifer- and Sinapaldehyde and Higher Saccharification upon Deficiency in the Dehydrogenase CAD1
<p>In the search for renewable energy sources, genetic engineering is a promising strategy to improve plant cell wall composition for biofuel and bioproducts generation. Lignin is a major factor determining saccharification efficiency and, therefore, is a prime target to engineer. Here, lignin content and composition were modified in poplar (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus alba</i>) by specifically down-regulating <i>CINNAMYL ALCOHOL DEHYDROGENASE1</i> (<i>CAD1</i>) by a hairpin-RNA-mediated silencing approach, which resulted in only 5% residual <i>CAD1</i> transcript abundance. These transgenic lines showed no biomass penalty despite a 10% reduction in Klason lignin content and severe shifts in lignin composition. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and thioacidolysis revealed a strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e (up to 20-fold) in sinapaldehyde incorporation into lignin, whereas coniferaldehyde was not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed markedly. Accordingly, ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based phenolic profiling revealed a more than 24,000-fold accumulation of a newly identified compound made from 8-8 coupling of two sinapaldehyde radicals. However, no additional cinnamaldehyde coupling products could be detected in the CAD1-deficient poplars. Instead, the transgenic lines accumulated a range of hydroxycinnamate-derived metabolites, of which the most prominent accumulation (over 8,500-fold) was observed for a compound that was identified by purification and nuclear magnetic resonance as syringyl lactic acid hexoside. Our data suggest that, upon down-regulation of <i>CAD1</i>, coniferaldehyde is converted into ferulic acid and derivatives, whereas sinapaldehyde is either oxidatively coupled into S′(8-8)S′ and lignin or converted to sinapic acid and derivatives. The most prominent sink of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed flux to hydroxycinnamates is syringyl lactic acid hexoside. Furthermore, low-extent saccharification assays, under different pretreatment conditions, showed strongly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed glucose (up to +81%) and xylose (up to +153%) release, suggesting that down-regulating <i>CAD1</i> is a promising strategy for improving lignocellulosic biomass for the sugar platform industry.</p>

Overexpression of the RieskeFeS Protein Increases Electron Transport Rates and Biomass Yield
<p>In this study, we generated transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants overexpressing the Rieske FeS protein (PetC), a component of the cytochrome <i>b<sub>6</sub>f</i> (cyt <i>b<sub>6</sub>f</i>) complex. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ing the levels of this protein resulted in concomitant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>es in the levels of cyt <i>f</i> (PetA) and cyt <i>b<sub>6</sub></i> (PetB), core proteins of the cyt <i>b<sub>6</sub>f</i> complex. Interestingly, an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e in the levels of proteins in both the photosystem I (PSI) and PSII complexes also was seen in the Rieske FeS overexpression plants. Although the mechanisms leading to these changes remain to be identified, the transgenic plants presented here provide novel tools to explore this. Importantly, overexpression of the Rieske FeS protein resulted in substantial and significant impacts on the quantum efficiency of PSI and PSII, electron transport, biomass, and seed yield in Arabidopsis plants. These results demonstrate the potential for manipulating electron transport processes to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e crop productivity.</p>

Two Acyltransferases Contribute Differently to Linolenic Acid Levels in Seed Oil
<p>Acyltransferases are key contributors to triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis and, thus, are of great importance for seed oil quality. The effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed or decreased expression of <i>ACYL-COENZYME A:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1</i> (<i>DGAT1</i>) or <i>PHOSPHOLIPID:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE</i> (<i>PDAT</i>) on seed lipid composition were assessed in several <i>Camelina sativa</i> lines. Furthermore, in vitro assays of acyltransferases in microsomal fractions prepared from developing seeds of some of these lines were performed. Decreased expression of <i>DGAT1</i> led to an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed percentage of 18:3<i>n</i>-3 without any change in total lipid content of the seed. The tri-18:3 TAG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e occurred predominantly in the cotyledon, as determined with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry, whereas species with two 18:3<i>n</i>-3 acyl groups were elevated in both cotyledon and embryonal axis. <i>PDAT</i> overexpression led to a relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e of 18:2<i>n</i>-6 at the expense of 18:3<i>n</i>-3, also without affecting the total lipid content. Differential distributions of TAG species also were observed in different parts of the seed. The microsomal assays revealed that <i>C.</i> <i>sativa</i> seeds have very high activity of diacylglycerol-phosphatidylcholine interconversion. The combination of analytical and biochemical data suggests that the higher 18:2<i>n</i>-6 content in the seed oil of the <i>PDAT</i> overexpressors is due to the channeling of fatty acids from phosphatidylcholine into TAG before being desaturated to 18:3<i>n</i>-3, caused by the high activity of PDAT in general and by PDAT specificity for 18:2<i>n</i>-6. The higher levels of 18:3<i>n</i>-3 in <i>DGAT1</i>-silencing lines are likely due to the compensatory activity of a TAG-synthesizing enzyme with specificity for this acyl group and more desaturation of acyl groups occurring on phosphatidylcholine.</p>

Impaired Cyclic Electron Flow around Photosystem I Disturbs High-Light Respiratory Metabolism
<p>The cyclic electron flow around photosystem I (CEF-PSI) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>es ATP/NADPH production in the chloroplast, acting as an energy balance mechanism. Higher export of reducing power from the chloroplast in CEF-PSI mutants has been correlated with higher mitochondrial alternative oxidase (AOX) capacity and protein amount under high-light (HL) conditions. However, in vivo measurements of AOX activity are still required to confirm the exact role of AOX in dissipating the excess of reductant power from the chloroplast. Here, CEF-PSI single and double mutants were exposed to short-term HL conditions in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Chlorophyll fluorescence, in vivo activities of the cytochrome oxidase (ν<sub>cyt</sub>) and AOX (ν<sub>alt</sub>) pathways, levels of mitochondrial proteins, metabolite profiles, and pyridine nucleotide levels were determined under normal growth and HL conditions. ν<sub>alt</sub> was not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed in CEF-PSI mutants, while AOX capacity was positively correlated with photoinhibition, probably due to a reactive oxygen species-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e of AOX protein. The severe metabolic impairment observed in CEF-PSI mutants, as indicated by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e in photoinhibition and changes in the levels of stress-related metabolites, can explain their lack of ν<sub>alt</sub> induction. By contrast, ν<sub>cyt</sub> was positively correlated with photosynthetic performance. Correlations with metabolite changes suggest that ν<sub>cyt</sub> is coordinated with sugar metabolism and stress-related amino acid synthesis. Furthermore, changes in glycine-serine and NADH-NAD<sup>+</sup> ratios were highly correlated to ν<sub>cyt</sub>. Taken together, our results suggest that ν<sub>cyt</sub> can act as a sink for the excess of electrons from the chloroplast, probably via photorespiratory glycine oxidation, thus improving photosynthetic performance when ν<sub>alt</sub> is not induced under severe HL stress.</p>

Evidence for Selection on Gene Expression in Cultivated Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>)
<p>Artificial selection has been used throughout plant domestication and breeding to develop crops that are adapted to diverse environments. Here, we investigate whether gene regulatory changes have been widespread targets of lineage-specific selection in cultivated lines Minghui 63 and Zhenshan 97 of rice, <i>Oryza sativa</i>. A line experiencing positive selection for either an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e or a decrease in genes' transcript abundances is expected to have an overabundance of expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) alleles that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e or decrease those genes' expression, respectively. Results indicate that several genes that share Gene Ontology terms or are members of the same coexpression module have eQTL alleles from one parent that consistently <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e gene expression relative to the second parent. A second line of evidence for lineage-specific selection is an overabundance of <i>cis–trans</i> pairs of eQTL alleles that affect gene expression in the same direction (are reinforcing). Across all <i>cis–trans</i> pairs of eQTL, including pairs that both weakly and strongly affect gene expression, there is no evidence for selection. However, the frequency of genes with reinforcing eQTL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>es with eQTL strength. Therefore, there is evidence that eQTL with strong effects were positively selected during rice cultivation. Among 41 <i>cis–trans</i> pairs with strong <i>trans</i> eQTL, 31 have reinforcing eQTL. Several of the candidate genes under positive selection accurately predict phenotypic differences between Minghui 63 and Zhenshan 97. Overall, our results suggest that positive selection for regulatory alleles may be a key factor in plant improvement.</p>

Changes in protein expression in the salt marsh mussel <i>Geukensia demissa</i>: evidence for a shift from anaerobic to aerobic metabolism during prolonged aerial exposure
<p>During aerial exposure (emersion), most sessile intertidal invertebrates experience cellular stress caused by hypoxia, and the amount and types of hypoxia-induced stress will differ as exposure time <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>es, likely leading to altered metabolic responses. We examined proteomic responses to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ing emersion times and decreasing recovery (immersion) times in the mussel <i>Geukensia demissa</i>, which occurs in salt marshes along the east coast of North America. Individuals are found above mean tide level, and can be emersed for over 18 h during spring tides. We acclimated mussels to full immersion at 15°C for 4 weeks, and compared changes in gill protein expression between groups of mussels that were continually immersed (control), were emersed for 6 h and immersed during recovery for 18 h (6E/18R), were emersed for 12 h and recovered for 12 h (12E/12R), or were emersed for 18 h with a 6 h recovery (18E/6R). We found clear differences in protein expression patterns among the treatments. Proteins associated with anaerobic fermentation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed in abundance in 6E/18R but not in 12E/12R or 18E/6R. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>es in oxidative stress proteins were most apparent in 12E/12R, and in 18E/6R changes in cytoskeletal protein expression predominated. We conclude that <i>G. demissa</i> alters its strategy for coping with emersion stress over time, relying on anaerobic metabolism for short- to medium-duration exposure, but switching to an air-gaping strategy for long-term exposure, which reduces hypoxia stress but may cause structural damage to gill tissue.</p>

Aperture effects in squid jet propulsion
<p>Squid are the largest jet propellers in nature as adults, but as paralarvae they are some of the smallest, faced with the inherent inefficiency of jet propulsion at a low Reynolds number. In this study we describe the behavior and kinematics of locomotion in 1 mm paralarvae of <i>Dosidicus gigas</i>, the smallest squid yet studied. They swim with hop-and-sink behavior and can engage in fast jets by reducing the size of the mantle aperture during the contraction phase of a jetting cycle. We go on to explore the general effects of a variable mantle and funnel aperture in a theoretical model of jet propulsion scaled from the smallest (1 mm mantle length) to the largest (3 m) squid. Aperture reduction during mantle contraction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>es propulsive efficiency at all squid sizes, although 1 mm squid still suffer from low efficiency (20%) because of a limited speed of contraction. Efficiency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>es to a peak of 40% for 1 cm squid, then slowly declines. Squid larger than 6 cm must either reduce contraction speed or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e aperture size to maintain stress within maximal muscle tolerance. Ecological pressure to maintain maximum velocity may lead them to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e aperture size, which reduces efficiency. This effect might be ameliorated by nonaxial flow during the refill phase of the cycle. Our model's predictions highlight areas for future empirical work, and emphasize the existence of complex behavioral options for maximizing efficiency at both very small and large sizes.</p>

The cost of muscle power production: muscle oxygen consumption per unit work increases at low temperatures in <i>Xenopus laevis</i>
<p>Metabolic energy (ATP) supply to muscle is essential to support activity and behaviour. It is expected, therefore, that there is strong selection to maximise muscle power output for a given rate of ATP use. However, the viscosity and stiffness of muscle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>es with a decrease in temperature, which means that more ATP may be required to achieve a given work output. Here, we tested the hypothesis that ATP use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>es at lower temperatures for a given power output in <i>Xenopus laevis.</i> To account for temperature variation at different time scales, we considered the interaction between acclimation for 4 weeks (to 15 or 25°C) and acute exposure to these temperatures. Cold-acclimated frogs had greater sprint speed at 15°C than warm-acclimated animals. However, acclimation temperature did not affect isolated gastrocnemius muscle biomechanics. Isolated muscle produced greater tetanus force, and faster isometric force generation and relaxation, and generated more work loop power at 25°C than at 15°C acute test temperature. Oxygen consumption of isolated muscle at rest did not change with test temperature, but oxygen consumption while muscle was performing work was significantly higher at 15°C than at 25°C, regardless of acclimation conditions. Muscle therefore consumed significantly more oxygen at 15°C for a given work output than at 25°C, and plastic responses did not modify this thermodynamic effect. The metabolic cost of muscle performance and activity therefore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed with a decrease in temperature. To maintain activity across a range of temperature, animals must <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>e ATP production or face an allocation trade-off at lower temperatures. Our data demonstrate the potential energetic benefits of warming up muscle before activity, which is seen in diverse groups of animals such as bees, which warm flight muscle before take-off, and humans performing warm ups before exercise.</p>

Load-induced changes in bone stiffness and cancellous and cortical bone mass following tibial compression diminish with age in female mice
<p>The vertebrate skeleton is an adaptive structure that responds to mechanical stimuli by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ing bone mass under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed mechanical loads. Although experimental animal models have shown the anabolic cortical bone response to applied load decreases with age, no consensus exists regarding whether this adaptive mechanism is affected by age in cancellous bone, the tissue most impacted by age-related bone loss. We used an established murine <i>in vivo</i> tibial loading model to characterize the load-induced cancellous, cortical and whole-bone responses to mechanical stimuli in growing and mature female mice at 6, 10 and 16 weeks of age. The effects of applied load on tibial morphology and stiffness were determined using microcomputed tomography and <i>in vivo</i> bone strains measured at the medial tibial midshaft during applied loading. At all ages, 2 weeks of applied load produced larger midshaft cortical cross-sectional properties (+13–72%) and greater cancellous bone volume (+21–107%) and thicker trabeculae (+31–68%) in the proximal metaphyses of the loaded tibiae. The relative anabolic response decreased from 6 to 16 weeks of age in both the cancellous and cortical envelopes. Load-induced tibial stresses decreased more in 6-week-old mice following loading, which corresponded to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed <i>in vivo</i> tibial stiffness. Stiffness in the loaded tibiae of 16-week-old mice decreased despite moderately <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">increas</span></strong>ed cortical cross-sectional geometry, suggesting load-induced changes in bone material properties. This study shows that the cancellous and cortical anabolic responses to mechanical stimuli decline with age into adulthood and that cortical cross-sectional geometry alone does not necessarily predict whole-bone functional stiffness.</p>

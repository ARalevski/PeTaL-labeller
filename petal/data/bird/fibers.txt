Low Water Potential and At14a-Like1 (AFL1) Effects on Endocytosis and Actin Filament Organization
<p>At14a-Like1 (AFL1) is a stress-induced protein of unknown function that promotes growth during low water potential stress and drought. Previous analysis indicated that AFL1 may have functions related to endocytosis and regulation of actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong> organization, processes for which the effects of low water potential are little known. We found that low water potential led to a decrease in endocytosis, as measured by uptake of the membrane-impermeable dye FM4-64. Ectopic expression of AFL1 reversed the decrease in FM4-64 uptake seen in wild type, while reduced AFL1 expression led to further inhibition of FM4-64 uptake. Increased AFL1 also made FM4-64 uptake less sensitive to the actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong> disruptor Latrunculin B (LatB). LatB decreased AFL1-Clathrin Light Chain colocalization, further indicating that effects of AFL1 on endocytosis may be related to actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong> organization or stability. Consistent with this hypothesis, ectopic AFL1 expression made actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong>s less sensitive to disruption by LatB or Cytochalasin D and led to increased actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong> skewness and decreased occupancy, indicative of more bundled actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong>s. This latter effect could be partially mimicked by the actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong> stabilizer Jasplakinolide (JASP). However, AFL1 did not substantially inhibit actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong> dynamics, indicating that AFL1 acts via a different mechanism than JASP-induced stabilization. AFL1 partially colocalized with actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong>s but not with microtubules, further indicating actin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong>–related function of AFL1. These data provide insight into endocytosis and actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong> responses to low water potential stress and demonstrate an involvement of AFL1 in these key cellular processes.</p>

RSL Class II Transcription Factors Guide the Nuclear Localization of RHL1 to Regulate Root Hair Development
<p>Root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong>s are important for absorption of nutrients and water from the rhizosphere. The Root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> Defective-Six Like (RSL) Class II family of transcription factors is expressed preferentially in root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong>s and has a conserved role in root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> development in land plants. We functionally characterized the seven members of the RSL Class II subfamily in the rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) genome. In root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong>s, six of these genes were preferentially expressed and four were strongly expressed. Phenotypic analysis of each mutant revealed that <i>Os07g39940</i> plays a major role in root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> formation, based on observations of a short root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> phenotype in those mutants. Overexpression (OX) for each of four family members in rice resulted in an increase in the density and length of root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong>s. These four members contain a transcription activation domain and are targeted to the nucleus. They interact with rice Root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong>less1 (OsRHL1), a key regulator of root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> development. When heterologously expressed in epidermal cells of <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaves, OsRHL1 was predominantly localized to the cytoplasm. When coexpressed with each of the four RSL Class II members, however, OsRLH1 was translocated to the nucleus. Transcriptome analysis using <i>Os07g39940-</i>OX plants revealed that 86 genes, including Class III peroxidases, were highly up-regulated. Furthermore, reactive oxygen species levels in the root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong>s were increased in <i>Os07g39940-</i>OX plants but were drastically reduced in the <i>os07g39940</i> and <i>rhl1</i> mutants. Our results demonstrate that RSL Class II members function as essential regulators of root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> development in rice.</p>

The Microtubule-Associated Protein MAP18 Affects ROP2 GTPase Activity during Root Hair Growth
<p>Establishment and maintenance of the polar site are important for root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> tip growth. We previously reported that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN18 (MAP18) functions in controlling the direction of pollen tube growth and root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> elongation. Additionally, the Rop GTPase ROP2 was reported as a positive regulator of both root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> initiation and tip growth in Arabidopsis. Both loss of function of <i>ROP2</i> and knockdown of <i>MAP18</i> lead to a decrease in root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> length, whereas overexpression of either <i>MAP18</i> or <i>ROP2</i> causes multiple tips or a branching <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> phenotype. However, it is unclear whether MAP18 and ROP2 coordinately regulate root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> growth. In this study, we demonstrate that MAP18 and ROP2 interact genetically and functionally. MAP18 interacts physically with ROP2 in vitro and in vivo and preferentially binds to the inactive form of the ROP2 protein. MAP18 promotes ROP2 activity during root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> tip growth. Further investigation revealed that MAP18 competes with RhoGTPase GDP DISSOCIATION INHIBITOR1/SUPERCENTIPEDE1 for binding to ROP2, in turn affecting the localization of active ROP2 in the plasma membrane of the root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> tip. These results reveal a novel function of MAP18 in the regulation of ROP2 activation during root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> growth.</p>

A mechanism for preventing asymmetric histone segregation onto replicating DNA strands
<p>How parental histone (H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> tetramers, the primary carriers of epigenetic modifications, are transferred onto leading and lagging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong>s of DNA replication forks for epigenetic inheritance remains elusive. Here we show that parental (H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> tetramers are assembled into nucleosomes onto both leading and lagging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong>s, with a slight preference for lagging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong>s. The lagging-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong> preference increases markedly in budding yeast cells lacking Dpb3 and Dpb4, two subunits of the leading <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong> DNA polymerase, Pol ε, owing to the impairment of parental (H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> transfer to leading <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong>s. Dpb3-Dpb4 binds H3-H4 in vitro and participates in the inheritance of heterochromatin. These results indicate that different proteins facilitate the transfer of parental (H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> onto leading versus lagging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong>s and that Dbp3-Dpb4 plays an important role in this poorly understood process.</p>

Diversification of Root Hair Development Genes in Vascular Plants
<p>The molecular genetic program for root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> development has been studied intensively in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). To understand the extent to which this program might operate in other plants, we conducted a large-scale comparative analysis of root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> development genes from diverse vascular plants, including eudicots, monocots, and a lycophyte. Combining phylogenetics and transcriptomics, we discovered conservation of a core set of root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> genes across all vascular plants, which may derive from an ancient program for unidirectional cell growth coopted for root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> development during vascular plant evolution. Interestingly, we also discovered preferential diversification in the structure and expression of root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> development genes, relative to other root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong>- and root-expressed genes, among these species. These differences enabled the definition of sets of genes and gene functions that were acquired or lost in specific lineages during vascular plant evolution. In particular, we found substantial divergence in the structure and expression of genes used for root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> patterning, suggesting that the Arabidopsis transcriptional regulatory mechanism is not shared by other species. To our knowledge, this study provides the first comprehensive view of gene expression in a single plant cell type across multiple species.</p>

Recovery of otoacoustic emissions after high-level noise exposure in the American bullfrog
<p>The American bullfrog (<i>Rana catesbeiana</i>) has an amphibian papilla (AP) that senses airborne, low-frequency sound and generates distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) similar to other vertebrate species. Although ranid frogs are typically found in noisy environments, the effects of noise on the AP have not been studied. First, we determined the noise levels that diminished DPOAE at 2<i>f</i><sub>1</sub>–<i>f</i><sub>2</sub> using an <i>f</i><sub>2</sub> stimulus level at 80 dB SPL and that also produced morphological damage of the sensory epithelium. Second, we compared DPOAE (2<i>f</i><sub>1</sub>–<i>f</i><sub>2</sub>) responses with histopathologic changes occurring in bullfrogs after noise exposure. Consistent morphological damage, such as fragmented <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> cells and missing bundles, as well as elimination of DPOAE responses were seen only after very high-level (>150 dB SPL) sound exposures. The morphological response of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> cells to noise differed along the mediolateral AP axis: medial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> cells were sensitive to noise and lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> cells were relatively insensitive to noise. Renewed or repaired <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> cells were not observed until 9 days post-exposure. Following noise exposure, DPOAE responses disappeared within 24 h and then recovered to normal pre-exposure levels within 3–4 days. Our results suggest that DPOAEs in the bullfrog are sensitive to the initial period of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> cell damage. After noise-induced damage, the bullfrog AP has functional recovery mechanisms that do not depend on substantial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> cell regeneration or repair. Thus, the bullfrog auditory system might serve as an interesting model for investigation of ways to prevent noise damage.</p>

Structures and operating principles of the replisome
<p>Visualization in atomic detail of the replisome that performs concerted leading– and lagging–DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong> synthesis at a replication fork has not been reported. Using bacteriophage T7 as a model system, we determined cryo–electron microscopy structures up to 3.2-angstroms resolution of helicase translocating along DNA and of helicase-polymerase-primase complexes engaging in synthesis of both DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong>s. Each domain of the spiral-shaped hexameric helicase translocates sequentially hand-over-hand along a single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong>ed DNA coil, akin to the way AAA+ ATPases (adenosine triphosphatases) unfold peptides. Two lagging-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong> polymerases are attached to the primase, ready for Okazaki fragment synthesis in tandem. A β <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong>pin from the leading-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong> polymerase separates two parental DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong>s into a T-shaped fork, thus enabling the closely coupled helicase to advance perpendicular to the downstream DNA duplex. These structures reveal the molecular organization and operating principles of a replisome.</p>

De novo design of self-assembling helical protein filaments
<p>We describe a general computational approach to designing self-assembling helical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong>s from monomeric proteins and use this approach to design proteins that assemble into micrometer-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong>s with a wide range of geometries in vivo and in vitro. Cryo–electron microscopy structures of six designs are close to the computational design models. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong> building blocks are idealized repeat proteins, and thus the diameter of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong>s can be systematically tuned by varying the number of repeat units. The assembly and disassembly of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong>s can be controlled by engineered anchor and capping units built from monomers lacking one of the interaction surfaces.

Hydrogen Sulfide Disturbs Actin Polymerization via <i>S</i>-Sulfhydration Resulting in Stunted Root Hair Growth
<p>Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) is an important signaling molecule in plants. Our previous report suggested that H<sub>2</sub>S signaling affects the actin cytoskeleton and root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> growth. However, the underlying mechanisms of its effects are not understood. <i>S</i>-Sulfhydration of proteins is regulated directly by H<sub>2</sub>S, which converts the thiol groups of cysteine (Cys) residues to persulfides and alters protein function. In this work, we studied the effects of <i>S</i>-sulfhydration on actin dynamics in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We generated transgenic plants overexpressing the H<sub>2</sub>S biosynthesis-related genes <i><sc>l</sc>-CYSTEINE DESULFHYDRASE</i> (<i>LCD</i>) and <i><sc>d</sc>-CYSTEINE DESULFHYDRASE</i> in the <i>O-acetylserine(thiol)lyase isoform a1</i> (<i>oasa1</i>) mutant and Columbia-0 backgrounds. The H<sub>2</sub>S content increased significantly in overexpressing <i>LCD</i>/<i>oasa1</i> plants. The density of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong>ous actin (F-actin) bundles and the F-actin/globular actin ratio decreased in overexpressing <i>LCD</i>/<i>oasa1</i> plants. <i>S</i>-Sulfhydration also was enhanced in overexpressing <i>LCD</i>/<i>oasa1</i> plants. An analysis of actin dynamics suggested that <i>S</i>-sulfhydration inhibited actin polymerization. We also found that ACTIN2 (ACT2) was <i>S</i>-sulfhydrated at Cys-287. Cys-287 is adjacent to the D-loop, which acts as a central region for hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions and stabilizes F-actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong>s. Overaccumulation of H<sub>2</sub>S caused the depolymerization of F-actin bundles and inhibited root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> growth. Introduction of <i>ACT2</i> carrying a Cys-287-to-Ser mutation into an <i>act2-1</i> mutant partially suppressed H<sub>2</sub>S-dependent inhibition of root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> growth. We conclude that H<sub>2</sub>S regulates actin dynamics and affects root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> growth.</p>

The Deubiquitinase OTU5 Regulates Root Responses to Phosphate Starvation
<p>Phosphorus, taken up by plants as inorganic phosphate (Pi), is an essential but often growth-limiting mineral nutrient for plants. As part of an orchestrated response to improve its acquisition, insufficient Pi supply triggers alterations in root architecture and epidermal cell morphogenesis. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants defective in the expression of the <i>OVARIAN TUMOR DOMAIN-CONTAINING DEUBIQUITINATING ENZYME5</i> (<i>OTU5</i>) exhibited a constitutive Pi deficiency root phenotype, comprising the formation of long and dense root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong>s and attenuated primary root growth. Quantitative protein profiling of <i>otu5</i> and wild-type roots using the isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification methodology revealed genotype- and Pi-dependent alterations in protein profiles. In <i>otu5</i> plants, Pi starvation caused a short-root-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> phenotype and decreased abundance of a suite of Pi-responsive root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong>-related proteins. Mutant plants also showed the accumulation of proteins involved in chromatin remodeling and altered distribution of reactive oxygen species along the root, which may be causative for the alterations in root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> morphogenesis. The root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> phenotype of <i>otu5</i> was synergistic to that of <i>actin-related protein6</i> (<i>arp6</i>), harboring a mutation in the SWR1 chromatin-remodeling complex. Genetic analysis of <i>otu5/arp6</i> double mutants suggests independent but functionally related roles of the two proteins in chromatin organization. The root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> phenotype of <i>otu5</i> is not caused by a general up-regulation of the Pi starvation response, indicating that OTU5 acts downstream of or interacts with Pi signaling. It is concluded that OTU5 is involved in the interpretation of environmental information, probably by altering chromatin organization and maintaining redox homeostasis.</p>

Auxin and ROP GTPase Signaling of Polar Nuclear Migration in Root Epidermal Hair Cells
<p>Polar nuclear migration is crucial during the development of diverse eukaryotes. In plants, root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> growth requires polar nuclear migration into the outgrowing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong>. However, knowledge about the dynamics and the regulatory mechanisms underlying nuclear movements in root epidermal cells remains limited. Here, we show that both auxin and Rho-of-Plant (ROP) signaling modulate polar nuclear position at the inner epidermal plasma membrane domain oriented to the cortical cells during cell elongation as well as subsequent polar nuclear movement to the outer domain into the emerging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> bulge in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Auxin signaling via the nuclear AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR7 (ARF7)/ARF19 and INDOLE ACETIC ACID7 pathway ensures correct nuclear placement toward the inner membrane domain. Moreover, precise inner nuclear placement relies on SPIKE1 Rho-GEF, SUPERCENTIPEDE1 Rho-GDI, and ACTIN7 (ACT7) function and to a lesser extent on VTI11 vacuolar SNARE activity. Strikingly, the directionality and/or velocity of outer polar nuclear migration into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> outgrowth along actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong>s also are ACT7 dependent, auxin sensitive, and regulated by ROP signaling. Thus, our findings provide a founding framework revealing auxin and ROP signaling of inner polar nuclear position with some contribution by vacuolar morphology and of actin-dependent outer polar nuclear migration in root epidermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> cells.</p>

Conserved Dynamics of Chloroplast Cytoskeletal FtsZ Proteins Across Photosynthetic Lineages
<p>The cytoskeletal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong>ing temperature-sensitive Z (FtsZ) ring is critical for cell division in bacteria and chloroplast division in photosynthetic eukaryotes. While bacterial FtsZ rings are composed of a single FtsZ, except in the basal glaucophytes, chloroplast division involves two heteropolymer-forming FtsZ isoforms: FtsZ1 and FtsZ2 in the green lineage and FtsZA and FtsZB in red algae. FtsZ1 and FtsZB probably arose by duplication of the more ancestral FtsZ2 and FtsZA, respectively. We expressed fluorescent fusions of FtsZ from diverse photosynthetic organisms in a heterologous system to compare their intrinsic assembly and dynamic properties. FtsZ2 and FtsZA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong>s were morphologically distinct from FtsZ1 and FtsZB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong>s. When coexpressed, FtsZ pairs from plants and algae colocalized, consistent with heteropolymerization. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments demonstrated that subunit exchange was greater from FtsZ1 and FtsZB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong>s than from FtsZ2 and FtsZA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong>s and that FtsZ1 and FtsZB increased turnover of FtsZ2 and FtsZA, respectively, from heteropolymers. GTPase activity was essential only for turnover of FtsZ2 and FtsZA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong>s. Cyanobacterial and glaucophyte FtsZ properties mostly resembled those of FtsZ2 and FtsZA, though the glaucophyte protein exhibited some hybrid features. Our results demonstrate that the more ancestral FtsZ2 and FtsZA have retained functional attributes of their common FtsZ ancestor, while eukaryotic-specific FtsZ1 and FtsZB acquired new but similar dynamic properties, possibly through convergent evolution. Our findings suggest that the evolution of a second FtsZ that could copolymerize with the more ancestral form to enhance FtsZ-ring dynamics may have been essential for plastid evolution in the green and red photosynthetic lineages.</p>

ABA Suppresses Root Hair Growth via the OBP4 Transcriptional Regulator
<p>Plants modify organ growth and tune morphogenesis in response to various endogenous and environmental cues. At the cellular level, organ growth is often adjusted by alterations in cell growth, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this control remain poorly understood. In this study, we identify the DNA BINDING WITH ONE FINGER (DOF)-type transcription regulator OBF BINDING PROTEIN4 (OBP4) as a repressor of cell growth. Ectopic expression of <i>OBP4</i> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) inhibits cell growth, resulting in severe dwarfism and the repression of genes involved in the regulation of water transport, root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> development, and stress responses. Among the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors known to control root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> growth, OBP4 binds the <i>ROOT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> DEFECTIVE6-LIKE2</i> (<i>RSL2</i>) promoter to repress its expression. The accumulation of OBP4 proteins is detected in expanding root epidermal cells, and its expression level is increased by the application of abscisic acid (ABA) at concentrations sufficient to inhibit root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> growth. ABA-dependent induction of <i>OBP4</i> is associated with the reduced expression of <i>RSL2</i>. Furthermore, ectopic expression of <i>OBP4</i> or loss of <i>RSL2</i> function results in ABA-insensitive root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> growth. Taken together, our results suggest that OBP4-mediated transcriptional repression of <i>RSL2</i> contributes to the ABA-dependent inhibition of root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> growth in Arabidopsis.</p>

Recursive Paleohexaploidization Shaped the Durian Genome
<p>The durian (<i>Durio zibethinus</i>) genome has recently become available, and analysis of this genome reveals two paleopolyploidization events previously inferred as shared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cotton</span></strong> (<i>Gossypium</i> spp.). Here, we reanalyzed the durian genome in comparison with other well-characterized genomes. We found that durian and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cotton</span></strong> were actually affected by different polyploidization events: hexaploidization in durian ∼19–21 million years ago (mya) and decaploidization in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cotton</span></strong> ∼13–14 mya. Previous interpretations of shared polyploidization events may have resulted from the elevated evolutionary rates in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cotton</span></strong> genes due to the decaploidization and insufficient consideration of the complexity of plant genomes. The decaploidization elevated evolutionary rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cotton</span></strong> genes by ∼64% compared to durian and explained a previous ∼4-fold over dating of the event. In contrast, the hexaploidization in durian did not prominently elevate gene evolutionary rates, likely due to its long generation time. Moreover, divergent evolutionary rates probably explain 98.4% of reconstructed phylogenetic trees of homologous genes being incongruent with expected topology. The findings provide further insight into the roles played by polypoidization in the evolution of genomes and genes, and they suggest revisiting existing reconstructed phylogenetic trees.</p>

Identification of Functional Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms Affecting Leaf Hair Number in <i>Brassica rapa</i>
<p>Leaf traits affect plant agronomic performance; for example, leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> number provides a morphological indicator of drought and insect resistance. <i>Brassica rapa</i> crops have diverse phenotypes, and many <i>B. rapa</i> single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified and used as molecular markers for plant breeding. However, which SNPs are functional for leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> traits and, therefore, effective for breeding purposes remains unknown. Here, we identify a set of SNPs in the <i>B. rapa</i> ssp. <i>pekinenesis</i> candidate gene <i>Brp<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong>Y LEAVES1</i> (<i>BrpHL1</i>) and a number of SNPs of <i>BrpHL1</i> in a natural population of 210 <i>B. rapa</i> accessions that have <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong>y, margin-only <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong>y, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong>less leaves. <i>BrpHL1</i> genes and their orthologs and paralogs have many SNPs. By intensive mutagenesis and genetic transformation, we selected the functional SNPs for leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong>s by the exclusion of nonfunctional SNPs and the orthologous and paralogous genes. The residue tryptophan-92 of BrpHL1a was essential for direct interaction with GLABROUS3 and, thus, necessary for the formation of leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong>s. The accessions with the functional SNP leading to substitution of the tryptophan-92 residue had <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong>less leaves. The orthologous <i>BrcHL1b</i> from <i>B. rapa</i> ssp. <i>chinensis</i> regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> formation on leaf margins rather than leaf surfaces. The selected SNP for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong>y phenotype could be adopted as a molecular marker for insect resistance in <i>Brassica</i> spp. crops. Moreover, the procedures optimized here can be used to explain the molecular mechanisms of natural variation and to facilitate the molecular breeding of many crops.</p>

Laccase GhLac1 Modulates Broad-Spectrum Biotic Stress Tolerance via Manipulating Phenylpropanoid Pathway and Jasmonic Acid Synthesis
<p>Plants are constantly challenged by a multitude of pathogens and pests, which causes massive yield and quality losses annually. A promising approach to reduce such losses is to enhance the immune system of plants through genetic engineering. Previous work has shown that laccases (p-diphenol:dioxygen oxidoreductase, EC 1.10.3.2) function as lignin polymerization enzymes. Here we demonstrate that transgenic manipulation of the expression of the laccase gene <i>GhLac1</i> in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cotton</span></strong> (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>) can confer an enhanced defense response to both pathogens and pests. Overexpression of <i>GhLac1</i> leads to increased lignification, associated with increased tolerance to the fungal pathogen <i>Verticillium dahliae</i> and to the insect pests <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cotton</span></strong> bollworm (<i>Helicoverpa armigera</i>) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cotton</span></strong> aphid (<i>Aphis gosypii</i>). Suppression of <i>GhLac1</i> expression leads to a redirection of metabolic flux in the phenylpropanoid pathway, causing the accumulation of JA and secondary metabolites that confer resistance to <i>V. dahliae</i> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cotton</span></strong> bollworm; it also leads to increased susceptibility to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cotton</span></strong> aphid. Plant laccases therefore provide a new molecular tool to engineer pest and pathogen resistance in crops.</p>

Biological fabrication of cellulose fibers with tailored properties

This yields fibers with unnatural properties such as fluorescence or magnetism. Combining biological systems with the appropriate molecular design offers numerous possibilities to grow functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">composite materi</span></strong>als and implements a material-farming concept.</p>

Harvesting electrical energy from carbon nanotube yarn twist
<p>Mechanical energy harvesters are needed for diverse applications, including self-powered wireless sensors, structural and human health monitoring systems, and the extraction of energy from ocean waves.

ALY RNA-Binding Proteins Are Required for Nucleocytosolic mRNA Transport and Modulate Plant Growth and Development
<p>The regulated transport of mRNAs from the cell nucleus to the cytosol is a critical step linking transcript synthesis and processing with translation. However, in plants, only a few of the factors that act in the mRNA export pathway have been functionally characterized. Flowering plant genomes encode several members of the ALY protein family, which function as mRNA export factors in other organisms. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) ALY1 to ALY4 are commonly detected in root and leaf cells, but they are differentially expressed in reproductive tissue. Moreover, the subnuclear distribution of ALY1/2 differs from that of ALY3/4. ALY1 binds with higher affinity to single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong>ed RNA than double-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong>ed RNA and single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong>ed DNA and interacts preferentially with 5-methylcytosine-modified single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong>ed RNA. Compared with the full-length protein, the individual RNA recognition motif of ALY1 binds RNA only weakly. ALY proteins interact with the RNA helicase UAP56, indicating a link to the mRNA export machinery. Consistently, ALY1 complements the lethal phenotype of yeast cells lacking the ALY1 ortholog Yra1. Whereas individual <i>aly</i> mutants have a wild-type appearance, disruption of <i>ALY1</i> to <i>ALY4</i> in <i>4xaly</i> plants causes vegetative and reproductive defects, including strongly reduced growth, altered flower morphology, as well as abnormal ovules and female gametophytes, causing reduced seed production. Moreover, polyadenylated mRNAs accumulate in the nuclei of <i>4xaly</i> cells. Our results highlight the requirement of efficient mRNA nucleocytosolic transport for proper plant growth and development and indicate that ALY1 to ALY4 act partly redundantly in this process; however, differences in expression and subnuclear localization suggest distinct functions.</p>

Deubiquitinating Enzyme OTU5 Contributes to DNA Methylation Patterns and Is Critical for Phosphate Nutrition Signals
<p>Phosphate (Pi) starvation induces a suite of adaptive responses aimed at recalibrating cellular Pi homeostasis. Plants harboring a mutation in <i>OVARIAN TUMOR DOMAIN-CONTAINING DEUBIQUITINATING ENZYME5</i> (<i>OTU5</i>) showed altered DNA methylation of root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong>-related genes and altered Pi-responsive root traits. Unlike the wild type, homozygous <i>otu5</i> mutants did not respond to Pi starvation by increased lateral root formation and increased root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> length but formed very short root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong>s when grown on low-Pi media. Under Pi-replete conditions, <i>otu5</i> plants developed more root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong>s than the wild type due to attenuated primary root growth, a phenotype that resembled that of Pi-deficient plants. Growth of plants on low-Pi media altered both H3K4 and H3K27 trimethylation levels at the transcriptional start site of a subset of genes encoding key players in Pi homeostasis, which was correlated with mRNA abundance changes of these genes. Pi starvation had a minor impact on DNA methylation. Differentially methylated regions were enriched in transposable elements, suggesting that DNA methylation associated with low Pi supply is required for maintaining genome integrity. It is concluded that DNA methylation and histone methylation constitute critical, interdependent regulatory components that orchestrate the activity of a subset of Pi-responsive genes.</p>

A Comprehensively Curated Genome-Scale Two-Cell Model for the Heterocystous Cyanobacterium <i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120
<p><i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120 is a nitrogen-fixing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong>ous cyanobacterium. Under nitrogen-limiting conditions, a fraction of the vegetative cells in each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong> terminally differentiate to nongrowing heterocysts. Heterocysts are metabolically and structurally specialized to enable O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive nitrogen fixation. The functionality of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong>, as an association of vegetative cells and heterocysts, is postulated to depend on metabolic exchange of electrons, carbon, and fixed nitrogen. In this study, we compile and evaluate a comprehensive curated stoichiometric model of this two-cell system, with the objective function based on the growth of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong> under diazotrophic conditions. The predicted growth rate under nitrogen-replete and -deplete conditions, as well as the effect of external carbon and nitrogen sources, was thereafter verified. Furthermore, the model was utilized to comprehensively evaluate the optimality of putative metabolic exchange reactions between heterocysts and vegetative cells. The model suggested that optimal growth requires at least four exchange metabolites. Several combinations of exchange metabolites resulted in predicted growth rates that are higher than growth rates achieved by only considering exchange of metabolites previously suggested in the literature. The curated model of the metabolic network of <i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120 enhances our ability to understand the metabolic organization of multicellular cyanobacteria and provides a platform for further study and engineering of their metabolism.</p>

Dynamic gating of infrared radiation in a textile
<p>The human body absorbs and loses heat largely through infrared radiation centering around a wavelength of 10 micrometers. However, neither our skin nor the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">textil</span></strong>es that make up clothing are capable of dynamically controlling this optical channel for thermal management. By coating triacetate-cellulose bimorph fibers with a thin layer of carbon nanotubes, we effectively modulated the infrared radiation by more than 35% as the relative humidity of the underlying skin changed. Both experiments and modeling suggest that this dynamic infrared gating effect mainly arises from distance-dependent electromagnetic coupling between neighboring coated fibers in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">textil</span></strong>e <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yarn</span></strong>s. This effect opens a pathway for developing wearable localized thermal management systems that are autonomous and self-powered, as well as expanding our ability to adapt to demanding environments.</p>

Functionally diverse type V CRISPR-Cas systems
<p>Type V CRISPR-Cas systems are distinguished by a single RNA-guided RuvC domain-containing effector, Cas12. Although effectors of subtypes V-A (Cas12a) and V-B (Cas12b) have been studied in detail, the distinct domain architectures and diverged RuvC sequences of uncharacterized Cas12 proteins suggest unexplored functional diversity. Here, we identify and characterize Cas12c, -g, -h, and -i. Cas12c, -h, and -i demonstrate RNA-guided double-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong>ed DNA (dsDNA) interference activity. Cas12i exhibits markedly different efficiencies of CRISPR RNA spacer complementary and noncomplementary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong> cleavage resulting in predominant dsDNA nicking.

MCM2 promotes symmetric inheritance of modified histones during DNA replication
<p>During genome replication, parental histones are recycled to newly replicated DNA with their posttranslational modifications (PTMs). Whether sister chromatids inherit modified histones evenly remains unknown. We measured histone PTM partition to sister chromatids in embryonic stem cells. We found that parental histones H3-H4 segregate to both daughter DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong>s with a weak leading-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong> bias, skewing partition at topologically associating domain (TAD) borders and enhancers proximal to replication initiation zones. Segregation of parental histones to the leading <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong> increased markedly in cells with histone-binding mutations in MCM2, part of the replicative helicase, exacerbating histone PTM sister chromatid asymmetry. This work reveals how histones are inherited to sister chromatids and identifies a mechanism by which the replication machinery ensures symmetric cell division.</p>

Ribonucleotide incorporation enables repair of chromosome breaks by nonhomologous end joining
<p>The nonhomologous end–joining (NHEJ) pathway preserves genome stability by ligating the ends of broken chromosomes together. It employs end-processing enzymes, including polymerases, to prepare ends for ligation. We show that two such polymerases incorporate primarily ribonucleotides during NHEJ—an exception to the central dogma of molecular biology—both during repair of chromosome breaks made by Cas9 and during V(D)J recombination. Moreover, additions of ribonucleotides but not deoxynucleotides effectively promote ligation. Repair kinetics suggest that ribonucleotide-dependent first-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong> ligation is followed by complementary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong> repair with deoxynucleotides, then by replacement of ribonucleotides embedded in the first <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong> with deoxynucleotides. Our results indicate that as much as 65% of cellular NHEJ products have transiently embedded ribonucleotides, which promote flexibility in repair at the cost of more fragile intermediates.</p>

Structure basis for RNA-guided DNA degradation by Cascade and Cas3
<p>Type I CRISPR-Cas system features a sequential target-searching and degradation process on double-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong>ed DNA by the RNA-guided Cascade (CRISPR associated complex for antiviral defense) complex and the nuclease-helicase fusion enzyme Cas3, respectively. Here, we present a 3.7-angstrom-resolution cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the Type I-E Cascade/R-loop/Cas3 complex, poised to initiate DNA degradation. Cas3 distinguishes Cascade conformations and only captures the R-loop–forming Cascade, to avoid cleaving partially complementary targets. Its nuclease domain recruits the nontarget <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong> (NTS) DNA at a bulged region for the nicking of single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong>ed DNA. An additional 4.7-angstrom-resolution cryo-EM structure captures the postnicking state, in which the severed NTS retracts to the helicase entrance, to be threaded for adenosine 5′-triphosphate–dependent processive degradation. These snapshots form the basis for understanding RNA-guided DNA degradation in Type I-E CRISPR-Cas systems.</p>

CRISPR-Cas12a target binding unleashes indiscriminate single-stranded DNase activity
<p>CRISPR-Cas12a (Cpf1) proteins are RNA-guided enzymes that bind and cut DNA as components of bacterial adaptive immune systems. Like CRISPR-Cas9, Cas12a has been harnessed for genome editing on the basis of its ability to generate targeted, double-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong>ed DNA breaks. Here we show that RNA-guided DNA binding unleashes indiscriminate single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong>ed DNA (ssDNA) cleavage activity by Cas12a that completely degrades ssDNA molecules. We find that target-activated, nonspecific single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong>ed deoxyribonuclease (ssDNase) cleavage is also a property of other type V CRISPR-Cas12 enzymes. By combining Cas12a ssDNase activation with isothermal amplification, we create a method termed DNA endonuclease-targeted CRISPR trans reporter (DETECTR), which achieves attomolar sensitivity for DNA detection. DETECTR enables rapid and specific detection of human papillomavirus in patient samples, thereby providing a simple platform for molecular diagnostics.</p>

<p>Self-folding of an information-carrying polymer into a defined structure is foundational to biology and offers attractive potential as a synthetic strategy.

We describe a framework to design and synthesize a single DNA or RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong> to self-fold into a complex yet unknotted structure that approximates an arbitrary user-prescribed shape.

Regeneration of fat cells from myofibroblasts during wound healing
<p>Although regeneration through the reprogramming of one cell lineage to another occurs in fish and amphibians, it has not been observed in mammals. We discovered in the mouse that during wound healing, adipocytes regenerate from myofibroblasts, a cell type thought to be differentiated and nonadipogenic. Myofibroblast reprogramming required neogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> follicles, which triggered bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling and then activation of adipocyte transcription factors expressed during development. Overexpression of the BMP antagonist Noggin in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> follicles or deletion of the BMP receptor in myofibroblasts prevented adipocyte formation. Adipocytes formed from human keloid fibroblasts either when treated with BMP or when placed with human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> follicles in vitro<i>.</i> Thus, we identify the myofibroblast as a plastic cell type that may be manipulated to treat scars in humans.</p>

RPA binds histone H3-H4 and functions in DNA replication–coupled nucleosome assembly
<p>DNA replication–coupled nucleosome assembly is essential to maintain genome integrity and retain epigenetic information. Multiple involved histone chaperones have been identified, but how nucleosome assembly is coupled to DNA replication remains elusive. Here we show that replication protein A (RPA), an essential replisome component that binds single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong>ed DNA, has a role in replication-coupled nucleosome assembly. RPA directly binds free H3-H4. Assays using a synthetic sequence that mimics freshly unwound single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong>ed DNA at replication fork showed that RPA promotes DNA-(H3-H4) complex formation immediately adjacent to double-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong>ed DNA. Further, an RPA mutant defective in H3-H4 binding exhibited attenuated nucleosome assembly on nascent chromatin. Thus, we propose that RPA functions as a platform for targeting histone deposition to replication fork, through which RPA couples nucleosome assembly with ongoing DNA replication.</p>

The Largest Subunit of DNA Polymerase Delta Is Required for Normal Formation of Meiotic Type I Crossovers
<p>Meiotic recombination contributes to the maintenance of the association between homologous chromosomes (homologs) and ensures the accurate segregation of homologs during anaphase I, thus facilitating the redistribution of alleles among progeny. Meiotic recombination is initiated by the programmed formation of DNA double <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong> breaks, the repair of which requires DNA synthesis, but the role of DNA synthesis proteins during meiosis is largely unknown. Here, we hypothesized that the lagging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong>-specific DNA Polymerase δ (POL δ) might be required for meiotic recombination, based on a previous analysis of DNA Replication Factor1 that suggested a role for lagging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong> synthesis in meiotic recombination. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), complete mutation of the catalytic subunit of POL δ, encoded by <i>AtPOLD1</i>, leads to embryo lethality. Therefore, we used a meiocyte-specific knockdown strategy to test this hypothesis. Reduced expression of <i>AtPOLD1</i> in meiocytes caused decreased fertility and meiotic defects, including incomplete synapsis, the formation of multivalents, chromosome fragmentation, and improper segregation. Analysis of meiotic crossover (CO) frequencies showed that <i>AtPOLD1<sup>RNAi</sup></i> plants had significantly fewer interference-sensitive COs than the wild type, indicating that AtPOL δ participates in type I CO formation. <i>AtPOLD1<sup>RNAi</sup> atpol2a</i> double mutant meiocytes displayed more severe meiotic phenotypes than those of either single mutant, suggesting that the function of AtPOLD1 and AtPOL2A is not identical in meiotic recombination. Given that POL δ is highly conserved among eukaryotes, we hypothesize that the described role of POL δ here in meiotic recombination likely exists widely in eukaryotes.</p>

ANGUSTIFOLIA Regulates Actin Filament Alignment for Nuclear Positioning in Leaves
<p>During dark adaptation, plant nuclei move centripetally toward the midplane of the leaf blade; thus, the nuclei on both the adaxial and abaxial sides become positioned at the inner periclinal walls of cells. This centripetal nuclear positioning implies that a characteristic cell polarity exists within a leaf, but little is known about the mechanism underlying this process. Here, we show that ANGUSTIFOLIA (AN) and ACTIN7 regulate centripetal nuclear positioning in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves. Two mutants defective in the positioning of nuclei in the dark were isolated and designated as <i>unusual nuclear positioning1</i> (<i>unp1</i>) and <i>unp2</i>. In the dark, nuclei of <i>unp1</i> were positioned at the anticlinal walls of adaxial and abaxial mesophyll cells and abaxial pavement cells, whereas the nuclei of <i>unp2</i> were positioned at the anticlinal walls of mesophyll and pavement cells on both the adaxial and abaxial sides. <i>unp1</i> was caused by a dominant-negative mutation in <i>ACTIN7</i>, and <i>unp2</i> resulted from a recessive mutation in <i>AN</i>. Actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong>s in <i>unp1</i> were fragmented and reduced in number, which led to pleiotropic defects in nuclear morphology, cytoplasmic streaming, and plant growth. The mutation in <i>AN</i> caused aberrant positioning of nuclei-associated actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong>s at the anticlinal walls. AN was detected in the cytosol, where it interacted physically with plant-specific dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinases (DYRKPs) and itself. The DYRK inhibitor (1<i>Z</i>)-1-(3-ethyl-5-hydroxy-2(3<i>H</i>)-benzothiazolylidene)-2-propanone significantly inhibited dark-induced nuclear positioning. Collectively, these results suggest that the AN-DYRKP complex regulates the alignment of actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong>s during centripetal nuclear positioning in leaf cells.</p>

A Pectin Methylesterase Inhibitor Enhances Resistance to <i>Verticillium</i> Wilt
<p>Pectins are major components of the primary plant cell wall, which functions as the primary barrier against pathogens. Pectin methylesterases (PMEs) catalyze the demethylesterification of the homogalacturonan domains of pectin in the plant cell wall. Their activity is regulated by PME inhibitors (PMEIs). Here, we provide evidence that the pectin methylesterase-inhibiting protein GhPMEI3 from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cotton</span></strong> (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>) functions in plant responses to infection by the fungus <i>Verticillium dahliae</i>. GhPMEI3 interacts with PMEs and regulates the expression of a specific fungal polygalacturonase (VdPG1). Ectopic expression of GhPMEI3 increased pectin methyl esterification and limited fungal disease in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cotton</span></strong>, while also modulating root elongation. Enzymatic analyses revealed that GhPMEI3 efficiently inhibited the activity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cotton</span></strong> GhPME2/GhPME31. Experiments using transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants expressing the <i>GhPMEI3</i> gene under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter revealed that GhPMEI3 inhibits the endogenous PME activity in vitro. Moreover, the enhanced resistance to <i>V. dahliae</i> was associated with altered <i>VdPG1</i> expression. Virus-induced silencing of <i>GhPMEI3</i> resulted in increased susceptibility to <i>V. dahliae</i>. Further, we investigated the interaction between GhPMEI3 and GhPME2/GhPME31 using inhibition assays and molecular docking simulations. The peculiar structural features of GhPMEI3 were responsible for the formation of a 1:1 stoichiometric complex with GhPME2/GhPME31. Together, these results suggest that GhPMEI3 enhances resistance to <i>Verticillium</i> wilt. Moreover, GhPMEI3-GhPMEs interactions would be needed before drawing the correlation between structure-function and are crucial for plant development against the ever-evolving fungal pathogens.</p>

SCYL2 Genes Are Involved in Clathrin-Mediated Vesicle Trafficking and Essential for Plant Growth
<p>Protein transport between organelles is an essential process in all eukaryotic cells and is mediated by the regulation of processes such as vesicle formation, transport, docking, and fusion. In animals, SCY1-LIKE2 (SCYL2) binds to clathrin and has been shown to play roles in trans-Golgi network-mediated clathrin-coated vesicle trafficking. Here, we demonstrate that SCYL2A and SCYL2B, which are Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) homologs of animal SCYL2, are vital for plant cell growth and root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> development. Studies of the SCYL2 isoforms using multiple single or double loss-of-function alleles show that SCYL2B is involved in root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> development and that SCYL2A and SCYL2B are essential for plant growth and development and act redundantly in those processes. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and a β-glucuronidase-aided promoter assay show that <i>SCYL2A</i> and <i>SCYL2B</i> are differentially expressed in various tissues. We also show that SCYL2 proteins localize to the Golgi, trans-Golgi network, and prevacuolar compartment and colocalize with Clathrin Heavy Chain1 (CHC1). Furthermore, bimolecular fluorescence complementation and coimmunoprecipitation data show that SCYL2B interacts with CHC1 and two Soluble NSF Attachment Protein Receptors (SNAREs): Vesicle Transport through t-SNARE Interaction11 (VTI11) and VTI12. Finally, we present evidence that the root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> tip localization of Cellulose Synthase-Like D3 is dependent on SCYL2B. These findings suggest the role of SCYL2 genes in plant cell developmental processes via clathrin-mediated vesicle membrane trafficking.</p>

We present the first study of the design, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fabric</span></strong>ation and hydrodynamic testing of a synthetic, flexible, shark skin membrane. A three-dimensional (3D) model of shark skin denticles was constructed using micro-CT imaging of the skin of the shortfin mako (<i>Isurus oxyrinchus</i>). Using 3D printing, thousands of rigid synthetic shark denticles were placed on flexible membranes in a controlled, linear-arrayed pattern. This flexible 3D printed shark skin model was then tested in water using a robotic flapping device that allowed us to either hold the models in a stationary position or move them dynamically at their self-propelled swimming speed. Compared with a smooth control model without denticles, the 3D printed shark skin showed increased swimming speed with reduced energy consumption under certain motion programs. For example, at a heave frequency of 1.5 Hz and an amplitude of ±1 cm, swimming speed increased by 6.6% and the energy cost-of-transport was reduced by 5.9%. In addition, a leading-edge vortex with greater vorticity than the smooth control was generated by the 3D printed shark skin, which may explain the increased swimming speeds. The ability to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fabric</span></strong>ate synthetic biomimetic shark skin opens up a wide array of possible manipulations of surface roughness parameters, and the ability to examine the hydrodynamic consequences of diverse skin denticle shapes present in different shark species.</p>

Ligand-dependent Notch signaling strength orchestrates lateral induction and lateral inhibition in the developing inner ear
<p>During inner ear development, Notch exhibits two modes of operation: lateral induction, which is associated with prosensory specification, and lateral inhibition, which is involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> cell determination. These mechanisms depend respectively on two different ligands, jagged 1 (Jag1) and delta 1 (Dl1), that rely on a common signaling cascade initiated after Notch activation. In the chicken otocyst, expression of Jag1 and the Notch target Hey1 correlates well with lateral induction, whereas both Jag1 and Dl1 are expressed during lateral inhibition, as are Notch targets Hey1 and Hes5. Here, we show that Jag1 drives lower levels of Notch activity than Dl1, which results in the differential expression of Hey1 and Hes5. In addition, Jag1 interferes with the ability of Dl1 to elicit high levels of Notch activity. Modeling the sensory epithelium when the two ligands are expressed together shows that ligand regulation, differential signaling strength and ligand competition are crucial to allow the two modes of operation and for establishing the alternate pattern of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> cells and supporting cells. Jag1, while driving lateral induction on its own, facilitates patterning by lateral inhibition in the presence of Dl1. This novel behavior emerges from Jag1 acting as a competitive inhibitor of Dl1 for Notch signaling. Both modeling and experiments show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> cell patterning is very robust. The model suggests that autoactivation of proneural factor Atoh1, upstream of Dl1, is a fundamental component for robustness. The results stress the importance of the levels of Notch signaling and ligand competition for Notch function.</p>

Zebrafish Foxi1 provides a neuronal ground state during inner ear induction preceding the Dlx3b/4b-regulated sensory lineage
<p>Vertebrate inner ear development is a complex process that involves the induction of a common territory for otic and epibranchial precursors and their subsequent segregation into otic and epibranchial cell fates. In zebrafish, the otic-epibranchial progenitor domain (OEPD) is induced by Fgf signaling in a Foxi1- and Dlx3b/4b-dependent manner, but the functional differences of Foxi1 and Dlx3b/4b in subsequent cell fate specifications within the developing inner ear are poorly understood. Based on pioneer tracking (PioTrack), a novel Cre-dependent genetic lineage tracing method, and genetic data, we show that the competence to embark on a neuronal or sensory fate is provided sequentially and very early during otic placode induction. Loss of Foxi1 prevents neuronal precursor formation without affecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> cell specification, whereas loss of Dlx3b/4b inhibits <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> cell but not neuronal precursor formation. Consistently, in Dlx3b/4b- and Sox9a-deficient <i>b380</i> mutants almost all otic epithelial fates are absent, including sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> cells, and the remaining otic cells adopt a neuronal fate. Furthermore, the progenitors of the anterior lateral line ganglia also arise from the OEPD in a Foxi1-dependent manner but are unaffected in the absence of Dlx3b/4b or in <i>b380</i> mutants. Thus, in addition to otic fate Foxi1 provides neuronal competence during OEPD induction prior to and independently of the Dlx3b/4b-mediated sensory fate of the developing inner ear.</p>

Self-assembly of genetically encoded DNA-protein hybrid nanoscale shapes
<p>We describe an approach to bottom-up <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fabric</span></strong>ation that allows integration of the functional diversity of proteins into designed three-dimensional structural frameworks. A set of custom staple proteins based on transcription activator–like effector proteins folds a double-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong>ed DNA template into a user-defined shape. Each staple protein is designed to recognize and closely link two distinct double-helical DNA sequences at separate positions on the template. We present design rules for constructing megadalton-scale DNA-protein hybrid shapes; introduce various structural motifs, such as custom curvature, corners, and vertices; and describe principles for creating multilayer DNA-protein objects with enhanced rigidity. We demonstrate self-assembly of our hybrid nanostructures in one-pot mixtures that include the genetic information for the designed proteins, the template DNA, RNA polymerase, ribosomes, and cofactors for transcription and translation.</p>

Treadmilling by FtsZ filaments drives peptidoglycan synthesis and bacterial cell division
<p>The mechanism by which bacteria divide is not well understood. Cell division is mediated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong>s of FtsZ and FtsA (FtsAZ) that recruit septal peptidoglycan-synthesizing enzymes to the division site. To understand how these components coordinate to divide cells, we visualized their movements relative to the dynamics of cell wall synthesis during cytokinesis. We found that the division septum was built at discrete sites that moved around the division plane. FtsAZ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong>s treadmilled circumferentially around the division ring and drove the motions of the peptidoglycan-synthesizing enzymes. The FtsZ treadmilling rate controlled both the rate of peptidoglycan synthesis and cell division. Thus, FtsZ treadmilling guides the progressive insertion of new cell wall by building increasingly smaller concentric rings of peptidoglycan to divide the cell.</p>

Control of meiotic pairing and recombination by chromosomally tethered 26<i>S</i> proteasome
<p>During meiosis, paired homologous chromosomes (homologs) become linked via the synaptonemal complex (SC) and crossovers. Crossovers mediate homolog segregation and arise from self-inflicted double-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong> breaks (DSBs). Here, we identified a role for the proteasome, the multisubunit protease that degrades proteins in the nucleus and cytoplasm, in homolog juxtaposition and crossing over. Without proteasome function, homologs failed to pair and instead remained associated with nonhomologous chromosomes. Although dispensable for noncrossover formation, a functional proteasome was required for a coordinated transition that entails SC assembly between longitudinally organized chromosome axes and stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong> exchange of crossover-designated DSBs. Notably, proteolytic core and regulatory proteasome particles were recruited to chromosomes by Zip3, the ortholog of mammalian E3 ligase RNF212, and SC protein Zip1 . We conclude that proteasome functions along meiotic chromosomes are evolutionarily conserved.</p>

Braiding a molecular knot with eight crossings
<p>Knots may ultimately prove just as versatile and useful at the nanoscale as at the macroscale. However, the lack of synthetic routes to all but the simplest molecular knots currently prevents systematic investigation of the influence of knotting at the molecular level. We found that it is possible to assemble four building blocks into three braided ligand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong>s. Octahedral iron(II) ions control the relative positions of the three <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong>s at each crossing point in a circular triple helicate, while structural constraints on the ligands determine the braiding connections. This approach enables two-step assembly of a molecular 8<sub>19</sub> knot featuring eight nonalternating crossings in a 192-atom closed loop ~20 nanometers in length. The resolved metal-free 8<sub>19</sub> knot enantiomers have pronounced features in their circular dichroism spectra resulting solely from topological chirality.</p>

Spatiotemporal antagonism in mesenchymal-epithelial signaling in sweat versus hair fate decision
<p>The gain of eccrine sweat glands in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong>y body skin has empowered humans to run marathons and tolerate temperature extremes. Epithelial-mesenchymal cross-talk is integral to the diverse patterning of skin appendages, but the molecular events underlying their specification remain largely unknown. Using genome-wide analyses and functional studies, we show that sweat glands are specified by mesenchymal-derived bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and fibroblast growth factors that signal to epithelial buds and suppress epithelial-derived sonic hedgehog (SHH) production. Conversely, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> follicles are specified when mesenchymal BMP signaling is blocked, permitting SHH production. Fate determination is confined to a critical developmental window and is regionally specified in mice. In contrast, a shift from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> to gland fates is achieved in humans when a spike in BMP silences SHH during the final embryonic wave(s) of bud morphogenesis.</p>

Critics assail paper claiming harm from cancer vaccine
<p>Vaccines for human papillomavirus (HPV), given to girls to prevent cervical cancer, have come under fire in several countries for allegedly causing such side effects as difficulty walking, headache, fatigue, poor concentration, and pain.

The DNA-sensing AIM2 inflammasome controls radiation-induced cell death and tissue injury
<p>Acute exposure to ionizing radiation induces massive cell death and severe damage to tissues containing actively proliferating cells, including bone marrow and the gastrointestinal tract. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this pathology remain controversial. Here, we show that mice deficient in the double-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong>ed DNA sensor AIM2 are protected from both subtotal body irradiation–induced gastrointestinal syndrome and total body irradiation–induced hematopoietic failure. AIM2 mediates the caspase-1–dependent death of intestinal epithelial cells and bone marrow cells in response to double-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong> DNA breaks caused by ionizing radiation and chemotherapeutic agents. Mechanistically, we found that AIM2 senses radiation-induced DNA damage in the nucleus to mediate inflammasome activation and cell death. Our results suggest that AIM2 may be a new therapeutic target for ionizing radiation exposure.</p>

Synthetic nacre by predesigned matrix-directed mineralization

GhCPK33 Negatively Regulates Defense against <i>Verticillium dahliae</i> by Phosphorylating GhOPR3
<p><i>Verticillium</i> wilt, caused by the soil-borne fungus <i>Verticillium dahliae</i>, is a destructive vascular disease in plants. Approximately 200 dicotyledonous plant species in temperate and subtropical regions are susceptible to this notorious pathogen. Previous studies showed that jasmonic acid (JA) plays a crucial role in plant-<i>V. dahliae</i> interactions. <i>V. dahliae</i> infection generally induces significant JA accumulation in local and distal tissues of the plant. Although JA biosynthesis and the associated enzymes have been studied intensively, the precise mechanism regulating JA biosynthesis upon <i>V. dahliae</i> infection remains unknown. Here, we identified the calcium-dependent protein kinase GhCPK33 from upland <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cotton</span></strong> (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>) as a negative regulator of resistance to <i>V. dahliae</i> that directly manipulates JA biosynthesis. Knockdown of <i>GhCPK33</i> by <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i>-mediated virus-induced gene silencing constitutively activated JA biosynthesis and JA-mediated defense responses and enhanced resistance to <i>V</i>. <i>dahliae</i>. Further analysis revealed that GhCPK33 interacts with 12-oxophytodienoate reductase3 (GhOPR3) in peroxisomes. GhCPK33 phosphorylates GhOPR3 at threonine-246, leading to decreased stability of GhOPR3, which consequently limits JA biosynthesis. We propose that GhCPK33 is a potential molecular target for improving resistance to <i>Verticillium</i> wilt disease in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cotton</span></strong>.</p>

5-Aminolevulinic Acid Dehydratase Gene Dosage Affects Programmed Cell Death and Immunity
<p>Programmed cell death (PCD) is an important form to protect plants from pathogen attack. However, plants must precisely control the PCD process under microbe attacks to avoid detrimental effects. The complexity of how plants balance the defense activation and PCD requires further clarification. Lesion mimic mutants constitute an excellent material to study the crosstalk between them. Here, we identified a <i>Gossypium hirsutum</i> (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cotton</span></strong>) lesion mimic mutant (<i>Ghlmm</i>), which exhibits necrotic leaf damage and enhanced disease resistance. Map-based cloning demonstrated that <i>GhLMMD</i>, encoding 5-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase and located on chromosome D5, was responsible for the phenotype. The mutant was resulted from a nonsense mutation within the coding region of <i>GhLMMD</i>. It exhibited an overaccumulation of the 5-aminolevulinic acid, elevated levels of reactive oxygen species and salicylic acid, along with constitutive expression of pathogenesis-related genes and enhanced resistance to the <i>Verticillium dahliae</i> infection. Interestingly, <i>GhLMM</i> plays a dosage-dependent role in regulating PCD of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cotton</span></strong> leaves and resistance to <i>V. dahliae</i> infection. This study provides a new strategy on the modulation of plant immunity, particularly in polyploidy plants.</p>

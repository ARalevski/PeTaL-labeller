Insect Morphological Diversification Through the Modification of Wing Serial Homologs
<sec><title>A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wing</span></strong> by Another Name?</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wing</span></strong>s and their derivatives on the second and third thoracic segments represent the only known dorsal appendages in modern insects; however, the existence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wing</span></strong> homologs in non-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wing</span></strong>ed segments has been suggested from fossil insects. <bold>Ohde <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 495, published online 14 March) identify part of the body wall on the first thoracic segment and pupal dorsolateral outgrowths as modified pairs of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wing</span></strong>s in the mealworm beetle.

Bioinspired spring origami
<p>Origami enables folding of objects into a variety of shapes in arts, engineering, and biological systems. In contrast to well-known paper-folded objects, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wing</span></strong> of the earwig has an exquisite natural folding system that cannot be sufficiently described by current origami models. Such an unusual biological system displays incompatible folding patterns, remains open by a bistable locking mechanism during flight, and self-folds rapidly without muscular actuation. We show that these notable functionalities arise from the protein-rich joints of the earwig <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wing</span></strong>, which work as extensional and rotational springs between facets. Inspired by this biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wing</span></strong>, we establish a spring origami model that broadens the folding design space of traditional origami and allows for the fabrication of precisely tunable, four-dimensional–printed objects with programmable bioinspired morphing functionalities.</p>

Dynamic clonal analysis based on chronic <i>in vivo</i> imaging allows multiscale quantification of growth in the <i>Drosophila</i> wing disc
<p>In the course of morphogenesis, tissues change shape and grow. How this is orchestrated is largely unknown, partly o<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wing</span></strong> to the lack of experimental methods to visualize and quantify growth. Here, we describe a novel experimental approach to investigate the growth of tissues <i>in vivo</i> on a time-scale of days, as employed to study the <i>Drosophila</i> larval imaginal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wing</span></strong> disc, the precursor of the adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wing</span></strong>. We developed a protocol to image <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wing</span></strong> discs at regular intervals in living anesthetized larvae so as to follow the growth of the tissue over extended periods of time. This approach can be used to image cells at high resolution <i>in vivo</i>. At intermediate scale, we tracked the increase in cell number within clones as well as the changes in clone area and shape. At scales extending to the tissue level, clones can be used as landmarks for measuring strain, as a proxy for growth. We developed general computational tools to extract strain maps from clonal shapes and landmark displacements in individual tissues, and to combine multiple datasets into a mean strain. In the disc, we use these to compare properties of growth at the scale of clones (a few cells) and at larger regional scales.</p>

Precipitation strengthening of aluminum alloys by room-temperature cyclic plasticity
<p>High-strength aluminum alloys are important for lightweighting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vehicl</span></strong>es and are extensively used in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aircraft</span></strong> and, increasingly, in automobiles. The highest-strength aluminum alloys require a series of high-temperature “bakes” (120° to 200°C) to form a high number density of nanoparticles by solid-state precipitation. We found that a controlled, room-temperature cyclic deformation is sufficient to continuously inject vacancies into the material and to mediate the dynamic precipitation of a very fine (1- to 2-nanometer) distribution of solute clusters. This results in better material strength and elongation properties relative to traditional thermal treatments, despite a much shorter processing time. The microstructures formed are much more uniform than those characteristic of traditional thermal treatments and do not exhibit precipitate-free zones. These alloys are therefore likely to be more resistant to damage.</p>

Glutamate signaling at cytoneme synapses
<p>We investigated the roles of components of neuronal synapses for development of the <i>Drosophila</i> air sac primordium (ASP). The ASP, an epithelial tube, extends specialized signaling filopodia called cytonemes that take up signals such as Dpp (Decapentaplegic, a homolog of the vertebrate bone morphogenetic protein) from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wing</span></strong> imaginal disc. Dpp signaling in the ASP was compromised if disc cells lacked Synaptobrevin and Synaptotagmin-1 (which function in vesicle transport at neuronal synapses), the glutamate transporter, and a voltage-gated calcium channel, or if ASP cells lacked Synaptotagmin-4 or the glutamate receptor GluRII. Transient elevations of intracellular calcium in ASP cytonemes correlate with signaling activity. Calcium transients in ASP cells depend on GluRII, are activated by <sc>l</sc>-glutamate and by stimulation of an optogenetic ion channel expressed in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wing</span></strong> disc, and are inhibited by EGTA and by the GluR inhibitor NASPM (1-naphthylacetyl spermine trihydrochloride). Activation of GluRII is essential but not sufficient for signaling. Cytoneme-mediated signaling is glutamatergic.</p>

Morphology, muscle capacity, skill, and maneuvering ability in hummingbirds
<p>How does agility evolve? This question is challenging because natural movement has many degrees of freedom and can be influenced by multiple traits. We used computer vision to record thousands of translations, rotations, and turns from more than 200 hummingbirds from 25 species, revealing that distinct performance metrics are correlated and that species diverge in their maneuvering style. Our analysis demonstrates that the enhanced maneuverability of larger species is explained by their proportionately greater muscle capacity and lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wing</span></strong> loading. Fast acceleration maneuvers evolve by recruiting changes in muscle capacity, whereas fast rotations and sharp turns evolve by recruiting changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wing</span></strong> morphology. Both species and individuals use turns that play to their strengths. These results demonstrate how both skill and biomechanical traits shape maneuvering behavior.</p>

Immunogene and viral transcript dynamics during parasitic <i>Varroa destructor</i> mite infection of developing honey bee (<i>Apis mellifera</i>) pupae
<p>The ectoparasitic <i>Varroa destructor</i> mite is a major contributor to the ongoing honey bee health crisis. <i>Varroa</i> interacts with honey bee viruses, exacerbating their pathogenicity. In addition to vectoring viruses, immunosuppression of the developing honey bee hosts by <i>Varroa</i> has been proposed to explain the synergy between viruses and mites. However, the evidence for honey bee immune suppression by <i>V. destructor</i> is contentious. We systematically studied the quantitative effects of experimentally introduced <i>V. destructor</i> mites on immune gene expression at five specific time points during the development of the honey bee hosts. Mites reproduced normally and were associated with increased titers of deformed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wing</span></strong> virus in the developing bees. Our data on different immune genes show little evidence for immunosuppression of honey bees by <i>V. destructor</i>. Experimental wounding of developing bees increases relative immune gene expression and deformed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wing</span></strong> virus titers. Combined, these results suggest that mite feeding activity itself and not immunosuppression may contribute to the synergy between viruses and mites. However, our results also suggest that increased expression of honey bee immune genes decreases mite reproductive success, which may be explored to enhance mite control strategies. Finally, our expression data for multiple immune genes across developmental time and different experimental treatments indicates co-regulation of several of these genes and thus improves our understanding of the understudied honey bee immune system.</p>

Flexible strategies for flight control: an active role for the abdomen
<p>Moving animals orchestrate myriad motor systems in response to multimodal sensory inputs. Coordinating movement is particularly challenging in flight control, where animals deal with potential instability and multiple degrees of freedom of movement. Prior studies have focused on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wing</span></strong>s as the primary flight control structures, for which changes in angle of attack or shape are used to modulate lift and drag forces. However, other actuators that may impact flight performance are reflexively activated during flight. We investigated the visual–abdominal reflex displayed by the hawkmoth <i>Manduca sexta</i> to determine its role in flight control. We measured the open-loop stimulus–response characteristics (measured as a transfer function) between the visual stimulus and abdominal response in tethered moths. The transfer function reveals a 41 ms delay and a high-pass filter behavior with a pass band starting at ~0.5 Hz. We also developed a simplified mathematical model of hovering flight wherein articulation of the thoracic–abdominal joint redirects an average lift force provided by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wing</span></strong>s. We show that control of the joint, subject to a high-pass filter, is sufficient to maintain stable hovering, but with a slim stability margin. Our experiments and models suggest a novel mechanism by which articulation of the body or ‘airframe’ of an animal can be used to redirect lift forces for effective flight control. Furthermore, the small stability margin may increase flight agility by easing the transition from stable flight to a more maneuverable, unstable regime.</p>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
Elevated expression of the V-ATPase C subunit triggers JNK-dependent cell invasion and overgrowth in a <i>Drosophila</i> epithelium
<p>The C subunit of the vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase or V-ATPase regulates the activity and assembly of the proton pump at cellular membranes. It has been shown to be strongly upregulated in oral squamous cell carcinoma, a highly metastatic epithelial cancer. In addition, increased V-ATPase activity appears to correlate with invasiveness of cancer cells, but the underlying mechanism is largely unknown. Using the <i>Drosophila</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wing</span></strong> imaginal epithelium as an <i>in vivo</i> model system, we demonstrate that overexpression of Vha44, the <i>Drosophila</i> orthologue of the C subunit, causes a tumor-like tissue transformation in cells of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wing</span></strong> epithelium. Overexpressing cells are excluded from the epithelium and acquire invasive properties while displaying high apoptotic rates. Blocking apoptosis in these cells unmasks a strong proliferation stimulus, leading to overgrowth. Furthermore, we show that excess Vha44 greatly increases acidification of endocytic compartments and interferes with endosomal trafficking. As a result, cargoes such as GFP-Lamp1 and Notch accumulate in highly acidified enlarged endolysosomal compartments. Consistent with previous reports on the endocytic activation of Eiger/JNK signaling, we find that V-ATPase stimulation by Vha44 causes JNK signaling activation whereas downmodulation of JNK signaling rescues the invasive phenotypes. In summary, our <i>in vivo-</i>findings demonstrate that increased levels of V-ATPase C subunit induce a Eiger/JNK-dependent cell transformation within an epithelial organ that recapitulates early carcinoma stages.</p>

Scaling morphogen gradients during tissue growth by a cell division rule
<p>Morphogen gradients guide the patterning of tissues and organs during the development of multicellular organisms. In many cases, morphogen signaling is also required for tissue growth. The consequences of this interplay between growth and patterning are not well understood. In the <i>Drosophila</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wing</span></strong> imaginal disc, the morphogen Dpp guides patterning and is also required for tissue growth. In particular, it was recently reported that cell division in the disc correlates with the temporal increase in Dpp signaling. Here we mathematically model morphogen gradient formation in a gro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wing</span></strong> tissue, accounting also for morphogen advection and dilution. Our analysis defines a new scaling mechanism, which we term the morphogen-dependent division rule (MDDR): when cell division depends on the temporal increase in morphogen signaling, the morphogen gradient scales with the gro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wing</span></strong> tissue size, tissue growth becomes spatially uniform and the tissue naturally attains a finite size. This model is consistent with many properties of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wing</span></strong> disc. However, we find that the MDDR is not consistent with the phenotype of scaling-defective mutants, supporting the view that temporal increase in Dpp signaling is not the driver of cell division during late phases of disc development. More generally, our results show that local coupling of cell division with morphogen signaling can lead to gradient scaling and uniform growth even in the absence of global feedbacks. The MDDR scaling mechanism might be particularly beneficial during rapid proliferation, when global feedbacks are hard to implement.</p>

No patient who underwent primary   wound closure developed an infection. All the fractures united,   although nine patients required revision of a mono-lateral to circular   frame for delayed union (two) or for altered alignment or length   (seven). The mean time to union was two weeks longer in diaphyseal fractures   than in distal fractures (13 weeks <i>versus</i> 10.8   weeks, p<i> = </i>0.016). Children aged > 12 years had   a significantly longer time to union than those aged < 12 years   (16.3 weeks <i>versus</i> 11.4 weeks, p<i> = </i>0.045).   The length of stay in hospital for patients with a Gustilo-Anderson   grade IIIB fracture was twice as long as for less severe injuries. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Fractures in children heal better than those in adults. Based   on our experience of deep infection we discourage the use of internal   fixation with a plate for open tibial fractures in children. We   advocate aggressive initial wound debridement in theatre with early   definitive combined orthopaedic and plastic surgery in order to   obtain skeletal stabilisation and soft-tissue cover.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:544–53.</p></sec>

Contribution of Impaired Parasympathetic Activity to Right Ventricular Dysfunction and Pulmonary Vascular Remodeling in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The beneficial effects of parasympathetic stimulation have been reported in left heart failure, but whether it would be beneficial for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) remains to be explored. Here, we investigated the relationship between parasympathetic activity and right ventricular (RV) function in patients with PAH, and the potential therapeutic effects of pyridostigmine (PYR), an oral drug stimulating the parasympathetic activity through acetylcholinesterase inhibition, in experimental pulmonary hypertension (PH).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Heart rate recovery after a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test was used as a surrogate for parasympathetic activity. RV ejection fraction was assessed in 112 patients with PAH. Expression of nicotinic (α-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor) and muscarinic (muscarinic acetylcholine type 2 receptor) receptors, and acetylcholinesterase activity were evaluated in RV (n=11) and lungs (n=7) from patients with PAH undergoing heart/lung transplantation and compared with tissue obtained from controls. In addition, we investigated the effects of PYR (40 mg/kg per day) in experimental PH. PH was induced in male rats by SU5416 (25 mg/kg subcutaneously) injection followed by 4 weeks of hypoxia. In a subgroup, sympathetic/parasympathetic modulation was assessed by power spectral analysis. At week 6, PH status was confirmed by echocardiography, and rats were randomly assigned to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vehicl</span></strong>e or treatment (both n=12). At the end of the study, echocardiography was repeated, with additional RV pressure-volume measurements, along with lung, RV histological, and protein analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Patients with PAH with lower RV ejection fraction (<41%) had a significantly reduced heart rate recovery in comparison with patients with higher RV ejection fraction. In PAH RV samples, α-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor was increased and acetylcholinesterase activity was reduced versus controls. No difference in muscarinic acetylcholine type 2 receptor expression was observed. Chronic PYR treatment in PH rats normalized the cardiovascular autonomic function, demonstrated by an increase in parasympathetic activity and baroreflex sensitivity. PYR improved survival, increased RV contractility, and reduced RV stiffness, RV hypertrophy, RV fibrosis, RV inflammation, and RV α-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and muscarinic acetylcholine type 2 receptor expression, as well. Furthermore, PYR reduced pulmonary vascular resistance, RV afterload, and pulmonary vascular remodeling, which was associated with reduced local and systemic inflammation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>RV dysfunction is associated with reduced systemic parasympathetic activity in patients with PAH, with an inadequate adaptive response of the cholinergic system in the RV. Enhancing parasympathetic activity by PYR improved survival, RV function, and pulmonary vascular remodeling in experimental PH.</p></sec>

Inhibition of JAK-STAT Signaling Suppresses Pathogenic Immune Responses in Medium and Large Vessel Vasculitis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Giant cell arteritis, a chronic autoimmune disease of the aorta and its large branches, is complicated by aneurysm formation, dissection, and arterial occlusions. Arterial wall dendritic cells attract CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and macrophages to form prototypic granulomatous infiltrates. Vasculitic lesions contain a diverse array of effector T cells that persist despite corticosteroid therapy and sustain chronic, smoldering vasculitis. Transmural inflammation induces microvascular neoangiogenesis and results in lumen-occlusive intimal hyperplasia. We have examined whether persistent vessel wall inflammation is maintained by lesional T cells, including the newly identified tissue-resident memory T cells, and whether such T cells are sensitive to the cytokine-signaling inhibitor tofacitinib, a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor targeting JAK3 and JAK1.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Vascular inflammation was induced in human arteries engrafted into immunodeficient mice that were reconstituted with T cells and monocytes from patients with giant cell arteritis. Mice carrying inflamed human arteries were treated with tofacitinib or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vehicl</span></strong>e. Vasculitic arteries were examined for gene expression (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction), protein expression (immunohistochemistry), and infiltrating cell populations (flow cytometry).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Tofacitinib effectively suppressed innate and adaptive immunity in the vessel wall. Lesional T cells responded to tofacitinib with reduced proliferation rates (<10%) and minimal production of the effector molecules interferon-γ, interleukin-17, and interleukin-21. Tofacitinib disrupted adventitial microvascular angiogenesis, reduced outgrowth of hyperplastic intima, and minimized CD4<sup>+</sup>CD103<sup>+</sup> tissue-resident memory T cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Cytokine signaling dependent on JAK3 and JAK1 is critically important in chronic inflammation of medium and large arteries. The JAK inhibitor tofacitinib effectively suppresses tissue-resident memory T cells and inhibits core vasculitogenic effector pathways.</p></sec>

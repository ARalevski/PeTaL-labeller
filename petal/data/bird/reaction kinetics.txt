Factorial Effects of Evolocumab and Atorvastatin on Lipoprotein Metabolism
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Monoclonal antibodies against proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9), such as evolocumab, lower plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol concentrations. Evolocumab is under investigation for its effects on cardiovascular outcomes in statin-treated, high-risk patients. The mechanism of action of PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies on lipoprotein metabolism remains to be fully evaluated. Stable isotope tracer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinet</span></strong>ics can effectively elucidate the mode of action of new lipid-regulating pharmacotherapies.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a 2-by-2 factorial trial of the effects of atorvastatin (80 mg daily) and subcutaneous evolocumab (420 mg every 2 weeks) for 8 weeks on the plasma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinet</span></strong>ics of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)–apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB), intermediate-density lipoprotein–apoB, and LDL-apoB in 81 healthy, normolipidemic, nonobese men. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinet</span></strong>ics of apoB in these lipoproteins was studied using a stable isotope infusion of D3-leucine, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, and multicompartmental modeling.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Atorvastatin and evolocumab independently accelerated the fractional catabolism of VLDL-apoB (<i>P</i><0.001 and <i>P</i>.032, respectively), intermediate-density lipoprotein–apoB (<i>P</i>=0.021 and <i>P</i>=.002, respectively), and LDL-apoB (<i>P</i><0.001, both interventions). Evolocumab but not atorvastatin decreased the production rate of intermediate-density lipoprotein–apoB (<i>P</i>=0.043) and LDL-apoB (<i>P</i><0.001), which contributed to the reduction in the plasma pool sizes of these lipoprotein particles. The reduction in LDL-apoB and LDL-cholesterol concentrations was significantly greater with combination versus either monotherapy (<i>P</i><0.001). Whereas evolocumab but not atorvastatin lowered the concentration of free PCSK9, atorvastatin lowered the lathosterol/campesterol ratio (a measure of cholesterol synthesis/absorption) and apoC-III concentration. Both interventions decreased plasma apoE, but neither significantly altered lipoprotein lipase and cholesteryl ester protein mass or measures of insulin resistance.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In healthy, normolipidemic subjects, evolocumab decreased the concentration of atherogenic lipoproteins, particularly LDL, by accelerating their catabolism. Reductions in intermediate-density lipoprotein and LDL production also contributed to the decrease in LDL particle concentration with evolocumab by a mechanism distinct from that of atorvastatin. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinet</span></strong>ic findings provide a metabolic basis for understanding the potential benefits of PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies incremental to statins in on-going clinical end point trials.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Isolation of isoform-specific binding proteins (Affimers) by phage display using negative selection
<p>Some 30 years after its discovery, phage display remains one of the most widely used methods of in vitro selection. Initially developed to revolutionize the generation of therapeutic antibodies, phage display is now the first choice for screening artificial binding proteins. Artificial binding proteins can be used as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reagent</span></strong>s to study protein-protein interactions, target posttranslational modifications, and distinguish between homologous proteins. They can also be used as research and affinity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reagent</span></strong>s, for diagnostic purposes, and as therapeutics. However, the ability to identify isoform-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reagent</span></strong>s remains highly challenging.

Unlocking P(V): Reagents for chiral phosphorothioate synthesis
<p>Phosphorothioate nucleotides have emerged as powerful pharmacological substitutes of their native phosphodiester analogs with important translational applications in antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapeutics and cyclic dinucleotide (CDN) synthesis. Stereocontrolled installation of this chiral motif has long been hampered by the systemic use of phosphorus(III) [P(III)]–based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reagent</span></strong> systems as the sole practical means of oligonucleotide assembly. A fundamentally different approach is described herein: the invention of a P(V)-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reagent</span></strong> platform for programmable, traceless, diastereoselective phosphorus-sulfur incorporation. The power of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reagent</span></strong> system is demonstrated through the robust and stereocontrolled synthesis of various nucleotidic architectures, including ASOs and CDNs, via an efficient, inexpensive, and operationally simple protocol.</p>

Carbonyl catalysis enables a biomimetic asymmetric Mannich reaction
<p>Chiral amines are widely used as catalysts in asymmetric synthesis to activate carbonyl groups for α-functionalization. Carbonyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalysi</span></strong>s reverses that strategy by using a carbonyl group to activate a primary amine. Inspired by biological carbonyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalysi</span></strong>s, which is exemplified by reactions of pyridoxal-dependent enzymes, we developed an N-quaternized pyridoxal catalyst for the asymmetric Mannich reaction of glycinate with aryl <i>N</i>-diphenylphosphinyl imines.

Modular radical cross-coupling with sulfones enables access to sp<sup>3</sup>-rich (fluoro)alkylated scaffolds
<p>Cross-coupling chemistry is widely applied to carbon-carbon bond formation in the synthesis of medicines, agrochemicals, and other functional materials. Recently, single-electron–induced variants of this reaction class have proven particularly useful in the formation of C(sp<sup>2</sup>)–C(sp<sup>3</sup>) linkages, although certain compound classes have remained a challenge. Here, we report the use of sulfones to activate the alkyl coupling partner in nickel-catalyzed radical cross-coupling with aryl zinc <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reagent</span></strong>s. This method’s tolerance of fluoroalkyl substituents proved particularly advantageous for the streamlined preparation of pharmaceutically oriented fluorinated scaffolds that previously required multiple steps, toxic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reagent</span></strong>s, and nonmodular retrosynthetic blueprints. Five specific sulfone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reagent</span></strong>s facilitate the rapid assembly of a vast set of compounds, many of which contain challenging fluorination patterns.</p>

Selective increase in CO<sub>2</sub> electroreduction activity at grain-boundary surface terminations
<p>Altering a material’s catalytic properties requires identifying structural features that give rise to active surfaces. Grain boundaries create strained regions in polycrystalline materials by stabilizing dislocations and may provide a way to create high-energy surfaces for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalysi</span></strong>s that are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinet</span></strong>ically trapped. Although grain-boundary density has previously been correlated with catalytic activity for some reactions, direct evidence that grain boundaries create surfaces with enhanced activity is lacking. We used a combination of bulk electrochemical measurements and scanning electrochemical cell microscopy with submicrometer resolution to show that grain-boundary surface terminations in gold electrodes are more active than grain surfaces for electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) reduction to carbon monoxide (CO) but not for the competing hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) evolution reaction. The catalytic footprint of the grain boundary is commensurate with its dislocation-induced strain field, providing a strategy for broader exploitation of grain-boundary effects in heterogeneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalysi</span></strong>s.</p>

Experimentally realized mechanochemistry distinct from force-accelerated scission of loaded bonds
<p>Stretching polymer chains accelerates dissociation of a variety of internal covalent bonds, to an extent that correlates well with the force experienced by the scissile bond. Recent theory has also predicted scenarios in which applied force accelerates dissociation of unloaded bonds and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinet</span></strong>ically strengthens strained bonds. We report here unambiguous experimental validation of this hypothesis: Detailed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinet</span></strong>ic measurements demonstrate that stretching phosphotriesters accelerates dissociation of the unloaded phosphorus-oxygen bond orthogonal to the pulling axis, whereas stretching organosiloxanes inhibits dissociation of the aligned loaded silicon-oxygen bonds. Qualitatively, the outcome is determined by phosphoester elongation and siloxane contraction along the pulling axis in the respective rate-determining transition states. Quantitatively, the results agree with a simple mechano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinet</span></strong></span></strong>ics model.</p>

Photosensitized, energy transfer-mediated organometallic catalysis through electronically excited nickel(II)
<p>Transition metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalysi</span></strong>s has traditionally relied on organometallic complexes that can cycle through a series of ground-state oxidation levels to achieve a series of discrete yet fundamental fragment-coupling steps. The viability of excited-state organometallic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalysi</span></strong>s via direct photoexcitation has been demonstrated. Although the utility of triplet sensitization by energy transfer has long been known as a powerful activation mode in organic photochemistry, it is surprising to recognize that photosensitization mechanisms to access excited-state organometallic catalysts have lagged far behind. Here, we demonstrate excited-state organometallic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalysi</span></strong>s via such an activation pathway: Energy transfer from an iridium sensitizer produces an excited-state nickel complex that couples aryl halides with carboxylic acids. Detailed mechanistic studies confirm the role of photosensitization via energy transfer.</p>

The role of dimer asymmetry and protomer dynamics in enzyme catalysis
<p>Freeze-trapping x-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance, and computational techniques reveal the distribution of states and their interconversion rates along the reaction pathway of a bacterial homodimeric enzyme, fluoroacetate dehalogenase (FAcD). The crystal structure of apo-FAcD exhibits asymmetry around the dimer interface and cap domain, priming one protomer for substrate binding. This asymmetry is dynamically averaged through conformational exchange on a millisecond time scale. During <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalysi</span></strong>s, the protomer conformational exchange rate becomes enhanced, the empty protomer exhibits increased local disorder, and water egresses. Computational studies identify allosteric pathways between protomers. Water release and enhanced dynamics associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalysi</span></strong>s compensate for entropic losses from substrate binding while facilitating sampling of the transition state. The studies provide insights into how substrate-coupled allosteric modulation of structure and dynamics facilitates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalysi</span></strong>s in a homodimeric enzyme.</p>

F-Actin Mediated Focusing of Vesicles at the Cell Tip Is Essential for Polarized Growth
<p>F-actin has been shown to be essential for tip growth in an array of plant models, including <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. One hypothesis is that diffusion can transport secretory vesicles, while actin plays a regulatory role during secretion. Alternatively, it is possible that actin-based transport is necessary to overcome vesicle transport limitations to sustain secretion. Therefore, a quantitative analysis of diffusion, secretion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinet</span></strong>ics, and cell geometry is necessary to clarify the role of actin in polarized growth. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis, we first show that secretory vesicles move toward and accumulate at the tip in an actin-dependent manner. We then depolymerized F-actin to decouple vesicle diffusion from actin-mediated transport and measured the diffusion coefficient and concentration of vesicles. Using these values, we constructed a theoretical diffusion-based model for growth, demonstrating that with fast-enough vesicle fusion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinet</span></strong>ics, diffusion could support normal cell growth rates. We further refined our model to explore how experimentally extrapolated vesicle fusion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinet</span></strong>ics and the size of the secretion zone limit diffusion-based growth. This model predicts that diffusion-mediated growth is dependent on the size of the region of exocytosis at the tip and that diffusion-based growth would be significantly slower than normal cell growth. To further explore the size of the secretion zone, we used a cell wall degradation enzyme cocktail and determined that the secretion zone is smaller than 6 μm in diameter at the tip. Taken together, our results highlight the requirement for active transport in polarized growth and provide important insight into vesicle secretion during tip growth.</p>

Characterization of Class III Peroxidases from Switchgrass
<p>Class III peroxidases (CIIIPRX) catalyze the oxidation of monolignols, generate radicals, and ultimately lead to the formation of lignin. In general, CIIIPRX genes encode a large number of isozymes with ranges of in vitro substrate specificities. In order to elucidate the mode of substrate specificity of these enzymes, we characterized one of the CIIIPRXs (PviPRX9) from switchgrass (<i>Panicum virgatum</i>), a strategic plant for second-generation biofuels. The crystal structure, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinet</span></strong>ic experiments, molecular docking, as well as expression patterns of PviPRX9 across multiple tissues and treatments, along with its levels of coexpression with the majority of genes in the monolignol biosynthesis pathway, revealed the function of PviPRX9 in lignification. Significantly, our study suggested that PviPRX9 has the ability to oxidize a broad range of phenylpropanoids with rather similar efficiencies, which reflects its role in the fortification of cell walls during normal growth and root development and in response to insect feeding. Based on the observed interactions of phenylpropanoids in the active site and analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinet</span></strong>ics, a catalytic mechanism involving two water molecules and residues histidine-42, arginine-38, and serine-71 was proposed. In addition, proline-138 and gluntamine-140 at the <sup>137</sup>P-X-P-X<sup>140</sup> motif, leucine-66, proline-67, and asparagine-176 may account for the broad substrate specificity of PviPRX9. Taken together, these observations shed new light on the function and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalysi</span></strong>s of PviPRX9 and potentially benefit efforts to improve biomass conservation properties in bioenergy and forage crops.</p>

Design and evaluation of engineered protein biosensors for live-cell imaging of EGFR phosphorylation
<p>Live-cell fluorescence microscopy is broadly applied to study the dynamics of receptor-mediated cell signaling, but the availability of intracellular biosensors is limited. A biosensor based on the tandem SH2 domains from phospholipase C–γ1 (PLCγ1), tSH2-WT, has been used to measure phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Here, we found that tSH2-WT lacked specificity for phosphorylated EGFR, consistent with the known promiscuity of SH2 domains. Further, EGF-stimulated membrane recruitment of tSH2-WT differed qualitatively from the expected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinet</span></strong>ics of EGFR phosphorylation. Analysis of a mathematical model suggested, and experiments confirmed, that the high avidity of tSH2-WT resulted in saturation of its target and interference with EGFR endocytosis. To overcome the apparent target specificity and saturation issues, we implemented two protein engineering strategies. In the first approach, we screened a combinatorial library generated by random mutagenesis of the C-terminal SH2 domain (cSH2) of PLCγ1 and isolated a mutant form (mSH2) with enhanced specificity for phosphorylated Tyr<sup>992</sup> (pTyr<sup>992</sup>) of EGFR. A biosensor based on mSH2 closely reported the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinet</span></strong>ics of EGFR phosphorylation but retained cross-reactivity similar to tSH2-WT. In the second approach, we isolated a pTyr<sup>992</sup>-binding protein (SPY992) from a combinatorial library generated by mutagenesis of the Sso7d protein scaffold. Compared to tSH2-WT and mSH2, SPY992 exhibited superior performance as a specific, moderate-affinity biosensor. We extended this approach to isolate a biosensor for EGFR pTyr<sup>1148</sup> (SPY1148). This approach of integrating theoretical considerations with protein engineering strategies can be generalized to design and evaluate suitable biosensors for various phospho-specific targets.</p>

Generation of specific inhibitors of SUMO-1– and SUMO-2/3–mediated protein-protein interactions using Affimer (Adhiron) technology
<p>Because protein-protein interactions underpin most biological processes, developing tools that target them to understand their function or to inform the development of therapeutics is an important task. SUMOylation is the posttranslational covalent attachment of proteins in the SUMO family (SUMO-1, SUMO-2, or SUMO-3), and it regulates numerous cellular pathways. SUMOylated proteins are recognized by proteins with SUMO-interaction motifs (SIMs) that facilitate noncovalent interactions with SUMO. We describe the use of the Affimer system of peptide display for the rapid isolation of synthetic binding proteins that inhibit SUMO-dependent protein-protein interactions mediated by SIMs both in vitro and in cells. Crucially, these synthetic proteins did not prevent SUMO conjugation either in vitro or in cell-based systems, enabling the specific analysis of SUMO-mediated protein-protein interactions. Furthermore, through structural analysis and molecular modeling, we explored the molecular mechanisms that may underlie their specificity in interfering with either SUMO-1–mediated interactions or interactions mediated by either SUMO-2 or SUMO-3. Not only will these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reagent</span></strong>s enable investigation of the biological roles of SUMOylation, but the Affimer technology used to generate these synthetic binding proteins could also be exploited to design or validate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reagent</span></strong>s or therapeutics that target other protein-protein interactions.</p>

A molecular assembly phase transition and kinetic proofreading modulate Ras activation by SOS
<p>The guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Son of Sevenless (SOS) is a key Ras activator that is autoinhibited in the cytosol and activates upon membrane recruitment. Autoinhibition release involves structural rearrangements of the protein at the membrane and thus introduces a delay between initial recruitment and activation. In this study, we designed a single-molecule assay to resolve the time between initial receptor-mediated membrane recruitment and the initiation of GEF activity of individual SOS molecules on microarrays of Ras-functionalized supported membranes. The rise-and-fall shape of the measured SOS activation time distribution and the long mean time scale to activation (~50 seconds) establish a basis for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinet</span></strong>ic proofreading in the receptor-mediated activation of Ras. We further demonstrate that this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinet</span></strong>ic proofreading is modulated by the LAT (linker for activation of T cells)–Grb2–SOS phosphotyrosine-driven phase transition at the membrane.</p>

A radical approach to the copper oxidative addition problem: Trifluoromethylation of bromoarenes

An artificial metalloenzyme with the kinetics of native enzymes

The first-step nucleophile—the branchsite adenosine—is sequestered within the Hsh155 HEAT domain and is held 50 angstroms away from the 5′ss. Our structure suggests that Prp2 adenosine triphosphatase–mediated remodeling leads to conformational changes in Hsh155’s HEAT domain that liberate the first-step reactants for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalysi</span></strong>s.</p>

Arabidopsis β-Amylase2 Is a K<sup>+</sup>-Requiring, Catalytic Tetramer with Sigmoidal Kinetics
<p>The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) genome contains nine β-amylase (<i>BAM</i>) genes, some of which play important roles in starch hydrolysis. However, little is known about BAM2, a plastid-localized enzyme reported to have extremely low catalytic activity. Using conservation of intron positions, we determined that the nine Arabidopsis <i>BAM</i> genes fall into two distinct subfamilies. A similar pattern was found in each major lineage of land plants, suggesting that these subfamilies diverged prior to the origin of land plants. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis indicated that <i>BAM2</i> is the ancestral member of one of these subfamilies. This finding, along with the conservation of amino acids in the active site of BAM2, suggested that it might be catalytically active. We then identified KCl as necessary for BAM2 activity. Unlike BAM1, BAM3, and BAM5, three Arabidopsis BAMs that all exhibited hyperbolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinet</span></strong>ics, BAM2 exhibited sigmoidal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinet</span></strong>ics with a Hill coefficient of over 3. Using multi-angle light scattering, we determined that BAM2 was a tetramer, whereas BAM5 was a monomer. Conserved residues from a diverse set of BAM2 orthologs were mapped onto a homology model of the protein, revealing a large, conserved surface away from the active site that we hypothesize is a secondary carbohydrate-binding site. Introduction of bulky methionine for glycine at two points on this surface reduced catalytic activity significantly without disrupting the tetrameric structure. Expression analysis indicated that BAM2 is more closely coexpressed with other starch degradation enzymes than any other BAM, suggesting that BAM2 may play an important role in starch degradation in plants.</p>

Salicylic Acid-Dependent Plant Stress Signaling via Mitochondrial Succinate Dehydrogenase
<p>Mitochondria are known for their role in ATP production and generation of reactive oxygen species, but little is known about the mechanism of their early involvement in plant stress signaling. The role of mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) in salicylic acid (SA) signaling was analyzed using two mutants: <i>disrupted in stress response1</i> (<i>dsr1</i>), which is a point mutation in SDH1 identified in a loss of SA signaling screen, and a knockdown mutant (<i>sdhaf2</i>) for SDH assembly factor 2 that is required for FAD insertion into SDH1. Both mutants showed strongly decreased SA-inducible stress promoter responses and low SDH maximum capacity compared to wild type, while <i>dsr1</i> also showed low succinate affinity, low catalytic efficiency, and increased resistance to SDH competitive inhibitors. The SA-induced promoter responses could be partially rescued in <i>sdhaf2</i>, but not in <i>dsr1</i>, by supplementing the plant growth media with succinate. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinet</span></strong>ic characterization showed that low concentrations of either SA or ubiquinone binding site inhibitors increased SDH activity and induced mitochondrial H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production. Both <i>dsr1</i> and <i>sdhaf2</i> showed lower rates of SA-dependent H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production in vitro in line with their low SA-dependent stress signaling responses in vivo. This provides quantitative and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinet</span></strong>ic evidence that SA acts at or near the ubiquinone binding site of SDH to stimulate activity and contributes to plant stress signaling by increased rates of mitochondrial H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production, leading to part of the SA-dependent transcriptional response in plant cells.</p>

Systems Genetics Identifies a Novel Regulatory Domain of Amylose Synthesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>A deeper understanding of the regulation of starch biosynthesis in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) endosperm is crucial in tailoring digestibility without sacrificing grain quality. In this study, significant association peaks on chromosomes 6 and 7 were identified through a genomewide association study (GWAS) of debranched starch structure from grains of a 320 <i>indica</i> rice diversity panel using genotyping data from the high-density rice array. A systems genetics approach that interrelates starch structure data from GWAS to functional pathways from a gene regulatory network identified known genes with high correlation to the proportion of amylose and amylopectin. An SNP in the promoter region of <i>Granule Bound Starch Synthase I</i> was identified along with seven other SNPs to form haplotypes that discriminate samples into different phenotypic ranges of amylose. A GWAS peak on chromosome 7 between LOC_Os07g11020 and LOC_Os07g11520 indexed by a nonsynonymous SNP mutation on exon 5 of a bHLH transcription factor was found to elevate the proportion of amylose at the expense of reduced short-chain amylopectin. Linking starch structure with starch digestibility by determining the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinet</span></strong>ics of cooked grain amylolysis of selected haplotypes revealed strong association of starch structure with estimated digestibility <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinet</span></strong>ics. Combining all results from grain quality genomics, systems genetics, and digestibility phenotyping, we propose target haplotypes for fine-tuning starch structure in rice through marker-assisted breeding that can be used to alter the digestibility of rice grain, thus offering rice consumers a new diet-based intervention to mitigate the impact of nutrition-related noncommunicable diseases.</p>

Systems-level analysis of mechanisms regulating yeast metabolic flux
<p>Cellular metabolic fluxes are determined by enzyme activities and metabolite abundances. Biochemical approaches reveal the impact of specific substrates or regulators on enzyme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinet</span></strong>ics but do not capture the extent to which metabolite and enzyme concentrations vary across physiological states and, therefore, how cellular reactions are regulated. We measured enzyme and metabolite concentrations and metabolic fluxes across 25 steady-state yeast cultures. We then assessed the extent to which flux can be explained by a Michaelis-Menten relationship between enzyme, substrate, product, and potential regulator concentrations. This revealed three previously unrecognized instances of cross-pathway regulation, which we biochemically verified. One of these involved inhibition of pyruvate kinase by citrate, which accumulated and thereby curtailed glycolytic outflow in nitrogen-limited yeast. Overall, substrate concentrations were the strongest driver of the net rates of cellular metabolic reactions, with metabolite concentrations collectively having more than double the physiological impact of enzymes.</p>

The methanogenic CO<sub>2</sub> reducing-and-fixing enzyme is bifunctional and contains 46 [4Fe-4S] clusters
<p>Biological methane formation starts with a challenging adenosine triphosphate (ATP)–independent carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) fixation process. We explored this enzymatic process by solving the x-ray crystal structure of formyl-methanofuran dehydrogenase, determined here as Fwd(ABCDFG)<sub>2</sub> and Fwd(ABCDFG)<sub>4</sub> complexes, from <i>Methanothermobacter wolfeii</i>. The latter 800-kilodalton apparatus consists of four peripheral catalytic sections and an electron-supplying core with 46 electronically coupled [4Fe-4S] clusters. Catalysis is separately performed by subunits FwdBD (FwdB and FwdD), which are related to tungsten-containing formate dehydrogenase, and subunit FwdA, a binuclear metal center carrying amidohydrolase. CO<sub>2</sub> is first reduced to formate in FwdBD, which then diffuses through a 43-angstrom-long tunnel to FwdA, where it condenses with methanofuran to formyl-methanofuran. The arrangement of [4Fe-4S] clusters functions as an electron relay but potentially also couples the four tungstopterin active sites over 206 angstroms.</p>

Graphite oxide with large lateral dimensions has an exfoliation yield of ~100%, but it has not been possible to completely remove the oxygen functional groups so that the reduced form of graphene oxide (GO; reduced form: rGO) remains a highly disordered material. Here we report a simple, rapid method to reduce GO into pristine graphene using 1- to 2-second pulses of microwaves. The desirable structural properties are translated into mobility values of >1000 square centimeters per volt per second in field-effect transistors with microwave-reduced GO (MW-rGO) as the channel material and into particularly high activity for MW-rGO catalyst support toward oxygen evolution reactions.</p>

Screening in crystalline liquids protects energetic carriers in hybrid perovskites
<p>Hybrid lead halide perovskites exhibit carrier properties that resemble those of pristine nonpolar semiconductors despite static and dynamic disorder, but how carriers are protected from efficient scattering with charged defects and optical phonons is unknown.

The hot fluorescence is correlated with liquid-like molecular reorientational motions, suggesting that dynamic screening protects energetic carriers via <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">solvat</span></strong>ion or large polaron formation on time scales competitive with that of ultrafast cooling. Similar protections likely exist for band-edge carriers. The long-lived energetic carriers may enable hot-carrier solar cells with efficiencies exceeding the Shockley-Queisser limit.</p>

Tandem Fluorescent Protein Timers for Noninvasive Relative Protein Lifetime Measurement in Plants
<p>Targeted protein degradation is an important and pervasive regulatory mechanism in plants, required for perception and response to the environment as well as developmental signaling. Despite the significance of this process, relatively few studies have assessed plant protein turnover in a quantitative fashion. Tandem fluorescent protein timers (tFTs) offer a powerful approach for the assessment of in vivo protein turnover in distinct subcellular compartments of single or multiple cells. A tFT is a fusion of two different fluorescent proteins with distinct fluorophore maturation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinet</span></strong>ics, which enable protein age to be estimated from the ratio of fluorescence intensities of the two fluorescent proteins. Here, we used short-lived auxin signaling proteins and model N-end rule (N-recognin) pathway reporters to demonstrate the utility of tFTs for studying protein turnover in living plant cells of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. We present transient expression of tFTs as an efficient screen for relative protein lifetime, useful for testing the effects of mutations and different genetic backgrounds on protein stability. This work demonstrates the potential for using stably expressed tFTs to study native protein dynamics with high temporal resolution in response to exogenous or endogenous stimuli.</p>

Light Acclimation of the Colonial Green Alga <i>Botryococcus braunii</i> Strain Showa
<p>In contrast to single cellular species, detailed information is lacking on the processes of photosynthetic acclimation for colonial algae, although these algae are important for biofuel production, ecosystem biodiversity, and wastewater treatment. To investigate differences between single cellular and colonial species, we studied the regulation of photosynthesis and photoprotection during photoacclimation for the colonial green alga <i>Botryococcus braunii</i> and made a comparison with the properties of the single cellular species <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>. We show that <i>B. braunii</i> shares some high-light (HL) photoacclimation strategies with <i>C. reinhardtii</i> and other frequently studied green algae: decreased chlorophyll content, increased free carotenoid content, and increased nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ). Additionally, <i>B. braunii</i> has unique HL photoacclimation strategies, related to its colonial form: strong internal shading by an increase of the colony size and the accumulation of extracellular echinenone (a ketocarotenoid). HL colonies are larger and more spatially heterogenous than low-light colonies. Compared with surface cells, cells deeper inside the colony have increased pigmentation and larger photosystem II antenna size. The core of the largest of the HL colonies does not contain living cells. In contrast with <i>C. reinhardtii</i>, but similar to other biofilm-forming algae, NPQ capacity is substantial in low light. In HL, NPQ amplitude increases, but <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinet</span></strong>ics are unchanged. We discuss possible causes of the different acclimation responses of <i>C. reinhardtii</i> and <i>B. braunii</i>. Knowledge of the specific photoacclimation processes for this colonial green alga further extends the view of the diversity of photoacclimation strategies in photosynthetic organisms.</p>

Hydraulics Regulate Stomatal Responses to Changes in Leaf Water Status in the Fern <i>Athyrium filix</i>-<i>femina</i>
<p>Stomatal responses to changes in leaf water status are important for the diurnal regulation of gas exchange and the survival of plants during drought. These stomatal responses in angiosperm species are well characterized, yet in species of nonseed plants, an ongoing debate surrounds the role of metabolism, particularly the role of the hormone abscisic acid (ABA), in functionally regulating stomatal responses to changes in leaf water status. Here, we measured the stomatal response to changes in vapor pressure difference (VPD) in two natural forms of the fern species <i>Athyrium filix</i>-<i>femina</i>, recently suggested to have stomata that are regulated by ABA. The two forms measured had considerable differences in key hydraulic traits, including leaf hydraulic conductance and capacitance, as well as the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinet</span></strong>ics of stomatal response to changes in VPD. In both forms, the stomatal responses to VPD could be accurately predicted by a dynamic, mechanistic model that assumes guard cell turgor changes in concert with leaf turgor in the light, and not via metabolic processes including the level of ABA. During drought, endogenous ABA did not play a role in stomatal closure, and exogenous ABA applied to live, intact leaves did not induce stomatal closure. Our results indicate that functional stomatal responses to changes in leaf water status in ferns are regulated by leaf hydraulics and not metabolism. With ferns being sister to seed plants, this result has implications for the evolutionary reconstruction of functional stomatal responses across vascular land plant lineages.</p>

Cation Specificity of Vacuolar NHX-Type Cation/H<sup>+</sup> Antiporters
<p>Cation/H<sup>+</sup> (NHX-type) antiporters are important regulators of intracellular ion homeostasis and are critical for cell expansion and plant stress acclimation. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), four distinct NHX isoforms, named AtNHX1 to AtNHX4, locate to the tonoplast. To determine the concerted roles of all tonoplast NHXs on vacuolar ion and pH homeostasis, we examined multiple knockout mutants lacking all but one of the four vacuolar isoforms and quadruple knockout plants lacking any vacuolar NHX activity. The <i>nhx</i> triple and quadruple knockouts displayed reduced growth phenotypes. Exposure to sodium chloride improved growth while potassium chloride was deleterious to some knockouts. Kinetic analysis of K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> transport indicated that AtNHX1 and AtNHX2 are the main contributors to both vacuolar pH and K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> uptake, while AtNHX3 and AtNHX4 differ in Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> selectivity. The lack of any vacuolar NHX activity resulted in no K<sup>+</sup> uptake, highly acidic vacuoles, and reduced but not abolished vacuolar Na<sup>+</sup> uptake. Additional K<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange activity assays in the quadruple knockout indicated Na<sup>+</sup> uptake that was not H<sup>+</sup> coupled, suggesting the existence of an alternative, cation/H<sup>+</sup>-independent, Na<sup>+</sup> conductive pathway in vacuoles. These results highlight the importance of NHX-type cation/H<sup>+</sup> antiporters in the maintenance of cellular cation homeostasis and in growth and development.</p>

NMT1 and NMT3 <i>N</i>-Methyltransferase Activity Is Critical to Lipid Homeostasis, Morphogenesis, and Reproduction
<p>Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is a major membrane phospholipid and a precursor for major signaling molecules. Understanding its synthesis is important for improving plant growth, nutritional value, and resistance to stress. PC synthesis is complex, involving several interconnected pathways, one of which proceeds from serine-derived phosphoethanolamine to form phosphocholine through three sequential phospho-base methylations catalyzed by phosphoethanolamine <i>N</i>-methyltransferases (PEAMTs). The contribution of this pathway to the production of PC and plant growth has been a matter of some debate. Although a handful of individual PEAMTs have been described, there has not been any in planta investigation of a PEAMT family. Here, we provide a comparative functional analysis of two Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) PEAMTs, NMT1 and the little known NMT3. Analysis of loss-of-function mutants demonstrates that NMT1 and NMT3 synergistically regulate PC homeostasis, phase transition at the shoot apex, coordinated organ development, and fertility through overlapping but also specific functions. The <i>nmt1 nmt3</i> double mutant shows extensive sterility, drastically reduced PC concentrations, and altered lipid profiles. These findings demonstrate that the phospho-base methylation pathway makes a major contribution to PC synthesis in Arabidopsis and that NMT1 and NMT3 play major roles in its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalysi</span></strong>s and the regulation of PC homeostasis as well as in plant growth and reproduction.</p>

Chloroplast Ca<sup>2+</sup> Fluxes into and across Thylakoids Revealed by Thylakoid-Targeted Aequorin Probes
<p>Chloroplasts require a fine-tuned control of their internal Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, which is crucial for many aspects of photosynthesis and for other chloroplast-localized processes. Increasing evidence suggests that calcium regulation within chloroplasts also may influence Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathways in the cytosol. To investigate the involvement of thylakoids in Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis and in the modulation of chloroplast Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in vivo, we targeted the bioluminescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> reporter aequorin as a YFP fusion to the lumen and the stromal surface of thylakoids in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Thylakoid localization of aequorin-based probes in stably transformed lines was confirmed by confocal microscopy, immunogold labeling, and biochemical analyses. In resting conditions in the dark, free Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in the thylakoid lumen were maintained at about 0.5 μ<sc>m</sc>, which was a 3- to 5-fold higher concentration than in the stroma. Monitoring of chloroplast Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in different intrachloroplast subcompartments (stroma, thylakoid membrane, and thylakoid lumen) revealed the occurrence of stimulus-specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, characterized by unique <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinet</span></strong>ic parameters. Oxidative and salt stresses initiated pronounced free Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes in the thylakoid lumen. Localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases also were observed on the thylakoid membrane surface, mirroring transient Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes observed for the bulk stroma, but with specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics. Moreover, evidence was obtained for dark-stimulated intrathylakoid Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes, suggesting a new scenario for light-to-dark-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluxes inside chloroplasts. Hence, thylakoid-targeted aequorin reporters can provide new insights into chloroplast Ca<sup>2+</sup> storage and signal transduction. These probes represent novel tools with which to investigate the role of thylakoids in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling networks within chloroplasts and plant cells.</p>

Acclimation to Fluctuating Light Impacts the Rapidity of Response and Diurnal Rhythm of Stomatal Conductance<sup><xref>1</xref></sup>
<p>Plant acclimation to growth light environment has been studied extensively; however, the majority of these studies have focused on light intensity and photo-acclimation, with few studies exploring the impact of dynamic growth light on stomatal acclimation and behavior. To assess the impact of growth light regime on stomatal acclimation, we grew Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants in three different lighting regimes (with the same average daily intensity), fluctuating with a fixed pattern of light, fluctuating with a randomized pattern of light (sinusoidal), and nonfluctuating (square wave), to assess the effect of light regime dynamics on gas exchange. We demonstrated that <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> (stomatal conductance to water vapor) acclimation is influenced by both intensity and light pattern, modifying the stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinet</span></strong>ics at different times of the day and resulting in differences in the rapidity and magnitude of the <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> response. We also describe and quantify the response to an internal signal that uncouples variation in <i>A</i> and <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> over the majority of the diurnal period and represents 25% of the total diurnal <i>g<sub>s</sub></i>. This <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> response can be characterized by a Gaussian element and when incorporated into the widely used Ball-Berry model greatly improved the prediction of <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> in a dynamic environment. From these findings, we conclude that acclimation of <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> to growth light could be an important strategy for maintaining carbon fixation and overall plant water status and should be considered when inferring responses in the field from laboratory-based experiments.</p>

Identification of Transcriptional and Receptor Networks That Control Root Responses to Ethylene<xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>

This study identified the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinet</span></strong>ics of genome-wide transcript abundance changes in response to elevated levels of the plant hormone ethylene in roots from light-grown Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings, which were overlaid on time-matched developmental changes. Functional annotation of clusters of transcripts with similar temporal patterns revealed rapidly induced clusters with known ethylene function and more slowly regulated clusters with novel predicted functions linked to root development. In contrast to studies with dark-grown seedlings, where the canonical ethylene response transcription factor, EIN3, is central to ethylene-mediated development, the roots of <i>ein3</i> and <i>eil1</i> single and double mutants still respond to ethylene in light-grown seedlings. Additionally, a subset of these clusters of ethylene-responsive transcripts were enriched in targets of EIN3 and ERFs. These results are consistent with EIN3-independent developmental and transcriptional changes in light-grown roots. Examination of single and multiple gain-of-function and loss-of-function receptor mutants revealed that, of the five ethylene receptors, ETR1 controls lateral root and root hair initiation and elongation and the synthesis of other receptors. These results provide new insight into the transcriptional and developmental responses to ethylene in light-grown seedlings.</p>

This first crystal structure of a monocotyledonous PAL displayed a unique conformation in its flexible inner loop of the 4-methylidene-imidazole-5-one (MIO) domain compared with that of dicotyledonous plants. The side chain of histidine-123 in the MIO domain dictated the distance between the catalytic MIO prosthetic group created from <sup>189</sup>Ala-Ser-Gly<sup>191</sup> residues and the bound <sc>l</sc>-phenylalanine and <sc>l</sc>-tyrosine, conferring the deamination reaction through either the Friedel-Crafts or E<sub>2</sub> reaction mechanism. Several recombinant mutant SbPAL1 enzymes were generated via structure-guided mutagenesis, one of which, H123F-SbPAL1, has 6.2 times greater PAL activity without significant TAL activity. Additional PAL isozymes of sorghum were characterized and categorized into three groups. Taken together, this approach identified critical residues and explained substrate preferences among PAL isozymes in sorghum and other monocots, which can serve as the basis for the engineering of plants with enhanced biomass conversion properties, disease resistance, or nutritional quality.</p>

Leaf and Plant Age Affects Photosynthetic Performance and Photoprotective Capacity
<p>In this work, we studied the changes in high-light tolerance and photosynthetic activity in leaves of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) rosette throughout the vegetative stage of growth. We implemented an image-analysis work flow to analyze the capacity of both the whole plant and individual leaves to cope with excess excitation energy by following the changes in absorbed light energy partitioning. The data show that leaf and plant age are both important factors influencing the fate of excitation energy. During the dark-to-light transition, the age of the plant affects mostly steady-state levels of photochemical and nonphotochemical quenching, leading to an increased photosynthetic performance of its leaves. The age of the leaf affects the induction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinet</span></strong>ics of nonphotochemical quenching. These observations were confirmed using model selection procedures. We further investigated how different leaves on a rosette acclimate to high light and show that younger leaves are less prone to photoinhibition than older leaves. Our results stress that both plant and leaf age should be taken into consideration during the quantification of photosynthetic and photoprotective traits to produce repeatable and reliable results.</p>

Impaired Malate and Fumarate Accumulation Due to the Mutation of the Tonoplast Dicarboxylate Transporter Has Little Effects on Stomatal Behavior
<p>Malate is a central metabolite involved in a multiplicity of plant metabolic pathways, being associated with mitochondrial metabolism and playing significant roles in stomatal movements. Vacuolar malate transport has been characterized at the molecular level and is performed by at least one carrier protein and two channels in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) vacuoles. The absence of the Arabidopsis tonoplast Dicarboxylate Transporter (tDT) in the <i>tdt</i> knockout mutant was associated previously with an impaired accumulation of malate and fumarate in leaves. Here, we investigated the consequences of this lower accumulation on stomatal behavior and photosynthetic capacity as well as its putative metabolic impacts. Neither the stomatal conductance nor the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinet</span></strong>ic responses to dark, light, or high CO<sub>2</sub> were highly affected in <i>tdt</i> plants. In addition, we did not observe any impact on stomatal aperture following incubation with abscisic acid, malate, or citrate. Furthermore, an effect on photosynthetic capacity was not observed in the mutant lines. However, leaf mitochondrial metabolism was affected in the <i>tdt</i> plants. Levels of the intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle were altered, and increases in both light and dark respiration were observed. We conclude that manipulation of the tonoplastic organic acid transporter impacted mitochondrial metabolism, while the overall stomatal and photosynthetic capacity were unaffected.</p>

Phloem Loading through Plasmodesmata: A Biophysical Analysis
<p>In many species, Suc en route out of the leaf migrates from photosynthetically active mesophyll cells into the phloem down its concentration gradient via plasmodesmata, i.e. symplastically. In some of these plants, the process is entirely passive, but in others phloem Suc is actively converted into larger sugars, raffinose and stachyose, and segregated (trapped), thus raising total phloem sugar concentration to a level higher than in the mesophyll. Questions remain regarding the mechanisms and selective advantages conferred by both of these symplastic-loading processes. Here, we present an integrated model—including local and global transport and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinet</span></strong>ics of polymerization—for passive and active symplastic loading. We also propose a physical model of transport through the plasmodesmata. With these models, we predict that (1) relative to passive loading, polymerization of Suc in the phloem, even in the absence of segregation, lowers the sugar content in the leaf required to achieve a given export rate and accelerates export for a given concentration of Suc in the mesophyll and (2) segregation of oligomers and the inverted gradient of total sugar content can be achieved for physiologically reasonable parameter values, but even higher export rates can be accessed in scenarios in which polymers are allowed to diffuse back into the mesophyll. We discuss these predictions in relation to further studies aimed at the clarification of loading mechanisms, fitness of active and passive symplastic loading, and potential targets for engineering improved rates of export.</p>

The Enzyme Activity and Substrate Specificity of Two Major Cinnamyl Alcohol Dehydrogenases in Sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>), SbCAD2 and SbCAD4
<p>Cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) catalyzes the final step in monolignol biosynthesis, reducing sinapaldehyde, coniferaldehyde, and <i>p</i>-coumaraldehyde to their corresponding alcohols in an NADPH-dependent manner. Because of its terminal location in monolignol biosynthesis, the variation in substrate specificity and activity of CAD can result in significant changes in overall composition and amount of lignin. Our in-depth characterization of two major CAD isoforms, SbCAD2 (Brown midrib 6 [bmr6]) and SbCAD4, in lignifying tissues of sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>), a strategic plant for generating renewable chemicals and fuels, indicates their similarity in both structure and activity to Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) CAD5 and <i>Populus tremuloides</i> sinapyl alcohol dehydrogenase, respectively. This first crystal structure of a monocot CAD combined with enzyme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinet</span></strong>ic data and a catalytic model supported by site-directed mutagenesis allows full comparison with dicot CADs and elucidates the potential signature sequence for their substrate specificity and activity. The L119W/G301F-SbCAD4 double mutant displayed its substrate preference in the order coniferaldehyde > <i>p</i>-coumaraldehyde > sinapaldehyde, with higher catalytic efficiency than that of both wild-type SbCAD4 and SbCAD2. As SbCAD4 is the only major CAD isoform in <i>bmr6</i> mutants, replacing SbCAD4 with L119W/G301F-SbCAD4 in <i>bmr6</i> plants could produce a phenotype that is more amenable to biomass processing.</p>

The C-Domain of Oleuropein <i>β</i>-Glucosidase Assists in Protein Folding and Sequesters the Enzyme in Nucleus<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Oleuropein, a terpene-derived glycosylated secoiridoid biosynthesized exclusively by members of the Oleaceae family, is involved in a two-component defense system comprising a β-glucosidase that activates oleuropein into a toxic glutaraldehyde-like structure. Oleuropein and its deglycosylated derivatives have high pharmaceutical interest. In this study we determined that the in planta heterologous expressed OeGLU, an oleuropein-specific β-glucosidase from olive (<i>Olea europaea</i>), had enzymatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinet</span></strong>ics similar to the olive native enzyme. The C terminus encompassing the nuclear localization signal sequesters the enzyme in the nucleus, and predetermines the protein-protein recognition and homodimerization. Biochemical analysis revealed that OeGLU is a homomultimer with high <i>M</i><sub>r</sub>. In silico prediction modeling of the complex structure and bimolecular fluorescence complementation analyses revealed that the C terminus of OeGLU is essential for the proper assembly of an octameric form, a key conformational feature that determines the activity of the enzyme. Our results demonstrate that intrinsic characteristics of the OeGLU ensure separation from oleuropein and keep the dual-partner defensive system conditionally inactive. Upon cell destruction, the dual-partner defense system is activated and olive massively releases the arsenal of defense.</p>

An R2R3-MYB Transcription Factor Regulates Capsaicinoid Biosynthesis
<p>Capsaicinoids are responsible for the hot taste of chili peppers. They are restricted to the genus <i>Capsicum</i> and are synthesized by the acylation of the aromatic compound vanillylamine (derived from the phenylpropanoid pathway) with a branched-chain fatty acid by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalysi</span></strong>s of the putative enzyme capsaicinoid synthase. R2R3-MYB transcription factors have been reported in different species of plants as regulators of structural genes of the phenylpropanoid pathway; therefore, we hypothesized that MYB genes might be involved in the regulation of the biosynthesis of pungent compounds. In this study, an <i>R2R3-MYB</i> transcription factor gene, designated <i>CaMYB31</i>, was isolated and characterized in <i>Capsicum annuum</i> ‘Tampiqueíííéóéííóéíño 74’. Bioinformatic analysis suggested that <i>CaMYB31</i> could be involved in secondary metabolism, stress and plant hormone responses, and development. <i>CaMYB31</i> expression analysis from placental tissue of pungent and nonpungent chili pepper fruits showed a positive correlation with the structural genes <i>Ca4H</i>, <i>Comt</i>, <i>Kas</i>, <i>pAmt</i>, and <i>AT3</i> expression and also with the content of capsaicin and dihydrocapsacin during fruit development. However, <i>CaMYB31</i> also was expressed in vegetative tissues (leaves, roots, and stems). Moreover, <i>CaMYB31</i> silencing significantly reduced the expression of capsaicinoid biosynthetic genes and the capsaicinoid content. Additionally, <i>CaMYB31</i> expression was affected by the plant hormones indoleacetic acid, jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, and gibberellic acid or by wounding, temperature, and light, factors known to affect the production of capsaicinoids. These findings indicate that <i>CaMYB31</i> is indeed involved in the regulation of structural genes of the capsaicinoid biosynthetic pathway.</p>

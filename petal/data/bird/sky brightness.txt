Basal aurora kinase B activity is sufficient for histone H3 phosphorylation in prophase
<p>Histone H3 phosphorylation is the hallmark of mitosis deposited by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aurora</span></strong> kinase B. Benzo[e]pyridoindoles are a family of potent, broad, ATP-competitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aurora</span></strong> kinase inhibitors. However, benzo[e]pyridoindole C4 only inhibits histone H3 phosphorylation in prophase but not in metaphase. Under the C4 treatment, the cells enter into mitosis with dephosphorylated histone H3, assemble chromosomes normally and progress to metaphase, and then to anaphase. C4 also induces lagging chromosome in anaphase but we demonstrated that these chromosome compaction defects are not related to the absence of H3 phosphorylation in prophase. As a result of C4 action, mitosis lasts longer and the cell cycle is slowed down.</p><p>We reproduced the mitotic defects with reduced concentrations of potent pan <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aurora</span></strong> kinase as well as with a specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aurora</span></strong> B ATP-competitive inhibitor; we therefore propose that histone H3 phosphorylation and anaphase chromosome compaction involve the basal activity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aurora</span></strong> kinase B. Our data suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aurora</span></strong> kinase B is progressively activated at mitosis entry and at anaphase onset. The full activation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aurora</span></strong> kinase B by its partners, in prometaphase, induces a shift in the catalytic domain of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aurora</span></strong> B that modifies its affinity for ATP. These waves of activation/deactivation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aurora</span></strong> B correspond to different conformations of the chromosomal complex revealed by FRAP.</p><p>The presence of lagging chromosomes may have deleterious consequences on the daughter cells and, unfortunately, the situation may be encountered in patients receiving treatment with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aurora</span></strong> kinase inhibitors.</p>

Phosphorylation of MAP65-1 by Arabidopsis Aurora Kinases Is Required for Efficient Cell Cycle Progression
<p>Aurora kinases are key effectors of mitosis. Plant Auroras are functionally divided into two clades. The alpha Auroras (Aurora1 and Aurora2) associate with the spindle and the cell plate and are implicated in controlling formative divisions throughout plant development. The beta Aurora (Aurora3) localizes to centromeres and likely functions in chromosome separation. In contrast to the wealth of data available on the role of Aurora in other kingdoms, knowledge on their function in plants is merely emerging. This is exemplified by the fact that only histone H3 and the plant homolog of TPX2 have been identified as Aurora substrates in plants. Here we provide biochemical, genetic, and cell biological evidence that the microtubule-bundling protein MAP65-1—a member of the MAP65/Ase1/PRC1 protein family, implicated in central spindle formation and cytokinesis in animals, yeasts, and plants—is a genuine substrate of alpha Aurora kinases. MAP65-1 interacts with Aurora1 in vivo and is phosphorylated on two residues at its unfolded tail domain. Its overexpression and down-regulation antagonistically affect the alpha Aurora double mutant phenotypes. Phospho-mutant analysis shows that Aurora contributes to the microtubule bundling capacity of MAP65-1 in concert with other mitotic kinases.</p>

Thresholds for Ambulatory Blood Pressure Among African Americans in the Jackson Heart Study
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring is the reference standard for out-of-clinic BP measurement.

We determined BP thresholds for ambulatory hypertension in a US population-based sample of African American adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We analyzed data from the Jackson Heart Study, a population-based cohort study comprised exclusively of African American adults (n=5306). Analyses were restricted to 1016 participants who completed ambulatory BP monitoring at baseline in 2000 to 2004. Mean SBP and DBP levels were calculated for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">daytim</span></strong>e (10:00 am–8:00 pm), 24-hour (all available readings), and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">night</span></strong>time (mid<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">night</span></strong>–6:00 am) periods, separately. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">daytim</span></strong>e, 24-hour, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">night</span></strong>time BP thresholds for ambulatory hypertension were identified using regression- and outcome-derived approaches. The composite of a cardiovascular disease or an all-cause mortality event was used in the outcome-derived approach. For this latter approach, BP thresholds were identified only for SBP because clinic DBP was not associated with the outcome.

Effect of Time of Day on Prehospital Care and Outcomes After Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>More than 300 000 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA) occur each year in the United States. The relationship between time of day and OHCA outcomes in the prehospital setting is unknown. Any such association may have important implications for emergency medical services resource allocation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We performed a retrospective review of cardiac arrest data from a large, urban emergency medical services system. Included were OHCA occurring in adults from January 2008 to February 2012. Excluded were traumatic arrests and cases in which resuscitation measures were not performed.

A relative risk regression model was used to evaluate the association between time of day and prehospital return of spontaneous circulation and 30-day survival, with adjustment for clinically relevant predictors of survival. Among the 4789 included cases, 1962 (41.0%) occurred at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">night</span></strong>. Mean age was 63.8 years (SD, 17.4 years); 54.5% were male. Patients with an OHCA occurring at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">night</span></strong> did not have significantly lower rates of prehospital return of spontaneous circulation compared with patients having <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">daytim</span></strong>e arrests (11.6% versus 12.8%; <i>P</i>=0.20). However, rates of 30-day survival were significantly lower at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">night</span></strong> (8.56% versus 10.9%; <i>P</i>=0.02).

Global assessment of its network dynamics reveals that the kinase Plk1 inhibits the phosphatase PP6 to promote Aurora A activity
<p>Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is an essential protein kinase that promotes faithful mitotic progression in eukaryotes. The subcellular localization and substrate interactions of Plk1 are tightly controlled and require its binding to phosphorylated residues. To identify phosphorylation-dependent interactions within the Plk1 network in human mitotic cells, we performed quantitative proteomics on HeLa cells cultured with kinase inhibitors or expressing a Plk1 mutant that was deficient in phosphorylation-dependent substrate binding. We found that many interactions were abolished upon kinase inhibition; however, a subset was protected from phosphatase opposition or was unopposed, resulting in persistent interaction of the substrate with Plk1. This subset includes phosphoprotein phosphatase 6 (PP6), whose activity toward Aurora kinase A (Aurora A) was inhibited by Plk1. Our data suggest that this Plk1-PP6 interaction generates a feedback loop that coordinates and reinforces the activities of Plk1 and Aurora A during mitotic entry and is terminated by the degradation of Plk1 during mitotic exit. Thus, we have identified a mechanism for the previously puzzling observation of the Plk1-dependent regulation of Aurora A.</p>

Circadian, Carbon, and Light Control of Expansion Growth and Leaf Movement
<p>We used Phytotyping<sup>4D</sup> to investigate the contribution of clock and light signaling to the diurnal regulation of rosette expansion growth and leaf movement in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Wild-type plants and clock mutants with a short (<i>lhycca1</i>) and long (<i>prr7prr9</i>) period were analyzed in a T24 cycle and in T-cycles that were closer to the mutants’ period. Wild types also were analyzed in various photoperiods and after transfer to free-running light or darkness. Rosette expansion and leaf movement exhibited a circadian oscillation, with superimposed transients after dawn and dusk. Diurnal responses were modified in clock mutants. <i>lhycca1</i> exhibited an inhibition of growth at the end of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">night</span></strong> and growth rose earlier after dawn, whereas <i>prr7prr9</i> showed decreased growth for the first part of the light period. Some features were partly rescued by a matching T-cycle, like the inhibition in <i>lhycca1</i> at the end of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">night</span></strong>, indicating that it is due to premature exhaustion of starch. Other features were not rescued, revealing that the clock also regulates expansion growth more directly. Expansion growth was faster at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">night</span></strong> than in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">daytim</span></strong>e, whereas published work has shown that the synthesis of cellular components is faster in the day than at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">night</span></strong>time. This temporal uncoupling became larger in short photoperiods and may reflect the differing dependence of expansion and biosynthesis on energy, carbon, and water. While it has been proposed that leaf expansion and movement are causally linked, we did not observe a consistent temporal relationship between expansion and leaf movement.</p>

Night-Break Experiments Shed Light on the Photoperiod1-Mediated Flowering
<p>Plants utilize variation in day length (photoperiod) to anticipate seasonal changes. They respond by modulating their growth and development to maximize seed production, which in cereal crops is directly related to yield. In wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>), the acceleration of flowering under long days (LD) is dependent on the light induction of <i>PHOTOPERIOD1</i> (<i>PPD1</i>) by phytochromes. Under LD, <i>PPD1</i> activates <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T1</i> (<i>FT1</i>), a mobile signaling protein that travels from the leaves to the shoot apical meristem to promote flowering. Here, we show that the interruption of long <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">night</span></strong>s by short pulses of light (“<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">night</span></strong>-break” [NB]) accelerates wheat flowering, suggesting that the duration of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">night</span></strong> is critical for wheat photoperiodic response. <i>PPD1</i> transcription was rapidly upregulated by NBs, and the magnitude of this induction increased with the length of darkness preceding the NB. Cycloheximide abolished the NB up-regulation of <i>PPD1</i>, suggesting that this process is dependent on active protein synthesis during darkness. While one NB was sufficient to induce <i>PPD1</i>, more than 15 NBs were required to induce high levels of <i>FT1</i> expression and a strong acceleration of flowering. Multiple NBs did not affect the expression of core circadian clock genes. The acceleration of flowering by NB disappeared in <i>ppd1-</i>null mutants, demonstrating that this response is mediated by <i>PPD1</i>. The acceleration of flowering was strongest when NBs were applied in the middle of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">night</span></strong>, suggesting that in addition to <i>PPD1</i>, other circadian-controlled factors are required for the up-regulation of <i>FT1</i> expression and the acceleration of flowering.</p>

Zones, spots, and planetary-scale waves beating in brown dwarf atmospheres

A TGFβ–miR-182–BRCA1 axis controls the mammary differentiation hierarchy
<p>Maintenance of mammary functional capacity during cycles of proliferation and regression depends on appropriate cell fate decisions of mammary progenitor cells to populate an epithelium consisting of secretory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lumin</span></strong>al cells and contractile myoepithelial cells. It is well established that transforming growth factor–β (TGFβ) restricts mammary epithelial cell proliferation and that sensitivity to TGFβ is decreased in breast cancer. We show that TGFβ also exerts control of mammary progenitor self-renewal and lineage commitment decisions by stringent regulation of breast cancer associated 1 (BRCA1), which controls stem cell self-renewal and lineage commitment. Either genetic depletion of <i>Tgfb1</i> or transient blockade of TGFβ increased self-renewal of mammary progenitor cells in mice, cultured primary mammary epithelial cells, and also skewed lineage commitment toward the myoepithelial fate. TGFβ stabilized the abundance of BRCA1 by reducing the abundance of microRNA-182 (miR-182). Ectopic expression of BRCA1 or antagonism of miR-182 in cultured TGFβ-deficient mammary epithelial cells restored <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lumin</span></strong>al lineage commitment. These findings reveal that TGFβ modulation of BRCA1 directs mammary epithelial cell fate and, because stem or progenitor cells are thought to be the cell of origin for aggressive breast cancer subtypes, suggest that TGFβ dysregulation during tumorigenesis may promote distinct breast cancer subtypes.</p>

Aurora B opposes PP1 function in mitosis by phosphorylating the conserved PP1-binding RVxF motif in PP1 regulatory proteins
<p>Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) is a highly conserved protein phosphatase that performs most of the serine- and threonine-dephosphorylation reactions in eukaryotes and opposes the actions of a diverse set of serine and threonine (Ser-Thr) protein kinases. PP1 gains substrate specificity through binding to a large number (>200) of regulatory proteins that control PP1 localization, activity, and interactions with substrates. PP1 recognizes the well-characterized RVxF binding motif that is present in many of these regulatory proteins, thus generating a multitude of distinct PP1 holoenzymes. We showed that a subset of the RVxF binding motifs, in which x is a phosphorylatable amino acid (RV[S/T]F), was phosphorylated specifically during mitosis and that this phosphorylation event abrogated the interaction of PP1 with the regulatory protein. We determined that this phosphorylation was primarily governed by the mitotic protein kinase Aurora B and that high phosphorylation site stoichiometry of these sites maintained the phosphorylation of PP1 substrates during mitosis by disrupting the assembly of PP1 holoenzymes. We generated an antibody that recognizes the phosphorylated form of the RV[S/T]F motif (RVp[S/T]F) and used it to identify known PP1 regulatory proteins (KNL1, CDCA2, and RIF1) and multiple proteins that could potentially act as PP1 binding partners (UBR5, ASPM, SEH1, and ELYS) governed by this mechanism. Together, these data suggest a general regulatory mechanism by which the coordinated activities of Aurora B and PP1 control mitotic progression.</p>

Structure of the posttranslational Sec protein-translocation channel complex from yeast
<p>The Sec61 protein-conducting channel mediates transport of many proteins, such as secretory proteins, across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane during or after translation. Posttranslational transport is enabled by two additional membrane proteins associated with the channel, Sec63 and Sec62, but its mechanism is poorly understood. We determined a structure of the Sec complex (Sec61-Sec63-Sec71-Sec72) from <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> by cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The structure shows that Sec63 tightly associates with Sec61 through interactions in cytosolic, transmembrane, and ER-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lumin</span></strong>al domains, prying open Sec61’s lateral gate and translocation pore and thus activating the channel for substrate engagement. Furthermore, Sec63 optimally positions binding sites for cytosolic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lumin</span></strong>al chaperones in the complex to enable efficient polypeptide translocation. Our study provides mechanistic insights into eukaryotic posttranslational protein translocation.</p>

Hierarchically porous polymer coatings for highly efficient passive daytime radiative cooling

We present a simple, inexpensive, and scalable phase inversion–based method for fabricating hierarchically porous poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropene) [P(VdF-HFP)<sub>HP</sub>] coatings with excellent PDRC capability. High, substrate-independent hemispherical solar reflectances (0.96 ± 0.03) and long-wave infrared emittances (0.97 ± 0.02) allow for subambient temperature drops of ~6°C and cooling powers of ~96 watts per square meter (W m<sup>−2</sup>) under solar intensities of 890 and 750 W m<sup>−2</sup>, respectively. The performance equals or surpasses those of state-of-the-art PDRC designs, and the technique offers a paint-like simplicity.</p>

A mitosis-specific and R loop–driven ATR pathway promotes faithful chromosome segregation
<p>The ataxia telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase is crucial for DNA damage and replication stress responses. Here, we describe an unexpected role of ATR in mitosis. Acute inhibition or degradation of ATR in mitosis induces whole-chromosome missegregation. The effect of ATR ablation is not due to altered cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) activity, DNA damage responses, or unscheduled DNA synthesis but to loss of an ATR function at centromeres. In mitosis, ATR localizes to centromeres through Aurora A–regulated association with centromere protein F (CENP-F), allowing ATR to engage replication protein A (RPA)–coated centromeric R loops. As ATR is activated at centromeres, it stimulates Aurora B through Chk1, preventing formation of lagging chromosomes. Thus, a mitosis-specific and R loop–driven ATR pathway acts at centromeres to promote faithful chromosome segregation, revealing functions of R loops and ATR in suppressing chromosome instability.</p>

Phytochromes function as thermosensors in <i>Arabidopsis</i>
<p>Plants are responsive to temperature, and some species can distinguish differences of 1°C. In <i>Arabidopsis</i>, warmer temperature accelerates flowering and increases elongation growth (thermomorphogenesis). However, the mechanisms of temperature perception are largely unknown. We describe a major thermosensory role for the phytochromes (red light receptors) during the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">night</span></strong>. Phytochrome null plants display a constitutive warm-temperature response, and consistent with this, we show in this background that the warm-temperature transcriptome becomes derepressed at low temperatures. We found that phytochrome B (phyB) directly associates with the promoters of key target genes in a temperature-dependent manner. The rate of phyB inactivation is proportional to temperature in the dark, enabling phytochromes to function as thermal timers that integrate temperature information over the course of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">night</span></strong>.</p>

ABI5-BINDING PROTEIN2 Coordinates CONSTANS to Delay Flowering by Recruiting the Transcriptional Corepressor TPR2
<p>ABI5-BINDING PROTEIN2 (AFP2) negatively regulates the abscisic acid signal by accelerating ABI5 degradation during seed germination in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The abscisic acid signal is reported to delay flowering by up-regulating <i>Flowering Locus C</i> expression, but the role of AFP2 in regulating flowering time is unknown. Here, we found that flowering time was markedly delayed and <i>CONSTANS</i> (<i>CO</i>) expression was reduced in a transgenic Arabidopsis line overexpressing <i>AFP2</i> under LD conditions. Conversely, the loss-of-function <i>afp2</i> mutant showed slightly earlier flowering, with higher <i>CO</i> expression. These data suggest that <i>AFP2</i> negatively regulates photoperiod-dependent flowering time by modulating the CO signal. We then found that <i>AFP2</i> exhibited circadian expression rhythms that peaked during the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">night</span></strong>. Furthermore, the C-terminus of AFP2 interacted with CO, while its N-terminal ethylene response factor–associated amphiphilic repression motif interacted with the transcriptional corepressor TOPLESS-related protein2 (TPR2). Thus, AFP2 bridges CO and TPR2 to form the CO-AFP2-TPR2 complex. Biochemical and genetic analyses showed that AFP2 mediated CO degradation during the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">night</span></strong>. AFP2 also recruited histone deacetylase activity at <i>Flowering Locus T</i> chromatin through its interaction with TPR2. Taken together, our results reveal an elaborate mechanism by which AFP2 modulates flowering time through coordinating the activity and stability of CO.</p>

Endocrine regulation of carbonate precipitate formation in marine fish intestine by stanniocalcin and PTHrP
<p>In marine fish, high epithelial bicarbonate secretion by the intestine generates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lumin</span></strong>al carbonate precipitates of divalent cations that play a key role in water and ion homeostasis. <i>In vitro</i> studies highlight the involvement of the calciotropic hormones PTHrP (parathyroid hormone-related protein) and stanniocalcin (STC) in the regulation of epithelial bicarbonate transport. The present study tested the hypothesis that calciotropic hormones have a regulatory role in carbonate precipitate formation <i>in vivo</i>. Sea bream (<i>Sparus aurata</i>) juveniles received single intraperitoneal injections of piscine PTHrP(1–34), the PTH/PTHrP receptor antagonist PTHrP(7–34) or purified sea bream STC, or were passively immunized with polyclonal rabbit antisera raised against sea bream STC (STC-Ab). Endocrine effects on the expression of the basolateral sodium bicarbonate co-transporter (Slc4a4.A), the apical anion exchangers Slc26a6.A and Slc26a3.B, and the V-type proton pump β-subunit (Atp6v1b) in the anterior intestine were evaluated. In keeping with their calciotropic nature, the hypocalcaemic factors PTHrP(7–34) and STC up-regulated gene expression of all transporters. In contrast, the hypercalcaemic factor PTHrP(1–34) and STC antibodies down-regulated transporters involved in the bicarbonate secretion cascade. Changes in intestine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lumin</span></strong>al precipitate contents provoked by calcaemic endocrine factors validated these results: 24 h post-injection either PTHrP(1–34) or immunization with STC-Ab reduced the carbonate precipitate content in the sea bream intestine. In contrast, the PTH/PTHrP receptor antagonist PTHrP(7–34) increased not only the precipitated fraction but also the concentration of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> equivalents in the intestinal fluid. These results confirm the hypothesis that calciotropic hormones have a regulatory role in carbonate precipitate formation <i>in vivo</i> in the intestine of marine fish. Furthermore, they illustrate for the first time in fish the counteracting effect of PTHrP and STC, and reveal an unexpected contribution of calcaemic factors to acid–base balance.</p>

Adherence to Antihypertensive Treatment and the Blood Pressure–Lowering Effects of Renal Denervation in the Renal Denervation for Hypertension (DENERHTN) Trial
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The DENERHTN trial (Renal Denervation for Hypertension) confirmed the blood pressure–lowering efficacy of renal denervation added to a standardized stepped-care antihypertensive treatment for resistant hypertension at 6 months.

CYP79D73 Participates in Biosynthesis of Floral Scent Compound 2-Phenylethanol in <i>Plumeria rubra</i>
<p>Plumeria (<i>Plumeria rubra</i>), well known for its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bright</span></strong>ly colored and fragrant flowers, emits a number of floral volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Plumeria flowers emit a total of 43 VOCs including nine phenylpropanoids/benzenoids, such as 2-phenylethanol (2PE), benzaldehyde, 2-phenylacetaldehyde (PAld), (<i>E/Z</i>)<i>-</i>phenylacetaldoxime (PAOx), benzyl nitrile (BN), and 2-phenylnitroethane (PN). To identify genes and pathways involved in the production of the major compound 2PE, we analyzed the plumeria floral transcriptome and found a highly expressed, flower-specific gene encoding a cytochrome P450 family 79D protein (PrCYP79D73), which catalyzed the formation of (<i>E/Z</i>)-PAOx. Feeding experiments with deuterated phenylalanine or deuterated (<i>E/Z</i>)-PAOx showed that (<i>E/Z</i>)-PAOx is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of 2PE, as are two nitrogen-containing volatiles, BN and PN, in plumeria flowers. Crude enzyme extracts from plumeria flowers converted <sc>l</sc>-phenylalanine to (<i>E/Z</i>)-PAOx, PAld, 2PE, BN, and PN. The biosynthesis of these compounds increased with addition of PrCYP79D73-enriched microsomes but was blocked by pretreatment with 4-phenylimidazole, an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 enzymes. Moreover, overexpression of <i>PrCYP79D73</i> in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> resulted in the emission of (<i>E/Z</i>)-PAOx as well as PAld, 2PE, BN, and PN, all of which were also found among plumeria floral VOCs. Taken together, our results demonstrate that PrCYP79D73 is a crucial player in the biosynthesis of the major floral VOC 2PE and other nitrogen-containing volatiles. These volatiles may be required for plant defense as well as to attract pollinators for the successful reproduction of plumeria.</p>

PGR5-Dependent Cyclic Electron Flow Protects Photosystem I under Fluctuating Light at Donor and Acceptor Sides
<p>In response to a sudden increase in light intensity, plants must cope with absorbed excess photon energy to protect photosystems from photodamage. Under fluctuating light, PSI is severely photodamaged in the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>proton gradient regulation5</i> (<i>pgr5</i>) mutant defective in the main pathway of PSI cyclic electron transport (CET). Here, we aimed to determine how PSI is protected by two proposed regulatory roles of CET via transthylakoid ΔpH formation: (1) reservation of electron sink capacity by adjusting the ATP/NADPH production ratio (acceptor-side regulation) and (2) down-regulation of the cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub><i>f</i> complex activity called photosynthetic control for slowing down the electron flow toward PSI (donor-side regulation). We artificially enhanced donor- and acceptor-side regulation in the wild-type and <i>pgr5</i> backgrounds by introducing the <i>pgr1</i> mutation conferring the hypersensitivity of the cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub><i>f</i> complex to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lumin</span></strong>al acidification and moss <i>Physcomitrella patens</i> flavodiiron protein genes, respectively. Enhanced photosynthetic control partially alleviated PSI photodamage in the <i>pgr5</i> mutant background but restricted linear electron transport under constant high light, suggesting that the strength of photosynthetic control should be optimized. Flavodiiron protein-dependent oxygen photoreduction formed a large electron sink and alleviated PSI photoinhibition, accompanied by the induction of photosynthetic control. Thus, donor-side regulation is essential for PSI photoprotection but acceptor-side regulation also is important to rapidly induce donor-side regulation. In angiosperms, PGR5-dependent CET is required for both functions.</p>

K<sup>+</sup> Efflux Antiporters 4, 5, and 6 Mediate pH and K<sup>+</sup> Homeostasis in Endomembrane Compartments
<p>KEA4, KEA5, and KEA6 are members of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) K<sup>+</sup> efflux antiporter (KEA) family that share high sequence similarity but whose function remains unknown. Here, we show their gene expression pattern, subcellular localization, and physiological function in Arabidopsis. <i>KEA4</i>, <i>KEA5</i>, and <i>KEA6</i> had similar tissue expression patterns, and the three KEA proteins localized to the Golgi, the trans-Golgi network, and the prevacuolar compartment/multivesicular bodies, suggesting overlapping roles of these proteins in the endomembrane system. Phenotypic analyses of single, double, and triple mutants confirmed functional redundancy. The triple mutant <i>kea4 kea5 kea6</i> had small rosettes, short seedlings, and was sensitive to low K<sup>+</sup> availability and to the sodicity imposed by high salinity. Also, the <i>kea4 kea5 kea6</i> mutant plants had a reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lumin</span></strong>al pH in the Golgi, trans-Golgi network, prevacuolar compartment, and vacuole, in accordance with the K/H exchange activity of KEA proteins. Genetic analysis indicated that KEA4, KEA5, and KEA6 as well as endosomal Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup>exchanger5 (NHX5) and NHX6 acted coordinately to facilitate endosomal pH homeostasis and salt tolerance. Neither cancelling nor overexpressing the vacuolar antiporters <i>NHX1</i> and <i>NHX2</i> in the <i>kea4 kea5 kea6</i> mutant background altered the salt-sensitive phenotype. The NHX1 and NHX2 proteins in the <i>kea4 kea5 kea6</i> mutant background could not suppress the acidity of the endomembrane system but brought the vacuolar pH close to wild-type values. Together, these data signify that KEA4, KEA5, and KEA6 are endosomal K<sup>+</sup> transporters functioning in maintaining pH and ion homeostasis in the endomembrane network.</p>

Diurnal Variation in Nonstructural Carbohydrate Storage in Trees: Remobilization and Vertical Mixing
<p>Nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) storage plays a critical role in tree function and survival, but understanding and predicting local NSC storage dynamics is challenging because NSC storage pools are dispersed throughout the complex architecture of trees and continuously exchange carbon between source and sink organs at different time scales. To address these knowledge gaps, characterization and understanding of NSC diel variation are necessary. Here, we analyzed diurnal NSC dynamics in the overall architecture of almond (<i>Prunus dulcis</i>) trees. We also analyzed the allocation of newly assimilated carbon using isotopic labeling. We show that both components of NSC (i.e. soluble carbohydrates and starch) are highly dynamic at the diurnal time scale and that these trends are influenced by tissue type, age, and/or position within the canopy. In leaves, starch reserves can be depleted completely during the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">night</span></strong>, while woody tissue starch levels may vary by more than 50% over a daily cycle. Recently assimilated carbon showed a dispersed downward allocation across the entire tree. NSC diurnal fluctuations within the tree’s structure in combination with dispersed carbon allocation patterns provide evidence for the presence of vertical mixing and suggest that the xylem acts as a secondary NSC redistribution pathway.</p>

Reduced Arogenate Dehydratase Expression: Ramifications for Photosynthesis and Metabolism
<p>Arogenate dehydratase (ADT) catalyzes the final step of phenylalanine (Phe) biosynthesis. Previous work showed that ADT-deficient Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants had significantly reduced lignin contents, with stronger reductions in lines that had deficiencies in more ADT isoforms. Here, by analyzing Arabidopsis <i>ADT</i> mutants using our phenomics facility and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, we describe the effects of the modulation of ADT on photosynthetic parameters and secondary metabolism. Our data indicate that a reduced carbon flux into Phe biosynthesis in <i>ADT</i> mutants impairs the consumption of photosynthetically produced ATP, leading to an increased ATP/ADP ratio, the overaccumulation of transitory starch, and lower electron transport rates. The effect on electron transport rates is caused by an increase in proton motive force across the thylakoid membrane that down-regulates photosystem II activity by the high-energy quenching mechanism. Furthermore, quantitation of secondary metabolites in <i>ADT</i> mutants revealed reduced flavonoid, phenylpropanoid, lignan, and glucosinolate contents, including glucosinolates that are not derived from aromatic amino acids, and significantly increased contents of putative galactolipids and apocarotenoids. Additionally, we used real-time atmospheric monitoring mass spectrometry to compare respiration and carbon fixation rates between the wild type and <i>adt3/4/5/6</i>, our most extreme <i>ADT</i> knockout mutant, which revealed no significant difference in both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">night</span></strong>- and day-adapted plants. Overall, these data reveal the profound effects of altered ADT activity and Phe metabolism on secondary metabolites and photosynthesis with implications for plant improvement.</p>

Heterologous Expression of <i>AtBBX21</i> Enhances the Rate of Photosynthesis and Alleviates Photoinhibition in <i>Solanum</i> <i>tuberosum</i><xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>B-box (BBX) proteins are zinc-finger transcription factors containing one or two B-box motifs. BBX proteins act as key factors in the networks regulating growth and development. The relevance of BBX21 to light and abscisic acid signaling in seedling development is well established; however, its importance in adult plant development and agronomic species is poorly understood. Therefore, we studied the effect of heterologous expression of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>BBX21</i> in potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>) var Spunta. Three independent <i>AtBBX21-</i>expressing lines and the wild-type control were cultivated under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sunlight</span></strong> and at controlled temperatures in a greenhouse. By anatomical, physiological, biochemical, and gene expression analysis, we demonstrated that <i>AtBBX21</i>-expressing plants were more robust and produced more tubers than wild-type plants. Interestingly, <i>AtBBX21-</i>expressing plants had higher rates of photosynthesis, with a significant increase in photosynthetic gene expression, and higher stomatal conductance, with increased size of the stomatal opening, without any associated decline in water use efficiency. Furthermore, <i>AtBBX21</i>-expressing potato plants had reduced photoinhibition associated with higher production of anthocyanins and phenolic compounds, and higher expression of genes in the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway. To gain insights into the mechanism of BBX21, we evaluated the molecular, morphological, metabolic, and photosynthetic behavior in adult <i>BBX21-</i>overexpressing Arabidopsis. We conclude that <i>BBX21</i> overexpression improved morphological and physiological attributes, and photosynthetic rates in nonoptimal, high-irradiance conditions, without associated impairment of water use efficiency. These characteristics of BBX21 may be useful for increasing production of potatoes, and potentially of other crops.</p>

Mitochondria Affect Photosynthetic Electron Transport and Photosensitivity in a Green Alga
<p>Photosynthetic organisms use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sunlight</span></strong> as the primary source of energy to support their metabolism. In eukaryotes, reactions responsible of the conversion of light into chemical energy occur in specific organelles, the chloroplasts. In this study, we showed that mitochondria also have a seminal influence on cells’ energy metabolism and on photosynthetic reactions. This is illustrated by the observation that the strong photosensitivity of <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> cells depleted of the chloroplast protein PGRL1 was rescued by the introduction of a mitochondrial mutation affecting respiratory complex I. Functional analysis showed that such a reduced respiratory activity influenced chloroplast electron transport with consequent overreduction of plastoquinone and donor-side limitation of photosystem I (PSI). As a consequence, damage due to excess light affected more photosystem II (PSII) rather than PSI. Double mutant cells are able to grow under excess il<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lumin</span></strong>ation, while single <i>pgrl1</i> are not, thanks to the presence of an efficient repair mechanism of PSII. These results also underline the seminal biological relevance of the regulation of electron transport reactions within the photosynthetic complexes. Photosynthetic organisms evolved a strategy to respond to excess light where damage is targeting preferentially to a specific complex, PSII. Cells are able to endure extensive damage targeting this complex thanks to an efficient repair mechanisms, while if PSI is affected, there are drastic consequences on growth.</p>

Linking PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR to Histone Modification in Plant Shade Avoidance
<p>Shade avoidance syndrome (SAS) allows a plant grown in a densely populated environment to maximize opportunities to access to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sunlight</span></strong>. Although it is well established that SAS is accompanied by gene expression changes, the underlying molecular mechanism needs to be elucidated. Here, we identify the H3K4me3/H3K36me3-binding proteins, Morf Related Gene (MRG) group proteins MRG1 and MRG2, as positive regulators of shade-induced hypocotyl elongation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). MRG2 binds PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR7 (PIF7) and regulates the expression of several common downstream target genes, including <i>YUCCA8</i> and <i>IAA19</i> involved in the auxin biosynthesis or response pathway and <i>PRE1</i> involved in brassinosteroid regulation of cell elongation. In response to shade, PIF7 and MRG2 are enriched at the promoter and gene-body regions and are necessary for increase of histone H4 and H3 acetylation to promote target gene expression. Our study uncovers a mechanism in which the shade-responsive factor PIF7 recruits MRG1/MRG2 that binds H3K4me3/H3K36me3 and brings histone-acetylases to induce histone acetylations to promote expression of shade responsive genes, providing thus a molecular mechanistic link coupling the environmental light to epigenetic modification in regulation of hypocotyl elongation in plant SAS.</p>

Variation in Leaf Respiration Rates at Night Correlates with Carbohydrate and Amino Acid Supply
<p>Plant respiration can theoretically be fueled by and dependent upon an array of central metabolism components; however, which ones are responsible for the quantitative variation found in respiratory rates is unknown. Here, large-scale screens revealed 2-fold variation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">night</span></strong>time leaf respiration rate (R<sub>N</sub>) among mature leaves from an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) natural accession collection grown under common favorable conditions. R<sub>N</sub> variation was mostly maintained in the absence of genetic variation, which emphasized the low heritability of R<sub>N</sub> and its plasticity toward relatively small environmental differences within the sampling regime. To pursue metabolic explanations for leaf R<sub>N</sub> variation, parallel metabolite level profiling and assays of total protein and starch were performed. Within an accession, R<sub>N</sub> correlated strongly with stored carbon substrates, including starch and dicarboxylic acids, as well as sucrose, major amino acids, shikimate, and salicylic acid. Among different accessions, metabolite-R<sub>N</sub> correlations were maintained with protein, sucrose, and major amino acids but not stored carbon substrates. A complementary screen of the effect of exogenous metabolites and effectors on leaf R<sub>N</sub> revealed that (1) R<sub>N</sub> is stimulated by the uncoupler FCCP and high levels of substrates, demonstrating that both adenylate turnover and substrate supply can limit leaf R<sub>N</sub>, and (2) inorganic nitrogen did not stimulate R<sub>N</sub>, consistent with limited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">night</span></strong>time nitrogen assimilation. Simultaneous measurements of R<sub>N</sub> and protein synthesis revealed that these processes were largely uncorrelated in mature leaves. These results indicate that differences in preceding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">daytim</span></strong>e metabolic activities are the major source of variation in mature leaf R<sub>N</sub> under favorable controlled conditions.</p>

Unique Motifs and Length of Hairpin in Oleosin Target the Cytosolic Side of Endoplasmic Reticulum and Budding Lipid Droplet
<p>Plant cytosolic lipid droplets (LDs) are covered with a layer of phospholipids and oleosin and were extensively studied before those in mammals and yeast. Oleosin has short amphipathic N- and C-terminal peptides flanking a conserved 72-residue hydrophobic hairpin, which penetrates and stabilizes the LD. Oleosin is synthesized on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and extracts ER-budding LDs to cytosol. To delineate the mechanism of oleosin targeting ER-LD, we have expressed modified-oleosin genes in <i>Physcomitrella patens</i> for transient expression and tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) BY2 cells for stable transformation. The results have identified oleosin motifs for targeting ER-LD and oleosin as the sole molecule responsible for budding-LD entering cytosol. Both the N-terminal and C-terminal peptides are not required for the targeting. The hairpin, including its entire length, initial N-portion residues, and hairpin-loop of three Pro and one Ser residues, as well as the absence of an N-terminal ER-targeting peptide, are necessary for oleosin targeting ER and moving onto budding LDs and extracting them to cytosol. In a reverse approach, eliminations of these necessities allow the modified oleosin to enter the ER lumen and extract budding LDs to the ER lumen. Modified oleosin with an added vacuole signal peptide transports the ER-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lumin</span></strong>al LDs to vacuoles. The overall findings define the mechanism of oleosin targeting ER-LDs and extracting budding LDs to the cytosol as well as reveal potential applications.</p>

An Animal-Like Cryptochrome Controls the <i>Chlamydomonas</i> Sexual Cycle
<p>Cryptochromes are known as flavin-binding blue light receptors in bacteria, fungi, plants, and insects. The animal-like cryptochrome (aCRY) of the green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> has extended our view on cryptochromes, because it responds also to other wavelengths of the visible spectrum, including red light. Here, we have investigated if aCRY is involved in the regulation of the sexual life cycle of <i>C. reinhardtii</i>, which is controlled by blue and red light at the steps of gametogenesis along with its restoration and germination. We show that aCRY is differentially expressed not only during the life cycle but also within the cell as part of the soluble and/or membrane-associated protein fraction. Moreover, localization of aCRY within the algal cell body varies between vegetative cells and the different cell types of gametogenesis. aCRY is significantly (early day) or to a small extent (late <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">night</span></strong>) enriched in the nucleus in vegetative cells. In pregametes, gametes and dark-inactivated gametes, aCRY is localized over the cell body. aCRY plays an important role in the sexual life cycle of <i>C. reinhardtii</i>: It controls the germination of the alga, under which the zygote undergoes meiosis, in a positive manner, similar to the regulation by the blue light receptors phototropin and plant cryptochrome (pCRY). However, aCRY acts in combination with pCRY as a negative regulator for mating ability as well as for mating maintenance, opposite to the function of phototropin in these processes.</p>

Vesicle Dynamics during Plant Cell Cytokinesis Reveals Distinct Developmental Phases
<p>Cell division in plant cells requires the deposition of a new cell wall between the two daughter cells. The assembly of this plate requires the coordinated movement of cargo vesicles whose size is below the diffraction-limited resolution of the optical microscope. We combined high spatial and temporal resolution confocal laser scanning microscopy with advanced image-processing tools and fluorescence fluctuation methods and distinguished three distinct phases during cell plate expansion in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) ‘Bright Yellow-2’ cells: massive delivery of preexisting vesicles to a disk-shaped region at the equatorial plane precedes a primary rapid expansion phase followed by a secondary, slow expansion phase during which the extremity of the circular plate seeks contact with the mother wall and brings about the separation of the two portions of cytoplasm. Different effects of pharmacological inhibition emphasize the distinct nature of the assembly and expansion mechanisms characterizing these phases.</p>

LNK1 and LNK2 Corepressors Interact with the MYB3 Transcription Factor in Phenylpropanoid Biosynthesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Subgroup 4 of R2R3-MYB transcription factors consists of four members, MYB3, MYB4, MYB7, and MYB32, which possess the conserved EAR repression motif (pdLHLD/LLxiG/S) in their C termini. Here, we show that MYB3 is a newly identified repressor in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. However, the repression mechanism of MYB3 is completely different from MYB4, MYB7, and MYB32. Yeast two-hybrid screening using MYB3 as a bait isolates NIGHT LIGHT-INDUCIBLE AND CLOCK-REGULATED1 (LNK1) and LNK2, members of a small family of four LNK proteins. The repression activity of MYB3 to cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (<i>C4H</i>) gene expression is directly regulated by corepressors LNK1 and LNK2, which could facilitate binding of MYB3 with <i>C4H</i> promoter. The two conserved Asp residues in both region 1 and 2 domain of LNKs are essential to mediate protein-protein interaction. Importantly, the Extra N-terminal Tail domain plays a negative role in LNK-MYB3 transcription complex-dependent repression of the <i>C4H</i> gene. We conclude that LNK1 and LNK2 act as transcriptional corepressors necessary for expression of the phenylpropanoids biosynthesis gene <i>C4H</i> through recruitment to its promoter via interaction with MYB3.</p>

Regulatory Phosphorylation of Bacterial-Type PEP Carboxylase by the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-Dependent Protein Kinase RcCDPK1 in Developing Castor Oil Seeds
<p>Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) is a tightly controlled cytosolic enzyme situated at a crucial branch point of central plant metabolism. In developing castor oil seeds (<i>Ricinus communis</i>) a novel, allosterically desensitized 910-kD Class-2 PEPC hetero-octameric complex, arises from a tight interaction between 107-kD plant-type PEPC and 118-kD bacterial-type (BTPC) subunits. The native Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein kinase (CDPK) responsible for in vivo inhibitory phosphorylation of Class-2 PEPC’s BTPC subunit’s at Ser-451 was highly purified from COS and identified as RcCDPK1 (XP_002526815) by mass spectrometry. Heterologously expressed RcCDPK1 catalyzed Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent, inhibitory phosphorylation of BTPC at Ser-451 while exhibiting: (<i>i</i>) a pair of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding sites with identical dissociation constants of 5.03 μM, (<i>ii</i>) a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent electrophoretic mobility shift, and (<i>iii</i>) a marked Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent hydrophobicity. Pull-down experiments established the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent interaction of N-terminal GST-tagged RcCDPK1 with BTPC. RcCDPK1-Cherry localized to the cytosol and nucleus of tobacco <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bright</span></strong> yellow-2 cells, but colocalized with mitochondrial-surface associated BTPC-enhanced yellow fluorescent protein when both fusion proteins were coexpressed. Deletion analyses demonstrated that although its N-terminal variable domain plays an essential role in optimizing Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent RcCDPK1 autophosphorylation and BTPC transphosphorylation activity, it is not critical for in vitro or in vivo target recognition. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) CPK4 and soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) CDPKβ are RcCDPK1 orthologs that effectively phosphorylated castor BTPC at Ser-451. Overall, the results highlight a potential link between cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and the posttranslational control of respiratory CO<sub>2</sub> refixation and anaplerotic photosynthate partitioning in support of storage oil and protein biosynthesis in developing COS.</p>

A Plant Cryptochrome Controls Key Features of the <i>Chlamydomonas</i> Circadian Clock and Its Life Cycle
<p>Cryptochromes are flavin-binding proteins that act as blue light receptors in bacteria, fungi, plants, and insects and are components of the circadian oscillator in mammals. Animal and plant cryptochromes are evolutionarily divergent, although the unicellular alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> (<i>Chlamydomonas</i> throughout) has both an animal-like cryptochrome and a plant cryptochrome (pCRY; formerly designated CPH1). Here, we show that the pCRY protein accumulates at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">night</span></strong> as part of a complex. Functional characterization of pCRY was performed based on an insertional mutant that expresses only 11% of the wild-type pCRY level. The <i>pcry</i> mutant is defective for central properties of the circadian clock. In the mutant, the period is lengthened significantly, ultimately resulting in arrhythmicity, while blue light-based phase shifts show large deviations from what is observed in wild-type cells. We also show that pCRY is involved in gametogenesis in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>. pCRY is down-regulated in pregametes and gametes, and in the <i>pcry</i> mutant, there is altered transcript accumulation under blue light of the strictly light-dependent, gamete-specific gene <i>GAS28</i>. pCRY acts as a negative regulator for the induction of mating ability in the light and for the loss of mating ability in the dark. Moreover, pCRY is necessary for light-dependent germination, during which the zygote undergoes meiosis that gives rise to four vegetative cells. In sum, our data demonstrate that pCRY is a key blue light receptor in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> that is involved in both circadian timing and life cycle progression.</p>

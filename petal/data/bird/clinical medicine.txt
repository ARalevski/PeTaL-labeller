Cardiovascular Health Promotion in Children: Challenges and Opportunities for 2020 and Beyond: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association
<p>This document provides a pediatric-focused companion to “Defining and Setting National Goals for Cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heal</span></strong>th Promotion and Disease Reduction: The American Heart Association’s Strategic Impact Goal Through 2020 and Beyond,” focused on cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heal</span></strong>th promotion and disease reduction in adults and children. The principles detailed in the document reflect the American Heart Association’s new dynamic and proactive goal to promote cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heal</span></strong>th throughout the life course. The primary focus is on adult cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heal</span></strong>th and disease prevention, but critical to achievement of this goal is maintenance of ideal cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heal</span></strong>th from birth through childhood to young adulthood and beyond. Emphasis is placed on the fundamental principles and metrics that define cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heal</span></strong>th in children for the clinical or research setting, and a balanced and critical appraisal of the strengths and weaknesses of the cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heal</span></strong>th construct in children and adolescents is provided. Specifically, this document discusses 2 important factors: the promotion of ideal cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heal</span></strong>th in all children and the improvement of cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heal</span></strong>th metric scores in children currently classified as having poor or intermediate cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heal</span></strong>th. Other topics include the current status of cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heal</span></strong>th in US children, opportunities for the refinement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heal</span></strong>th metrics, improvement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heal</span></strong>th metric scores, and possibilities for promoting ideal cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heal</span></strong>th. Importantly, concerns about the suitability of using single thresholds to identify elevated cardiovascular risk throughout the childhood years and the limits of our current knowledge are noted, and suggestions for future directions and research are provided.</p>

Arthroscopic decompression not recommended in the treatment of rotator cuff tendinopathy
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Rotator cuff tendinopathy has a multifactorial origin. Rejecting   the mechanistic theory has also led to abandoning <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong>   at initial presentation in the first line. Physiotherapy exercise   programmes are the accepted first line <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong>. The aim of this   study was to assess the long-term additional benefits of subacromial decompression   in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong> of rotator cuff tendinopathy.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This randomised controlled trial of 140 patients (52 men, 88   women, mean age 47.1 years; 18 to 60) with rotator cuff tendinopathy   extended previous work up to a maximum of 13 years. The patients   were randomised into two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong> groups: arthroscopic acromioplasty   and a supervised exercise <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong> and a similar supervised exercise   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong> alone. Self-reported pain on a visual analogue scale (VAS)   was the primary outcome measure. Secondary measures were disability,   working ability, pain at night, Shoulder Disability Questionnaire   score and the number of painful days during the three months preceding   the final assessment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 90 patients (64%) returned questionnaires at a mean   12 years after randomisation. On an intention-to-treat basis, both   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong> groups reached statistically significant improvement compared   with the initial VAS for pain, but there was no significant difference   between groups. The same was true in the secondary outcome measures.   Due to group changes, the results were also analysed per protocol:   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ated or not. No significant differences between the groups were   found.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The natural history of rotator cuff tendinopathy probably plays   a significant role in the results in the long-term. Even though   the patients who underwent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong> had a stronger belief   in recovery, which is likely to be surgical and the effect of placebo,   the exercise group obtained similar results. In the future, an optimum   exercise regime should be searched for, as the most clinically and   cost-effective conservative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong> for rotator cuff tendinopathy.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:799–805.</p></sec>

Effectiveness of open and arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (UKUFF)
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The appropriate management for patients with a degenerative tear   of the rotator cuff remains controversial, but <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong>,   particularly arthroscopic surgery, is increasingly being used. Our   aim in this paper was to compare the effectiveness of arthroscopic   with open repair of the rotator cuff.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 273 patients were recruited to a randomised comparison   trial (136 to arthroscopic surgery and 137 to open surgery) from   19 teaching and general hospitals in the United Kingdom. The surgeons   used their usual preferred method of repair. The Oxford Shoulder   Score (OSS), two years post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively, was the primary outcome   measure. Imaging of the shoulder was performed at one year after   surgery. The trial is registered with Current Controlled Trials,   ISRCTN97804283.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean OSS improved from 26.3 (standard deviation (<sc>sd</sc>)   8.2) at baseline, to 41.7 (<sc>sd</sc> 7.9) two years post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively   for arthroscopic surgery and from 25.0 (<sc>sd</sc> 8.0) to 41.5   (<sc>sd</sc> 7.9) for open surgery. Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis   showed no statistical difference between the groups at two years   (difference in OSS score -0.76; 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.75   to 1.22; p = 0.452). The confidence interval excluded the pre-determined   clinically important difference in the OSS of three points. The   rate of re-tear was not significantly different between the two groups   (46.4% for arthroscopic and 38.6% for open surgery; 95% CI -6.9   to 25.8; p = 0.256). Healed repairs had the most improved OSS. These   findings were the same when analysed per-protocol.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>There is no evidence of difference in effectiveness between open   and arthroscopic repair of rotator cuff tears. The rate of re-tear   is high in both groups, for all sizes of tear and ages and this   adversely affects the outcome.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:107–15.</p></sec>

An Evidence-Based Medicine Approach to Antihyperglycemic Therapy in Diabetes Mellitus to Overcome Overtreatment
<p>Over<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong> is pervasive in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">medicin</span></strong>e and leads to potential patient harms and excessive costs in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heal</span></strong>th care. Although evidence-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">medicin</span></strong>e is often derided as practice by rote algorithmic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">medicin</span></strong>e, the appropriate application of key evidence-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">medicin</span></strong>e principles in clinical decision making is fundamental to preventing over<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong> and promoting high-value, individualized patient-centered care. Specifically, this article discusses the importance of (1) using absolute rather than relative estimates of benefits to inform <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong> decisions; (2) considering the time horizon to benefit of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong>s; (3) balancing potential harms and benefits; and (4) using shared decision making by physicians to incorporate the patient’s values and preferences into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong> decisions. Here, we illustrate the application of these principles to considering the decision of whether or not to recommend intensive glycemic control to patients to minimize microvascular and cardiovascular complications in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Through this lens, this example will illustrate how an evidence-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">medicin</span></strong>e approach can be used to individualize glycemic goals and prevent over<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong>, and can serve as a template for applying evidence-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">medicin</span></strong>e to inform <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong> decisions for other conditions to optimize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heal</span></strong>th and individualize patient care.</p>

Diagnosis and Treatment of Fetal Cardiac Disease
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>The goal of this statement is to review available literature and to put forth a scientific statement on the current practice of fetal cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">medicin</span></strong>e, including the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s and management of fetal cardiovascular disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>A writing group appointed by the American Heart Association reviewed the available literature pertaining to topics relevant to fetal cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">medicin</span></strong>e, including the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of congenital heart disease and arrhythmias, assessment of cardiac function and the cardiovascular system, and available <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong> options. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association classification of recommendations and level of evidence for practice guidelines were applied to the current practice of fetal cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">medicin</span></strong>e. Recommendations relating to the specifics of fetal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s, including the timing of referral for study, indications for referral, and experience suggested for performance and interpretation of studies, are presented. The components of a fetal echocardiogram are described in detail, including descriptions of the assessment of cardiac anatomy, cardiac function, and rhythm. Complementary modalities for fetal cardiac assessment are reviewed, including the use of advanced ultrasound techniques, fetal magnetic resonance imaging, and fetal magnetocardiography and electrocardiography for rhythm assessment. Models for parental counseling and a discussion of parental stress and depression assessments are reviewed. Available fetal therapies, including medical management for arrhythmias or heart failure and closed or open intervention for diseases affecting the cardiovascular system such as twin–twin transfusion syndrome, lung masses, and vascular tumors, are highlighted. Catheter-based intervention strategies to prevent the progression of disease in utero are also discussed. Recommendations for delivery planning strategies for fetuses with congenital heart disease including models based on classification of disease severity and delivery room <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong> will be highlighted. Outcome assessment is reviewed to show the benefit of prenatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s and management as they affect outcome for babies with congenital heart disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Fetal cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">medicin</span></strong>e has evolved considerably over the past 2 decades, predominantly in response to advances in imaging technology and innovations in therapies. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of cardiac disease in the fetus is mostly made with ultrasound; however, new technologies, including 3- and 4-dimensional echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging, and fetal electrocardiography and magnetocardiography, are available. Medical and interventional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong>s for select diseases and strategies for delivery room care enable stabilization of high-risk fetuses and contribute to improved outcomes. This statement highlights what is currently known and recommended on the basis of evidence and experience in the rapidly advancing and highly specialized field of fetal cardiac care.</p></sec>

Revision total knee arthroplasty for failed high tibial osteotomy and unicompartmental knee arthroplasty have similar patient-reported outcome measures in a two-year follow-up study
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Little is known about the relative outcomes of revision of unicompartmental   knee arthroplasty (UKA) and high tibial osteotomy (HTO) to total   knee arthroplasty (TKA). The aim of this study is to compare the   outcomes of revision surgery for the two procedures in terms of   complications, re-revision and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs)   at a minimum of two years follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This study was a retrospective review of data from an institutional   arthroplasty registry for cases performed between 2001 and 2014.   A total of 292 patients were identified, of which 217 had a revision   of HTO to TKA, and 75 had revision of UKA to TKA. While mean follow-up   was longer for the HTO group compared with the UKA group, patient   demographics (age, body mass index and Charlson co-morbidity index)   and PROMs (Short Form-36, Oxford Knee Score, Knee Society Score,   both objective and functional) were similar in the two groups prior   to revision surgery.

At 6 years, we compared <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transplant</span></strong>-free survival and other outcomes between the groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Medical history was collected annually using medical record review, telephone interviews, and the death index. The cohort included 549 patients randomized and treated in the SVR trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transplant</span></strong>-free survival for the RVPAS versus modified Blalock–Taussig shunt groups did not differ at 6 years (64% versus 59%, <i>P</i>=0.25) or with all available follow-up of 7.1±1.6 years (log-rank <i>P</i>=0.13). The RVPAS versus modified Blalock–Taussig shunt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong> effect had nonproportional hazards (<i>P</i>=0.009); the hazard ratio (HR) for death or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transplant</span></strong> favored the RVPAS before stage II surgery (HR, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.48–0.92). The effect of shunt type on death or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transplant</span></strong> was not statistically significant between stage II to Fontan surgery (HR, 1.36; 95% confidence interval, 0.86–2.17; <i>P</i>=0.17) or after the Fontan procedure (HR, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.33–1.74; <i>P</i>=0.52). By 6 years, patients with RVPAS had a higher incidence of catheter interventions (0.38 versus 0.23/patient-year, <i>P</i><0.001), primarily because of more interventions between the stage II and Fontan procedures (HR, 1.72; 95% confidence interval, 1.00–3.03).

We report the influence of adherence to antihypertensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong> on blood pressure control.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>One hundred six patients with hypertension resistant to 4 weeks of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong> with indapamide 1.5 mg/d, ramipril 10 mg/d (or irbesartan 300 mg/d), and amlodipine 10 mg/d were randomly assigned to renal denervation plus standardized stepped-care antihypertensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong>, or the same antihypertensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong> alone. For standardized stepped-care antihypertensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong>, spironolactone 25 mg/d, bisoprolol 10 mg/d, prazosin 5 mg/d, and rilmenidine 1 mg/d were sequentially added at monthly visits if home blood pressure was ≥135/85 mm Hg after randomization.

A systematic review of Vancouver B2 and B3 periprosthetic femoral fractures
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the outcomes of Vancouver   type B2 and B3 fractures by performing a systematic review of the   methods of surgical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong> which have been reported.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A systematic search was performed in Ovid MEDLINE, Embase and   the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. For inclusion,   studies required a minimum of ten patients with a Vancouver type   B2 and/or ten patients with a Vancouver type B3 fracture, a minimum   mean follow-up of two years and outcomes which were matched to the type   of fracture. Studies were also required to report the rate of re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation   as an outcome measure. The protocol was registered in the PROSPERO   database. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 22 studies were included based on the eligibility   criteria, including 343 B2 fractures and 167 B3 fractures. The mean   follow-up ranged from 32 months to 74 months. </p><p>Of 343 Vancouver B2 fractures, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong> in 298 (86.8%) involved   revision arthroplasty and 45 (12.6%) were treated with internal   fixation alone. A total of 37 patients (12.4%) treated with revision   arthroplasty and six (13.3%) treated by internal fixation only underwent   further re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation. </p><p>Of 167 Vancouver B3 fractures, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong> in 160 (95.8%) involved   revision arthroplasty and eight (4.8%) were treated with internal   fixation without revision. A total of 23 patients (14.4%) treated   with revision arthroplasty and two (28.6%) treated only with internal   fixation required re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>A significant proportion, particularly of B2 fractures, were   treated without revision of the stem. These were associated with   a higher rate of re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong> of B3 fractures without   revision of the stem resulted in a high rate of re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation. This   demonstrates the importance of careful evaluation and accurate characterisation   of the fracture at the time of presentation to ensure the correct   management. There is a need for improvement in the reporting of   data in case series recording the outcome of the surgical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong>   of periprosthetic fractures. We have suggested a minimum dataset   to improve the quality of data in studies dealing with these fractures.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B(4   Supple B):17–25.</p></sec>

A pilot randomized trial of meniscal allograft transplantation versus personalized physiotherapy for patients with a symptomatic meniscal deficient knee compartment
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Meniscal allograft <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transplant</span></strong>ation is undertaken to improve pain   and function in patients with a symptomatic meniscal deficient knee   compartment. While case series have shown improvements in patient   reported outcome measures (PROMs), its efficacy has not been rigorously   evaluated. This study aimed to compare PROMs in patients having   meniscal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transplant</span></strong>ation with those having personalized physiotherapy   at 12 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A single-centre assessor-blinded, comprehensive cohort study,   incorporating a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) was performed   on patients with a symptomatic compartment of the knee in which   a (sub)total meniscectomy had previously been performed. They were   randomized to be treated either with a meniscal allograft <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transplant</span></strong>ation   or personalized physiotherapy, and stratified for malalignment of   the limb. They entered the preference groups if they were not willing   to be randomized. The Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS),   International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score and Lysholm   score and complications were collected at baseline and at four,   eight and 12 months following the interventions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 36 patients entered the study; 21 were randomized   and 15 chose their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong>s.

Tuberculosis of the spine with severe angular kyphosis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To address the natural history of severe post-tuberculous (TB)   kyphosis, with focus upon the long-term neurological outcome, occurrence   of restrictive lung disease, and the effect on life expectancy. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This is a retrospective clinical review of prospectively collected   imaging data based at a single institute. A total of 24 patients   of Southern Chinese origin who presented with spinal TB with a mean   of 113° of kyphosis (65° to 159°) who fulfilled inclusion criteria   were reviewed. Plain radiographs were used to assess the degree   of spinal deformity. Myelography, CT and MRI were used when available   to assess the integrity of the spinal cord and canal. Patient demographics,   age of onset of spinal TB and interventions, types of surgical procedure,   intra- and post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative complications, and neurological status   were assessed. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>All except one of the 24 patients were treated with anti-TB chemotherapy   when they were first diagnosed with spinal TB. They subsequently   received surgery either for neurological deterioration, or deformity   correction in later life. The mean follow-up was 34 years (11 to   59) since these surgical interventions. Some 16 patients (66.7%) suffered   from late neurological deterioration at a mean of 26 years (8 to   49) after the initial drug <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong>. The causes of neurological   deterioration were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heal</span></strong>ed disease in nine patients (56.2%),    re-activation in six patients (37.5%) and adjacent level spinal   stenosis in one patient (6.3%). The result of surgery was worse   in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heal</span></strong>ed disease. Eight patients without neurological deterioration   received surgery to correct the kyphosis. The mean correction ranged   from 97° to 72°. Three patients who were clinically quiescent with   no neurological deterioration were found to have active TB of the   spine. Solid fusion was achieved in all cases and no patient suffered   from neurological deterioration after 42 years of follow-up. On   final follow-up, six patients were noted to have deceased (age range:   47 years to 75 years).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study presents one of the longest assessments of spinal TB   with severe kyphosis. Severe post-TB kyphosis may lead to significant   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heal</span></strong>th problems many years following the initial drug <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong>.   Early surgical correction of the kyphosis, solid fusion and regular   surveillance may avoid late complications. Paraplegia, restrictive   lung disease and early onset kyphosis might relate to early death.   Clinically quiescent disease does not mean cure. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1381–8.</p></sec>

Intra-operative digital imaging
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aims of this study were to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">examin</span></strong>e the rate at which the   positioning of the acetabular component, leg length discrepancy   and femoral offset are outside an acceptable range in total hip   arthroplasties (THAs) which either do or do not involve the use   of intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative digital imaging.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A retrospective case-control study was undertaken with 50 patients   before and 50 patients after the integration of an intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative   digital imaging system in THA. The demographics of the two groups   were comparable for body mass index, age, laterality and the indication   for surgery. The digital imaging group had more men than the group without.   Surgical data and radiographic parameters, including the inclination   and anteversion of the acetabular component, leg length discrepancy,   and the difference in femoral offset compared with the contralateral   hip were collected and compared, as well as the incidence of altering   the position of a component based on the intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative image.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Digital imaging took a mean of five minutes (2.3 to 14.6) to   perform. Intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative changes with the use of digital imaging   were made for 43 patients (86%), most commonly to adjust leg length   and femoral offset. There was a decrease in the incidence of outliers   when using intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative imaging compared with not using it in   regard to leg length discrepancy (20% <i>versus</i> 52%,   p = 0.001) and femoral offset inequality (18% <i>versus</i> 44%,   p = 0.004). There was also a difference in the incidence of outliers   in acetabular inclination (0% <i>versus</i> 7%, p = 0.023)   and version (0% <i>versus</i> 4%, p = 0.114) compared   with historical results of a high-volume surgeon at the same centre.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The use of intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative digital imaging in THA improves the   accuracy of the positioning of the components at THA without adding   a substantial amount of time to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100B(1   Supple A):36–43.</p></sec>

Radiation-Induced DNA Damage in Operators Performing Endovascular Aortic Repair
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Radiation exposure during fluoroscopically guided interventions such as endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) is a growing concern for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ators. This study aimed to measure DNA damage/repair markers in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ators perfoming EVAR.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Expression of the DNA damage/repair marker, γ-H2AX and DNA damage response marker, phosphorylated ataxia telangiectasia mutated (pATM), were quantified in circulating lymphocytes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ators during the peri-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative period of endovascular (infrarenal, branched, and fenestrated) and open aortic repair using flow cytometry. These markers were separately measured in the same <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ators but this time wearing leg lead shielding in addition to upper body protection and compared with those <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ating with unprotected legs. Susceptibility to radiation damage was determined by irradiating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ators’ blood in vitro.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>γ-H2AX and pATM levels increased significantly in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ators immediately after branched endovascular aortic repair/fenestrated endovascular aortic repair (<i>P</i><0.0003 for both). Only pATM levels increased after infrarenal endovascular aortic repair (<i>P</i><0.04). Expression of both markers fell to baseline in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ators after 24 hours (<i>P</i><0.003 for both). There was no change in γ-H2AX or pATM expression after open repair. Leg protection abrogated γ-H2AX and pATM response after branched endovascular aortic repair/fenestrated endovascular aortic repair. The expression of γ-H2AX varied significantly when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ators’ blood was exposed to the same radiation dose in vitro (<i>P</i><0.0001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This is the first study to detect an acute DNA damage response in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ators performing fluoroscopically guided aortic procedures and highlights the protective effect of leg shielding.

Status of Cardiovascular Health in US Adolescents
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>The American Heart Association recently developed definitions and metrics for monitoring the spectrum of cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heal</span></strong>th in adolescents and children. Current nationally representative prevalence estimates according to sex and race/ethnicity are unavailable.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">examin</span></strong>ed the components of cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heal</span></strong>th in 4673 participants aged 12 to 19 years (representing ≈33.2 million US adolescents) from the 2005–2010 National <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heal</span></strong>th and Nutrition <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">examin</span></strong>ation Surveys. Population prevalence of individual cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heal</span></strong>th behaviors and factors was estimated according to American Heart Association criteria for poor, intermediate, and ideal levels. Ideal blood pressure was most prevalent (males, 78%; females, 90%), whereas a dramatically low prevalence of ideal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heal</span></strong>thy Diet Score was observed (males, <1%; females, <1%). Females exhibited a lower prevalence of ideal total cholesterol (65% versus 72%, respectively) and ideal physical activity levels (44% versus 67%, respectively) yet a higher prevalence of ideal blood glucose (89% versus 74%, respectively) compared with males. Approximately two thirds of adolescents exhibited ideal body mass index (males, 66%; females, 67%) and ideal smoking status (males, 66%; females, 70%). Less than 50% of adolescents exhibited ≥5 ideal cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heal</span></strong>th components (45%, males; 50%, females). Prevalence estimates according to sex were consistent across race/ethnic groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>The low prevalence of ideal cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heal</span></strong>th behaviors in US adolescents, particularly physical activity and dietary intake, will likely contribute to a worsening prevalence of obesity, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and dysglycemia as the current US adolescent population reaches adulthood. Population-wide emphasis on establishment of ideal cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heal</span></strong>th behaviors early in life is essential for maintenance of ideal cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heal</span></strong>th throughout the lifespan.</p></sec>

Effect of pre-operative expectations on the outcomes following total shoulder arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims </title><p>Few studies have evaluated the relationship between patients’   pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative expectations and the outcome of orthopaedic procedures.   Our aim was to determine the effect of expectations on the outcome   after primary anatomical total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA). We hypothesised   that patients with greater expectations would have better outcomes. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Patients undergoing primary anatomical TSA completed the Hospital   for Special Surgery’s Shoulder Expectations Survey pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively.   The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES), Shoulder Activity   Scale (SAS), Short-Form-36 (SF-36), and visual analogue scale (VAS)   for pain, fatigue, and general <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heal</span></strong>th scores were also collected   pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively and two years post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively. Pearson correlations   were used to assess the relationship between the number of expectations   and the outcomes. Differences in outcomes between those with higher   and lower levels of expectations for each expectation were assessed   by independent samples <i>t</i>-test. Multivariable linear   regression analysis was used to control for potential confounding   factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 67 patients were evaluated two years post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively.   Most parameters of outcome improved significantly from baseline   and most patients were satisfied. A greater number of expectations   was associated with a significantly greater improvement in the ASES   score (p = 0.02). In the multivariable analysis, a greater number   of expectations was an independent predictor of better ASES, VAS   and SF-36 scores, as well as improvements in ASES and VAS pain scores   (p < 0.05). Greater expectations for many specific expectation   questions were significantly associated with better outcomes (p   < 0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>TSA is a successful procedure with significant improvements in   outcome, and greater    pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative expectations are associated with better outcomes. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1190–6.</p></sec>

The effect of intravenous tranexamic acid on blood loss and early post-operative pain in total shoulder arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the impact of   intravenous tranexamic acid on the reduction of blood loss, transfusion   rate, and early post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative clinical outcome in total shoulder   arthroplasty.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A randomised, placebo-controlled trial which included 54 patients   undergoing unilateral primary stemless anatomical or stemmed reverse   total shoulder arthroplasty was undertaken. Patients received either   100 ml saline (placebo, n = 27), or 100 ml saline together with   1000 mg of tranexamic acid (TXA, n = 27) intravenously prior to   skin incision and during wound closure. Peri-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative blood loss   via an intra-articular drain was recorded and total blood loss was   calculated. The post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative transfusion rate was documented.   Assessment of early clinical parameters included the visual analogue   scale for pain (VAS), documentation of haematoma formation and adverse events.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Mean peri-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative blood drainage (placebo: 170 ml <i>versus</i> TXA:   50 ml, p = 0.001) and calculated mean total blood loss (placebo:   1248.2 ml <i>versus</i> TXA: 871.0 ml, p = 0.009) were   significantly lower in the TXA group. No transfusions were necessary   during the study period in either group. Mean VAS for pain significantly   decreased from pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative (VAS 7) to the early post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative   period (VAS 1.7, p < 0.001). Significant differences regarding   mean post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative pain between placebo (VAS 2.0) and TXA (VAS   1.3) were detected (p = 0.05). The occurrence of haematomas was   significantly more frequent in the placebo (59.3%, n = 16) than   in the TXA group (25.9%, n = 6, p = 0.027).

Which factors influence the rate of failure following metal-on-metal hip arthroplasty revision surgery performed for adverse reactions to metal debris?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To determine the outcomes following revision surgery of metal-on-metal   hip arthroplasties (MoMHA) performed for adverse reactions to metal   debris (ARMD), and to identify factors predictive of re-revision.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We performed a retrospective observational study using National   Joint Registry (NJR) data on 2535 MoMHAs undergoing revision surgery   for ARMD between 2008 and 2014. The outcomes studied following revision were   intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative complications, mortality and re-revision surgery.   Predictors of re-revision were identified using competing-risk regression   modelling.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative complications occurred in 40 revisions (1.6%).   The cumulative five-year patient survival rate was 95.9% (95% confidence   intervals (CI) 92.3 to 97.8). Re-revision surgery was performed   in 192 hips (7.6%). The cumulative five-year implant survival rate   was 89.5% (95% CI 87.3 to 91.3). Predictors of re-revision were   high body mass index at revision (subhazard ratio (SHR) 1.06 per   kg/m<sup>2 </sup>increase, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.09), modular component   only revisions (head and liner with or without taper adapter; SHR   2.01, 95% CI 1.19 to 3.38), ceramic-on-ceramic revision bearings   (SHR 1.86, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.80), and acetabular bone grafting (SHR   2.10, 95% CI 1.43 to 3.07). These four factors remained predictive   of re-revision when the missing data were imputed.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The short-term risk of re-revision following MoMHA revision surgery   performed for ARMD was comparable with that reported in the NJR   following all-cause non-MoMHA revision surgery.

‘Modern’ distal femoral locking plates allow safe, early weight-bearing with a high rate of union and low rate of failure
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Fractures of the distal femur can be challenging to manage and   are on the increase in the elderly osteoporotic population. Management   with casting or bracing can unacceptably limit a patient’s ability   to bear weight, but historically, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative fixation has been associated   with a high rate of re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation. In this study, we describe the outcomes   of fixation using modern implants within a strategy of early return   to function.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>All patients treated at our centre with lateral distal femoral   locking plates (LDFLP) between 2009 and 2014 were identified. Fracture   classification and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative information including weight-bearing   status, rates of union, re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation, failure of implants and mortality   rate, were recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 127 fractures were identified in 122 patients.

Equalisation of leg lengths in total hip arthroplasty for patients with Crowe type-IV developmental dysplasia of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>There is no consensus about the best method of achieving equal   leg lengths at total hip arthroplasty (THA) in patients with Crowe   type-IV developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). We reviewed our   experience of a consecutive series of patients who underwent THA   for this indication.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We retrospectively reviewed 78 patients (86 THAs) with Crowe   type-IV DDH, including 64 women and 14 men, with a minimum follow-up   of two years. The mean age at the time of surgery was 52.2 years   (34 to 82). We subdivided Crowe type-IV DDH into two major types   according to the number of dislocated hips, and further categorised   them into three groups according to the occurrence of pelvic obliquity   or spinal curvature.

High failure rates in treatment of streptococcal periprosthetic joint infection
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To investigate the outcomes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong> of streptococcal periprosthetic   joint infection (PJI) involving total knee and hip arthroplasties.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Streptococcal PJI episodes which occurred between January 2009   and December 2015 were identified from clinical databases. Presentation   and clinical outcomes for 30 streptococcal PJIs in 30 patients (12   hip and 18 knee arthroplasties) following <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong> were evaluated   from the medical notes and at review. The Kaplan-Meier survival method   was used to estimate the probability of infection-free survival.   The influence of the biofilm active antibiotic rifampin was also   assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The infection was thought to have been acquired haematogenously   in 16 patients and peri-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively in 14.

Contemporary failure aetiologies of the primary, posterior-stabilised total knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The number of revision total knee arthroplasties (TKA) that are   performed is expected to increase. However, previous reports of   the causes of failure after TKA are limited in that they report   the causes at specific institutions, which are often dependent on   referral patterns. Our aim was to report the most common indications   for re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ations and revisions in a large series of posterior-stabilised   TKAs undertaken at a single institution, excluding referrals from   elsewhere, which may bias the causes of failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 5098 TKAs which were undertaken between 2000 and 2012   were included in the study. Re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ations, revisions with modular   component exchange, and revisions with non-modular component replacement   or removal were identified from the medical records. The mean follow-up   was five years (two to 12).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The Kaplan-Meier ten-year survival without a re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation, modular   component revision and non-modular component revision was 95.7%,   99.3% and 95.3%, respectively. The most common indications for a   re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation were: post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative stiffness (58%), delayed wound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heal</span></strong>ing   (21%), and patellar clunk (11%). The indications for isolated modular   component revision were acute periprosthetic joint infection (PJI)   (64%) and instability (36%).

Aseptic loosening   was not an uncommon cause of failure, however, it was much less   common than in national registry and non-registry data.

Unsatisfactory outcomes following unicompartmental knee arthroplasty in patients with partial thickness cartilage loss
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>While medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is indicated   for patients with full-thickness cartilage loss, it is occasionally   used to treat those with partial-thickness loss. The aim of this   study was to investigate the five-year outcomes in a consecutive   series of UKAs used in patients with partial thickness cartilage   loss in the medial compartment of the knee.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between 2002 and 2014, 94 consecutive UKAs were undertaken in   90 patients with partial thickness cartilage loss and followed up   independently for a mean of six years (1 to 13). These patients   had partial thickness cartilage loss either on both femur and tibia   (13 knees), or on either the femur or the tibia, with full thickness   loss on the other surface of the joint (18 and 63 knees respectively).   Using propensity score analysis, these patients were matched 1:2 based   on age, gender and pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative Oxford Knee Score (OKS) with knees   with full thickness loss on both the femur and tibia. The functional   outcomes, implant survival and incidence of re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ations were assessed   at one, two and five years post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively. A subgroup of 36 knees   in 36 patients with partial thickness cartilage loss, who had pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative   MRI scans, was assessed to identify whether there were any factors   identified on MRI that predicted the outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Knees with partial thickness cartilage loss had significantly   worse functional outcomes at one, two and five years post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively   compared with those with full thickness loss. A quarter of knees   with partial thickness loss had a fair or poor result and a fifth   failed to achieve a clinically significant improvement in OKS from   a baseline of four points or more; double that seen in knees with   full thickness loss. Whilst there was no difference in implant survival between   the groups, the rate of re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ation in knees with partial thickness   loss was three times higher. Most of the re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ations (three-quarters),   were arthroscopies for persistent pain.</p><p>Compared with those achieving good or excellent outcomes, patients   with partial thickness cartilage loss who achieved fair or poor   outcomes were younger and had worse pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative functional scores.   However, there were no other differences in the baseline demographics.   MRI findings of full thickness cartilage loss, subchondral oedema,   synovitis or effusion did not provide additional prognostic information.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Medial UKA should be reserved for patients with full thickness   cartilage loss on both the femur and tibia. Whilst some patients   with partial thickness loss achieve a good result we cannot currently   identify which these will be and in this situation MRI is unhelpful   and misleading.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:475–82.</p></sec>

Does osteofibrous dysplasia progress to adamantinoma and how should they be treated?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to identify any progression between   benign osteofibrous dysplasia (OFD), OFD-like adamantinoma and malignant   adamantinoma, and to investigate the rates of local recurrence,   metastases and survival, in order to develop <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong> algorithms   for each.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A single institution retrospective review of all patients presenting   with OFD, OFD-like adamantinoma and adamantinoma between 1973 and   2012 was undertaken. Complete data were available for 73 patients   (42 with OFD; ten with an OFD-like adamantinoma and 21 with an adamantinoma).   The mean follow-up was 10.3 years (3 to 25) for OFD, 9.2 years (3.0   to 26.3) for OFD-like and 11.6 years (0.25 to 33) for adamantinoma.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean age at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s for OFD was 13.5 years (1 to 49), 10.5   years (6 to 28) for OFD-like and 34 years (14 to 86) for adamantinoma.   A total of 24 of the 42 patients with OFD (57%) have not required   any <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong> and have been managed with observation. A total of   18 of the 42 patients with OFD underwent surgery, 13 with curettage   and five with resection. In all, three patients developed recurrence   following curettage (23%) but none following resection. All these   patients were cured with further limited surgery. A total of six   patients initially diagnosed with OFD were subsequently found to   have OFD-like adamantinoma. Of the ten patients initially diagnosed   with OFD-like adamantinoma, three (30%) were managed with observation   alone and seven underwent surgery, two with curettage and five with   resection. Local recurrence arose in two patients, one each after   curettage and resection. No patients with either OFD or an OFD-like   adamantinoma developed metastases or had progression to adamantinoma.   All patients with an adamantinoma were treated by surgery, three   with curettage, six with amputation and 12 with excision. In all,   two of the three treated with curettage developed local recurrence, requiring   further surgery. Late development of both local recurrence and metastases   led to a ten year disease specific survival of 93% which had dropped   to 39% by 20 years.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We found no evidence of progression from OFD to adamantinoma.   Conservative management with observation or curettage is often successful   for patients with OFD and OFD-like adamantinoma. Resection with   clear margins is required for patients with adamantinoma.

Is computer navigation when used in the surgery of iliosacral pelvic bone tumours safer for the patient?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Due to the complex anatomy of the pelvis, limb-sparing resections   of pelvic tumours achieving adequate surgical margins, can often   be difficult. The advent of computer navigation has improved the   precision of resection of these lesions, though there is little   evidence comparing resection with or without the assistance of navigation.</p><p>Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy of navigation-assisted surgery   for the resection of pelvic bone tumours involving the posterior   ilium and sacrum. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Using our prospectively updated institutional database, we conducted   a retrospective case control study of 21 patients who underwent   resection of the posterior ilium and sacrum, for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong> of   a primary sarcoma of bone, between 1987 and 2015. The resection   was performed with the assistance of navigation in nine patients   and without navigation in 12. We assessed the accuracy of navigation-assisted   surgery, as defined by the surgical margin and how this affects   the rate of local recurrence, the disease-free survival and the   effects on peri-and post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative morbidity. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean age of the patients was 36.4 years (15 to 66). The mean   size of the tumour was 10.9 cm. In the navigation-assisted group,   the margin was wide in two patients (16.7%), marginal in six (66.7%)   and wide-contaminated in one (11.1%) with no intralesional margin.   In the non-navigated-assisted group; the margin was wide in two   patients (16.7%), marginal in five (41.7%), intralesional in three   (25.0%) and wide-contaminated in two (16.7%). Local recurrence occurred   in two patients in the navigation-assisted group (22.2%) and six   in the non-navigation-assisted group (50.0%). The disease-free survival   was significantly better when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ated with navigation-assistance   (p = 0.048). The blood loss and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ating time were less in the   navigated-assisted group, as was the risk of a foot drop post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion </title><p>The introduction of navigation-assisted surgery for the resection   of tumours of the posterior ilium and sacrum has increased the safety   for the patients and allows for a better oncological outcome. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:261–6.</p></sec>

Predicting dissatisfaction following total knee arthroplasty in patients under 55 years of age
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Risk of revision following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is higher   in patients under 55 years, but little data are reported regarding   non-revision outcomes. This study aims to identify predictors of   dissatisfaction in these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We prospectively assessed 177 TKAs (157 consecutive patients,   99 women, mean age 50 years; 17 to 54) from 2008 to 2013. Age, gender,   implant, indication, body mass index (BMI), social deprivation,   range of movement, Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade of osteoarthritis   (OA) and prior knee surgery were recorded. Pre- and post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative   Oxford Knee Score (OKS) as well as Short Form-12 physical (PCS)   and mental component scores were obtained.

<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Late survival and symptomatic status of children with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have not been well defined. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">examin</span></strong>ed long-term outcomes for pediatric hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The National Australian Childhood Cardiomyopathy Study is a longitudinal population-based cohort study of children (0–10 years of age) diagnosed with cardiomyopathy between 1987 and 1996. The primary study end point was time to death or cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transplant</span></strong>ation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>There were 80 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, with a median age at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of 0.48 (interquartile range, 0.1, 2.5) years. Freedom from death/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transplant</span></strong>ation was 86% (95% confidence interval [CI], 77.0–92.0) 1 year after presentation, 80% (95% CI, 69.0–87.0) at 10 years, and 78% (95% CI, 67.0–86.0) at 20 years.

Prognostic Value of Follow-Up Hemodynamic Variables After Initial Management in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Hemodynamic variables such as cardiac index and right atrial pressure have consistently been associated with survival in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) at the time of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s. Recent studies have suggested that pulmonary arterial compliance may also predict prognosis in PAH. The prognostic importance of hemodynamic values achieved after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong> initiation is less well established.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Our objective was to evaluate the prognostic importance of clinical and hemodynamic variables during follow-up, including pulmonary arterial compliance, after initial management in PAH. We evaluated incident patients with idiopathic, drug- and toxin-induced, or heritable PAH enrolled in the French pulmonary hypertension registry between 2006 and 2016 who had a follow-up right-sided heart catheterization (RHC). The primary outcome was death or lung <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transplant</span></strong>ation. We used stepwise Cox regression and the Kaplan-Meier method to assess variables obtained at baseline and at first follow-up RHC.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 981 patients, a primary outcome occurred in 331 patients (33.7%) over a median follow-up duration of 2.8 years (interquartile range, 1.1–4.6 years). In a multivariable model considering only baseline variables, no hemodynamic variables independently predicted prognosis. Median time to first follow-up RHC was 4.6 months (interquartile range, 3.7–7.8 months). At first follow-up RHC (n=763), New York Heart Association functional class, 6-minute walk distance, stroke volume index (SVI), and right atrial pressure were independently associated with death or lung <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transplant</span></strong>ation, adjusted for age, sex, and type of PAH. Pulmonary arterial compliance did not independently predict outcomes at baseline or during follow-up. The adjusted hazard ratio for SVI was 1.28 (95% confidence interval, 1.11–1.49; <i>P</i><0.01) per 10-mL/m<sup>2</sup> decrease and for right atrial pressure was 1.05 (95% confidence interval, 1.02–1.09; <i>P</i><0.01) per 1–mm Hg increase. Among patients who had 2 (n=355) or 3 (n=193) low-risk prognostic features at follow-up, including a cardiac index ≥2.5 L·min<sup>−1</sup>·m<sup>−2</sup>, 6-minute walk distance >440 m, and New York Heart Association class I or II functional class, lower SVI was still associated with higher rates of death or lung <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transplant</span></strong>ation (<i>P</i><0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>SVI and right atrial pressure were the hemodynamic variables that were independently associated with death or lung <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transplant</span></strong>ation at first follow-up RHC after initial PAH <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong>. These findings suggest that the SVI could be a more appropriate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong> target than cardiac index in PAH.</p></sec>

Phenotypic Characterization of <i>EIF2AK4</i> Mutation Carriers in a Large Cohort of Patients Diagnosed Clinically With Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare disease with an emerging genetic basis. Heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding the bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 (<i>BMPR2</i>) are the commonest genetic cause of PAH, whereas biallelic mutations in the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 4 gene (<i>EIF2AK4</i>) are described in pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis. Here, we determine the frequency of these mutations and define the genotype-phenotype characteristics in a large cohort of patients diagnosed clinically with PAH.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Whole-genome sequencing was performed on DNA from patients with idiopathic and heritable PAH and with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis recruited to the National Institute of Health Research BioResource–Rare Diseases study. Heterozygous variants in <i>BMPR2</i> and biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> variants with a minor allele frequency of <1:10 000 in control data sets and predicted to be deleterious (by combined annotation-dependent depletion, PolyPhen-2, and <i>sorting intolerant from tolerant</i> predictions) were identified as potentially causal. Phenotype data from the time of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s were also captured.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Eight hundred sixty-four patients with idiopathic or heritable PAH and 16 with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis were recruited. Mutations in <i>BMPR2</i> were identified in 130 patients (14.8%). Biallelic mutations in <i>EIF2AK4</i> were identified in 5 patients with a clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis. Furthermore, 9 patients with a clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of PAH carried biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutations. These patients had a reduced transfer coefficient for carbon monoxide (K<sc>co</sc>; 33% [interquartile range, 30%–35%] predicted) and younger age at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s (29 years; interquartile range, 23–38 years) and more interlobular septal thickening and mediastinal lymphadenopathy on computed tomography of the chest compared with patients with PAH without <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutations. However, radiological assessment alone could not accurately identify biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutation carriers. Patients with PAH with biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutations had a shorter survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutations are found in patients classified clinically as having idiopathic and heritable PAH. These patients cannot be identified reliably by computed tomography, but a low K<sc>co</sc> and a young age at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s suggests the underlying molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s. Genetic testing can identify these misclassified patients, allowing appropriate management and early referral for lung <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transplant</span></strong>ation.</p></sec>

Weight Loss and Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Associations of obesity with incidence of heart failure have been observed, but the causality is uncertain. We hypothesized that gastric bypass surgery leads to a lower incidence of heart failure compared with intensive lifestyle modification in obese people.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We included obese people without previous heart failure from a Swedish nationwide registry of people treated with a structured intensive lifestyle program and the Scandinavian Obesity Surgery Registry. All analyses used inverse probability weights based on baseline body mass index and a propensity score estimated from baseline variables. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong> groups were well balanced in terms of weight, body mass index, and most potential confounders. Associations of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong> with heart failure incidence, as defined in the National Patient Register, were analyzed with Cox regression.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The 25 804 gastric bypass surgery patients had on average lost 18.8 kg more weight after 1 year and 22.6 kg more after 2 years than the 13 701 lifestyle modification patients. During a median of 4.1 years, surgery patients had lower heart failure incidence than lifestyle modification patients (hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% confidence interval, 0.36–0.82). A 10-kg achieved weight loss after 1 year was related to a hazard ratio for heart failure of 0.77 (95% confidence interval, 0.60–0.97) in both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong> groups combined. Results were robust in sensitivity analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Gastric bypass surgery was associated with approximately one half the incidence of heart failure compared with intensive lifestyle modification in this study of 2 large nationwide registries.

The outcome of the surgical treatment of pelvic chondrosarcomas
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Few studies dealing with chondrosarcoma of the pelvis are currently   available. Different data about the overall survival and prognostic   factors have been published but without a detailed analysis of surgery-related complications.   We aimed to analyse the outcome of a series of pelvic chondrosarcomas   treated at a single institution, with particular attention to the   prognostic factors. Based on a competing risk model, our objective   was to identify risk factors for the development of complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>In a retrospective single-centre study, 58 chondrosarcomas (26   patients alive, 32 patients dead) of the pelvis were reviewed. The   mean follow-up was 13 years (one week to 23.1 years).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 26 patients (45%) were alive and 32 patients (55%)   had died. Overall survival was 76%, 55% and 45% at one, five and   ten years post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively, respectively. In a competing risk model   the cumulative risk of the development of a surgery-related complication   was 64% at six months and 69% at one year, post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively, respectively.   Endoprosthetic reconstruction was a significant risk factor for   the development of complications (p = 0.006). Complications were   not significantly related to age or the location or grade of the   tumour (p = 0.823, p = 0.976, p = 0.858).

Radiographic scoring system for the evaluation of stability of cementless acetabular components in the presence of osteolysis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The stability of cementless acetabular components is an important   factor for surgical planning in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong> of patients with pelvic   osteolysis after total hip arthroplasty (THA). However, the methods   for determining the stability of the acetabular component from pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative   radiographs remain controversial. Our aim was to develop a scoring   system to help in the assessment of the stability of the acetabular   component under these circumstances.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The new scoring system is based on the mechanism of failure of   these components and the location of the osteolytic lesion, according   to the DeLee and Charnley classification. Each zone is evaluated   and scored separately. The sum of the individual scores from the   three zones is reported as a total score with a maximum of 10 points.   The study involved 96 revision procedures which were undertaken   for wear or osteolysis in 91 patients between July 2002 and December   2012. Pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative anteroposterior pelvic radiographs and Judet   views were reviewed. The stability of the acetabular component was   confirmed intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively, it was found that 64 components were well-fixed   and 32 were loose. Mean total scores in the well-fixed and loose   components were 2.9 (0 to 7) and 7.2 (1 to 10), respectively (p   < 0.001). In hips with a low score (0 to 2), the component was   only loose in one of 33 hips (3%). The incidence of loosening increased   with increasing scores: in those with scores of 3 and 4, two of   19 components (10.5%) were loose; in hips with scores of 5 and 6, eight   of 19 components (44.5%) were loose; in hips with scores of 7 or   8, 13 of 17 components (70.6%) were loose; and for hips with scores   of 9 and 10, nine of nine components (100%) were loose. Receiver-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ating-characteristic curve   analysis demonstrated very good accuracy (area under the curve =   0.90, p < 0.001). The optimal cutoff point was a score of ≥ 5   with a sensitivity of 0.79, and a specificity of 0.87.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>There was a strong correlation between the scoring system and   the probability of loosening of a cementless acetabular component.

<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to report a retrospective, consecutive   series of patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) who   were treated with posterior minimally invasive surgery (MIS) with   a mean follow-up of two years (<sc>sd</sc> 1.4; 0.9 to 0 3.7). Our   objectives were to measure the correction of the deformity and record   the peri-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative morbidity. Special attention was paid to the   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ating time (ORT), estimated blood loss (EBL), length of stay   (LOS) and further complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We prospectively collected the data of 70 consecutive patients   with AIS treated with MIS using three incisions and a muscle-splitting   approach by a single surgeon between June 2013 and February 2016   and these were retrospectively reviewed. There were eight male and   62 female patients with a mean age of 15 years (<sc>sd</sc> 4.5   ) with a mean body mass index of 19.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (<sc>sd</sc> 5.4).   The curves were classified according to Lenke; 40 curves were type   1, 15 were type 2, three were type 3, two were type 4, eight were   type 5 and two were type 6.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean primary Cobb angle was corrected from 58.9° (<sc>sd</sc> 12.6°)   pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively to 17.7° (<sc>sd</sc> 10.2°) post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively with   a mean correction of 69% (<sc>sd</sc> 20%, p < 0.001). The mean   kyphosis at T5 to T12 increased from 24.2° (<sc>sd</sc> 12.2°) pre-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively   to 30.1° (<sc>sd</sc> 9.6°,    p < 0.001) post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively. Peri-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative (30 days) complications   occurred in three patients(4.2%): one subcutaneous haematoma, one   deep venous thrombosis and one pulmonary complication. Five additional complications   occurred in five patients (7.1%): one superficial wound infection,   one suture granuloma and three delayed deep surgical site infections.   The mean ORT was 337.1 mins (<sc>sd</sc> 121.3); the mean EBL was   345.7 ml (<sc>sd</sc> 175.1) and the mean LOS was 4.6 days (<sc>sd</sc> 0.8).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The use of MIS for patients with AIS results in a significant   correction of spinal deformity in both the frontal and sagittal   planes, with a low EBL and a short LOS. The rate of peri-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative   complications compares well with that following a routine open technique.   The longer term safety and benefit of MIS in these patients needs   to be evaluated with further follow-up of a larger cohort of patients.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1651–7.</p></sec>

The Rim Cutter does not show an advantage over modern cementing techniques
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We report the incidence of radiolucent lines (RLLs) using two   flanged acetabular components at total hip arthroplasty (THA) and   the effect of the Rim Cutter.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We performed a retrospective review of 300 hips in 292 patients   who underwent primary cemented THA. A contemporary flanged acetabular   component was used with (group 1) and without (group 2) the use   of the Rim Cutter and the Rimfit acetabular component was used with   the Rim Cutter (group 3). RLLs and clinical outcomes were evaluated   immediately post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively and at five years post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was no significant difference in the incidence of RLLs   on the immediate post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative radiographs (p = 0.241) or at five   years post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively (p = 0.463). RLLs were seen on the immediate   post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative radiograph in 2% of hips in group 1, in 5% in group   2 and in 7% in group 3. Five years post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively, there were   RLLs in 42% of hips in group 1, 41% in group 2 and in 49% in group   3. In the vast majority of hips, in each group, the RLL was present   in DeLee and Charnley zone 1 only (86%, 83%, 67% respectively).   Oxford and Harris Hip scores improved significantly in all groups.   There was no significant difference in these scores or in the change   in scores between the groups, with follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Despite the Rim Cutter showing promising results in early laboratory   and clinical studies, this analysis of the radiological and clinical   outcome five years post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>atively does not show any advantage   over and above modern cementing techniques in combination with a   well performing cemented acetabular component. For this reason,   we no longer use the Rim Cutter in routine primary THA. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1450–7.</p></sec>

Accuracy of CT-navigated pedicle screw positioning in the cervical and upper thoracic region with and without prior anterior surgery and ventral plating
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We aimed to retrospectively assess the accuracy and safety of   CT navigated pedicle screws and to compare accuracy in the cervical   and thoracic spine (C2-T8) with (COMB) and without (POST) prior   anterior surgery (anterior cervical discectomy or corpectomy and   fusion with ventral plating: ACDF/ACCF).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 592 pedicle screws, which were used in 107 consecutively   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ated patients (210 COMB, 382 POST), were analysed. The accuracy   of positioning was determined according to the classification of   Gertzbein and Robbins on post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative CT scans.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>High accuracy was achieved in 524 screws (88.5%), 192 (87.7%)   in the cervical spine and 332 (89%) in the thoracic spine, respectively.   The results in the two surgical groups were compared and a logistic   regression mixed model was performed to analyse the risk of low   accuracy. Significantly lower accuracy was found in the COMB group   with 82.9% <i>versus</i> 91.6% in the POST group (p =   0.036). There were no neurological complications, but two vertebral artery   lesions were recorded. Three patients underwent revision surgery   for malpositioning of a screw. Although the risk of malpositioning   of a screw after primary anterior surgery was estimated to be 2.4-times   higher than with posterior surgery alone, the overall rates of complication   and revision were low.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We therefore conclude that CT navigated pedicle screws can be   positioned safely although greater caution must be taken in patients   who have previously undergone anterior surgery.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1373–80.</p></sec>

MRI appearances of atypical cartilaginous tumour/grade I chondrosarcoma after treatment by curettage, phenolisation and allografting
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The purpose of this retrospective study was to differentiate   between the MRI features of normal post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative change and those   of residual or recurrent disease after intralesional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong> of   an atypical cartilage tumour (ACT)/grade I chondrosarcoma.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We reviewed the case notes, radiology and histology of 75 patients,   who had been treated for an ACT/grade I chondrosarcoma by curettage,   phenolisation and bone allografting between 1994 and 2005. The first   post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative Gd-enhanced MRI scan was carried out within one year   of surgery. Patients had a minimum of two scans and a mean follow-up   of 72 months (13 to 169). Further surgery was undertaken in cases   of suspected recurrence.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In 14 patients (18.6%) a second procedure was undertaken after   a mean period of 59 months (8 to 114). Radio frequency ablation   (RFA) was used in lesions of < 10 mm and curettage, phenolisation   and bone grafting for those ≥ 10 mm. Only six of these (8% of total)   had a histologically-proven recurrence. No increase in tumour grade   was seen at time of recurrence.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Based on this study, we have been able to classify the post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative   MRI appearances into four groups.

Delays in the diagnosis and treatment of bone and joint tuberculosis in the United Kingdom
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Tuberculosis (TB) infection of bones and joints accounts for   6.7% of TB cases in England, and is associated with significant   morbidity and disability. Public Health England reports that patients   with TB experience delays in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong>. Our aims were   to determine the demographics, presentation and investigation of   patients with a TB infection of bones and joints, to help doctors   assessing potential cases and to identify avoidable delays.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This was a retrospective observational study of all adults with   positive TB cultures on specimens taken at a tertiary orthopaedic   centre between June 2012 and May 2014. A laboratory information   system search identified the patients. The demographics, clinical presentation,   radiology, histopathology and key clinical dates were obtained from   medical records.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 31 adult patients were identified. Their median age   was 37 years (interquartile range (IQR): 29 to 53); 21 (68%) were   male; 89% were migrants. The main sites affected were joints (10,   32%), the spine (8, 26%) and long bones (6, 19%); 8 (26%) had multifocal   disease. The most common presenting symptoms were pain (29/31, 94%)   and swelling (26/28, 93%). ‘Typical’ symptoms of TB, such as fever,   sweats and weight loss, were uncommon. Patients waited a median   of seven months (IQR 3 to 13.5) between the onset of symptoms and referral   to the tertiary centre and 2.3 months (IQR 1.6 to 3.4.)) between   referral and starting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong>. Radiology suggested TB in 26 (84%),   but in seven patients (23%) the initial biopsy specimens were not   sent for mycobacterial culture, necessitating a second biopsy. Rapid   Polymerase Chain Reaction-based testing for TB using Xpert MTB/RIF   was performed in five patients; 4 (80%) tested positive for TB.   These patients had a reduced time between the diagnostic biopsy and   starting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong> than those whose samples were not tested (median   eight days <i>versus</i> 36 days, p = 0.016).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Patients with bone and joint TB experience delays in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s   and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong>, some of which are avoidable. Maintaining a high index   of clinical suspicion and sending specimens for mycobacterial culture   are crucial to avoid missing cases.

Sex Difference in Patients With Ischemic Heart Failure Undergoing Surgical Revascularization
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Female sex is conventionally considered a risk factor for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and has been included as a poor prognostic factor in multiple cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ative risk evaluation scores. We aimed to investigate the association of sex and the long-term benefit of CABG in patients with ischemic left ventricular dysfunction enrolled in the prospective STICH trial (Surgical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong> for Ischemic Heart Failure Study).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The STICH trial randomized 1212 patients (148 [12%] women and 1064 [88%] men) with coronary artery disease and left ventricular ejection fraction ≤35% to CABG+medical therapy (MED) versus MED alone. Long-term (10-year) outcomes with each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong> were compared according to sex.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>At baseline, women were older (63.4 versus 59.3 years; <i>P</i>=0.016) with higher body mass index (27.9 versus 26.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; <i>P</i>=0.001). Women had more coronary artery disease risk factors (diabetes mellitus, 55.4% versus 37.2%; hypertension, 70.9% versus 58.6%; hyperlipidemia, 70.3% versus 58.9%) except for smoking (13.5% versus 21.8%) and had lower rates of prior CABG (0% versus 3.4%; all <i>P</i><0.05) than men. Moreover, women had higher New York Heart Association class (class III/IV, 66.2% versus 57.0%), lower 6-minute walk capacity (300 versus 350 m), and lower Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire overall summary scores (51 versus 63; all <i>P</i><0.05). Over 10 years of follow-up, all-cause mortality (49.0% versus 65.8%; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.52–0.86; <i>P</i>=0.002) and cardiovascular mortality (34.3% versus 52.3%; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.65; 95% confidence interval, 0.48–0.89; <i>P</i>=0.006) were significantly lower in women compared with men. With randomization to CABG+MED versus MED <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong>, there was no significant interaction between sex and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong> group in all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, or the composite of all-cause mortality or cardiovascular hospitalization (all <i>P</i>>0.05). In addition, surgical deaths were not statistically different (1.5% versus 5.1%; <i>P</i>=0.187) between sexes among patients randomized to CABG per protocol as initial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Sex is not associated with the effect of CABG+MED versus MED on all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, the composite of death or cardiovascular hospitalization, or surgical deaths in patients with ischemic left ventricular dysfunction.

Large Cardiac Muscle Patches Engineered From Human Induced-Pluripotent Stem Cell–Derived Cardiac Cells Improve Recovery From Myocardial Infarction in Swine
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Here, we generated human cardiac muscle patches (hCMPs) of clinically relevant dimensions (4 cm × 2 cm × 1.25 mm) by suspending cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells that had been differentiated from human induced-pluripotent stem cells in a fibrin scaffold and then culturing the construct on a dynamic (rocking) platform.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In vitro assessments of hCMPs suggest maturation in response to dynamic culture stimulation. In vivo assessments were conducted in a porcine model of myocardial infarction (MI). Animal groups included: MI hearts treated with 2 hCMPs (MI+hCMP, n=13), MI hearts treated with 2 cell-free open fibrin patches (n=14), or MI hearts with neither experimental patch (n=15); a fourth group of animals underwent sham surgery (Sham, n=8). Cardiac function and infarct size were evaluated by MRI, arrhythmia incidence by implanted loop recorders, and the engraftment rate by calculation of quantitative polymerase chain reaction measurements of expression of the human Y chromosome. Additional studies <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">examin</span></strong>ed the myocardial protein expression profile changes and potential mechanisms of action that related to exosomes from the cell patch.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The hCMPs began to beat synchronously within 1 day of fabrication, and after 7 days of dynamic culture stimulation, in vitro assessments indicated the mechanisms related to the improvements in electronic mechanical coupling, calcium-handling, and force generation, suggesting a maturation process during the dynamic culture. The engraftment rate was 10.9±1.8% at 4 weeks after the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transplant</span></strong>ation. The hCMP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transplant</span></strong>ation was associated with significant improvements in left ventricular function, infarct size, myocardial wall stress, myocardial hypertrophy, and reduced apoptosis in the periscar boarder zone myocardium. hCMP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transplant</span></strong>ation also reversed some MI-associated changes in sarcomeric regulatory protein phosphorylation. The exosomes released from the hCMP appeared to have cytoprotective pr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oper</span></strong>ties that improved cardiomyocyte survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We have fabricated a clinically relevant size of hCMP with trilineage cardiac cells derived from human induced-pluripotent stem cells. The hCMP matures in vitro during 7 days of dynamic culture. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transplant</span></strong>ation of this type of hCMP results in significantly reduced infarct size and improvements in cardiac function that are associated with reduction in left ventricular wall stress. The hCMP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong> is not associated with significant changes in arrhythmogenicity.</p></sec>

Low-Dose Aspirin Discontinuation and Risk of Cardiovascular Events
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>There are increasing concerns about risks associated with aspirin discontinuation in the absence of major surgery or bleeding. We investigated whether long-term low-dose aspirin discontinuation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong> gaps increase the risk of cardiovascular events.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed a cohort study of 601 527 users of low-dose aspirin for primary or secondary prevention in the Swedish prescription register between 2005 and 2009 who were >40 years of age, were free from previous cancer, and had ≥80% adherence during the first observed year of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong>. Cardiovascular events were identified with the Swedish inpatient and cause-of-death registers. The first 3 months after a major bleeding or surgical procedure were excluded from the time at risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>During a median of 3.0 years of follow-up, 62 690 cardiovascular events occurred. Patients who discontinued aspirin had a higher rate of cardiovascular events than those who continued (multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio, 1.37; 95% confidence interval, 1.34–1.41), corresponding to an additional cardiovascular event observed per year in 1 of every 74 patients who discontinue aspirin. The risk increased shortly after discontinuation and did not appear to diminish over time.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In long-term users, discontinuation of low-dose aspirin in the absence of major surgery or bleeding was associated with a >30% increased risk of cardiovascular events. Adherence to low-dose aspirin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong> in the absence of major surgery or bleeding is likely an important <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">treatment</span></strong> goal.</p></sec>

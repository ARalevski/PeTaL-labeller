FUBAR: A Fast, Unconstrained Bayesian AppRoximation for Inferring Selection
<p>Model-based analyses of natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion often categorize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s into a relatively small number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> classes. Forcing each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> to belong to one of these classes places unrealistic constraints on the distribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion parameters, which can result in misleading inference due to model misspecification. We present an approximate hierarchical Bayesian method using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rout</span></strong>ine that ensures robustness against model misspecification by averaging over a large number of predefined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> classes. This leaves the distribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion parameters essentially unconstrained, and also allows <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s experiencing positive and purifying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion to be identified orders of magnitude faster than by existing methods. We demonstrate that popular random effects likelihood methods can produce misleading results when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s assigned to the same <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> class experience different levels of positive or purifying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion—an unavoidable scenario when using a small number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> classes. Our Fast Unconstrained Bayesian AppRoximation (FUBAR) is unaffected by this problem, while achieving higher power than existing unconstrained (fixed effects likelihood) methods. The speed advantage of FUBAR allows us to analyze larger data sets than other methods: We illustrate this on a large influenza hemagglutinin data set (3,142 sequences). FUBAR is available as a batch file within the latest HyPhy distribution (<ext-link>http://www.hyphy.org</ext-link>), as well as on the Datamonkey web server (<ext-link>http://www.datamonkey.org/</ext-link>).</p>

Natural Selection in the Great Apes
<p>Natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion is crucial for the adaptation of populations to their environments. Here, we present the first global study of natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion in the <i>Hominidae</i> (humans and great apes) based on genome-wide information from population samples representing all extant species (including most subspecies). Combining several neutrality tests we create a multi-species map of signatures of natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion covering all major types of natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion. We find that the estimated efficiency of both purifying and positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion varies between species and is significantly correlated with their long-term effective population size. Thus, even the modest differences in population size among the closely related <i>Hominidae</i> lineages have resulted in differences in their ability to remove deleterious alleles and to adapt to changing environments. Most signatures of balancing and positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion are species-specific, with signatures of balancing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion more often being shared among species. We also identify loci with evidence of positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion across several lineages. Notably, we detect signatures of positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion in several genes related to brain function, anatomy, diet and immune processes. Our results contribute to a better understanding of human evolution by putting the evidence of natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion in humans within its larger evolutionary context. The global map of natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion in our closest living relatives is available as an interactive browser at <ext-link>http://tinyurl.com/nf8qmzh</ext-link>.</p>

Highly variable chemical signatures over short spatial distances among Scots pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i>) populations
<p>Understanding within-species variability in terpenoid content and composition is highly relevant for predicting species adaptive potential to biotic stresses, but there is still limited information on terpene variations even for widespread species. We studied the foliage content and composition of terpenoids, foliage structure, and carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) contents in <i>Pinus sylvestris</i> L. in four Estonian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s ranging from dry forest to raised bog. In the bogs, samples were taken along the environmental gradient from drier margins towards wetter central parts. A chiral column was used to gain insight into the variation in terpene composition. We hypothesized that terpene contents increase and the composition becomes more diverse in more strongly N-limited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s (greater C/N ratio) and that terpene signatures cluster together in sub-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s with similar conditions (drier/wetter). Altogether 37 terpenes were quantified across the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s. Extremely large variability of terpene contents, 48–62% for monoterpenes and 61–89% for sesquiterpenes, was observed. According to the amounts of α-pinenes and (+)-3-carene, we distinguished two different ‘pine chemotypes’. Contrary to the hypothesis, terpene contents and variability were the greatest in the dry <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> with the lowest C/N ratio. However, individual terpenoids correlated differently with C or N in different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s, indicating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> effects on terpene composition. Moreover, correlations between the terpenoids and C or N depended on the pine chemotype. The sub-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s with different water regime were more strongly clustered together within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> than across the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s. The study demonstrates extensive variations in terpene contents and composition among the populations and over short spatial distances within the populations, suggesting a large among- and within-population adaptive capacity of <i>P. sylvestris</i>.</p>

Restored iron transport by a small molecule promotes absorption and hemoglobinization in animals
<p>Multiple human diseases ensue from a hereditary or acquired deficiency of iron-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ing protein function that diminishes transmembrane iron flux in distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s and directions. Because other iron-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> proteins remain active, labile iron gradients build up across the corresponding protein-deficient membranes. Here we report that a small-molecule natural product, hinokitiol, can harness such gradients to restore iron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> into, within, and/or out of cells. The same compound promotes gut iron absorption in DMT1-deficient rats and ferroportin-deficient mice, as well as hemoglobinization in DMT1- and mitoferrin-deficient zebrafish. These findings illuminate a general mechanistic framework for small molecule–mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>- and direction-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ive restoration of iron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>. They also suggest that small molecules that partially mimic the function of missing protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers of iron, and possibly other ions, may have potential in treating human diseases.</p>

The Evolution of Silicon Transport in Eukaryotes
<p>Biosilicification (the formation of biological structures from silica) occurs in diverse eukaryotic lineages, plays a major role in global biogeochemical cycles, and has significant biotechnological applications. Silicon (Si) uptake is crucial for biosilicification, yet the evolutionary history of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers involved remains poorly known. Recent evidence suggests that the SIT family of Si <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers, initially identified in diatoms, may be widely distributed, with an extended family of related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers (SIT-Ls) present in some nonsilicified organisms. Here, we identify SITs and SIT-Ls in a range of eukaryotes, including major silicified lineages (radiolarians and chrysophytes) and also bacterial SIT-Ls. Our evidence suggests that the symmetrical 10-transmembrane-domain SIT structure has independently evolved multiple times via duplication and fusion of 5-transmembrane-domain SIT-Ls. We also identify a second gene family, similar to the active Si <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er Lsi2, that is b<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">road</span></strong>ly distributed amongst siliceous and nonsiliceous eukaryotes. Our analyses resolve a distinct group of Lsi2-like genes, including plant and diatom Si-responsive genes, and sequences unique to siliceous sponges and choanoflagellates. The SIT/SIT-L and Lsi2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er families likely contribute to biosilicification in diverse lineages, indicating an ancient role for Si <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> in eukaryotes. We propose that these Si <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers may have arisen initially to prevent Si toxicity in the high Si Precambrian oceans, with subsequent biologically induced reductions in Si concentrations of Phanerozoic seas leading to widespread losses of SIT, SIT-L, and Lsi2-like genes in diverse lineages. Thus, the origin and diversification of two independent Si <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er families both drove and were driven by ancient ocean Si levels.</p>

Evidence for Selection on Gene Expression in Cultivated Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>)
<p>Artificial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion has been used throughout plant domestication and breeding to develop crops that are adapted to diverse environments. Here, we investigate whether gene regulatory changes have been widespread targets of lineage-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion in cultivated lines Minghui 63 and Zhenshan 97 of rice, <i>Oryza sativa</i>. A line experiencing positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion for either an increase or a decrease in genes' transcript abundances is expected to have an overabundance of expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) alleles that increase or decrease those genes' expression, respectively. Results indicate that several genes that share Gene Ontology terms or are members of the same coexpression module have eQTL alleles from one parent that consistently increase gene expression relative to the second parent. A second line of evidence for lineage-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion is an overabundance of <i>cis–trans</i> pairs of eQTL alleles that affect gene expression in the same direction (are reinforcing). Across all <i>cis–trans</i> pairs of eQTL, including pairs that both weakly and strongly affect gene expression, there is no evidence for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion. However, the frequency of genes with reinforcing eQTL increases with eQTL strength. Therefore, there is evidence that eQTL with strong effects were positively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ed during rice cultivation. Among 41 <i>cis–trans</i> pairs with strong <i>trans</i> eQTL, 31 have reinforcing eQTL. Several of the candidate genes under positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion accurately predict phenotypic differences between Minghui 63 and Zhenshan 97. Overall, our results suggest that positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion for regulatory alleles may be a key factor in plant improvement.</p>

Opposing microtubule motors control motility, morphology and cargo segregation during ER-to-Golgi transport
<p>We recently demonstrated that dynein and kinesin motors drive multiple aspects of endosomal function in mammalian cells. These functions include driving motility, maintaining morphology (notably through providing longitudinal tension to support vesicle fission), and driving cargo sorting. Microtubule motors drive bidirectional motility during traffic between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi. Here, we have examined the role of microtubule motors in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> carrier motility, morphology, and domain organization during ER-to-Golgi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>. We show that, consistent with our findings for endosomal dynamics, microtubule motor function during ER-to-Golgi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> of secretory cargo is required for motility, morphology, and cargo sorting within vesicular tubular carriers <i>en <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rout</span></strong>e</i> to the Golgi. Our data are consistent with previous findings that defined roles for dynein-1, kinesin-1 (KIF5B) and kinesin-2 in this trafficking step. Our high resolution tracking data identify some intriguing aspects. Depletion of kinesin-1 reduces the number of motile structures seen, which is in line with other findings relating to the role of kinesin-1 in ER export. However, those <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> carriers that were produced had a much greater run length suggesting that this motor can act as a brake on anterograde motility. Kinesin-2 depletion did not significantly reduce the number of motile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> carriers but did cause a similar increase in run length. These data suggest that kinesins act as negative regulators of ER-to-Golgi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>. Depletion of dynein not only reduced the number of motile carriers formed but also caused tubulation of carriers similar to that seen for sorting nexin-coated early endosomes. Our data indicated that the previously observed anterograde–retrograde polarity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> carriers in transit to the Golgi from the ER is maintained by microtubule motor function.</p>

Winter drought impairs xylem phenology, anatomy and growth in Mediterranean Scots pine forests
<p>Continental Mediterranean forests face drought but also cold spells and both climate extremes can impair the resilience capacity of these forests. Climate warming could amplify the negative effects of cold spells by inducing premature dehardening. Here we capitalize on a winter drought-induced dieback triggered by a cold spell which occurred in December 2001 affecting Scots pine forests in eastern Spain. We assessed post-dieback recovery by quantifying and comparing radial growth and xylem anatomy of non-declining (ND, crown cover >50%) and declining (D, crown cover ≤50%) trees in two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s (VP, Villarroya de los Pinares; TO, Torrijas). We also characterized xylogenesis in both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s and aboveground productivity in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> VP. Dieback caused legacy effects since needle loss, a 60% reduction in litter fall and radial-growth decline characterized D-trees 3 years after dieback symptoms started appearing in spring 2002. D-trees formed collapsed tracheids in the 2002-ring, particularly in the most affected VP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> where xylogenesis differences between ND and D trees were most noticeable. The lower growth rates of D-trees were caused by a shorter duration of their major xylogenesis phases. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> VP the radial-enlargement and wall-thickening of tracheids were significantly reduced in D-trees as compared to ND-trees because these xylogenesis phases tended to start earlier and end later in ND-trees. Gompertz models fitted to tracheid production predicted that maximum growth rates occurred 11–12 days earlier in ND than in D-trees. The formation of radially-enlarging tracheids was enhanced by longer days in both study <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s and also by wetter conditions in the driest TO <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>, but xylogenesis sensitivity to climate was reduced in D-trees. Winter-drought dieback impairs xylem anatomy and phenology, aboveground productivity, xylogenesis and growth in Mediterranean Scots pine populations. Affected stands show a costly post-dieback recovery challenging their resilience ability.</p>

Modulation of Cl<sup>−</sup> signaling and ion transport by recruitment of kinases and phosphatases mediated by the regulatory protein IRBIT
<p>IRBIT is a multifunctional protein that controls the activity of various epithelial ion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers including NBCe1-B. Interaction with IRBIT increases NBCe1-B activity and exposes two cryptic Cl<sup>−</sup>-sensing GXXXP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s that enable regulation of NBCe1-B by intracellular Cl<sup>−</sup> (Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub>). Here, phosphoproteomic analysis revealed that IRBIT controlled five phosphorylation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s in NBCe1-B that determined both the active conformation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er and its regulation by Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub>. Mutational analysis suggested that the phosphorylation status of Ser<sup>232</sup>, Ser<sup>233</sup>, and Ser<sup>235</sup> was regulated by IRBIT and determined whether NBCe1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers are in active or inactive conformations. The absence of phosphorylation at Ser<sup>232</sup>, Ser<sup>233</sup>, or Ser<sup>235</sup> produced NBCe1-B in the conformations pSer<sup>233</sup>/pSer<sup>235</sup>, pSer<sup>232</sup>/pSer<sup>235</sup>, or pSer<sup>232</sup>/pSer<sup>233</sup>, respectively. The activity of the pSer<sup>233</sup>/pSer<sup>235</sup> form was similar to that of IRBIT-activated NBCe1-B, but it was insensitive to inhibition by Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub>. The properties of the pSer<sup>232</sup>/pSer<sup>235</sup> form were similar to those of wild-type NBCe1-B, whereas the pSer<sup>232</sup>/pSer<sup>233</sup> form was partially active, further activated by IRBIT, but retained inhibition by Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub>. Furthermore, IRBIT recruited the phosphatase PP1 and the kinase SPAK to control phosphorylation of Ser<sup>65</sup>, which affected Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub> sensing by the <sup>32</sup>GXXXP<sup>36</sup> motif. IRBIT also recruited the phosphatase calcineurin and the kinase CaMKII to control phosphorylation of Ser<sup>12</sup>, which affected Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub> sensing by the <sup>194</sup>GXXXP<sup>198</sup> motif. Ser<sup>232</sup>, Ser<sup>233</sup>, and Ser<sup>235</sup> are conserved in all NBCe1 variants and affect their activity. These findings reveal how multiple kinase and phosphatase pathways use phosphorylation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s to fine-tune a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er, which have important implications for epithelial fluid and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> secretion.</p>

Pausing of Chloroplast Ribosomes Is Induced by Multiple Features and Is Linked to the Assembly of Photosynthetic Complexes<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Many mRNAs contain pause <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s that briefly interrupt the progress of translation. Specific features that induce ribosome pausing have been described; however, their individual contributions to pause-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> formation, and the overall biological significance of ribosome pausing, remain largely unclear. We have taken advantage of the compact genome of chloroplasts to carry out a plastid genome-wide survey of pause <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s, as a basis for studying the impact of pausing on posttranslational processes. Based on ribosomal profiling of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) chloroplast mRNAs, we demonstrate that a combination of factors—mRNA secondary structure, internal Shine-Dalgarno sequences, and positively charged amino acids in the nascent peptide chain—explains 95% of the major pause <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s on plastid mRNAs, whereas codon usage has little impact. The distribution of the pause <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s is nonrandom and conforms to distinct patterns in the vicinity of sequences coding for transmembrane domains, which depend on their orientation within the membrane as well as being next to sequences coding for cofactor binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s. We found strong indications that the mechanisms causing ribosomal pausing and at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leas</span></strong>t some of the ribosomes pause <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s are conserved between distantly related plant species. In addition, the positions of features that cause pausing are well conserved in photoautotrophic plants, but less so in their nonphotosynthetic, parasitic relatives, implying that the synthesis and assembly of photosynthetic multiprotein complexes requires localized ribosome pausing.</p>

A Magnesium Transporter OsMGT1 Plays a Critical Role in Salt Tolerance in Rice
<p>Salt stress is one of the major factors limiting rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) production globally. Although several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers involved in salt tolerance have been identified in rice, the mechanisms regulating their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> activity are still poorly understood. Here, we show evidence that a rice Mg <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er OsMGT1 is required for salt tolerance probably by regulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> activity of OsHKT1;5, a key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er for the removal of Na<sup>+</sup> from the xylem sap at the root mature zone. Knockout of <i>OsMGT1</i> did not affect total Na uptake, but increased Na concentration in the shoots and xylem sap, resulting in a significant increase in salt sensitivity at low external Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration (20–200 μ<sc>m</sc>). However, such differences were abolished at a higher Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration (2 m<sc>m</sc>), although the total Na uptake was not altered. <i>OsMGT1</i> was expressed in both the roots and shoots, but only that in the roots was moderately up-regulated by salt stress. Spatial expression analysis revealed that <i>OsMGT1</i> was expressed in all root cells of the root tips but was highly expressed in the pericycle of root mature zone. <i>OsMGT1</i> was also expressed in the phloem region of basal node, leaf blade, and sheath. When expressed in <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> activity of OsHKT1;5 was enhanced by elevating external Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration. Furthermore, knockout of <i>OsHKT1;5</i> in <i>osmgt1</i> mutant background did not further increase its salt sensitivity. Taken together, our results suggest that Mg<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ed by OsMGT1 in the root mature zone is required for enhancing OsHKT1;5 activity, thereby restricting Na accumulation to the shoots.</p>

Detecting Adaptation in Protein-Coding Genes Using a Bayesian Site-Heterogeneous Mutation-Selection Codon Substitution Model
<p>Codon substitution models have traditionally attempted to uncover signatures of adaptation within protein-coding genes by contrasting the rates of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions. Another modeling approach, known as the mutation–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion framework, attempts to explicitly account for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ive patterns at the amino acid level, with some approaches allowing for heterogeneity in these patterns across codon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s. Under such a model, substitutions at a given position occur at the neutral or nearly neutral rate when they are synonymous, or when they correspond to replacements between amino acids of similar fitness; substitutions from high to low (low to high) fitness amino acids have comparatively low (high) rates. Here, we study the use of such a mutation–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion framework as a null model for the detection of adaptation. Following previous works in this direction, we include a deviation parameter that has the effect of capturing the surplus, or deficit, in non-synonymous rates, relative to what would be expected under a mutation–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion modeling framework that includes a Dirichlet process approach to account for across-codon-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> variation in amino acid fitness profiles. We use simulations, along with a few real data sets, to study the behavior of the approach, and find it to have good power with a low false-positive rate. Altogether, we emphasize the potential of recent mutation–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion models in the detection of adaptation, calling for further model refinements as well as large-scale applications.</p>

Genome-Wide Analysis of Selection on the Malaria Parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> in West African Populations of Differing Infection Endemicity
<p>Locally varying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion on pathogens may be due to differences in drug pressure, host immunity, transmission opportunities between hosts, or the intensity of between-genotype competition within hosts. Highly recombining populations of the human malaria para<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> throughout West Africa are closely related, as gene flow is relatively unrestricted in this endemic region, but markedly varying ecology and transmission intensity should cause distinct local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ive pressures. Genome-wide analysis of sequence variation was undertaken on a sample of 100 <i>P. falciparum</i> clinical isolates from a highly endemic region of the Republic of Guinea where transmission occurs for most of each year and compared with data from 52 clinical isolates from a previously sampled population from The Gambia, where there is relatively limited seasonal malaria transmission. Paired-end short-read sequences were mapped against the 3D7 <i>P. falciparum</i> reference genome sequence, and data on 136,144 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were obtained. Within-population analyses identifying loci showing evidence of recent positive directional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion and balancing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion confirm that antimalarial drugs and host immunity have been major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ive agents. Many of the signatures of recent directional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion reflected by standardized integrated haplotype scores were population specific, including differences at drug resistance loci due to historically different antimalarial use between the countries. In contrast, both populations showed a similar set of loci likely to be under balancing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion as indicated by very high Tajima’s <i>D</i> values, including a significant overrepresentation of genes expressed at the merozoite stage that invades erythrocytes and several previously validated targets of acquired immunity. Between-population <i>F</i><sub>ST</sub> analysis identified exceptional differentiation of allele frequencies at a small number of loci, most markedly for five SNPs covering a 15-kb region within and flanking the <i>gdv1</i> gene that regulates the early stages of gametocyte development, which is likely related to the extreme differences in mosquito vector abundance and seasonality that determine the transmission opportunities for the sexual stage of the para<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>.</p>

Inference of Natural Selection from Interspersed Genomic Elements Based on Polymorphism and Divergence
<p>Complete genome sequences contain valuable information about natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion, but this information is difficult to access for short, widely scattered noncoding elements such as transcription factor binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s or small noncoding RNAs. Here, we introduce a new computational method, called <i>I</i>nference of <i>N</i>atural <i>S</i>election from <i>I</i>nterspersed <i>G</i>enomically co<i>H</i>erent elemen<i>T</i>s (INSIGHT), for measuring the influence of natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion on such elements. INSIGHT uses a generative probabilistic model to contrast patterns of polymorphism and divergence in the elements of interest with those in flanking neutral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s, pooling weak information from many short elements in a manner that accounts for variation among loci in mutation rates and coalescent times. The method is able to disentangle the contributions of weak negative, strong negative, and positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion based on their distinct effects on patterns of polymorphism and divergence. It obtains information about divergence from multiple outgroup genomes using a general statistical phylogenetic approach. The INSIGHT model is efficiently fitted to genome-wide data using an approximate expectation maximization algorithm. Using simulations, we show that the method can accurately estimate the parameters of interest even in complex demographic scenarios, and that it significantly improves on methods based on summary statistics describing polymorphism and divergence. To demonstrate the usefulness of INSIGHT, we apply it to several classes of human noncoding RNAs and to GATA2-binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s in the human genome.</p>

Skeletal muscle fuel selection occurs at the mitochondrial level
<p>Mammals exponentially increase the rate of carbohydrate oxidation as exercise intensity rises, while birds combust lipid almost exclusively while flying at high percentages of aerobic capacity. The fuel oxidized by contracting muscle depends on many factors: whole-body fuel storage mass, mobilization, blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>, cellular uptake, and substrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion at the level of the mitochondrion. We examined the fuel preferences of mitochondria isolated from mammalian and avian locomotory muscles using two approaches. First, the influence of substrates on the kinetics of respiration (<i>K</i><sub>m,ADP</sub> and <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>) was evaluated. For all substrates and combinations, <i>K</i><sub>m,ADP</sub> was generally twofold higher in avian mitochondria. Second, fuel competition between pyruvate, glutamate and/or palmitoyl-<sc>l</sc>-carnitine at three levels of ATP free energy was determined using the principle of mass balance and the measured rates of O<sub>2</sub> consumption and metabolite accumulation/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">util</span></strong>ization. Avian mitochondria strongly spared pyruvate from oxidation when another substrate was available and fatty acid was the dominant substrate, regardless of energy state. Mammalian mitochondria exhibited some preference for fatty acid over pyruvate at lower flux (higher energy state), but exhibited a much greater tendency to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong> pyruvate and glutamate when available. Studies in sonicated mitochondria revealed twofold higher electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> chain electron conductance in avian mitochondria. We conclude that substantial fuel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion occurs at the level of the mitochondrial matrix and that avian flight muscle mitochondria are particularly biased toward the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion of fatty acid, possibly by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">facil</span></strong>itating high β-oxidation flux by maintaining a more oxidized matrix.</p>

Inhibition of Endothelial Notch Signaling Impairs Fatty Acid Transport and Leads to Metabolic and Vascular Remodeling of the Adult Heart
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Nutrients are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ed through endothelial cells before being metabolized in muscle cells. However, little is known about the regulation of endothelial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> processes. Notch signaling is a critical regulator of metabolism and angiogenesis during development. Here, we studied how genetic and pharmacological manipulation of endothelial Notch signaling in adult mice affects endothelial fatty acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>, cardiac angiogenesis, and heart function.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Endothelial-specific Notch inhibition was achieved by conditional genetic inactivation of Rbp-jκ in adult mice to analyze fatty acid metabolism and heart function. Wild-type mice were treated with neutralizing antibodies against the Notch ligand Delta-like 4. Fatty acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> was studied in cultured endothelial cells and transgenic mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Treatment of wild-type mice with Delta-like 4 neutralizing antibodies for 8 weeks impaired fractional shortening and ejection fraction in the majority of mice. Inhibition of Notch signaling specifically in the endothelium of adult mice by genetic ablation of Rbp-jκ caused heart hypertrophy and failure. Impaired heart function was preceded by alterations in fatty acid metabolism and an increase in cardiac blood vessel density. Endothelial Notch signaling controlled the expression of endothelial lipase, Angptl4, CD36, and Fabp4, which are all needed for fatty acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> across the vessel wall. In endothelial-specific Rbp-jκ–mutant mice, lipase activity and transendothelial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> of long-chain fatty acids to muscle cells were impaired. In turn, lipids accumulated in the plasma and liver. The attenuated supply of cardiomyocytes with long-chain fatty acids was accompanied by higher glucose uptake, increased concentration of glycolysis intermediates, and mTOR-S6K signaling. Treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin or displacing glucose as cardiac substrate by feeding a ketogenic diet prolonged the survival of endothelial-specific Rbp-jκ–deficient mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This study identifies Notch signaling as a novel regulator of fatty acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> across the endothelium and as an essential repressor of angiogenesis in the adult heart.

Phosphorylation of the phosphatase PTPROt at Tyr<sup>399</sup> is a molecular switch that controls osteoclast activity and bone mass in vivo
<p>Bone resorption by osteoclasts is essential for bone homeostasis. The kinase Src promotes osteoclast activity and is activated in osteoclasts by the receptor-type tyrosine phosphatase PTPROt. In other contexts, however, PTPROt can inhibit Src activity. Through in vivo and in vitro experiments, we show that PTPROt is bifunctional and can dephosphorylate Src both at its inhibitory residue Tyr<sup>527</sup> and its activating residue Tyr<sup>416</sup>. Whereas wild-type and PTPROt knockout mice exhibited similar bone masses, mice in which a putative C-terminal phosphorylation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>, Tyr<sup>399</sup>, in endogenous PTPROt was replaced with phenylalanine had increased bone mass and reduced osteoclast activity. Osteoclasts from the knock-in mice also showed reduced Src activity. Experiments in cultured cells and in osteoclasts derived from both mouse strains demonstrated that the absence of phosphorylation at Tyr<sup>399</sup> caused PTPROt to dephosphorylate Src at the activating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> pTyr<sup>416</sup>. In contrast, phosphorylation of PTPROt at Tyr<sup>399</sup> enabled PTPROt to recruit Src through Grb2 and to dephosphorylate Src at the inhibitory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> Tyr<sup>527</sup>, thus stimulating Src activity. We conclude that reversible phosphorylation of PTPROt at Tyr<sup>399</sup> is a molecular switch that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>s between its opposing activities toward Src and maintains a coherent signaling output, and that blocking this phosphorylation event can induce physiological effects in vivo. Because most receptor-type tyrosine phosphatases contain potential phosphorylation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s at their C termini, we propose that preventing phosphorylation at these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s or its consequences may offer an alternative to inhibiting their catalytic activity to achieve therapeutic benefit.</p>

Modulation of Auxin Signaling and Development by Polyadenylation Machinery
<p>Polyadenylation influences gene expression by affecting mRNA stability, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>, and translatability. Here, we report that Cleavage stimulation Factor 77 (AtCstF77), a component of the pre-mRNA 3′-end polyadenylation machinery, affects polyadenylation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> (PAS) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion in transcripts of some auxin signaling genes in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Disruption of <i>AtCstF77</i> reduced auxin sensitivity and decreased the expression of the auxin reporter <i>DR5</i>-<i>GFP</i>. Null mutations of <i>cstf77</i> caused severe developmental defects, but were not lethal as previously reported. <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> genetically interacted with <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> inhibitor response 1 auxin signaling f</i>-<i>box 2</i> auxin receptor double mutants, further supporting that polyadenylation affects auxin signaling. <i>AtCstF77</i> was ubiquitously expressed in embryos, seedlings, and adult plants. The AtCstF77 protein was localized in the nucleus, which is consistent with its function in pre-mRNA processing. We observed that PASs in transcripts from approximately 2,400 genes were shifted in the <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> mutant. Moreover, most of the PAS shifts were from proximal to distal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s. Auxin treatment also caused PAS shifts in transcripts from a small number of genes. Several auxin signaling or homeostasis genes had different PASs in their transcripts in the <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> mutant. The expression levels of <i>AUXIN RESISTANT 2</i>/<i>INDOLE</i>-<i>3</i>-<i>ACETIC ACID 7</i> were significantly increased in the <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> mutant, which can partially account for the auxin resistance phenotype of this mutant. Our results demonstrate that AtCstF77 plays pleiotropic and critical roles in Arabidopsis development. Moreover, disruption of AtCstF64, another component of the polyadenylation machinery, led to developmental defects and reduced auxin response, similar to those of the <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> mutant. We conclude that AtCstF77 affects auxin responses, likely by controlling PAS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion of transcripts of some auxin signaling components.</p>

MAPINS, a Highly Efficient Detection Method That Identifies Insertional Mutations and Complex DNA Rearrangements
<p>Insertional mutagenesis, in which a piece of exogenous DNA is integrated randomly into the genomic DNA of the recipient cell, is a useful method to generate new mutants with phenotypes of interest. The unicellular green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> is an outstanding model for studying many biological processes. We developed a new computational algorithm, MAPINS (mapping insertions), to efficiently identify insertion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s created by the integration of an <i>APHVIII</i> (<i>aminoglycoside 3′-phosphotransferase VIII</i>) cassette that confers paromomycin resistance. Using whole-genome sequencing data, this method eliminates the need for genomic DNA manipulation and retains all the sequencing information provided by paired-end sequencing. We experimentally verified 38 insertion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s out of 41 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s (93%) identified by MAPINS from 20 paromomycin-resistant strains. Using meiotic analysis of 18 of these strains, we identified insertion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s that completely cosegregate with paromomycin resistance. In six of the seven strains with a mutant phenotype, we demonstrated complete cosegregation of the mutant phenotype and the verified insertion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>. In addition, we provide direct evidence of complex rearrangements of genomic DNA in five strains, three of which involve the <i>APHVIII</i> insertion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>. We suggest that strains obtained by insertional mutagenesis are more complicated than expected from previous analyses in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>. To map the locations of some complex insertions, we designed 49 molecular markers based on differences identified via whole-genome sequencing between wild-type strains CC-124 and CC-125. Overall, MAPINS provides a low-cost, efficient method to characterize insertional mutants in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>.</p>

The Coumarin Glucoside, Esculin, Reveals Rapid Changes in Phloem-Transport Velocity in Response to Environmental Cues
<p>The study of phloem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> and its vital roles in long-distance communication and carbon allocation have been hampered by a lack of suitable tools that allow high-throughput, real-time studies. Esculin, a fluorescent coumarin glucoside, is recognized by Suc <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers, including AtSUC2, which loads it into the phloem for translocation to sink tissues. These properties make it an ideal tool for use in live-imaging experiments, where it acts as a surrogate for Suc. Here, we show that esculin is translocated with a similar efficiency to Suc and, because of its ease of application and detection, demonstrate that it is an ideal tool for in vivo studies of phloem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>. We used esculin to determine the effect of different environmental cues on the velocity of phloem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>. We provide evidence that fluctuations in cotyledon Suc levels influence phloem velocity rapidly, supporting the pressure-flow model of phloem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>. Under acute changes in light levels, the phloem velocity mirrored changes in the expression of <i>AtSUC2</i>. This observation suggests that under certain environmental conditions, transcriptional regulation may affect the abundance of AtSUC2 and thus regulate the phloem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> velocity.</p>

Boron Alleviates Aluminum Toxicity by Promoting Root Alkalization in Transition Zone via Polar Auxin Transport
<p>Boron (B) alleviates aluminum (Al) toxicity in higher plants; however, the underlying mechanisms behind this phenomenon remain unknown. Here, we used bromocresol green pH indicator, noninvasive microtest, and microelectrode ion flux estimation techniques to demonstrate that B promotes root surface pH gradients in pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) roots, leading to alkalization in the root transition zone and acidification in the elongation zone, while Al inhibits these pH gradients. B significantly decreased Al accumulation in the transition zone (∼1.0–2.5 mm from the apex) of lateral roots, thereby alleviating Al-induced inhibition of root elongation. Net indole acetic acid (IAA) efflux detected by an IAA-sensitive platinum microelectrode showed that polar auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>, which peaked in the root transition zone, was inhibited by Al toxicity, while it was partially recovered by B. Electrophysiological experiments using the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er mutants (<i>auxin resistant1-7</i>; <i>pin-formed2</i> [<i>pin2</i>]) and the specific polar auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er inhibitor1-naphthylphthalamic acid showed that PIN2-based polar auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> is involved in root surface alkalization in the transition zone. Our results suggest that B promotes polar auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> driven by the auxin efflux <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er PIN2 and leads to the downstream regulation of the plasma membrane-H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, resulting in elevated root surface pH, which is essential to decrease Al accumulation in this Al-targeted apical root zone. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the role of exogenous B in alleviation of Al accumulation and toxicity in plants.</p>

Sugar Transporter STP7 Specificity for <sc>l</sc>-Arabinose and <sc>d</sc>-Xylose Contrasts with the Typical Hexose Transporters STP8 and STP12
<p>The controlled distribution of sugars between assimilate-exporting source tissues and sugar-consuming sink tissues is a key element for plant growth and development. Monosaccharide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers of the SUGAR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> PROTEIN (STP) family contribute to the uptake of sugars into sink cells. Here, we report on the characterization of STP7, STP8, and STP12, three previously uncharacterized members of this family in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Heterologous expression in yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) revealed that STP8 and STP12 catalyze the high-affinity proton-dependent uptake of glucose and also accept galactose and mannose. STP12 additionally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>s xylose. <i>STP8</i> and <i>STP12</i> are highly expressed in reproductive organs, where their protein products might contribute to sugar uptake into the pollen tube and the embryo sac. <i>stp8.1</i> and <i>stp12.1</i> T-DNA insertion lines developed normally, which may point toward functional redundancy with other STPs. In contrast to all other STPs, STP7 does not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> hexoses but is specific for the pentoses <sc>l</sc>-arabinose and <sc>d</sc>-xylose. <i>STP7-</i>promoter-reporter gene plants showed an expression of <i>STP7</i> especially in tissues with high cell wall turnover, indicating that STP7 might contribute to the uptake and recycling of cell wall sugars. Uptake analyses with radioactive <sc>l</sc>-arabinose revealed that 11 other STPs are able to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> <sc>l</sc>-arabinose with high affinity. Hence, functional redundancy might explain the missing-mutant phenotype of two <i>stp7</i> T-DNA insertion lines. Together, these data complete the characterization of the STP family and present the STPs as new <sc>l</sc>-arabinose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers for potential biotechnological applications.</p>

Vacuolar Transporters – Companions on a Longtime Journey
<p>Biochemical and electrophysiological studies on plant vacuolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers became feasible in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when methods to isolate large quantities of intact vacuoles and purified vacuolar membrane vesicles were established. However, with the exception of the H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase and H<sup>+</sup>-PPase, which could be followed due to their hydrolytic activities, attempts to purify tonoplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers were for a long time not successful. Heterologous complementation, T-DNA insertion mutants, and later proteomic studies allowed the next steps, starting from the 1990s. Nowadays, our knowledge about vacuolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers has increased greatly. Nevertheless, there are several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers of central importance that have still to be identified at the molecular level or have even not been characterized biochemically. Furthermore, our knowledge about regulation of the vacuolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers is very limited, and much work is needed to get a holistic view about the interplay of the vacuolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ome. The huge amount of information generated during the last 35 years cannot be summarized in such a review. Therefore, I decided to concentrate on some aspects where we were involved during my research on vacuolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers, for some our laboratories contributed more, while others contributed less.</p>

Adaptor Protein-3-Dependent Vacuolar Trafficking Involves a Subpopulation of COPII and HOPS Tethering Proteins
<p>Plant vacuoles are versatile organelles critical for plant growth and responses to environment. Vacuolar proteins are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ed from the endoplasmic reticulum via multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rout</span></strong>es in plants. Two classic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rout</span></strong>es bear great similarity to other phyla with major regulators known, such as COPII and Rab5 GTPases. By contrast, vacuolar trafficking mediated by adaptor protein-3 (AP-3) or that independent of the Golgi has few recognized cargos and none of the regulators. In search of novel regulators for vacuolar trafficking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rout</span></strong>es and by using a fluorescence-based forward genetic screen, we demonstrated that the multispan transmembrane protein, Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) PROTEIN <i>S</i>-ACYL TRANSFERASE10 (PAT10), is an AP-3-mediated vacuolar cargo. We show that the tonoplast targeting of PAT10 is mediated by the AP-3 complex but independent of the Rab5-mediated post-Golgi trafficking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rout</span></strong>e. We also report that AP-3-mediated vacuolar trafficking involves a subpopulation of COPII and requires the vacuolar tethering complex HOPS. In addition, we have identified two novel mutant alleles of <i>AP-3δ</i>, whose point mutations interfered with the formation of the AP-3 complex as well as its membrane targeting. The results presented here shed new light on the vacuolar trafficking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rout</span></strong>e mediated by AP-3 in plant cells.</p>

Metal Tolerance Protein 8 Mediates Manganese Homeostasis and Iron Reallocation during Seed Development and Germination
<p>Metal accumulation in seeds is a prerequi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> for germination and establishment of plants but also for micronutrient delivery to humans. To investigate metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> processes and their interactions in seeds, we focused on METAL TOLERANCE PROTEIN8 (MTP8), a tonoplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er of the manganese (Mn) subclade of cation diffusion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">facil</span></strong>itators, which in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) is expressed in embryos of seeds. The x-ray fluorescence imaging showed that expression of MTP8 was responsible for Mn localization in subepidermal cells on the abaxial side of the cotyledons and in cortical cells of the hypocotyl. Accordingly, under low Mn availability, MTP8 increased seed stores of Mn, required for efficient seed germination. In mutant embryos lacking expression of <i>VACUOLAR IRON <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ER1</i> (<i>VIT1</i>), MTP8 built up iron (Fe) hotspots in <i>MTP8</i>-expressing cells types, suggesting that MTP8 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>s Fe in addition to Mn. In <i>mtp8 vit1</i> double mutant seeds, Mn and Fe were distributed in all cell types of the embryo. An Fe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> function of MTP8 was confirmed by its ability to complement Fe hypersensitivity of a yeast mutant defective in vacuolar Fe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>. Imbibing <i>mtp8-1</i> mutant seeds in the presence of Mn or subjecting seeds to wet-dry cycles showed that MTP8 conferred Mn tolerance. During germination, MTP8 promoted reallocation of Fe from the vasculature. These results indicate that cell type-specific accumulation of Mn and Fe in seeds depends on MTP8 and that this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er plays an important role in the generation of seed metal stores as well as for metal homeostasis and germination efficiency under challenging environmental conditions.</p>

Global Sensitivity Analysis of OnGuard Models Identifies Key Hubs for Transport Interaction in Stomatal Dynamics
<p>The physical requirement for charge to balance across biological membranes means that the transmembrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> of each ionic species is interrelated, and manipulating solute flux through any one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er will affect other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers at the same membrane, often with unforeseen consequences. The OnGuard systems modeling platform has helped to resolve the mechanics of stomatal movements, uncovering previously unexpected behaviors of stomata. To date, however, the manual approach to exploring model parameter space has captured little formal information about the emergent connections between parameters that define the most interesting properties of the system as a whole. Here, we introduce global sensitivity analysis to identify interacting parameters affecting a number of outputs commonly accessed in experiments in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The analysis highlights synergies between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers affecting the balance between Ca<sup>2+</sup> sequestration and Ca<sup>2+</sup> re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leas</span></strong>e pathways, notably those associated with internal Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores and their turnover. Other, unexpected synergies appear, including with the plasma membrane anion channels and H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase and with the tonoplast TPK K<sup>+</sup> channel. These emergent synergies, and the core hubs of interaction that they define, identify subsets of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers associated with free cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration that represent key targets to enhance plant performance in the future. They also highlight the importance of interactions between the voltage regulation of the plasma membrane and tonoplast in coordinating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> between the different cellular compartments.</p>

Spontaneous Mutation Accumulation in <i>Daphnia pulex</i> in Selection-Free vs. Competitive Environments
<p>Understanding the rates, spectra, and fitness effects of spontaneous mutations is fundamental to answering key questions in evolution, molecular biology, disease genetics, and conservation biology. To estimate mutation rates and evaluate the effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion on new mutations, we propagated mutation accumulation (MA) lines of <i>Daphnia pulex</i> for more than 82 generations and maintained a non-MA population under conditions where <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion could act. Both experiments were started with the same obligate asexual progenitor clone. By sequencing 30 genomes and implementing a series of validation steps that informed the bioinformatic analyses, we identified a total of 477 single nucleotide mutations (SNMs) in the MA lines, corresponding to a mutation rate of 2.30 × 10<sup>−9</sup> (95% CI 1.90–2.70 × 10<sup>−9</sup>) per nucleotide per generation. The high overall rate of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of 4.82 × 10<sup>−5</sup> per <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> per generation was due to a large ameiotic recombination event spanning an entire arm of a chromosome (∼6 Mb) and several hemizygous deletion events spanning ∼2 kb each. In the non-MA population, we found significantly fewer mutations than expected based on the rate derived from the MA experiment, indicating purifying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion was likely acting to remove new deleterious mutations. We observed a surprisingly high level of genetic variability in the non-MA population, which we propose to be driven by balancing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion. Our findings suggest that both positive and negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion on new mutations is powerful and effective in a strictly clonal population.</p>

Reconstruction of Haplotype-Blocks Selected during Experimental Evolution
<p>The genetic analysis of experimentally evolving populations typically relies on short reads from pooled individuals (Pool-Seq). While this method provides reliable allele frequency estimates, the underlying haplotype structure remains poorly characterized. With small population sizes and adaptive variants that start from low frequencies, the interpretation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion signatures in most Evolve and Resequencing studies remains challenging. To <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">facil</span></strong>itate the characterization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion targets, we propose a new approach that reconstructs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ed haplotypes from replicated time series, using Pool-Seq data. We identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ed haplotypes through the correlated frequencies of alleles carried by them. Computer simulations indicate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ed haplotype-blocks of several Mb can be reconstructed with high confidence and low error rates, even when allele frequencies change only by 20% across three replicates. Applying this method to real data from <i>D. melanogaster</i> populations adapting to a hot environment, we identify a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ed haplotype-block of 6.93 Mb. We confirm the presence of this haplotype-block in evolved populations by experimental haplotyping, demonstrating the power and accuracy of our haplotype reconstruction from Pool-Seq data. We propose that the combination of allele frequency estimates with haplotype information will provide the key to understanding the dynamics of adaptive alleles.</p>

Dynamic Convergent Evolution Drives the Passage Adaptation across 48 Years’ History of H3N2 Influenza Evolution
<p>Influenza viruses are often propagated in a diverse set of culturing media and additional substitutions known as passage adaptation can cause extra evolution in the target strain, leading to ineffective vaccines. Using 25,482 H3N2 HA1 sequences curated from Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data and National Center for Biotechnology Information databases, we found that passage adaptation is a very dynamic process that changes over time and evolves in a seesaw like pattern. After crossing the species boundary from bird to human in 1968, the influenza H3N2 virus evolves to be better adapted to the human environment and passaging them in embryonated eggs (i.e., an avian environment) leads to increasingly stronger positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion. On the contrary, passage adaptation to the mammalian cell lines changes from positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion to negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion. Using two statistical tests, we identified 19 codon positions around the receptor binding domain strongly contributing to passage adaptation in the embryonated egg. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s show strong convergent evolution and overlap extensively with positively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s identified in humans, suggesting that passage adaptation can confound many of the earlier studies on influenza evolution. Interestingly, passage adaptation in recent years seems to target a few codon positions in antigenic surface epitopes, which makes it difficult to produce antigenically unaltered vaccines using embryonic eggs. Our study outlines another interesting scenario whereby both convergent and adaptive evolution are working in synchrony driving viral adaptation. Future studies from sequence analysis to vaccine production need to take careful consideration of passage adaptation.</p>

Crohn's Disease Loci Are Common Targets of Protozoa-Driven Selection
<p>Previous studies indicated that a few risk variants for autoimmune diseases are subject to pathogen-driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion. Nonetheless, the proportion of risk loci that has been targeted by pathogens and the type of infectious agent(s) that exerted the strongest pressure remain to be evaluated. We assessed whether different pathogens exerted a pressure on known Crohn's disease (CD) risk variants and demonstrate that these single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are preferential targets of protozoa-driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion (<i>P</i> = 0.008). In particular, 19% of SNPs associated with CD have been subject to protozoa-driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ive pressure. Analysis of <i>P</i> values from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and meta-analyses indicated that protozoan-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ed SNPs display significantly stronger association with CD compared with non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ed variants. This same behavior was not observed for GWASs of other autoimmune diseases. Thus, we integrated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion signatures and meta-analysis results to prioritize five genic SNPs for replication in an Italian cohort. Three SNPs were significantly associated with CD risk, and combination with meta-analysis results yielded <i>P</i> values < 4 × 10<sup>−6</sup>. The bona fide risk alleles are located in <i>ARHGEF2</i>, an interactor of <i>NOD2, NSF</i>, a gene involved in autophagy, and <i>HEBP1</i>, encoding a possible mediator of inflammation. Pathway analysis indicated that <i>ARHGEF2</i> and <i>NSF</i> participate in a molecular network, which also contains <i>VAMP3</i> (previously associated to CD) and is centered around miR-31 (known to be disregulated in CD). Thus, we show that protozoa-driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ive pressure had a major role in shaping predisposition to CD. We next used this information for the identification of three bona fide novel susceptibility loci.</p>

Intertidal sea stars (<i>Pisaster ochraceus</i>) alter body shape in response to wave action
<p>Sea stars are some of the largest mobile animals able to live in the harsh flow environment of wave-exposed, rocky intertidal shores. In addition, some species, such as the northeastern Pacific <i>Pisaster ochraceus</i>, are ecologically significant predators in a b<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">road</span></strong> range of environments, from sheltered lagoons to the most wave-exposed shorelines. How they function and survive under such an extreme range of wave exposures remains a puzzle. Here we examine the ability of <i>P. ochraceus</i> to alter body form in response to variation in flow conditions. We found that sea stars in wave-exposed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s had narrower arms and were lighter per unit arm length than those from sheltered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s. Body form was tightly correlated with maximum velocity of breaking waves across four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s and also varied over time. In addition, field transplant experiments showed that these differences in shape were due primarily to phenotypic plasticity. Sea stars transplanted from a sheltered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> to a more wave-exposed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> became lighter per unit arm length, and developed narrower arms, after 3 months. The tight correlation between water flow and morphology suggests that wave force must be a significant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ive factor acting on body shape. On exposed shores, narrower arms probably reduce both lift and drag in breaking waves. On protected shores, fatter arms may provide more thermal inertia to resist overheating, or more body volume for gametes. Such plastic changes in body shape represent a unique method by which sea stars adapt to spatial, seasonal and possibly short-term variation in flow conditions.</p>

Ontogenetic expression of metabolic genes and microRNAs in rainbow trout alevins during the transition from the endogenous to the exogenous feeding period
<p>As oviparous fish, rainbow t<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rout</span></strong> change their nutritional strategy during ontogenesis. This change is divided into the exclusive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">util</span></strong>ization of yolk-sac reserves (endogenous feeding), the concurrent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">util</span></strong>ization of yolk reserves and exogenous feeds (mixed feeding) and the complete dependence on external feeds (exogenous feeding). The change in food source is accompanied by well-characterized morphological changes, including the development of adipose tissue as an energy storage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>, and continuous muscle development to improve foraging. The aim of this study was to investigate underlying molecular mechanisms that contribute to these ontogenetic changes between the nutritional phenotypes in rainbow t<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rout</span></strong> alevins. We therefore analyzed the expression of marker genes of metabolic pathways and microRNAs (miRNAs) important in the differentiation and/or maintenance of metabolic tissues. In exogenously feeding alevins, the last enzyme involved in glucose production (<i>g6pca</i> and <i>g6pcb</i>) and lipolytic gene expression (<i>cpt1a</i> and <i>cpt1b</i>) decreased, while that of <i>gk</i>, involved in hepatic glucose use, was induced. This pattern is consistent with a progressive switch from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">util</span></strong>ization of stored (gluconeogenic) amino acids and lipids in endogenously feeding alevins to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">util</span></strong>ization of exogenous feeds <i>via</i> the glycolytic pathway. A shift towards the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">util</span></strong>ization of external feeds is further evidenced by the increased expression of <i>omy-miRNA-143</i>, a homologue of the mammalian marker of adipogenesis. The expression of its predicted target gene <i>abhd5</i>, a factor in triglyceride hydrolysis, decreased concurrently, suggesting a potential mechanism in the onset of lipid deposition. Muscle-specific <i>omy-miRNA-1/133</i> and <i>myod1</i> expression decreased in exogenously feeding alevins, a molecular signature consistent with muscle hypertrophy, which may be linked to nutritional cues or increased foraging.</p>

Prospective Countywide Surveillance and Autopsy Characterization of Sudden Cardiac Death
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Studies of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death (SCD) use emergency medical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">servic</span></strong>es records, death <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">certif</span></strong>icates, or definitions that infer cause of death; thus, the true incidence of SCD is unknown. Over 90% of SCDs occur out-of-hospital; nonforensic autopsies are rarely performed, and therefore causes of death are presumed. We conducted a medical examiner–based investigation to determine the precise incidence and autopsy-defined causes of all SCDs in an entire metropolitan area. We hypothesized that postmortem investigation would identify actual sudden arrhythmic deaths among presumed SCDs.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Between February 1, 2011, and March 1, 2014, we prospectively identified all incident deaths attributed to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (emergency medical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">servic</span></strong>es primary impression, cardiac arrest) between 18 to 90 years of age in San Francisco County for autopsy, toxicology, and histology via medical examiner surveillance of consecutive out-of-hospital deaths, all reported by law. We obtained comprehensive records to determine whether out-of-hospital cardiac arrest deaths met World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for SCD. We reviewed death <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">certif</span></strong>icates filed quarterly for missed SCDs. Autopsy-defined sudden arrhythmic deaths had no extracardiac cause of death or acute heart failure. A multidisciplinary committee adjudicated final cause.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>All 20 440 deaths were reviewed; 12 671 were unattended and reported to the medical examiner. From these, we identified 912 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest deaths; 541 (59%) met WHO SCD criteria (mean 62.8 years, 69% male) and 525 (97%) were autopsied. Eighty-nine additional WHO-defined SCDs occurred within 3 weeks of active medical care with the death <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">certif</span></strong>icate signed by the attending physician, ineligible for autopsy but included in the countywide WHO-defined SCD incidence of 29.6/100 000 person-years, highest in black men (<i>P</i><0.0001).

Predator-driven natural selection on risk-taking behavior in anole lizards
<p>Bio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">logist</span></strong>s have long debated the role of behavior in evolution, yet understanding of its role as a driver of adaptation is hampered by the scarcity of experimental studies of natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion on behavior in nature. After showing that individual <i>Anolis sagrei</i> lizards vary consistently in risk-taking behaviors, we experimentally established populations on eight small islands either with or without <i>Leiocephalus carinatus</i>, a major ground predator. We found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion predictably favors different risk-taking behaviors under different treatments: Exploratory behavior is favored in the absence of predators, whereas avoidance of the ground is favored in their presence. On predator islands, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion on behavior is stronger than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion on morphology, whereas the oppo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> holds on islands without predators.

Enhanced water permeability and tunable ion selectivity in subnanometer carbon nanotube porins

Long-range hot-carrier transport in hybrid perovskites visualized by ultrafast microscopy
<p>The Shockley-Queisser limit for solar cell efficiency can be overcome if hot carriers can be harvested before they thermalize. Recently, carrier cooling time up to 100 picoseconds was observed in hybrid perovskites, but it is unclear whether these long-lived hot carriers can migrate long distance for efficient collection. We report direct visualization of hot-carrier migration in methylammonium lead iodide (CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub>) thin films by ultrafast transient absorption microscopy, demonstrating three distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> regimes. Quasiballistic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> was observed to correlate with excess kinetic energy, resulting in up to 230 nanometers <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> distance that could overcome grain boundaries. The nonequilibrium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> persisted over tens of picoseconds and ~600 nanometers before reaching the diffusive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> limit. These results suggest potential applications of hot-carrier devices based on hybrid perovskites.</p>

The genomic landscape of rapid repeated evolutionary adaptation to toxic pollution in wild fish
<p>Atlantic killifish populations have rapidly adapted to normally lethal levels of pollution in four urban estuaries. Through analysis of 384 whole killifish genome sequences and comparative transcriptomics in four pairs of sensitive and tolerant populations, we identify the aryl hydrocarbon receptor–based signaling pathway as a shared target of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion. This suggests evolutionary constraint on adaptive solutions to complex toxicant mixtures at each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>. However, distinct molecular variants apparently contribute to adaptive pathway modification among tolerant populations. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion also targets other toxicity-mediating genes and genes of connected signaling pathways; this indicates complex tolerance phenotypes and potentially compensatory adaptations. Molecular changes are consistent with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion on standing genetic variation. In killifish, high nucleotide diversity has likely been a crucial substrate for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ive sweeps to propel rapid adaptation.</p>

Pinstatic Acid Promotes Auxin Transport by Inhibiting PIN Internalization
<p>Polar auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> plays a pivotal role in plant growth and development. PIN-FORMED (PIN) auxin efflux carriers regulate directional auxin movement by establishing local auxin maxima, minima, and gradients that drive multiple developmental processes and responses to environmental signals. Auxin has been proposed to modulate its own <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> by regulating subcellular PIN trafficking via processes such as clathrin-mediated PIN endocytosis and constitutive recycling. Here, we further investigated the mechanisms by which auxin affects PIN trafficking by screening auxin analogs and identified pinstatic acid (PISA) as a positive modulator of polar auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). PISA had an auxin-like effect on hypocotyl elongation and adventitious root formation via positive regulation of auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>. PISA did not activate SCF<sup>TIR1/AFB</sup> signaling and yet induced PIN accumulation at the cell surface by inhibiting PIN internalization from the plasma membrane. This work demonstrates PISA to be a promising chemical tool to dissect the regulatory mechanisms behind subcellular PIN trafficking and auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>.</p>

SULTR3s Function in Chloroplast Sulfate Uptake and Affect ABA Biosynthesis and the Stress Response
<p>Plants are major sulfur reducers in the global sulfur cycle. Sulfate, the major natural sulfur source in soil, is absorbed by plant roots and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ed into plastids, where it is reduced and assimilated into Cys for further metabolic processes. Despite its importance, how sulfate is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ed into plastids is poorly understood. We previously demonstrated using single Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) genetic mutants that each member of the sulfate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er (SULTR) subfamily 3 was able to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> sulfate across the chloroplast envelope membrane. To resolve the function of SULTR3s, we constructed a <i>sultr3</i> quintuple mutant completely knocking out all five members of the subfamily. Here we report that all members of the <i>SULTR3</i> subfamily show chloroplast membrane localization. Sulfate uptake by chloroplasts of the quintuple mutant is reduced by more than 50% compared with the wild type. Consequently, Cys and abscisic acid (ABA) content are reduced to ∼67 and ∼20% of the wild-type level, respectively, and strong positive correlations are found among sulfate, Cys, and ABA content. The <i>sultr3</i> quintuple mutant shows obvious growth retardation with smaller rosettes and shorter roots. Seed germination of the <i>sultr3</i> quintuple mutant is hypersensitive to exogenous ABA and salt stress, but is rescued by sulfide supplementation. Furthermore, sulfate-induced stomatal closure is abolished in the quintuple mutant, strongly suggesting that chloroplast sulfate is required for stomatal closure. Our genetic analyses unequivocally demonstrate that sulfate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er subfamily 3 is responsible for more than half of the chloroplast sulfate uptake and influences downstream sulfate assimilation and ABA biosynthesis.</p>

In Silico Analysis of the Regulation of the Photosynthetic Electron Transport Chain in C3 Plants<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>We present a new simulation model of the reactions in the photosynthetic electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> chain of C3 species. We show that including recent insights about the regulation of the thylakoid proton motive force, ATP/NADPH balancing mechanisms (cyclic and noncyclic alternative electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>), and regulation of Rubisco activity leads to emergent behaviors that may affect the operation and regulation of photosynthesis under different dynamic environmental conditions. The model was parameterized with experimental results in the literature, with a focus on Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). A dataset was constructed from multiple sources, including measurements of steady-state and dynamic gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, and absorbance spectroscopy under different light intensities and CO<sub>2</sub>, to test predictions of the model under different experimental conditions. Simulations suggested that there are strong interactions between cyclic and noncyclic alternative electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> and that an excess capacity for alternative electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> is required to ensure adequate redox state and lumen pH. Furthermore, the model predicted that, under specific conditions, reduction of ferredoxin by plastoquinol is possible after a rapid increase in light intensity. Further analysis also revealed that the relationship between ATP synthesis and proton motive force was highly regulated by the concentrations of ATP, ADP, and inorganic phosphate, and this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">facil</span></strong>itated an increase in nonphotochemical quenching and proton motive force under conditions where metabolism was limiting, such as low CO<sub>2</sub>, high light intensity, or combined high CO<sub>2</sub> and high light intensity.

A Program for Iron Economy during Deficiency Targets Specific Fe Proteins
<p>Iron (Fe) is an essential element for plants, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">util</span></strong>ized in nearly every cellular process. Because the adjustment of uptake under Fe limitation cannot satisfy all demands, plants need to acclimate their physiology and biochemistry, especially in their chloroplasts, which have a high demand for Fe. To investigate if a program exists for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">util</span></strong>ization of Fe under deficiency, we analyzed how hydroponically grown Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) adjusts its physiology and Fe protein composition in vegetative photosynthetic tissue during Fe deficiency. Fe deficiency first affected photosynthetic electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> with concomitant reductions in carbon assimilation and biomass production when effects on respiration were not yet significant. Photosynthetic electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> function and protein levels of Fe-dependent enzymes were fully recovered upon Fe resupply, indicating that the Fe depletion stress did not cause irreversible secondary damage. At the protein level, ferredoxin, the cytochrome-<i>b<sub>6</sub>f</i> complex, and Fe-containing enzymes of the plastid sulfur assimilation pathway were major targets of Fe deficiency, whereas other Fe-dependent functions were relatively less affected. In coordination, SufA and SufB, two proteins of the plastid Fe-sulfur cofactor assembly pathway, were also diminished early by Fe depletion. Iron depletion reduced mRNA levels for the majority of the affected proteins, indicating that loss of enzyme was not just due to lack of Fe cofactors. SufB and ferredoxin were early targets of transcript down-regulation. The data reveal a hierarchy for Fe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">util</span></strong>ization in photosynthetic tissue and indicate that a program is in place to acclimate to impending Fe deficiency.</p>

F-Actin Mediated Focusing of Vesicles at the Cell Tip Is Essential for Polarized Growth
<p>F-actin has been shown to be essential for tip growth in an array of plant models, including <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. One hypothesis is that diffusion can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> secretory vesicles, while actin plays a regulatory role during secretion. Alternatively, it is possible that actin-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> is necessary to overcome vesicle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> limitations to sustain secretion. Therefore, a quantitative analysis of diffusion, secretion kinetics, and cell geometry is necessary to clarify the role of actin in polarized growth. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis, we first show that secretory vesicles move toward and accumulate at the tip in an actin-dependent manner. We then depolymerized F-actin to decouple vesicle diffusion from actin-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> and measured the diffusion coefficient and concentration of vesicles. Using these values, we constructed a theoretical diffusion-based model for growth, demonstrating that with fast-enough vesicle fusion kinetics, diffusion could support normal cell growth rates. We further refined our model to explore how experimentally extrapolated vesicle fusion kinetics and the size of the secretion zone limit diffusion-based growth. This model predicts that diffusion-mediated growth is dependent on the size of the region of exocytosis at the tip and that diffusion-based growth would be significantly slower than normal cell growth. To further explore the size of the secretion zone, we used a cell wall degradation enzyme cocktail and determined that the secretion zone is smaller than 6 μm in diameter at the tip. Taken together, our results highlight the requirement for active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> in polarized growth and provide important insight into vesicle secretion during tip growth.</p>

Wheat Vacuolar Iron Transporter TaVIT2 Transports Fe and Mn and Is Effective for Biofortification
<p>Increasing the intrinsic nutritional quality of crops, known as biofortification, is viewed as a sustainable approach to alleviate micronutrient deficiencies. In particular, iron deficiency anemia is a major global health issue, but the iron content of staple crops such as wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) is difficult to change because of genetic complexity and homeostasis mechanisms. To identify target genes for the biofortification of wheat, we functionally characterized homologs of the <i>VACUOLAR IRON <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ER</i> (<i>VIT</i>). The wheat genome contains two <i>VIT</i> paralogs, <i>TaVIT1</i> and <i>TaVIT2</i>, which have different expression patterns but are both low in the endosperm. TaVIT2, but not TaVIT1, was able to rescue the growth of a yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) mutant defective in vacuolar iron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>. TaVIT2 also complemented a manganese <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er mutant but not a vacuolar zinc <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er mutant. By overexpressing <i>TaVIT2</i> under the control of an endosperm-specific promoter, we achieved a greater than 2-fold increase in iron in white flour fractions, exceeding minimum legal fortification levels in countries such as the United Kingdom. The antinutrient phytate was not increased and the iron in the white flour fraction was bioavailable in vitro, suggesting that food products made from the biofortified flour could contribute to improved iron nutrition. The single-gene approach impacted minimally on plant growth and also was effective in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>). Our results show that by enhancing vacuolar iron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> in the endosperm, this essential micronutrient accumulated in this tissue, bypassing existing homeostatic mechanisms.</p>

The Sites of Evaporation within Leaves
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s of evaporation within leaves are unknown, but they have drawn attention for decades due to their perceived implications for many factors, including patterns of leaf isotopic enrichment, the maintenance of mesophyll water status, stomatal regulation, and the interpretation of measured stomatal and leaf hydraulic conductances. We used a spatially explicit model of coupled water and heat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> outside the xylem, MOFLO 2.0, to map the distribution of net evaporation across leaf tissues in relation to anatomy and environmental parameters. Our results corroborate earlier predictions that most evaporation occurs from the epidermis at low light and moderate humidity but that the mesophyll contributes substantially when the leaf center is warmed by light absorption, and more so under high humidity. We also found that the bundle sheath provides a significant minority of evaporation (15% in darkness and 18% in high light), that the vertical center of amphistomatous leaves supports net condensation, and that vertical temperature gradients caused by light absorption vary over 10-fold across species, reaching 0.3°C. We show that several hypotheses that depend on the evaporating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s require revision in light of our findings, including that experimental measurements of stomatal and hydraulic conductances should be affected directly by changes in the location of the evaporating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s. We propose a new conceptual model that accounts for mixed-phase water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> outside the xylem. These conclusions have far-reaching implications for inferences in leaf hydraulics, gas exchange, water use, and isotope physiology.</p>

The plasma membrane-localized SbSUT1 and SbSUT5 exhibited a strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ivity for Suc and high Suc affinities in <i>X. laevis</i> oocytes at pH 5—SbSUT1, 6.3 ± 0.7 m<sc>m,</sc> and SbSUT5, 2.4 ± 0.5 m<sc>m</sc> Suc. The Suc affinity of SbSUT1 was dependent on membrane potential and pH. In contrast, SbSUT5 Suc affinity was independent of membrane potential and pH but supported high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> rates at neutral pH. Suc <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> by the tonoplast localized SbSUT4 could not be detected using yeast or <i>X. laevis</i> oocytes. Across internode development, SUTs, other than SbSUT4, were immunolocalized to sieve elements, while for elongating and recently elongated internodes, SUTs also were detected in storage parenchyma cells. We conclude that apoplasmic Suc unloading from de-energized protophloem sieve elements in meristematic zones may be mediated by reversal of SbSUT1 and/or by uniporting SWEETs. Storage parenchyma localized SbSUT1 and SbSUT5 may accumulate Suc from the stem apoplasms of elongating and recently elongated internodes, whereas SbSUT4 may function to re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leas</span></strong>e Suc from vacuoles. Transiting from an apoplasmic to symplasmic unloading pathway as the stem matures, SbSUT1 and SbSUT5 increasingly function in Suc retrieval into metaphloem sieve elements to maintain a high turgor to drive symplasmic unloading by bulk flow.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Phloem Transport of the Receptor DWARF14 Protein Is Required for Full Function of Strigolactones<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The cell-to-cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> of signaling molecules is essential for multicellular organisms to coordinate the action of their cells. Recent studies identified DWARF14 (D14) as a receptor of strigolactones (SLs), molecules that act as plant hormones and inhibit shoot branching. Here, we demonstrate that <i>RAMOSUS3</i>, a pea ortholog of <i>D14</i>, works as a graft-transmissible signal to suppress shoot branching. In addition, we show that D14 protein is contained in phloem sap and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ed through the phloem to axillary buds in rice. SLs are not required for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> of D14 protein. Disruption of D14 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> weakens the suppression of axillary bud outgrowth of rice. Taken together, we conclude that the D14 protein works as an intercellular signaling molecule to fine-tune SL function. Our findings provide evidence that the intercellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> of a receptor can regulate the action of plant hormones.</p>

Selective Sweeps across Twenty Millions Years of Primate Evolution
<p>The contribution from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ive sweeps to variation in genetic diversity has proven notoriously difficult to assess, in part because polymorphism data only allows detection of sweeps in the most recent few hundred thousand years. Here, we show how linked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion in ancestral species can be quantified across evolutionary timescales by analyzing patterns of incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) along the genomes of closely related species. We show that sweeps in the human–chimpanzee and human–orangutan ancestors can be identified as depletions of ILS in regions in excess of 100 kb in length. Sweeps predicted in each ancestral species, as well as recurrent sweeps predicted in both species, often overlap sweeps predicted in humans. This suggests that many genomic regions experience recurrent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ive sweeps. By comparing the ILS patterns along the genomes of the closely related human–chimpanzee and human–orangutan ancestors, we are further able to quantify the impact of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ive sweeps relative to that of background <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion. Compared with the human–orangutan ancestor, the human–chimpanzee ancestor shows a strong excess of regions depleted of ILS as well as a stronger reduction in ILS around genes. We conclude that sweeps play a strong role in reducing diversity along the genome and that sweeps have reduced diversity in the human–chimpanzee ancestor much more than in the human–orangutan ancestor.</p>

Evidence from a House Finch (<i>Haemorhous mexicanus</i>) Spleen Transcriptome for Adaptive Evolution and Biased Gene Conversion in Passerine Birds
<p>Identifying genes influenced by natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion can provide information about lineage-specific adaptations, and transcriptomes generated by next-generation sequencing are a useful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resourc</span></strong>e for identifying such genes. Here, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">util</span></strong>ize a spleen transcriptome for the house finch (<i>Haemorhous mexicanus</i>), an emerging model for sexual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion and disease ecology, together with previously sequenced avian genomes (chicken, turkey, and zebra finch), to investigate lineage-specific adaptations within birds. An analysis of 4,398 orthologous genes revealed a significantly higher ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions and significantly higher GC content in passerines than in galliforms, an observation deviating from strictly neutral expectations but consistent with an effect of biased gene conversion on the evolutionary rate in passerines. These data also showed that genes exhibiting signs of positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion and fast evolution in passerines have functional roles related to fat metabolism, neurodevelopment, and ion binding.</p>

Molecular Adaptation during a Rapid Adaptive Radiation
<p>“Explosive” adaptive radiations on islands remain one of the most puzzling evolutionary phenomena and the evolutionary genetic processes behind such radiations remain unclear. Rapid morphological and ecological evolution during island radiations suggests that many genes may be under fairly strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion, although this remains untested. Here, we report that during a rapid recent diversification in the Hawaiian endemic plant genus <i>Schiedea</i> (<i>Caryophyllaceae</i>), 5 in 36 studied genes evolved under positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion. Positively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ed genes are involved in defence mechanisms, photosynthesis, and reproduction. Comparison with eight mainland plant groups demonstrates both the relaxation of purifying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion and more widespread positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">select</span></strong>ion in Hawaiian <i>Schiedea</i>. This provides compelling evidence that adaptive evolution of protein-coding genes may play a significant role during island adaptive radiations.</p>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
Osteoarticular tissue infection and development of skeletal pathology in murine brucellosis
<p>Brucellosis, a frequent bacterial zoonosis, can produce debilitating chronic disease with involvement of multiple organs in human patients. Whereas acute brucellosis is well studied using the murine animal model, long-term complications of host-pathogen interaction remain largely elusive. Human brucellosis frequently results in persistent, chronic osteoarticular system involvement, with complications such as arthritis, spondylitis and sacroiliitis. Here, we focused on identifying infectious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s in the mouse that parallel <i>Brucella melitensis</i> foci observed in patients. <i>In vivo</i> imaging showed rapid bacterial dispersal to multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s of the murine axial skeleton. In agreement with these findings, immunohistochemistry revealed the presence of bacteria in bones and limbs, and in the lower spine vertebrae of the axial skeleton where they were preferentially located in the bone marrow. Surprisingly, some animals developed arthritis in paws and spine after infection, but without obvious bacteria in these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s. The identification of <i>Brucella</i> in the bones of mice corroborates the findings in humans that these osteoarticular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s are important niches for the persistence of <i>Brucella</i> in the host, but the mechanisms that mediate pathological manifestations in these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s remain unclear. Future studies addressing the immune responses within osteoarticular tissue foci could elucidate important tissue injury mediators and <i>Brucella</i> survival strategies.</p>

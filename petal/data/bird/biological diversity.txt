Truncation- and motif-based pan-cancer analysis reveals tumor-suppressing kinases
<p>A major challenge in cancer genomics is identifying “driver” <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions from the many neutral “passenger” <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions within a given tumor. To identify driver <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions that would otherwise be lost within <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional noise, we filtered genomic data by motifs that are critical for kinase activity. In the first step of our screen, we used data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia and The Cancer Genome Atlas to identify kinases with truncation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions occurring within or before the kinase domain. The top 30 tumor-suppressing kinases were aligned, and hotspots for loss-of-function (LOF) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions were identified on the basis of amino acid conservation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional frequency. The functional consequences of new LOF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions were biochemically validated, and the top 15 hotspot LOF residues were used in a pan-cancer analysis to define the tumor-suppressing kinome. A ranked list revealed MAP2K7, an essential mediator of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, as a candidate tumor suppressor in gastric cancer, despite its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional frequency falling within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional noise for this cancer type. The majority of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in MAP2K7 abolished its catalytic activity, and reactivation of the JNK pathway in gastric cancer cells harboring LOF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in MAP2K7 or the downstream kinase JNK suppressed clonogenicity and growth in soft agar, demonstrating the functional relevance of inactivating the JNK pathway in gastric cancer. Together, our data highlight a broadly applicable strategy to identify functional cancer driver <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions and define the JNK pathway as tumor-suppressive in gastric cancer.</p>

The paradox of mutations and cancer
<p>The past decade has witnessed the cataloging of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in cancer genomes, providing new insights into how and in what ways cancer can develop and spread (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). The focus has been on defining specific “driver” <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic errors in cancer cells that reveal basic biological processes gone awry that are required for cancer initiation and progression. These drivers are the target of new therapies—this concept is central to precision oncology efforts to treat patients according to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic changes that are present in their tumors (<i>3</i>). Along the way, it has also become apparent that cancer genomes harbor many additional “passenger” <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions (<i>4</i>). Patterns of driver and passenger DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions derived from cancer genomes have provided clues about the different ways that cancer can manifest as a disease of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions (<i>5</i>, <i>6</i>). In some circumstances, they can be linked to strong environmental carcinogens (for example, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion patterns caused by tobacco smoke, ultraviolet radiation, or the fungal toxin aflatoxin) (<i>7</i>). Moreover, these forensic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional patterns can be used to estimate how long it has taken for a tumor to develop (<i>5</i>). On page 911 of this issue, Martincorena <i>et al.</i> (<i>8</i>) turned their attention toward the detection of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in normal tissue, addressing a long-standing paradox that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions arise in normal tissues but do not necessarily lead to cancer.</p>

Phenotypic Characterization of <i>EIF2AK4</i> Mutation Carriers in a Large Cohort of Patients Diagnosed Clinically With Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare disease with an emerging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic basis. Heterozygous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in the gene encoding the bone morpho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic protein receptor type 2 (<i>BMPR2</i>) are the commonest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic cause of PAH, whereas biallelic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 4 gene (<i>EIF2AK4</i>) are described in pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis. Here, we determine the frequency of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions and define the genotype-phenotype characteristics in a large cohort of patients diagnosed clinically with PAH.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Whole-genome sequencing was performed on DNA from patients with idiopathic and heritable PAH and with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis recruited to the National Institute of Health Research BioResource–Rare Diseases study. Heterozygous variants in <i>BMPR2</i> and biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> variants with a minor allele frequency of <1:10 000 in control data sets and predicted to be deleterious (by combined annotation-dependent depletion, PolyPhen-2, and <i>sorting intolerant from tolerant</i> predictions) were identified as potentially causal. Phenotype data from the time of diagnosis were also captured.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Eight hundred sixty-four patients with idiopathic or heritable PAH and 16 with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis were recruited. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in <i>BMPR2</i> were identified in 130 patients (14.8%). Biallelic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in <i>EIF2AK4</i> were identified in 5 patients with a clinical diagnosis of pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis. Furthermore, 9 patients with a clinical diagnosis of PAH carried biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions. These patients had a reduced transfer coefficient for carbon monoxide (K<sc>co</sc>; 33% [interquartile range, 30%–35%] predicted) and younger age at diagnosis (29 years; interquartile range, 23–38 years) and more interlobular septal thickening and mediastinal lymphadenopathy on computed tomography of the chest compared with patients with PAH without <i>EIF2AK4</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions. However, radiological assessment alone could not accurately identify biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion carriers. Patients with PAH with biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions had a shorter survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions are found in patients classified clinically as having idiopathic and heritable PAH. These patients cannot be identified reliably by computed tomography, but a low K<sc>co</sc> and a young age at diagnosis suggests the underlying molecular diagnosis. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic testing can identify these misclassified patients, allowing appropriate management and early referral for lung transplantation.</p></sec>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
A Comprehensive, High-Resolution Map of a Gene’s Fitness Landscape
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions are central to evolution, providing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic variation upon which selection acts. A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion’s effect on the suitability of a gene to perform a particular function (gene fitness) can be positive, negative, or neutral. Knowledge of the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions is fundamental for understanding evolutionary dynamics, molecular-level <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic variation, complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic disease, the accumulation of deleterious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions, and the molecular clock. We present comprehensive DFEs for point and codon mutants of the <i>Escherichia coli TEM-1</i> β-lactamase gene and missense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in the TEM-1 protein. These DFEs provide insight into the inherent benefits of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic code’s architecture, support for the hypothesis that mRNA stability dictates codon usage at the beginning of genes, an extensive framework for understanding protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional tolerance, and evidence that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional effects on protein thermodynamic stability shape the DFE. Contrary to prevailing expectations, we find that deleterious effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion primarily arise from a decrease in specific protein activity and not cellular protein levels.</p>

Novel Desmin Mutation p.Glu401Asp Impairs Filament Formation, Disrupts Cell Membrane Integrity, and Causes Severe Arrhythmogenic Left Ventricular Cardiomyopathy/Dysplasia
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Desmin (<i>DES</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions cause severe skeletal and cardiac muscle disease with heterogeneous phenotypes.

In addition, desmin, and intercalar disc–related proteins expression were histologically analyzed in explanted cardiac tissue affected by the <i>DES</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion.

One hundred percent of genotype-positive patients presented data consistent with inherited arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy/dysplasia phenotype with variable disease severity expression, high-incidence of sudden cardiac death, and absence of skeletal myopathy or conduction system disorders. Immunohistochemistry was compatible with inherited arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy/dysplasia, and the functional study showed an abnormal growth pattern and cellular adhesion, reduced desmin RNA expression, and some other membrane proteins, as well, and desmin aggregates in transfected cells expressing the mutant desmin.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The <i>DES</i>-p.Glu401Asp <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion causes predominant inherited left ventricular arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy/dysplasia with a high incidence of adverse clinical events in the absence of skeletal myopathy or conduction system disorders.

Genetic Risk Prediction of Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) has a substantial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic basis.

We examined associations between AF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic risk scores and ischemic stroke in a separate study of 509 ischemic stroke cases (202 cardioembolic [40%]) and 3028 referents. Scores were based on 11 to 719 common variants (≥5%) associated with AF at <i>P</i> values ranging from <1×10<sup>−3</sup> to <1×10<sup>−8</sup> in a prior independent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic association study.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Incident AF occurred in 1032 individuals (5.5%).

The pooled hazard ratio for incident AF for the highest versus lowest quartile of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic risk scores ranged from 1.28 (719 variants; 95% confidence interval, 1.13–1.46; <i>P</i>=1.5×10<sup>−4</sup>) to 1.67 (25 variants; 95% confidence interval, 1.47–1.90; <i>P</i>=9.3×10<sup>−15</sup>).

Spontaneous Mutation Accumulation in <i>Daphnia pulex</i> in Selection-Free vs. Competitive Environments
<p>Understanding the rates, spectra, and fitness effects of spontaneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions is fundamental to answering key questions in evolution, molecular biology, disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ics, and conservation biology. To estimate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rates and evaluate the effect of selection on new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions, we propagated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion accumulation (MA) lines of <i>Daphnia pulex</i> for more than 82 generations and maintained a non-MA population under conditions where selection could act. Both experiments were started with the same obligate asexual progenitor clone. By sequencing 30 genomes and implementing a series of validation steps that informed the bioinformatic analyses, we identified a total of 477 single nucleotide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions (SNMs) in the MA lines, corresponding to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rate of 2.30 × 10<sup>−9</sup> (95% CI 1.90–2.70 × 10<sup>−9</sup>) per nucleotide per generation. The high overall rate of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of 4.82 × 10<sup>−5</sup> per site per generation was due to a large ameiotic recombination event spanning an entire arm of a chromosome (∼6 Mb) and several hemizygous deletion events spanning ∼2 kb each. In the non-MA population, we found significantly fewer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions than expected based on the rate derived from the MA experiment, indicating purifying selection was likely acting to remove new deleterious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions. We observed a surprisingly high level of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic variability in the non-MA population, which we propose to be driven by balancing selection. Our findings suggest that both positive and negative selection on new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions is powerful and effective in a strictly clonal population.</p>

Common Genetic Variant Risk Score Is Associated With Drug-Induced QT Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes Risk

Mutation dynamics and fitness effects followed in single cells
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions have been investigated for more than a century but remain difficult to observe directly in single cells, which limits the characterization of their dynamics and fitness effects. By combining microfluidics, time-lapse imaging, and a fluorescent tag of the mismatch repair system in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, we visualized the emergence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in single cells, revealing Poissonian dynamics. Concomitantly, we tracked the growth and life span of single cells, accumulating ~20,000 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions genome-wide over hundreds of generations. This analysis revealed that 1% of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions were lethal; nonlethal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions displayed a heavy-tailed distribution of fitness effects and were dominated by quasi-neutral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions with an average cost of 0.3%. Our approach has enabled the investigation of single-cell individuality in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rate, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion fitness costs, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion interactions.</p>

Genome-Wide Biases in the Rate and Molecular Spectrum of Spontaneous Mutations in <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> and <i>Vibrio fischeri</i>
<p>The vast diversity in nucleotide composition and architecture among bacterial genomes may be partly explained by inherent biases in the rates and spectra of spontaneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions. Bacterial genomes with multiple chromosomes are relatively unusual but some are relevant to human health, none more so than the causative agent of cholera, <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>. Here, we present the genome-wide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion spectra in wild-type and mismatch repair (MMR) defective backgrounds of two <i>Vibrio</i> species, the low-%GC squid symbiont <i>V. fischeri</i> and the pathogen <i>V. cholerae</i>, collected under conditions that greatly minimize the efficiency of natural selection. In apparent contrast to their high diversity in nature, both wild-type <i>V. fischeri</i> and <i>V. cholerae</i> have among the lowest rates for base-substitution <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions (bpsms) and insertion–deletion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions (indels) that have been measured, below 10<sup>−</sup><sup>3</sup>/genome/generation. <i>Vibrio fischeri</i> and <i>V. cholerae</i> have distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion spectra, but both are AT-biased and produce a surprising number of multi-nucleotide indels. Furthermore, the loss of a functional MMR system caused the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion spectra of these species to converge, implying that the MMR system itself contributes to species-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion patterns. Bpsm and indel rates varied among genome regions, but do not explain the more rapid evolutionary rates of genes on chromosome 2, which likely result from weaker purifying selection. More generally, the very low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rates of <i>Vibrio</i> species correlate inversely with their immense population sizes and suggest that selection may not only have maximized replication fidelity but also optimized other polygenic traits relative to the constraints of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic drift.</p>

<p>Catalytically activating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in <i>Ptpn11</i>, which encodes the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2, cause 50% of Noonan syndrome (NS) cases, whereas inactivating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in <i>Ptpn11</i> are responsible for nearly all cases of the similar, but distinct, developmental disorder Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (NSML; formerly called LEOPARD syndrome). However, both types of disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions are gain-of-function <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions because they cause SHP2 to constitutively adopt an open conformation. We found that the catalytic activity of SHP2 was required for the pathogenic effects of gain-of-function, disease-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions on the development of hydrocephalus in the mouse. Targeted pan-neuronal knockin of a <i>Ptpn11</i> allele encoding the active SHP2 E76K mutant resulted in hydrocephalus due to aberrant development of ependymal cells and their cilia. These pathogenic effects of the E76K <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion were suppressed by the additional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion C459S, which abolished the catalytic activity of SHP2. Moreover, ependymal cells in NSML mice bearing the inactive SHP2 mutant Y279C were also unaffected. Mechanistically, the SHP2 E76K mutant induced developmental defects in ependymal cells by enhancing dephosphorylation and inhibition of the transcription activator STAT3. Whereas STAT3 activity was reduced in <i>Ptpn11</i><sup><i>E76K/+</i></sup> cells, the activities of the kinases ERK and AKT were enhanced, and neural cell–specific <i>Stat3</i> knockout mice also manifested developmental defects in ependymal cells and cilia. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic and biochemical data demonstrate a catalytic-dependent role of SHP2 gain-of-function disease mutants in the pathogenesis of hydrocephalus.</p>

Exploring genetic suppression interactions on a global scale
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic suppression occurs when the phenotypic defects caused by a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion in a particular gene are rescued by a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion in a second gene. To explore the principles of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic suppression, we examined both literature-curated and unbiased experimental data, involving systematic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic mapping and whole-genome sequencing, to generate a large-scale suppression network among yeast genes. Most suppression pairs identified novel relationships among functionally related genes, providing new insights into the functional wiring diagram of the cell. In addition to suppressor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions, we identified frequent secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions,in a subset of genes, that likely cause a delay in the onset of stationary phase, which appears to promote their enrichment within a propagating population. These findings allow us to formulate and quantify general mechanisms of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic suppression.</p>

An Anthropocene map of genetic diversity

For intraspecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic divers</span></strong>ity, however, we lack even basic knowledge on its global distribution.

Scanning for New BRI1 Mutations via TILLING Analysis
<p>The identification and characterization of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional spectrum for a specific protein can help to elucidate its detailed cellular functions. BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE1 (BRI1), a multidomain transmembrane receptor-like kinase, is a major receptor of brassinosteroids in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Within the last two decades, over 20 different <i>bri1</i> mutant alleles have been identified, which helped to determine the significance of each domain within BRI1. To further understand the molecular mechanisms of BRI1, we tried to identify additional alleles via targeted induced local lesions in genomes. Here, we report our identification of 83 new point <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in <i>BRI1</i>, including nine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions that exhibit an allelic series of typical <i>bri1</i> phenotypes, from subtle to severe morphological alterations. We carried out biochemical analyses to investigate possible mechanisms of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in affecting brassinosteroid signaling. A number of interesting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions have been isolated via this study. For example, <i>bri1-702</i>, the only weak allele identified so far with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion in the activation loop, showed reduced autophosphorylation activity. <i>bri1-705</i>, a subtle allele with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion in the extracellular portion, disrupts the interaction of BRI1 with its ligand brassinolide and coreceptor BRI1-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR KINASE1. <i>bri1-706</i>, with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion in the extracellular portion, is a subtle defective mutant. Surprisingly, root inhibition analysis indicated that it is largely insensitive to exogenous brassinolide treatment. In this study, we found that <i>bri1-301</i> possesses kinase activity in vivo, clarifying a previous report arguing that kinase activity may not be necessary for the function of BRI1. These data provide additional insights into our understanding of the early events in the brassinosteroid signaling pathway.</p>

Stearoyl-Acyl Carrier Protein Desaturase Mutations Uncover an Impact of Stearic Acid in Leaf and Nodule Structure
<p>Stearoyl-acyl carrier protein desaturase (SACPD-C) has been reported to control the accumulation of seed stearic acid; however, no study has previously reported its involvement in leaf stearic acid content and impact on leaf structure and morphology. A subset of an ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenized population of soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) ‘Forrest’ was screened to identify mutants within the <i>GmSACPD-C</i> gene. Using a forward <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ics approach, one nonsense and four missense <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutants were identified to have high levels of seed, nodule, and leaf stearic acid content. Homology modeling and in silico analysis of the GmSACPD-C enzyme revealed that most of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions were localized near or at conserved residues essential for diiron ion coordination. Soybeans carrying <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions at conserved residues showed the highest stearic acid content, and these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions were found to have deleterious effects on nodule development and function. Interestingly, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions at nonconserved residues show an increase in stearic acid content yet retain healthy nodules. Thus, random mutagenesis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional analysis allows for the achievement of high seed stearic acid content with no associated negative agronomic characteristics. Additionally, expression analysis demonstrates that nodule leghemoglobin transcripts were significantly more abundant in soybeans with deleterious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions at conserved residues of GmSACPD-C. Finally, we report that <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions cause an increase in leaf stearic acid content and an alteration of leaf structure and morphology in addition to differences in nitrogen-fixing nodule structure.</p>

Histone Lysine-to-Methionine Mutations Reduce Histone Methylation and Cause Developmental Pleiotropy
<p>Epi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic modifications play critical roles in diverse biological processes. Histone Lys-to-Met (K-to-M) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions act as gain-of-function <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions to inhibit a wide range of histone methyltransferases and are thought to promote tumorigenesis. However, it is largely unknown whether K-to-M <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions impact organismal development. Using Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) as a model system, we discovered that a transgene exogenously expressing histone 3 Lys-36 to Met <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion (K36M) acts in a dominant-negative manner to cause global reduction of H3K36 methylation. Remarkably, this dominant repressive activity is dosage-dependent and causes strong developmental perturbations including extreme branching and early flowering by affecting the expression of genes involved in developmental and metabolic processes. Besides the established pathological roles of K-to-M <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in tumor cells, we demonstrate a physiological outcome for K-to-M induced H3K36 hypomethylation. This study provides evidence for a conserved dominant-negative inhibitory role of histone K-to-M <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion across the plant and animal kingdoms. We also highlight the unique ability of K36M <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions to alter plant developmental processes leading to severe pleiotropic phenotypes. Finally, our data suggests K-to-M <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions may provide a useful strategy for altering epi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic landscapes in organisms where histone methyltransferases are uncharacterized.</p>

Population Parameters Underlying an Ongoing Soft Sweep in Southeast Asian Malaria Parasites
<p>Multiple <i>kelch13</i> alleles conferring artemisinin resistance (ART-R) are currently spreading through Southeast Asian malaria parasite populations, providing a unique opportunity to observe an ongoing soft selective sweep, investigate why resistance alleles have evolved multiple times and determine fundamental population <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic parameters for <i>Plasmodium</i>. We sequenced <i>kelch13</i> (<i>n</i> = 1,876), genotyped 75 flanking SNPs, and measured clearance rate (<i>n</i> = 3,552) in parasite infections from Western Thailand (2001–2014). We describe 32 independent coding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions including common <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions outside the <i>kelch13</i> propeller associated with significant reductions in clearance rate. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions were first observed in 2003 and rose to 90% by 2014, consistent with a selection coefficient of ∼0.079. ART-R allele diversity rose until 2012 and then dropped as one allele (C580Y) spread to high frequency. The frequency with which adaptive alleles arise is determined by the rate of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion and the population size. Two factors drive this soft sweep: (1) multiple <i>kelch13</i> amino-acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions confer resistance providing a large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional target—we estimate the target is 87–163 bp. (2) The population <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion parameter (<i>Θ</i> = 2<i>N</i><sub>e</sub><i>μ</i>) can be estimated from the frequency distribution of ART-R alleles and is ∼5.69, suggesting that short term effective population size is 88 thousand to 1.2 million. This is 52–705 times greater than <i>N</i><sub>e</sub> estimated from fluctuation in allele frequencies, suggesting that we have previously underestimated the capacity for adaptive evolution in <i>Plasmodium</i>. Our central conclusions are that retrospective studies may underestimate the complexity of selective events and the <i>N</i><sub>e</sub> relevant for adaptation for malaria is considerably higher than previously estimated.</p>

Direct Determination of the Mutation Rate in the Bumblebee Reveals Evidence for Weak Recombination-Associated Mutation and an Approximate Rate Constancy in Insects
<p>Accurate knowledge of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rate provides a base line for inferring expected rates of evolution, for testing evolutionary hypotheses and for estimation of key parameters. Advances in sequencing technology now permit direct estimates of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rate from sequencing of close relatives. Within insects there have been three prior such estimates, two in nonsocial insects (<i>Drosophila</i>: 2.8 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> per bp per haploid genome per generation; <i>Heliconius</i>: 2.9 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>) and one in a social species, the honeybee (3.4 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>). Might the honeybee’s rate be ∼20% higher because it has an exceptionally high recombination rate and recombination may be directly or indirectly mutagenic? To address this possibility, we provide a direct estimate of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rate in the bumblebee (<i>Bombus terrestris</i>), this being a close relative of the honeybee but with a much lower recombination rate. We confirm that the crossover rate of the bumblebee is indeed much lower than honeybees (8.7 cM/Mb vs. 37 cM/Mb). Importantly, we find no significant difference in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rates: we estimate for bumblebees a rate of 3.6 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> per haploid genome per generation (95% confidence intervals 2.38 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> and 5.37 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>) which is just 5% higher than the estimate that of honeybees. Both genomes have approximately one new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion per haploid genome per generation. While we find evidence for a direct coupling between recombination and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion (also seen in honeybees), the effect is so weak as to leave almost no footprint on any between-species differences. The similarity in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rates suggests an approximate constancy of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rate in insects.</p>

Phenotypic Consequences of a Genetic Predisposition to Enhanced Nitric Oxide Signaling

Mutated clones are the new normal
<p>Cancers are formed by the expansion of harmful “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional clones,” which are cell populations carrying the same DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions. How harmful they are depends on which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ed genes they contain. On page 970 of this issue, Yizhak <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) add to the evidence that normal tissues are not so normal after all. Examining a substantial number of healthy tissues from almost 500 individuals, they found a large number of acquired (somatic) DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions—some of which are typically associated with cancer—and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional clones of macroscopic size, in the absence of cancer pathology.

Tissue-specificity in cancer: The rule, not the exception
<p>We are in the midst of a renaissance in cancer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ics. Over the past several decades, candidate-based targeted sequencing efforts provided a steady stream of information on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic drivers for certain cancer types. However, with recent technological advances in DNA sequencing, this stream has become a torrent of unbiased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic information revealing the frequencies and patterns of point <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions and copy number variations (CNVs) across the entire spectrum of cancers. One of the most important observations from this work is that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic alterations in bona fide cancer drivers (those genes that, when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ed, promote tumorigenesis) show a remarkable spectrum of tissue specificity: Alterations in certain driver genes appear only in cancers derived from one or a few tissue types (<i>1</i>). Only a handful of cancer drivers [such as telomerase reverse transcriptase (<i>TERT</i>), <i>TP53</i>, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (<i>CDKN2A</i>) locus, and <i>MYC</i>] show broad tissue spectrums.

Somatic mutant clones colonize the human esophagus with age
<p>The extent to which cells in normal tissues accumulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions throughout life is poorly understood. Some mutant cells expand into clones that can be detected by genome sequencing. We mapped mutant clones in normal esophageal epithelium from nine donors (age range, 20 to 75 years). Somatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions accumulated with age and were caused mainly by intrinsic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional processes. We found strong positive selection of clones carrying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in 14 cancer genes, with tens to hundreds of clones per square centimeter. In middle-aged and elderly donors, clones with cancer-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions covered much of the epithelium, with <i>NOTCH1</i> and <i>TP53</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions affecting 12 to 80% and 2 to 37% of cells, respectively.

Human mutation rate a legacy from our past
<p>Humans should be more like paramecia. That's because their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rate is orders of magnitude lower than a human's. Those rates increase when genes involved in copying or repairing DNA stop working correctly. Although some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions are good for generating variety that allows organisms to adapt to changing environments, too many can cause disease and birth defects. At a meeting in Tempe, Arizona, researchers documented <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rates in dozens of species and found that the species's specific rate is inversely related to the so-called "effective population" size. Small populations are less able to get rid of or compensate for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic changes that increase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rate. In the past, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rates were thought to be so stable that they were "molecular clocks" useful for dating species' divergences. But researchers are now recognizing that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rates vary from species to species.</p>

One brain, many genomes
<p>We each begin life as a single cell harboring a single genome, which—over the course of development—gives rise to the trillions of cells that make up the body. From skin cells to heart cells to neurons of the brain, each bears a copy of the original cell's genome. But as anyone who has used a copy machine or played the childhood game of “telephone” knows, copies are never perfect. Every cell in an individual actually has a unique genome, an imperfect copy of its cellular ancestor differentiated by inevitable somatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions arising from errors in DNA replication and other mutagenic forces (<i>1</i>). Somatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion is the fundamental process leading to all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic diseases, including cancer; every inherited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic disease also has its origins in such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion events that occurred in an ancestor's germline cells. Yet how many and what kinds of somatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions accumulate in our cells as we develop and age has long been unknown and a blind spot in our understanding of the origins of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic disease.</p>

<i>NLR</i> Mutations Suppressing Immune Hybrid Incompatibility and Their Effects on Disease Resistance
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic divergence between populations can lead to reproductive isolation. Hybrid incompatibilities (HI) represent intermediate points along a continuum toward speciation. In plants, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic variation in disease resistance (<i>R</i>) genes underlies several cases of HI. The progeny of a cross between Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) accessions Landsberg <i>erecta</i> (L<i>er</i>, Poland) and Kashmir2 (Kas2, central Asia) exhibits immune-related HI. This incompatibility is due to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic interaction between a cluster of eight <i>TNL (TOLL/INTERLEUKIN1 RECEPTOR-NUCLEOTIDE BINDING-LEU RICH REPEAT</i>) <i>RPP1</i> (<i>RECOGNITION OF PERONOSPORA PARASITICA1)</i>-<i>like</i> genes (<i>R1</i>–<i>R8</i>) from L<i>er</i> and central Asian alleles of a <i>Strubbelig</i>-family receptor-like kinase (<i>SRF3</i>) from Kas2. In characterizing mutants altered in L<i>er</i>/Kas2 HI, we mapped multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions to the <i>RPP1</i>-like L<i>er</i> locus. Analysis of these <i>suppressor of Ler/Kas2 incompatibility</i> (<i>sulki</i>) mutants reveals complex, additive and epistatic interactions underlying <i>RPP1</i>-<i>like</i> L<i>er</i> locus activity. The effects of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions were measured on basal defense, global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene express</span></strong>ion, primary metabolism, and disease resistance to a local <i>Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis</i> isolate (<i>Hpa</i> Gw) collected from Gorzéáéáów (Gw), where the Landsberg accession originated. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene express</span></strong>ion sectors and metabolic hallmarks identified for HI are both dependent and independent of <i>RPP1</i>-<i>like</i> L<i>er</i> members. We establish that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions suppressing immune-related L<i>er</i>/Kas2 HI do not compromise resistance to <i>Hpa</i> Gw. QTL mapping analysis of <i>Hpa</i> Gw resistance point to <i>RPP7</i> as the causal locus.

Roles of miR319 and TCP Transcription Factors in Leaf Development
<p>Sophisticated regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene express</span></strong>ion, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and their target genes, is required for leaf differentiation, growth, and senescence. The impact of miR319 and its target <i>TEOSINTE BRANCHED1</i>, <i>CYCLOIDEA</i>, and <i>PROLIFERATING CELL NUCLEAR ANTIGEN BINDING FACTOR</i> (<i>TCP</i>) genes on leaf development has been extensively investigated, but the redundancies of these gene families often interfere with the evaluation of their function and regulation in the developmental context. Here, we present the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic evidence of the involvement of the <i>MIR319</i> and <i>TCP</i> gene families in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaf development. Single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in <i>MIR319A</i> and <i>MIR319B</i> genes moderately inhibited the formation of leaf serrations, whereas double <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions increased the extent of this inhibition and resulted in the formation of smooth leaves. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in <i>MIR319</i> and gain-of-function <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in the <i>TCP4</i> gene conferred resistance against miR319 and impaired the cotyledon boundary and leaf serration formation. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions functionally associated with <i>CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON</i> genes, which regulate the cotyledon boundary and leaf serration formation. In contrast, loss-of-function <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in miR319-targeted and nontargeted <i>TCP</i> genes cooperatively induced the formation of serrated leaves in addition to changes in the levels of their downstream gene transcript. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the <i>MIR319</i> and <i>TCP</i> gene families underlie robust and multilayer control of leaf development. This study also provides a framework toward future researches on redundant miRNAs and transcription factors in Arabidopsis and crop plants.</p>

The Genetic Basis of Plant Architecture in 10 Maize Recombinant Inbred Line Populations
<p>Plant architecture is a key factor affecting planting density and grain yield in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). However, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic mechanisms underlying plant architecture in diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic backgrounds have not been fully addressed. Here, we performed a large-scale phenotyping of 10 plant architecture-related traits and dissected the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic loci controlling these traits in 10 recombinant inbred line populations derived from 14 diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic backgrounds. Nearly 800 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with major and minor effects were identified as contributing to the phenotypic variation of plant architecture-related traits. Ninety-two percent of these QTLs were detected in only one population, confirming the diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic backgrounds of the mapping populations and the prevalence of rare alleles in maize. The numbers and effects of QTLs are positively associated with the phenotypic variation in the population, which, in turn, correlates positively with parental phenotypic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic variations. A large proportion (38.5%) of QTLs was associated with at least two traits, suggestive of the frequent occurrence of pleiotropic loci or closely linked loci. Key developmental genes, which previously were shown to affect plant architecture in mutant studies, were found to colocalize with many QTLs. Five QTLs were further validated using the segregating populations developed from residual heterozygous lines present in the recombinant inbred line populations. Additionally, one new plant height QTL, <i>qPH3</i>, has been fine-mapped to a 600-kb genomic region where three candidate genes are located. These results provide insights into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic mechanisms controlling plant architecture and will benefit the selection of ideal plant architecture in maize breeding.</p>

Genetic Predisposition to High Blood Pressure and Lifestyle Factors
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>High blood pressure (BP) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), the leading cause of mortality worldwide.

Polygenic Risk Score Identifies Subgroup With Higher Burden of Atherosclerosis and Greater Relative Benefit From Statin Therapy in the Primary Prevention Setting
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Relative risk reduction with statin therapy has been consistent across nearly all subgroups studied to date. However, in analyses of 2 randomized controlled primary prevention trials (ASCOT [Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial–Lipid-Lowering Arm] and JUPITER [Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin]), statin therapy led to a greater relative risk reduction among a subgroup at high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic risk. Here, we aimed to confirm this observation in a third primary prevention randomized controlled trial. In addition, we assessed whether those at high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic risk had a greater burden of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied participants from a randomized controlled trial of primary prevention with statin therapy (WOSCOPS [West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study]; n=4910) and 2 observational cohort studies (CARDIA [Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults] and BioImage; n=1154 and 4392, respectively).

A calcium-sensing receptor mutation causing hypocalcemia disrupts a transmembrane salt bridge to activate β-arrestin–biased signaling
<p>The calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is a G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) that signals through G<sub>q/11</sub> and G<sub>i/o</sub> to stimulate cytosolic calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>i</sub>) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling to control extracellular calcium homeostasis. Studies of loss- and gain-of-function <i>CASR</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions, which cause familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia type 1 (FHH1) and autosomal dominant hypocalcemia type 1 (ADH1), respectively, have revealed that the CaSR signals in a biased manner. Thus, some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions associated with FHH1 lead to signaling predominantly through the MAPK pathway, whereas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions associated with ADH1 preferentially enhance Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>i</sub> responses. We report a previously unidentified ADH1-associated R680G CaSR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion, which led to the identification of a CaSR structural motif that mediates biased signaling. Expressing CaSR<sup>R680G</sup> in HEK 293 cells showed that this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion increased MAPK signaling without altering Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>i</sub> responses. Moreover, this gain of function in MAPK activity occurred independently of G<sub>q/11</sub> and G<sub>i/o</sub> and was mediated instead by a noncanonical pathway involving β-arrestin proteins. Homology modeling and mutagenesis studies showed that the R680G CaSR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion selectively enhanced β-arrestin signaling by disrupting a salt bridge formed between Arg<sup>680</sup> and Glu<sup>767</sup>, which are located in CaSR transmembrane domain 3 and extracellular loop 2, respectively. Thus, our results demonstrate CaSR signaling through β-arrestin and the importance of the Arg<sup>680</sup>-Glu<sup>767</sup> salt bridge in mediating signaling bias.</p>

Heterogeneity in efflux pump expression predisposes antibiotic-resistant cells to mutation
<p>Antibiotic resistance is often the result of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions that block drug activity; however, bacteria also evade antibiotics by transiently expressing genes such as multidrug efflux pumps. A crucial question is whether transient resistance can promote permanent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic changes. Previous studies have established that antibiotic treatment can select tolerant cells that then <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>e to achieve permanent resistance. Whether these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions result from antibiotic stress or preexist within the population is unclear. To address this question, we focused on the multidrug pump AcrAB-TolC. Using time-lapse microscopy, we found that cells with higher <i>acrAB</i> expression have lower expression of the DNA mismatch repair gene <i>mutS</i>, lower growth rates, and higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion frequencies. Thus, transient antibiotic resistance from elevated <i>acrAB</i> expression can promote spontaneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions within single cells.</p>

The chromatin of cancer
<p>Developments in modern genomics tools have led to rapid progress in our understanding of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic basis of cancer. Recent large-scale efforts have primarily focused on two types of analysis: mapping acquired somatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions by whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>), and identification of common inherited variants that increase cancer risk using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) (<i>3</i>). Despite the power of these technologies, we are still far from understanding how the variants and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions found in individual tumors precisely drive the oncogenic process. A large number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic variants increase risk for cancer, but most explain only a very small fraction of the risk. Furthermore, although acquired somatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions are found in almost all tumors, most do not carry complete sets of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions that, according to our present mechanistic understanding, would be sufficient to cause cancer. On page 420 of this issue, Corces <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) show how a third type of genomics approach—functional genomic analyses of primary human tumors—can begin to bridge this gap in our mechanistic understanding of the tumorigenic process.</p>

Use of CRISPR-modified human stem cell organoids to study the origin of mutational signatures in cancer
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional processes underlie cancer initiation and progression. Signatures of these processes in cancer genomes may explain cancer etiology and could hold diagnostic and prognostic value. We developed a strategy that can be used to explore the origin of cancer-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional signatures. We used CRISPR-Cas9 technology to delete key DNA repair genes in human colon organoids, followed by delayed subcloning and whole-genome sequencing. We found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion accumulation in organoids deficient in the mismatch repair gene <i>MLH1</i> is driven by replication errors and accurately models the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion profiles observed in mismatch repair–deficient colorectal cancers. Application of this strategy to the cancer predisposition gene <i>NTHL1</i>, which encodes a base excision repair protein, revealed a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional footprint (signature 30) previously observed in a breast cancer cohort. We show that signature 30 can arise from germline <i>NTHL1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions.</p>

Ascorbic Acid Integrates the Antagonistic Modulation of Ethylene and Abscisic Acid in the Accumulation of Reactive Oxygen Species
<p>During plant growth and development, ethylene and abscisic acid (ABA) play important roles and exert synergistic or antagonistic effects on various biological processes, but the detailed mechanism underlying the interaction of the two phytohormones, especially in the regulation of the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), is largely unclear. Here, we report that ethylene inhibits but ABA promotes the accumulation of ROS in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings. Furthermore, changes in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s of ascorbic acid (AsA) act as a key factor in integrating the interaction of ethylene and ABA in the regulation of ROS levels. We found that ethylene and ABA antagonistically regulate AsA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s via ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3) and ABA INSENSITIVE4 (ABI4), which are key factors in the ethylene and ABA signaling pathways, respectively. In addition, <i>ABI4</i> is transcriptionally repressed by EIN3 in ethylene-regulated AsA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s. Via transcriptome analysis and molecular and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic experiments, we identified <i>VITAMIN C DEFECTIVE2</i>as the direct target of ABI4 in the regulation of AsA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s and ROS accumulation. Thus, the EIN3-ABI4- <i>VITAMIN C DEFECTIVE2</i> transcriptional cascade involves a mechanism by which ethylene and ABA antagonistically regulate AsA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s and ROS accumulation in response to complex environmental stimuli.</p>

Sugar Potentiation of Fatty Acid and Triacylglycerol Accumulation
<p>Photosynthetically derived sugar provides carbon skeletons for lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s. We used mutants of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and the expression of oleogenic factors to investigate relationships among sugar availability, lipid synthesis, and the accumulation of triacylglycerol (TAG) in leaf tissue. The <i>adg1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion disables the small subunit of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, the first step in starch synthesis, and the <i>suc2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion disables a sucrose/proton symporter that facilitates sucrose loading from leaves into phloem. The <i>adg1suc2</i> double mutant increases glucose plus sucrose content in leaves 80-fold relative to the wild type, total fatty acid (FA) content 1.8-fold to 8.3% dry weight, and TAG more than 10-fold to 1.2% dry weight. The WRINKLED1 transcription factor also accumulates to higher levels in these leaves, and the rate of FA synthesis increases by 58%. Adding <i>tt4</i>, which disables chalcone synthase, had little effect, but adding the <i>tgd1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion, which disables an importer of lipids into plastids to create <i>adg1suc2tt4tgd1</i>, increased total leaf FA to 13.5% dry weight and TAG to 3.8% dry weight, demonstrating a synergistic effect upon combining these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions. Combining <i>adg1suc2</i> with the <i>sdp1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion, deficient in the predominant TAG lipase, had little effect on total FA content but increased the TAG accumulation by 66% to 2% dry weight. Expression of the <i>WRINKLED1</i> transcription factor, along with <i>DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1</i> and the <i>OLEOSIN1</i> oil body-associated protein, in the <i>adg1suc2</i> mutant doubled leaf FA content and increased TAG content to 2.3% dry weight, a level 4.6-fold higher than that resulting from expression of the same factors in the wild type.</p>

Cytokinin Biosynthesis Promotes Cortical Cell Responses during Nodule Development
<p>Legume mutants have shown the requirement for receptor-mediated cytokinin signaling in symbiotic nodule organogenesis. While the receptors are central regulators, cytokinin also is accumulated during early phases of symbiotic interaction, but the pathways involved have not yet been fully resolved. To identify the source, timing, and effect of this accumulation, we followed transcript levels of the cytokinin biosynthetic pathway genes in a sliding developmental zone of <i>Lotus japonicus</i> roots. <i>LjIpt2</i> and <i>LjLog4</i> were identified as the major contributors to the first cytokinin burst. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic dependence and Nod factor responsiveness of these genes confirm that cytokinin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s is a key target of the common symbiosis pathway. The accumulation of <i>LjIpt2</i> and <i>LjLog4</i> transcripts occurs independent of the <i>LjLhk1</i> receptor during nodulation. Together with the rapid repression of both genes by cytokinin, this indicates that <i>LjIpt2</i> and <i>LjLog4</i> contribute to, rather than respond to, the initial cytokinin buildup. Analysis of the cytokinin response using the synthetic cytokinin sensor, <i>TCSn</i>, showed that this response occurs in cortical cells before spreading to the epidermis in <i>L. japonicus</i>. While mutant analysis identified redundancy in several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s families, we found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion of <i>LjIpt4</i> limits nodule numbers. Overexpression of <i>LjIpt3</i> or <i>LjLog4</i> alone was insufficient to produce the robust formation of spontaneous nodules. In contrast, overexpressing a complete cytokinin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s pathway leads to large, often fused spontaneous nodules. These results show the importance of cytokinin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s in initiating and balancing the requirement for cortical cell activation without uncontrolled cell proliferation.</p>

A global genetic interaction network maps a wiring diagram of cellular function
<p>We generated a global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic interaction network for <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, constructing more than 23 million double mutants, identifying about 550,000 negative and about 350,000 positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic interactions. This comprehensive network maps <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic interactions for essential gene pairs, highlighting essential genes as densely connected hubs. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic interaction profiles enabled assembly of a hierarchical model of cell function, including modules corresponding to protein complexes and pathways, biological processes, and cellular compartments. Negative interactions connected functionally related genes, mapped core bioprocesses, and identified pleiotropic genes, whereas positive interactions often mapped general regulatory connections among gene pairs, rather than shared functionality. The global network illustrates how coherent sets of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic interactions connect protein complex and pathway modules to map a functional wiring diagram of the cell.</p>

Stop codon reassignments in the wild
<p>The canonical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic code is assumed to be deeply conserved across all domains of life with very few exceptions. By scanning 5.6 trillion base pairs of metagenomic data for stop codon reassignment events, we detected recoding in a substantial fraction of the >1700 environmental samples examined. We observed extensive <i>opal</i> and <i>amber</i> stop codon reassignments in bacteriophages and of <i>opal</i> in bacteria. Our data indicate that bacteriophages can infect hosts with a different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic code and demonstrate phage-host antagonism based on code differences. The abundance and diversity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic codes present in environmental organisms should be considered in the design of engineered organisms with altered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic codes in order to preclude the exchange of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic information with naturally occurring species.</p>

Hypermorphic <i>SERK1</i> Mutations Function via a <i>SOBIR1</i> Pathway to Activate Floral Abscission Signaling
<p>In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the abscission of floral organs is regulated by two related receptor-like protein kinases, HAESA (HAE) and HAESA-LIKE2 (HSL2). In complex with members of the SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE (SERK) family of coreceptor protein kinases, HAE and HSL2 are activated when bound by INFLORESCENCE DEFICIENT IN ABSICSSION, a proteolytically processed peptide ligand, activating the expression of genes encoding secreted cell wall remodeling and hydrolase enzymes. <i>hae hsl2</i> mutants fail to induce expression of these genes and retain floral organs indefinitely. Here, we report identification of an allelic series of <i>hae hsl2</i> suppressor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in the <i>SERK1</i> coreceptor protein kinase gene. Genetic and transcriptomic evidence indicates that these alleles represent a novel class of gain-of-function <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions that activate signaling independently of HAE/HSL2. We show that, surprisingly, the suppression effect does not rely on the protein kinase activity of SERK1 and that activation of signaling relies on the receptor-like kinase gene <i>SUPPRESSOR OF BIR1</i> (<i>SOBIR1</i>). The effect of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions can be mimicked by loss of function of <i>BAK1-INTERACTING RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE1</i> (<i>BIR1</i>), a known negative regulator of <i>SERK</i>-<i>SOBIR1</i> signaling. These results suggest that <i>BIR1</i> negatively regulates <i>SERK-SOBIR1</i> signaling during abscission and that the identified <i>SERK1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions likely interfere with this negative regulation.</p>

A Methyltransferase Trio Essential for Phosphatidylcholine Biosynthesis and Growth
<p>Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is a primary class of membrane lipids in most eukaryotes. In plants, the primary PC biosynthetic pathway and its role in plant growth and development remain elusive due to lack of a mutant model with substantially decreased PC content. Recently, a double mutant of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) PHOSPHO-BASE <i>N</i>-METHYLTRANSFERASE 1 (PMT1) and PMT3 was reported with reduced PC content and defective plant growth. However, residual PC content as well as the nonlethal phenotype of the mutant suggests an additional enzyme contributes to PC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s. In this article, we report on the role of three PMTs in PC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s and plant development, with a focus on PMT2. <i>PMT2</i> had the highest expression level among the three PMTs, and it was highly expressed in roots. The <i>pmt1 pmt2</i> double mutant enhanced the defects in root growth, cell viability, and PC content of <i>pmt1</i>, suggesting that PMT2 functions together with PMT1 in roots. Chemical inhibition of PMT activity in wild-type roots reproduced the short root phenotype observed in <i>pmt1 pmt2</i>, suggesting that PMT1 and PMT2 are the major PMT isoforms in roots. In shoots, <i>pmt1 pmt2 pmt3</i> enhanced the phenotype of <i>pmt1 pmt3</i>, showing seedling lethality and further reduced PC content without detectable de novo PC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s. These results suggest that PMTs catalyze an essential reaction step in PC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s and that the three PMTs have differential tissue-specific functions in PC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s and plant growth.</p>

GhCPK33 Negatively Regulates Defense against <i>Verticillium dahliae</i> by Phosphorylating GhOPR3
<p><i>Verticillium</i> wilt, caused by the soil-borne fungus <i>Verticillium dahliae</i>, is a destructive vascular disease in plants. Approximately 200 dicotyledonous plant species in temperate and subtropical regions are susceptible to this notorious pathogen. Previous studies showed that jasmonic acid (JA) plays a crucial role in plant-<i>V. dahliae</i> interactions. <i>V. dahliae</i> infection generally induces significant JA accumulation in local and distal tissues of the plant. Although JA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s and the associated enzymes have been studied intensively, the precise mechanism regulating JA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s upon <i>V. dahliae</i> infection remains unknown. Here, we identified the calcium-dependent protein kinase GhCPK33 from upland cotton (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>) as a negative regulator of resistance to <i>V. dahliae</i> that directly manipulates JA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s. Knockdown of <i>GhCPK33</i> by <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i>-mediated virus-induced gene silencing constitutively activated JA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s and JA-mediated defense responses and enhanced resistance to <i>V</i>. <i>dahliae</i>. Further analysis revealed that GhCPK33 interacts with 12-oxophytodienoate reductase3 (GhOPR3) in peroxisomes. GhCPK33 phosphorylates GhOPR3 at threonine-246, leading to decreased stability of GhOPR3, which consequently limits JA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s. We propose that GhCPK33 is a potential molecular target for improving resistance to <i>Verticillium</i> wilt disease in cotton.</p>

EIN3-LIKE1, MYB1, and ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR3 Act in a Regulatory Loop That Synergistically Modulates Ethylene Biosynthesis and Anthocyanin Accumulation
<p>Ethylene regulates climacteric fruit ripening, and EIN3-LIKE1 (EIL1) plays an important role in this process. In apple (<i>Malus domestica</i>), fruit coloration is accompanied by ethylene release during fruit ripening, but the molecular mechanism that underlies these two physiological processes is unknown. In this study, we found that ethylene treatment markedly induced fruit coloration as well as the expression of <i>MdMYB1</i>, a positive regulator of anthocyanin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s and fruit coloration. In addition, we found that MdEIL1 directly bound to the promoter of <i>MdMYB1</i> and transcriptionally activated its expression, which resulted in anthocyanin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s and fruit coloration. Furthermore, MdMYB1 interacted with the promoter of <i>ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR3</i>, a key regulator of ethylene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s, thereby providing a positive feedback for ethylene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s regulation. Overall, our findings provide insight into a mechanism involving the synergistic interaction of the ethylene signal with the MdMYB1 transcription factor to regulate ethylene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s and fruit coloration in apple.</p>

The Major Origin of Seedless Grapes Is Associated with a Missense Mutation in the MADS-Box Gene <i>VviAGL11</i>
<p>Seedlessness is greatly prized by consumers of fresh grapes. While stenospermocarpic seed abortion determined by the <i>SEED DEVELOPMENT INHIBITOR</i> (<i>SDI</i>) locus is the usual source of seedlessness in commercial grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) cultivars, the underlying <i>sdi</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion remains unknown. Here, we undertook an integrative approach to identify the causal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion. Quantitative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ics and fine-mapping in two ‘Crimson Seedless’-derived F1 mapping populations confirmed the major effect of the <i>SDI</i> locus and delimited the <i>sdi</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion to a 323-kb region on chromosome 18. RNA-sequencing comparing seed traces of seedless and seeds of seeded F1 individuals identified processes triggered during <i>sdi</i>-determined seed abortion, including the activation of salicylic acid-dependent autoimmunity. The RNA-sequencing data set was investigated for candidate genes, and while no evidence for causal cis-acting regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions was detected, deleterious nucleotide changes in coding sequences of the seedless haplotype were predicted in two genes within the <i>sdi</i> fine-mapping interval. Targeted resequencing of the two genes in a collection of 124 grapevine cultivars showed that only the point variation causing the arginine-197-to-leucine substitution in the seed morphogenesis regulator gene <i>AGAMOUS-LIKE11</i> (<i>VviAGL11</i>) was fully linked with stenospermocarpy. The concurrent postzygotic variation identified for this missense polymorphism and seedlessness phenotype in seeded somatic variants of the original stenospermocarpic cultivar supports a causal effect. We postulate that seed abortion caused by this amino acid substitution in VviAGL11 is the major cause of seedlessness in cultivated grapevine. This information can be exploited to boost seedless grape breeding.</p>

Identification of Genes Related to Cold Tolerance and a Functional Allele That Confers Cold Tolerance
<p>Cold stress is a major factor limiting rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) production worldwide, especially at the seedling and booting stages. The identification of genes associated with cold tolerance (CT) in rice is important for sustainable food production. Here, we report the results of a genome-wide association study to identify the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic loci associated with CT by using a 1,033-accession diversity panel. We identified five CT-related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic loci at the booting stage. Accessions carrying multiple cold-tolerant alleles displayed a higher seed-setting rate than did accessions that had no cold-tolerant alleles or carried a single allele. At the seedling stage, eight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic loci related to CT have been identified. Among these, <i>LOC_Os10g34840</i> was identified as the candidate gene for the <i>qPSR10</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic locus that is associated with CT in rice seedlings. A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), SNP2<sup>G</sup>, at position 343 in <i>LOC_Os10g34840</i> is responsible for conferring CT at the seedling stage in rice. Further analysis of the haplotype network revealed that SNP2<sup>G</sup> was present in 80.08% of the temperate <i>japonica</i> accessions but only 3.8% of the <i>indica</i> ones. We used marker-assisted selection to construct a series of BC<sub>4</sub>F<sub>3</sub> near-isogenic lines possessing the cold-tolerant allele SNP2<sup>G</sup>. When subjected to cold stress, plants carrying SNP2<sup>G</sup> survived better as seedlings and showed higher grain weight than plants carrying the SNP2<sup>A</sup> allele. The CT-related loci identified here and the functional verification of <i>LOC_Os10g34840</i> will provide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic resources for breeding cold-tolerant varieties and for studying the molecular basis of CT in rice.</p>

Transcriptomic Insights into Phenological Development and Cold Tolerance of Wheat Grown in the Field
<p>Cold acclimation and winter survival in cereal species is determined by complicated environmentally regulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene express</span></strong>ion. However, studies investigating these complex cold responses are mostly conducted in controlled environments that only consider the responses to single environmental variables. In this study, we have comprehensively profiled global transcriptional responses in crowns of field-grown spring and winter wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) genotypes and their near-isogenic lines with the <i>VRN-A1</i> alleles swapped. This in-depth analysis revealed multiple signaling, interactive pathways that influence cold tolerance and phenological development to optimize plant growth and development in preparation for a wide range of over-winter stresses. Investigation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic differences at the <i>VRN-A1</i> locus revealed that a vernalization requirement maintained a higher level of cold response pathways while <i>VRN-A1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ically promoted floral development. Our results also demonstrated the influence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic background on the expression of cold and flowering pathways. The link between delayed shoot apex development and the induction of cold tolerance was reflected by the gradual up-regulation of abscisic acid-dependent and C-REPEAT-BINDING FACTOR pathways. This was accompanied by the down-regulation of key genes involved in meristem development as the autumn progressed. The chromosome location of differentially expressed genes between the winter and spring wheat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic backgrounds showed a striking pattern of biased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene express</span></strong>ion on chromosomes 6A and 6D, indicating a transcriptional regulation at the genome level. This finding adds to the complexity of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic cascades and gene interactions that determine the evolutionary patterns of both phenological development and cold tolerance traits in wheat.</p>

Transcription Factor-Mediated Control of Anthocyanin Biosynthesis in Vegetative Tissues
<p>Plants accumulate secondary metabolites to adapt to environmental conditions. These compounds, here exemplified by the purple-colored anthocyanins, are accumulated upon high temperatures, UV-light, drought, and nutrient deficiencies, and may contribute to tolerance to these stresses. Producing compounds is often part of a more broad response of the plant to changes in the environment. Here we investigate how a transcription-factor-mediated program for controlling anthocyanin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s also has effects on formation of specialized cell structures and changes in the plant root architecture. A systems biology approach was developed in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) for coordinated induction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s of anthocyanins, in a tissue- and development-independent manner. A transcription factor couple from <i>Antirrhinum</i> that is known to control anthocyanin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s was introduced in tomato under control of a dexamethasone-inducible promoter. By application of dexamethasone, anthocyanin formation was induced within 24 h in vegetative tissues and in undifferentiated cells. Profiles of metabolites and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene express</span></strong>ion were analyzed in several tomato tissues. Changes in concentration of anthocyanins and other phenolic compounds were observed in all tested tissues, accompanied by induction of the biosynthetic pathways leading from Glc to anthocyanins. A number of pathways that are not known to be involved in anthocyanin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s were observed to be regulated. Anthocyanin-producing plants displayed profound physiological and architectural changes, depending on the tissue, including root branching, root epithelial cell morphology, seed germination, and leaf conductance. The inducible anthocyanin-production system reveals a range of phenomena that accompanies anthocyanin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s in tomato, including adaptions of the plants architecture and physiology.</p>

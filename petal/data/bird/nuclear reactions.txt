Genetics of Variable Disease Expression Conferred by Inverse Gene-For-Gene Interactions in the Wheat-<i>Parastagonospora nodorum</i> Pathosystem
<p>The wheat-<i>Parastagonospora nodorum</i> pathosystem involves the recognition of pathogen-secreted necrotrophic effectors (NEs) by corresponding wheat NE sensitivity genes. This inverse gene-for-gene recognition leads to necrotrophic effector-triggered susceptibility and ultimately septoria nodorum blotch disease. Here, we used multiple pathogen isolates to individually evaluate the effects of the host gene-NE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions <i>Tan spot necrosis1</i>-Stagonospora nodorum ToxinA (<i>Tsn1</i>-SnToxA), <i>Stagonospora nodorum necrosis1</i>-Stagonospora nodorum Toxin1 (<i>Snn1</i>-SnTox1), and <i>Stagonospora nodorum necrosis3-B genome homeolog1</i>-Stagonospora nodorum Toxin3 (<i>Snn3-B1</i>-SnTox3), alone and in various combinations, to determine the relative importance of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions in causing disease. Genetic analysis of a recombinant inbred wheat population inoculated separately with three <i>P. nodorum</i> isolates, all of which produce all three NEs, indicated that the <i>Tsn1</i>-SnToxA and <i>Snn3-B1</i>-SnTox3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions contributed to disease caused by all four isolates, but their effects varied and ranged from epistatic to additive. The <i>Snn1</i>-SnTox1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion was associated with increased disease for one isolate, but for other isolates, there was evidence that this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion inhibited the expression of other host gene-NE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions. RNA sequencing analysis in planta showed that <i>SnTox1</i> was differentially expressed between these three isolates after infection. Further analysis of NE gene-knockout isolates showed that the effect of some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions could be masked or inhibited by other compatible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions, and the regulation of this occurs at the level of NE gene transcription. Collectively, these results show that the inverse gene-for-gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions leading to necrotrophic effector-triggered susceptibility in the wheat-<i>P. nodorum</i> pathosystem vary in their effects depending on the genetic backgrounds of the pathogen and host, and interplay among the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions is complex and intricately regulated.</p>

Systematic analysis of complex genetic interactions
<p>To systematically explore complex genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions, we constructed ~200,000 yeast triple mutants and scored negative trigenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions. We selected double-mutant query genes across a broad spectrum of biological processes, spanning a range of quantitative features of the global digenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion network and tested for a genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion with a third mutation. Trigenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions often occurred among functionally related genes, and essential genes were hubs on the trigenic network. Despite their functional enrichment, trigenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions tended to link genes in distant bioprocesses and displayed a weaker magnitude than digenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions. We estimate that the global trigenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion network is ~100 times as large as the global digenic network, highlighting the potential for complex genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions to affect the biology of inheritance, including the genotype-to-phenotype relationship.</p>

Spectacular Oscillations in Plant Isoprene Emission under Transient Conditions Explain the Enigmatic CO<sub>2</sub> Response<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plant isoprene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ions respond to light and temperature similarly to photosynthesis, but CO<sub>2</sub> dependencies of isoprene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion and photosynthesis are profoundly different, with photosynthesis increasing and isoprene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion decreasing with increasing CO<sub>2</sub> concentration due to reasons not yet understood. We studied isoprene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion, net assimilation rate, and chlorophyll fluorescence under different CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the strong isoprene emitter hybrid aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus tremuloides</i>), and used rapid changes in ambient CO<sub>2</sub> or O<sub>2</sub> concentrations or light level to induce oscillations. As isoprene-emitting species support very high steady-state chloroplastic pool sizes of the primary isoprene substrate, dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMADP), which can mask the effects of oscillatory dynamics on isoprene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion, the size of the DMADP pool was experimentally reduced by either partial inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis pathway by fosmidomycin-feeding or by changes in ambient gas concentrations leading to DMADP pool depletion in intact leaves. In feedback-limited conditions observed at low O<sub>2</sub> and/or high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration under which the rate of photosynthesis is governed by the limited rate of ATP and NADPH formation due to low chloroplastic phosphate levels, oscillations in photosynthesis and isoprene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion were repeatedly induced by rapid environmental modifications in both partly fosmidomycin-inhibited leaves and in intact leaves with in vivo reduced DMADP pools. The oscillations in net assimilation rate and isoprene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion in feedback-inhibited leaves were in the same phase, and relative changes in the pools of photosynthetic metabolites and DMADP estimated by in vivo kinetic methods were directly proportional through all oscillations induced by different environmental perturbations. We conclude that the oscillations in isoprene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion provide direct experimental evidence demonstrating that the response of isoprene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion to changes in ambient gas concentrations is controlled by the chloroplastic reductant supply.</p>

Pharmacodynamic Effects of Switching From Ticagrelor to Clopidogrel in Patients With Coronary Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Switching between different classes of P2Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitors, including de-escalation from ticagrelor to clopidogrel, commonly occurs in clinical practice. However, the pharmacodynamic profiles of this strategy have been poorly explored.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This was a prospective, randomized, open-label study conducted in patients on maintenance dosing (MD) of aspirin (81 mg/d) and clopidogrel (75 mg/d). After a 7-day run-in with ticagrelor (180 mg loading dose [LD] followed by 90 mg twice daily MD), patients (n=80) were randomized into 1 of 4 groups: group A, clopidogrel 600 mg LD 24 hours after the last MD of ticagrelor (C-600 mg-24h); group B, clopidogrel 600 mg LD 12 hours after the last MD of ticagrelor (C-600 mg-12h); group C, clopidogrel 75 mg/d MD 24 hours after the last MD of ticagrelor (C-75 mg-24h); and group D, ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily MD (T-90 mg twice daily). MD of the randomized treatment was maintained for 10±3 days. Pharmacodynamic assessments were performed at baseline, after run-in, and at 2, 24, 48, and 72 hours and 10 days with P2Y<sub>12</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong> units by VerifyNow; platelet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reactiv</span></strong>ity index was assessed by vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein; and maximal platelet aggregation was determined by light transmittance aggregometry.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>T-90 mg twice daily led to lower platelet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reactiv</span></strong>ity than any clopidogrel regimen using all assays at all time points.

P2Y<sub>12</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong> unit levels were lower with C-600 mg-12h (group B) than with C-75 mg-24h (group C; <i>P</i>=0.024).

Platelet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reactiv</span></strong>ity index profiles paralleled those observed with P2Y<sub>12</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong> units. There were no pharmacodynamic differences for all tests between C-600 mg-24h (group A) and C-600 mg-12h (group B).

Impact of summer drought on isoprenoid emissions and carbon sink of three Scots pine provenances
<p>Scots pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i> L.) provenances cover broad ecological amplitudes. In a greenhouse study, we investigated the impact of drought stress and rewetting on gas exchange for three provenances (Italy: Emilia Romagna; Spain: Alto Ebro; Germany: East-German lowlands) of 2-year old Scots pine seedlings. CO<sub>2</sub>, water vapour and isoprenoid exchange of stressed and control trees were quantified with a four-chamber dynamic-enclosure system in the controlled environment of a climate chamber. The three provenances showed distinct isoprenoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion patterns and were classified into a non-Δ<sup>3</sup>-carene, with either high α-/β-pinene or β-myrcene fraction, and a Δ<sup>3</sup>-carene dominated type. Isoprenoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion rates, net-photosynthesis and transpiration were reduced during summer drought stress and significantly recovered after rewetting. A seasonal increase of isoprenoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion rates towards autumn was observed for all control groups. Compared with the German provenance, the Spanish and Italian provenances revealed higher isoprenoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion rates and more plastic responses to drought stress and seasonal development, which points to a local adaptation to climate. As a result of drought, net carbon uptake and transpiration of trees was reduced, but recovered after rewetting. We conclude from our study that Scots pine isoprenoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion is more variable than expected and sensitive to drought periods, likely impacting regional air chemistry. Thus, a provenance-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion assessment accounting for reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion during prolonged (summer) drought is recommend for setting up biogenic volatile organic compound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion inventories used in air quality models.</p>

Generation of specific inhibitors of SUMO-1– and SUMO-2/3–mediated protein-protein interactions using Affimer (Adhiron) technology
<p>Because protein-protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions underpin most biological processes, developing tools that target them to understand their function or to inform the development of therapeutics is an important task. SUMOylation is the posttranslational covalent attachment of proteins in the SUMO family (SUMO-1, SUMO-2, or SUMO-3), and it regulates numerous cellular pathways. SUMOylated proteins are recognized by proteins with SUMO-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion motifs (SIMs) that facilitate noncovalent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions with SUMO. We describe the use of the Affimer system of peptide display for the rapid isolation of synthetic binding proteins that inhibit SUMO-dependent protein-protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions mediated by SIMs both in vitro and in cells. Crucially, these synthetic proteins did not prevent SUMO conjugation either in vitro or in cell-based systems, enabling the specific analysis of SUMO-mediated protein-protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions. Furthermore, through structural analysis and molecular modeling, we explored the molecular mechanisms that may underlie their specificity in interfering with either SUMO-1–mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions mediated by either SUMO-2 or SUMO-3. Not only will these reagents enable investigation of the biological roles of SUMOylation, but the Affimer technology used to generate these synthetic binding proteins could also be exploited to design or validate reagents or therapeutics that target other protein-protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions.</p>

Evidence That Isoprene Emission Is Not Limited by Cytosolic Metabolites. Exogenous Malate Does Not Invert the Reverse Sensitivity of Isoprene Emission to High [CO<sub>2</sub>]
<p>Isoprene is synthesized via the chloroplastic 2-<i>C</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-erythritol 4-phosphate/1-deoxy-<sc>d</sc>-xylulose 5-phosphate pathway (MEP/DOXP), and its synthesis is directly related to photosynthesis, except under high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, when the rate of photosynthesis increases but isoprene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion decreases. Suppression of MEP/DOXP pathway activity by high CO<sub>2</sub> has been explained either by limited supply of the cytosolic substrate precursor, phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate (PEP), into chloroplast as the result of enhanced activity of cytosolic PEP carboxylase or by limited supply of energetic and reductive equivalents. We tested the PEP-limitation hypotheses by feeding leaves with the PEP carboxylase competitive inhibitors malate and diethyl oxalacetate (DOA) in the strong isoprene emitter hybrid aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus tremuloides</i>). Malate feeding resulted in the inhibition of net assimilation, photosynthetic electron transport, and isoprene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion rates, but DOA feeding did not affect any of these processes except at very high application concentrations. Both malate and DOA did not alter the sensitivity of isoprene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion to high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. Malate inhibition of isoprene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion was associated with enhanced chloroplastic reductive status that suppressed light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong>s of photosynthesis, ultimately leading to reduced isoprene substrate dimethylallyl diphosphate pool size. Additional experiments with altered oxygen concentrations in conditions of feedback-limited and non-feedback-limited photosynthesis further indicated that changes in isoprene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion rate in control and malate-inhibited leaves were associated with changes in the share of ATP and reductive equivalent supply for isoprene synthesis. The results of this study collectively indicate that malate importantly controls the chloroplast reductive status and, thereby, affects isoprene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion, but they do not support the hypothesis that cytosolic metabolite availability alters the response of isoprene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion to changes in atmospheric composition.</p>

Loss of Cardioprotective Effects at the <i>ADAMTS7</i> Locus as a Result of Gene-Smoking Interactions

Isoscapes resolve species-specific spatial patterns in plant–plant interactions in an invaded Mediterranean dune ecosystem
<p>Environmental heterogeneity and plant–plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions are key factors shaping plant communities. However, the spatial dimension of plant–plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions has seldom been addressed in field studies. This is at least partially rooted in a lack of methods that can accurately resolve functional processes in a spatially explicit manner. Isoscapes, that is, spatially explicit representations of stable isotope data, provide a versatile means to trace functional changes on spatial scales, for example, related to N-cycling (foliar δ<sup>15</sup>N) and water use efficiency (WUE<sub>i</sub>, foliar δ<sup>13</sup>C). In a case study in a nutrient-depleted Mediterranean dune ecosystem, we analysed the spatial impact of the invasive N<sub>2</sub>-fixing <i>Acacia longifolia</i> on three native species of different functional types using δ<sup>15</sup>N and δ<sup>13</sup>C isoscapes and spatial autocorrelation analyses. Isoscapes revealed strong spatial patterns in δ<sup>15</sup>N and δ<sup>13</sup>C with pronounced species-specific differences, demonstrating distinct spatial ranges of plant–plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions. A coniferous tree and an ericaceous dwarf shrub showed significant enrichment in δ<sup>15</sup>N within a range of 5–8 m surrounding the canopy of <i>A. longifolia</i>, indicating input of N originating from symbiotic N<sub>2</sub>-fixation by the invader. In the dwarf shrub, which was most responsive to invader influence, enrichment in δ<sup>13</sup>C additionally demonstrated spatially explicit changes to WUE<sub>i</sub>, while a native N<sub>2</sub>-fixer was unresponsive to the presence of the invader. Furthermore, δ<sup>15</sup>N and δ<sup>13</sup>C isoscapes yielded different patterns, indicating that plant–plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions can have distinct spatial distributions and ranges based on the process measured. Additionally, the magnitude of the effect differed between field situations with high and low invasion pressure. This study highlights that the spatial scale must be accounted for when assessing the effects and outcome of species <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions. Functional tracers such as stable isotopes enable us to quantify spatial ranges of plant–plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions, providing empirical data that can help to better understand and predict complex species <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions in multifaceted natural environments.</p>

Teaching an old carbocation new tricks: Intermolecular C–H insertion reactions of vinyl cations

pTAC10, a Key Subunit of Plastid-Encoded RNA Polymerase, Promotes Chloroplast Development
<p>Regulation of photosynthetic gene expression by plastid-encoded RNA polymerase (PEP) is essential for chloroplast development. The activity of PEP largely relies on at least 12 PEP-associated proteins (PAPs) encoded in the nuclear genome of plant cells. A recent model proposed that these PAPs regulate the establishment of the PEP complex through broad PAP-PEP or PAP-PAP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions. In this study, we identified the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedling-lethal mutant <i>ptac10-1</i>, which has defects in chloroplast development, and found that the mutant phenotype is caused by the suppression of <i>PLASTID S1 RNA-BINDING DOMAIN PROTEIN</i> (<i>pTAC10/PAP3</i>). Analysis of the heterozygous mutant and <i>pTAC10</i>-overexpressing transgenic plants indicated that the expression level of <i>pTAC10</i> is tightly linked to chloroplast development. Characterization of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion of pTAC10 with PAPs revealed that pTAC10 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>s with other PAPs, such as FSD2, FSD3, TrxZ, pTAC7, and pTAC14, but it does not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong> with PEP core enzymes, such as rpoA and rpoB. Analysis of pTAC10 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions using truncated pTAC10 proteins showed that the pTAC10 carboxyl-terminal region downstream of the S1 domain is involved in the pTAC10-PAP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion. Furthermore, overexpression of truncated <i>pTAC10s</i> lacking the C-terminal regions downstream of the S1 domain could not rescue the <i>ptac10-1</i> mutant phenotype and induced an abnormal whitening phenotype in Columbia-0 plants. Our observations suggested that these pTAC10-PAP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions are essential for the formation of the PEP complex and chloroplast development.</p>

The conformational state of hERG1 channels determines integrin association, downstream signaling, and cancer progression
<p>Ion channels regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration in normal and neoplastic cells through cell-cell and cell–extracellular matrix (ECM) transmembrane receptors called integrins. K<sup>+</sup> flux through the human ether-à-go-go–related gene 1 (hERG1) channel shapes action potential firing in excitable cells such as cardiomyocytes. Its abundance is often aberrantly high in tumors, where it modulates integrin-mediated signaling. We found that hERG1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ed with the β<sub>1</sub> integrin subunit at the plasma membrane of human cancer cells. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion was not detected in cardiomyocytes because of the presence of the hERG1 auxiliary subunit KCNE1 (potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily E regulatory subunit 1), which blocked the β<sub>1</sub> integrin–hERG1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion. Although open hERG1 channels did not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong> as strongly with β<sub>1</sub> integrins as did closed channels, current flow through hERG1 channels was necessary to activate the integrin-dependent phosphorylation of Tyr<sup>397</sup> in focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in both normal and cancer cells. In immunodeficient mice, proliferation was inhibited in breast cancer cells expressing forms of hERG1 with impaired K<sup>+</sup> flow, whereas metastasis of breast cancer cells was reduced when the hERG1/β<sub>1</sub> integrin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion was disrupted. We conclude that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion of β<sub>1</sub> integrins with hERG1 channels in cancer cells stimulated distinct signaling pathways that depended on the conformational state of hERG1 and affected different aspects of tumor progression.</p>

<p>Methane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ions from the U.S. oil and natural gas supply chain were estimated by using ground-based, facility-scale measurements and validated with aircraft observations in areas accounting for ~30% of U.S. gas production. When scaled up nationally, our facility-based estimate of 2015 supply chain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ions is 13 ± 2 teragrams per year, equivalent to 2.3% of gross U.S. gas production. This value is ~60% higher than the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency inventory estimate, likely because existing inventory methods miss <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ions released during abnormal operating conditions. Methane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ions of this magnitude, per unit of natural gas consumed, produce radiative forcing over a 20-year time horizon comparable to the CO<sub>2</sub> from natural gas combustion. Substantial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion reductions are feasible through rapid detection of the root causes of high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ions and deployment of less failure-prone systems.</p>

If two deletions don't stop growth, try three
<p>How many and which genes does an organism need at a minimum to sustain growth? With the identification of essential genes in a variety of organisms such as yeast (<i>1</i>), worms (<i>2</i>), and human cultured cells (<i>3</i>–<i>5</i>), the answer may seem obvious: Remove all nonessential genes, and the organism should be able to continue to survive and grow. In the yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, the workhorse of genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion mapping, ∼1000 of the ∼6000 (∼17%) protein-coding genes are essential for viability (<i>1</i>). So theoretically, one might think that one could remove the other ∼5000 nonessential genes and still have a growing yeast. The reason this does not work is that genes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong> with each other to drive different traits, including viability and growth. On page 283 of this issue, Kuzmin <i>et al.</i> (<i>6</i>) provide the first systematic analysis of trigenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions in yeast in which three gene deletions are combined in individual strains in order to ascertain the importance of multigene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions for growth. This study shows that higher-order genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions are abundant, which has implications for the interpretation of human gene variants that may <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong> to affect health and disease.</p>

A dedicated network for social interaction processing in the primate brain
<p>Primate cognition requires <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion processing. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions can reveal otherwise hidden properties of intentional agents, such as thoughts and feelings, and of inanimate objects, such as mass and material. Where and how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion analyses are implemented in the brain is unknown. Using whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging in macaque monkeys, we discovered a network centered in the medial and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex that is exclusively engaged in social <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion analysis. Exclusivity of specialization was found for no other function anywhere in the brain. Two additional networks, a parieto-premotor and a temporal one, exhibited both social and physical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion preference, which, in the temporal lobe, mapped onto a fine-grain pattern of object, body, and face selectivity. Extent and location of a dedicated system for social <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion analysis suggest that this function is an evolutionary forerunner of human mind-reading capabilities.</p>

SIPP, a Novel Mitochondrial Phosphate Carrier, Mediates in Self-Incompatibility
<p>In Solanaceae, the <i>S</i>-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion between the pistil S-RNase and the pollen <i>S</i>-Locus F-box protein controls self-incompatibility (SI). Although this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion defines the specificity of the pollen rejection response, the identification of three pistil essential modifier genes unlinked to the <i>S</i>-locus (<i>HT-B</i>, <i>120K</i>, and <i>NaStEP</i>) unveils a higher degree of complexity in the pollen rejection pathway. We showed previously that NaStEP, a stigma protein with homology with Kunitz-type protease inhibitors, is essential to SI in <i>Nicotiana</i> spp. During pollination, NaStEP is taken up by pollen tubes, where potential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions with pollen tube proteins might underlie its function. Here, we identified NaSIPP, a mitochondrial protein with phosphate transporter activity, as a novel NaStEP-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ing protein. Coexpression of NaStEP and NaSIPP in pollen tubes showed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion in the mitochondria, although when expressed alone, NaStEP remains mostly cytosolic, implicating NaSIPP-mediated translocation of NaStEP into the organelle. The <i>NaSIPP</i> transcript is detected specifically in mature pollen of <i>Nicotiana</i> spp.; however, in self-compatible plants, this gene has accumulated mutations, so its coding region is unlikely to produce a functional protein. RNA interference suppression of NaSIPP in <i>Nicotiana</i> spp. pollen grains disrupts the SI by preventing pollen tube inhibition. Taken together, our results are consistent with a model whereby the NaStEP and NaSIPP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion, in incompatible pollen tubes, might destabilize the mitochondria and contribute to arrest pollen tube growth.</p>

The DUF1669 domain of FAM83 family proteins anchor casein kinase 1 isoforms
<p>Members of the casein kinase 1 (CK1) family of serine-threonine protein kinases are implicated in the regulation of many cellular processes, including the cell cycle, circadian rhythms, and Wnt and Hedgehog signaling. Because these kinases exhibit constitutive activity in biochemical assays, it is likely that their activity in cells is controlled by subcellular localization, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions with inhibitory proteins, targeted degradation, or combinations of these mechanisms. We identified members of the FAM83 family of proteins as partners of CK1 in cells. All eight members of the FAM83 family (FAM83A to FAM83H) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ed with the α and α-like isoforms of CK1; FAM83A, FAM83B, FAM83E, and FAM83H also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ed with the δ and ε isoforms of CK1. We detected no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion between any FAM83 member and the related CK1γ1, CK1γ2, and CK1γ3 isoforms. Each FAM83 protein exhibited a distinct pattern of subcellular distribution and colocalized with the CK1 isoform(s) to which it bound. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion of FAM83 proteins with CK1 isoforms was mediated by the conserved domain of unknown function 1669 (DUF1669) that characterizes the FAM83 family. Mutations in FAM83 proteins that prevented them from binding to CK1 interfered with the proper subcellular localization and cellular functions of both the FAM83 proteins and their CK1 binding partners. On the basis of its function, we propose that DUF1669 be renamed the polypeptide anchor of CK1 domain.</p>

Global assessment of its network dynamics reveals that the kinase Plk1 inhibits the phosphatase PP6 to promote Aurora A activity
<p>Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is an essential protein kinase that promotes faithful mitotic progression in eukaryotes. The subcellular localization and substrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions of Plk1 are tightly controlled and require its binding to phosphorylated residues. To identify phosphorylation-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions within the Plk1 network in human mitotic cells, we performed quantitative proteomics on HeLa cells cultured with kinase inhibitors or expressing a Plk1 mutant that was deficient in phosphorylation-dependent substrate binding. We found that many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions were abolished upon kinase inhibition; however, a subset was protected from phosphatase opposition or was unopposed, resulting in persistent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion of the substrate with Plk1. This subset includes phosphoprotein phosphatase 6 (PP6), whose activity toward Aurora kinase A (Aurora A) was inhibited by Plk1. Our data suggest that this Plk1-PP6 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion generates a feedback loop that coordinates and reinforces the activities of Plk1 and Aurora A during mitotic entry and is terminated by the degradation of Plk1 during mitotic exit. Thus, we have identified a mechanism for the previously puzzling observation of the Plk1-dependent regulation of Aurora A.</p>

RAF1/BRAF dimerization integrates the signal from RAS to ERK and ROKα
<p>Downstream of growth factor receptors and of the guanine triphosphatase (GTPase) RAS, heterodimers of the serine/threonine kinases BRAF and RAF1 are critical upstream kinases and activators of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) module containing the mitogen-activated and extracellular signal–regulated kinase kinase (MEK) and their targets, the extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) family. Either direct or scaffold protein–mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions among the components of the ERK module (the MAPKKKs BRAF and RAF1, MEK, and ERK) facilitate signal transmission. RAF1 also has essential functions in the control of tumorigenesis and migration that are mediated through its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion with the kinase ROKα, an effector of the GTPase RHO and regulator of cytoskeletal rearrangements. We combined mutational and kinetic analysis with mathematical modeling to show that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion of RAF1 with ROKα is coordinated with the role of RAF1 in the ERK pathway. We found that the phosphorylated form of RAF1 that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ed with and inhibited ROKα was generated during the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion of RAF1 with the ERK module. This mechanism adds plasticity to the ERK pathway, enabling signal diversification at the level of both ERK and RAF. Furthermore, by connecting ERK activation with the regulation of ROKα and cytoskeletal rearrangements by RAF1, this mechanism has the potential to precisely coordinate the proper timing of proliferation with changes in cell shape, adhesion, or motility.</p>

Photon-mediated interactions between quantum emitters in a diamond nanocavity

When the optical transitions of the two color centers are tuned into resonance, the coupling to the common cavity mode results in a coherent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion between them, leading to spectrally resolved superradiant and subradiant states. We use the electronic spin degrees of freedom of the SiV centers to control these optically mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions.

Lewis acid enhancement by hydrogen-bond donors for asymmetric catalysis

However, these catalysts are only weakly acidic and therefore require highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reactiv</span></strong>e electrophilic substrates to be effective. We introduce here a mode of catalytic activity with chiral H-bond donors that enables enantioselective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong>s of relatively un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reactiv</span></strong>e electrophiles.

The silyl triflate-chiral squaramide combination promotes the generation of oxocarbenium intermediates from acetal substrates at low temperatures. Enantioselectivity in nucleophile additions to the cationic intermediates is then controlled through a network of noncovalent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions between the squaramide catalyst and the oxocarbenium triflate.</p>

Structure of a symmetric photosynthetic reaction center–photosystem

Gene duplication can impart fragility, not robustness, in the yeast protein interaction network

The Extra-Pathway Interactome of the TCA Cycle: Expected and Unexpected Metabolic Interactions
<p>The plant tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle provides essential precursors for respiration, amino acid biosynthesis, and general nitrogen metabolism; moreover, it is closely involved in biotic stress responses and cellular redox homeostasis. To further understand the in vivo function of the TCA cycle enzymes, we combined affinity purification with proteomics to generate a comprehensive extra-pathway protein-protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion network of the plant TCA cycle. We identified 125 extra-pathway <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mostly related to the mitochondrial electron transport complex/ATP synthesis and amino acid metabolism but also to proteins associated with redox stress. We chose three high-scoring and two low-scoring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions for complementary bimolecular fluorescence complementation and yeast two-hybrid assays, which highlighted the reliability of our approach, supported the intimate involvement of TCA cycle enzymes within many biological processes, and reflected metabolic changes reported previously for the corresponding mutant lines. To analyze the function of a subset of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions, we selected two mutants of mitochondrial glutaredoxin S15 and Amidase, which have not yet been analyzed with respect to their TCA cycle function, and performed metabolite profiling and flux analysis.

LIL3, a Light-Harvesting Complex Protein, Links Terpenoid and Tetrapyrrole Biosynthesis in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>The LIL3 protein of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) belongs to the light-harvesting complex (LHC) protein family, which also includes the light-harvesting chlorophyll-binding proteins of photosystems I and II, the early-light-inducible proteins, PsbS involved in nonphotochemical quenching, and the one-helix proteins and their cyanobacterial homologs designated high-light-inducible proteins. Each member of this family is characterized by one or two LHC transmembrane domains (referred to as the LHC motif) to which potential functions such as chlorophyll binding, protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion, and integration of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ing partners into the plastid membranes have been attributed. Initially, LIL3 was shown to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong> with geranylgeranyl reductase (CHLP), an enzyme of terpene biosynthesis that supplies the hydrocarbon chain for chlorophyll and tocopherol. Here, we show another function of LIL3 for the stability of protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR). Multiple protein-protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion analyses suggest the direct physical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion of LIL3 with POR but not with chlorophyll synthase. Consistently, LIL3-deficient plants exhibit substantial loss of POR as well as CHLP, which is not due to defective transcription of the POR and CHLP genes but to the posttranslational modification of their protein products. Interestingly, in vitro biochemical analyses provide novel evidence that LIL3 shows high binding affinity to protochlorophyllide, the substrate of POR. Taken together, this study suggests a critical role for LIL3 in the organization of later steps in chlorophyll biosynthesis. We suggest that LIL3 associates with POR and CHLP and thus contributes to the supply of the two metabolites, chlorophyllide and phytyl pyrophosphate, required for the final step in chlorophyll <i>a</i> synthesis.</p>

We report cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM), biophysical, biochemical, and cell biological studies of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion between the CENP-A nucleosome and CENP-N. We show that human CENP-N confers binding specificity through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions with the L1 loop of CENP-A, stabilized by electrostatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions with the nucleosomal DNA. Mutational analyses demonstrate analogous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions in <i>Xenopus</i>, which are further supported by residue-swapping experiments involving the L1 loop of CENP-A. Our results are consistent with the coevolution of CENP-N and CENP-A and establish the structural basis for recognition of the CENP-A nucleosome to enable kinetochore assembly and centromeric chromatin organization.</p>

Gating of social reward by oxytocin in the ventral tegmental area
<p>The reward generated by social <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions is critical for promoting prosocial behaviors. Here we present evidence that oxytocin (OXT) release in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a key node of the brain’s reward circuitry, is necessary to elicit social reward. During social <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions, activity in paraventricular nucleus (PVN) OXT neurons increased. Direct activation of these neurons in the PVN or their terminals in the VTA enhanced prosocial behaviors. Conversely, inhibition of PVN OXT axon terminals in the VTA decreased social <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions. OXT increased excitatory drive onto reward-specific VTA dopamine (DA) neurons. These results demonstrate that OXT promotes prosocial behavior through direct effects on VTA DA neurons, thus providing mechanistic insight into how social <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions can generate rewarding experiences.</p>

Observation of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering
<p>The coherent elastic scattering of neutrinos off nuclei has eluded detection for four decades, even though its predicted cross section is by far the largest of all low-energy neutrino couplings. This mode of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion offers new opportunities to study neutrino properties and leads to a miniaturization of detector size, with potential technological applications. We observed this process at a 6.7σ confidence level, using a low-background, 14.6-kilogram CsI[Na] scintillator exposed to the neutrino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ions from the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Characteristic signatures in energy and time, predicted by the standard model for this process, were observed in high signal-to-background conditions.

Higher predation risk for insect prey at low latitudes and elevations
<p>Biotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions underlie ecosystem structure and function, but predicting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion outcomes is difficult. We tested the hypothesis that biotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion strength increases toward the equator, using a global experiment with model caterpillars to measure predation risk. Across an 11,660-kilometer latitudinal gradient spanning six continents, we found increasing predation toward the equator, with a parallel pattern of increasing predation toward lower elevations. Patterns across both latitude and elevation were driven by arthropod predators, with no systematic trend in attack rates by birds or mammals. These matching gradients at global and regional scales suggest consistent drivers of biotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion strength, a finding that needs to be integrated into general theories of herbivory, community organization, and life-history evolution.</p>

Arylation of hydrocarbons enabled by organosilicon reagents and weakly coordinating anions
<p>Over the past 80 years, phenyl cation intermediates have been implicated in a variety of C–H arylation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong>s. Although these examples have inspired several theoretical and mechanistic studies, aryl cation equivalents have received limited attention in organic methodology. Their high-energy, promiscuous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reactiv</span></strong>ity profiles have hampered applications in selective intermolecular processes. We report a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong> design that overcomes these challenges. Specifically, we found that β-silicon–stabilized aryl cation equivalents, generated via silylium-mediated fluoride activation, undergo insertion into sp<sup>3</sup> and sp<sup>2</sup> C–H bonds. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong> manifold provides a framework for the catalytic arylation of hydrocarbons, including simple alkanes such as methane. This process uses low loadings of Earth-abundant initiators (1 to 5 mole percent) and occurs under mild conditions (30° to 100°C).</p>

<i>Mesorhizobium huakuii</i> HtpG Interaction with nsLTP AsE246 Is Required for Symbiotic Nitrogen Fixation
<p>Plant nonspecific lipid transfer proteins (nsLTPs) are involved in a number of biological processes including root nodule symbiosis. However, the role of nsLTPs in legume-rhizobium symbiosis remains poorly understood, and no rhizobia proteins that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong> with nsLTPs have been reported to date. In this study, we used a bacteria two-hybrid system and identified the high temperature protein G (HtpG) from <i>Mesorhizobium huakuii</i> that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>s with the nsLTP AsE246. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion between HtpG and AsE246 was confirmed by far-Western blotting and bimolecular fluorescence complementation. Our results indicated that the heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) domain of HtpG mediates the HtpG-AsE246 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion. Immunofluorescence assay showed that HtpG was colocalized with AsE246 in infected nodule cells and symbiosome membranes. Expression of the <i>htpG</i> gene was relatively higher in young nodules and was highly expressed in the infection zones. Further investigation showed that <i>htpG</i> expression affects lipid abundance and profiles in root nodules and plays an essential role in nodule development and nitrogen fixation. Our findings provide further insights into the functional mechanisms behind the transport of symbiosome lipids via nsLTPs in root nodules.</p>

A <i>Magnaporthe</i> Chitinase Interacts with a Rice Jacalin-Related Lectin to Promote Host Colonization
<p>The genome of rice blast fungus (<i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>) encodes 15 glycoside hydrolase 18 family chitinases. In this study, we characterized the function of an <i>M. oryzae</i> extracellular chitinase, MoChi1, and its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion with a host protein, OsMBL1, a jacalin-related Mannose-Binding Lectin (MBL) in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). Deletion of <i>MoChi1</i> resulted in reduced aerial hyphal formation and reduced virulence in rice by activating the expression of defense-responsive genes. We confirmed MoChi1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion with rice OsMBL1 in vitro and in vivo. <i>OsMBL1</i> was induced by pathogen-associated molecular patterns and <i>M. oryzae</i> infection. Overexpression of <i>OsMBL1</i> led to activation of rice defense-responsive genes and a chitin-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reactiv</span></strong>e oxygen species burst, thereby enhancing resistance to <i>M. oryzae</i>. Knockdown of <i>OsMBL1</i> enhances susceptibility of rice plants to <i>M. oryzae</i>. Furthermore, MoChi1 suppressed chitin-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reactiv</span></strong>e oxygen species in rice cells and competed with OsMBL1 for chitin binding. Taken together, our study reveals a mechanism in which MoChi1 targets a host lectin to suppress rice immunity.</p>

Split-TALE: A TALE-Based Two-Component System for Synthetic Biology Applications in Planta
<p>Transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) are bacterial Type-III effector proteins from phytopathogenic <i>Xanthomonas</i> species that act as transcription factors in plants. The modular DNA-binding domain of TALEs can be reprogrammed to target nearly any DNA sequence. Here, we designed and optimized a two-component AND-gate system for synthetic circuits in plants based on TALEs. In this system, named split-TALE (sTALE), the TALE DNA binding domain and the transcription activation domain are separated and each fused to protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ing domains. Physical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ing domains leads to TALE-reconstitution and can be monitored by reporter gene induction. This setup was used for optimization of the sTALE scaffolds, which result in an AND-gate system with an improved signal-to-noise ratio. We also provide a toolkit of ready-to-use vectors and single modules compatible with Golden Gate cloning and MoClo syntax. In addition to its implementation in synthetic regulatory circuits, the sTALE system allows the analysis of protein-protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions in planta.</p>

Genome-Scale Fluxome of <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973 Using Transient <sup>13</sup>C-Labeling Data
<p><i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973 (<i>Synechococcus</i> 2973) has the shortest reported doubling time (2.1 h) among cyanobacteria, making it a promising platform for the solar-based production of biochemicals. In this meta-analysis, its intracellular flux distribution was recomputed using genome-scale isotopic nonstationary <sup>13</sup>C-metabolic flux analysis given the labeling dynamics of 13 metabolites reported in an earlier study. To achieve this, a genome-scale mapping model, namely <i>i</i>mSyu593, was constructed using the <i>i</i>mSyn617 mapping model for <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 (<i>Synechocystis</i> 6803) as the starting point encompassing 593 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong>s. The flux elucidation revealed nearly complete conversion (greater than 96%) of the assimilated carbon into biomass in <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973. In contrast, <i>Synechocystis</i> 6803 achieves complete conversion of only 86% of the assimilated carbon. This high biomass yield was enabled by the reincorporation of the fixed carbons lost in anabolic and photorespiratory pathways in conjunction with flux rerouting through a nondecarboxylating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong> such as phosphoketolase. This reincorporation of lost CO<sub>2</sub> sustains a higher flux through the photorespiratory C2 cycle that fully meets the glycine and serine demands for growth. In accordance with the high carbon efficiency drive, acetyl-coenzyme A was entirely produced using the carbon-efficient phosphoketolase pathway. Comparison of the <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973 flux map with that of <i>Synechocystis</i> 6803 revealed differences in the use of Calvin cycle and photorespiratory pathway <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong>s. The two species used different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong>s for the synthesis of metabolites such as fructose-6-phosphate, glycine, sedoheptulose-7-phosphate, and Ser. These findings allude to a highly carbon-efficient metabolism alongside the fast carbon uptake rate in <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973, which explains its faster growth rate.</p>

RAMOSA1 ENHANCER LOCUS2-Mediated Transcriptional Repression Regulates Vegetative and Reproductive Architecture
<p>Transcriptional repression in multicellular organisms orchestrates dynamic and precise gene expression changes that enable complex developmental patterns. Here, we present phenotypic and molecular characterization of the maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) transcriptional corepressor RAMOSA1 ENHANCER LOCUS2 (REL2), a unique member of the highly conserved TOPLESS (TPL) family. Analysis of single recessive mutations in <i>rel2</i> revealed an array of vegetative and reproductive phenotypes, many related to defects in meristem initiation and maintenance. To better understand how REL2-mediated transcriptional complexes relate to <i>rel2</i> phenotypes, we performed protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion assays and transcriptional profiling of mutant inflorescences, leading to the identification of different maize transcription factors and regulatory pathways that employ REL2 repression to control traits directly impacting maize yields. In addition, we used our REL2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion data to catalog conserved repression motifs present on REL2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ors and showed that two of these, RLFGV- and DLN-type motifs, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong> with the C-terminal WD40 domain of REL2 rather than the N terminus, which is known to bind LxLxL EAR motifs. These findings establish that the WD40 domain of TPL family proteins is an independent protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion surface that may work together with the N-terminal domain to allow the formation of large macromolecular complexes of functionally related transcription factors.</p>

Digital Imaging Combined with Genome-Wide Association Mapping Links Loci to Plant-Pathogen Interaction Traits
<p>Plant resistance to generalist pathogens with broad host ranges, such as <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> (<i>Botrytis</i>), is typically quantitative and highly polygenic. Recent studies have begun to elucidate the molecular genetic basis of plant-pathogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions using commonly measured traits, including lesion size and/or pathogen biomass. However, with the advent of digital imaging and high-throughput phenomics, there are a large number of additional traits available to study quantitative resistance. In this study, we used high-throughput digital imaging analysis to investigate previously poorly characterized visual traits of plant-pathogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions related to disease resistance using the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>)/<i>Botrytis</i> pathosystem. From a large collection of visual lesion trait measurements, we focused on color, shape, and size to test how these aspects of the Arabidopsis/<i>Botrytis</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion are genetically related. Through genome-wide association mapping in Arabidopsis, we show that lesion color and shape are genetically separable traits associated with plant disease resistance. Moreover, by employing defined mutants in 23 candidate genes identified from the genome-wide association mapping, we demonstrate links between loci and each of the different plant-pathogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion traits. These results expand our understanding of the functional mechanisms driving plant disease resistance.</p>

Protein Carbonylation and Glycation in Legume Nodules
<p>Nitrogen fixation is an agronomically and environmentally important process catalyzed by bacterial nitrogenase within legume root nodules. These unique symbiotic organs have high metabolic rates and produce large amounts of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reactiv</span></strong>e oxygen species that may modify proteins irreversibly. Here, we examined two types of oxidative posttranslational modifications of nodule proteins: carbonylation, which occurs by direct oxidation of certain amino acids or by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reactiv</span></strong>e aldehydes arising from cell membrane lipid peroxides; and glycation, which results from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong> of lysine and arginine residues with reducing sugars or their autooxidation products. We used a strategy based on the enrichment of carbonylated peptides by affinity chromatography followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify 369 oxidized proteins in bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>) nodules. Of these, 238 corresponded to plant proteins and 131 to bacterial proteins. Lipid peroxidation products induced most carbonylation sites. This study also revealed that carbonylation has major effects on two key nodule proteins. Metal-catalyzed oxidation caused the inactivation of malate dehydrogenase and the aggregation of leghemoglobin. In addition, numerous glycated proteins were identified in vivo, including three key nodule proteins: sucrose synthase, glutamine synthetase, and glutamate synthase. Label-free quantification identified 10 plant proteins and 18 bacterial proteins as age-specifically glycated. Overall, our results suggest that the selective carbonylation or glycation of crucial proteins involved in nitrogen metabolism, transcriptional regulation, and signaling may constitute a mechanism to control cell metabolism and nodule senescence.</p>

DAWDLE Interacts with DICER-LIKE Proteins to Mediate Small RNA Biogenesis
<p>DAWDLE (DDL) is a conserved forkhead-associated (FHA) domain-containing protein with essential roles in plant development and immunity. It acts in the biogenesis of microRNAs (miRNAs) and endogenous small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which regulate gene expression at the transcriptional and/or posttranscriptional levels. However, the functional mechanism of DDL and its impact on exogenous siRNAs remain elusive. Here, we report that DDL is required for the biogenesis of siRNAs derived from sense transgenes and inverted-repeat transgenes. Furthermore, we show that a mutation in the FHA domain of DDL disrupts the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion of DDL with DICER-LIKE1 (DCL1), which is the enzyme that catalyzes miRNA maturation from primary miRNA transcripts (pri-miRNAs), resulting in impaired pri-miRNA processing. Moreover, we demonstrate that DDL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>s with DCL3, which is a DCL1 homolog responsible for siRNA production, and this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion is crucial for optimal DCL3 activity.

Potato Mop-Top Virus Co-Opts the Stress Sensor HIPP26 for Long-Distance Movement
<p>Virus movement proteins facilitate virus entry into the vascular system to initiate systemic infection. The potato mop-top virus (PMTV) movement protein, TGB1, is involved in long-distance movement of both viral ribonucleoprotein complexes and virions. Here, our analysis of TGB1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions with host <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> proteins revealed an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion with a member of the heavy metal-associated isoprenylated plant protein family, HIPP26, which acts as a plasma membrane-to-nucleus signal during abiotic stress. We found that knockdown of <i>NbHIPP26</i> expression inhibited virus long-distance movement but did not affect cell-to-cell movement. Drought and PMTV infection up-regulated <i>NbHIPP26</i> gene expression, and PMTV infection protected plants from drought. In addition, <i>NbHIPP26</i> promoter-reporter fusions revealed vascular tissue-specific expression. Mutational and biochemical analyses indicated that NbHIPP26 subcellular localization at the plasma membrane and plasmodesmata was mediated by lipidation (<i>S</i>-acylation and prenylation), as nonlipidated NbHIPP26 was predominantly in the nucleus. Notably, coexpression of NbHIPP26 with TGB1 resulted in a similar nuclear accumulation of NbHIPP26. TGB1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ed with the carboxyl-terminal CVVM (prenyl) domain of NbHIPP26, and bimolecular fluorescence complementation revealed that the TGB1-HIPP26 complex localized to microtubules and accumulated in the nucleolus, with little signal at the plasma membrane or plasmodesmata. These data support a mechanism where <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion with TGB1 negates or reverses NbHIPP26 lipidation, thus releasing membrane-associated NbHIPP26 and redirecting it via microtubules to the nucleus, thereby activating the drought stress response and facilitating virus long-distance movement.</p>

A Violaxanthin Deepoxidase Interacts with a Viral Suppressor of RNA Silencing to Inhibit Virus Amplification
<p>RNA silencing plays a critical role against viral infection. To counteract this antiviral silencing, viruses have evolved various RNA silencing suppressors. Meanwhile, plants have evolved counter-counter defense strategies against RNA silencing suppression (RSS). In this study, the violaxanthin deepoxidase protein of maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), ZmVDE, was shown to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong> specifically with the helper component-proteinase (HC-Pro; a viral RNA silencing suppressor) of <i>Sugarcane mosaic virus</i> (SCMV) via its mature protein region by yeast two-hybrid assay, which was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> cells. It was demonstrated that amino acids 101 to 460 in HC-Pro and the amino acid glutamine-292 in ZmVDE mature protein were essential for this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion. The mRNA levels of <i>ZmVDE</i> were down-regulated 75% to 65% at an early stage of SCMV infection. Interestingly, ZmVDE, which normally localized in the chloroplasts and cytoplasm, could relocalize to HC-Pro-containing aggregate bodies in the presence of HC-Pro alone or SCMV infection. In addition, ZmVDE could attenuate the RSS activity of HC-Pro in a specific protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion-dependent manner. Subsequently, transient silencing of the <i>ZmVDE</i> gene facilitated SCMV RNA and coat protein accumulation. Taken together, our results suggest that ZmVDE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>s with SCMV HC-Pro and attenuates its RSS activity, contributing to decreased SCMV accumulation. This study demonstrates that a host factor can be involved in secondary defense responses against viral infection in monocot plants.</p>

A dust-enshrouded tidal disruption event with a resolved radio jet in a galaxy merger
<p>Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are transient flares produced when a star is ripped apart by the gravitational field of a supermassive black hole (SMBH). We have observed a transient source in the western nucleus of the merging galaxy pair Arp 299 that radiated >1.5 × 10<sup>52</sup> erg at infrared and radio wavelengths but was not luminous at optical or x-ray wavelengths. We interpret this as a TDE with much of its emission reradiated at infrared wavelengths by dust. Efficient reprocessing by dense gas and dust may explain the difference between theoretical predictions and observed luminosities of TDEs. The radio observations resolve an expanding and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deceler</span></strong>ating jet, probing the jet formation and evolution around a SMBH.</p>

Ascending flight and decelerating vertical glides in Anna's hummingbirds
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> During rapid ascending flights, Anna's hummingbirds exert near-maximal power expenditure, and then <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deceler</span></strong>ate by folding their wings over the body to adopt a ballistic posture.</p>

Modulation of joint and limb mechanical work in walk-to-run transition steps in humans
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> Horizontal limb work at the hip characterizes fast walk-to-run transitions, whereas vertical knee-derived limb work occurs in slow walk-to-run transitions. Input of mechanical work is necessary in the walk-to-run transition even when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deceler</span></strong>ating.</p>

The use of the distal radius and ulna classification for the prediction of growth
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We report the use of the distal radius and ulna (DRU) classification   for the prediction of peak growth (PG) and growth cessation (GC)   in 777 patients with idiopathic scoliosis. We compare this classification   with other commonly used parameters of maturity.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The following data were extracted from the patients’ records   and radiographs: chronological age, body height (BH), arm span (AS),   date of menarche, Risser sign, DRU grade and status of the phalangeal   and metacarpal physes. The mean rates of growth were recorded according   to each parameter of maturity. PG was defined as the summit of the curve   and GC as the plateau in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deceler</span></strong>ation of growth. The rates of growth   at PG and GC were used for analysis using receiver operating characteristic   (ROC) curves to determine the strength and cutoff values of the   parameters of growth.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The most specific grades for PG using the DRU classification   were radial grade 6 and ulnar grade 5, and for GC were radial grade   9 and ulnar grade 7. The DRU classification spanned both PG and   GC, enabling better prediction of these clinically relevant stages   than other methods. The rate of PG (≥ 0.7 cm/month) and GC (≤ 0.15   cm/month) was the same for girls and boys, in BH and AS measurements.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This is the first study to note that the DRU classification can   predict both PG and GC, providing evidence that it may aid the management   of patients with idiopathic scoliosis.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2016;98-B:1689–96.</p></sec>

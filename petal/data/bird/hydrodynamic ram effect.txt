Bone penetration of intravenous flucloxacillin and gentamicin as antibiotic prophylaxis during total hip and knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To investigate the bone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">penetr</span></strong>ation of intravenous antibiotic   prophylaxis with flucloxacillin and gentamicin during hip and knee   arthroplasty, and their efficacy against <i>Staphylococcus</i> (<i>S.</i>) <i>aureus</i> and <i>S.   epidermidis</i>.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Bone samples from the femoral head, neck and acetabulum were   collected from 18 patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA)   and from the femur and tibia in 21 patients during total knee arthroplasty   (TKA). The concentration of both antibiotics in the samples was   analysed using high performance liquid chromatography. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">penetr</span></strong>ation   was expressed as a percentage of venous blood concentration.

Nocebo effects can make you feel pain
<p>The mysterious phenomenon known as the nocebo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> describes negative expectancies. This is in contrast to positive expectancies that trigger placebo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s (<i>1</i>). In evolutionary terms, nocebo and placebo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s coexist to favor perceptual mechanisms that anticipate threat and dangerous events (nocebo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s) and promote appetitive and safety behaviors (placebo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s). In randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials, patients that receive placebos often report side <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s (nocebos) that are similar to those experienced by patients that receive the investigational treatment (<i>2</i>). Information provided during the informed consent process and divulgence of adverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s contribute to nocebo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s in clinical trials (<i>1</i>). Nocebo (and placebo) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s engage a complex set of neural circuits in the central nervous system that modulate the perception of touch, pressure, pain, and temperature (<i>1</i>, <i>3</i>, <i>4</i>). Commercial features of drugs such as price and labeling influence placebos (<i>5</i>, <i>6</i>). On page 105 of this issue, Tinnermann <i>et al.</i> (<i>7</i>) show that price also influences nocebo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s.</p>

Reducing food’s environmental impacts through producers and consumers
<p>Food’s environmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>s are created by millions of diverse producers. To identify solutions that are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive under this heterogeneity, we consolidated data covering five environmental indicators; 38,700 farms; and 1600 processors, packaging types, and retailers. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong> can vary 50-fold among producers of the same product, creating substantial mitigation opportunities. However, mitigation is complicated by trade-offs, multiple ways for producers to achieve low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>s, and interactions throughout the supply chain. Producers have limits on how far they can reduce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>s. Most strikingly, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>s of the lowest-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong> animal products typically exceed those of vegetable substitutes, providing new evidence for the importance of dietary change. Cumulatively, our findings support an approach where producers monitor their own <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>s, flexibly meet environmental targets by choosing from multiple practices, and communicate their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>s to consumers.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Xylem Sap Surface Tension May Be Crucial for Hydraulic Safety
<p>The surface tension (γ) of xylem sap plays a key role in stabilizing air-water interfaces at the pits between water- and gas-filled conduits to avoid air seeding at low water potentials. We studied seasonal changes in xylem sap γ in <i>Picea abies</i> and <i>Pinus mugo</i> growing at the alpine timberline. We analyzed their vulnerability to drought-induced embolism using solutions of different γ and estimated the potential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of seasonal changes in γ on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic vulnerability. In both species, xylem sap γ showed distinct seasonal courses between about 50 and 68 m<sc>n</sc> m<sup>−1</sup>. Solutions with low γ caused higher vulnerability to drought-induced xylem embolism. The water potential at 50% loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductivity in <i>P. abies</i> and <i>P. mugo</i> was −3.35 and −3.86 MPa at γ of 74 m<sc>n</sc> m<sup>−1</sup> but −2.11 and −2.09 MPa at 45 m<sc>n</sc> m<sup>−1</sup>. This indicates up to about 1 MPa seasonal variation in 50% loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductivity. The results revealed pronounced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of changes in xylem sap γ on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic safety of trees in situ. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s also are relevant in vulnerability analyses, where the use of standard solutions with high γ overestimates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic safety. Thus, γ should be considered carefully in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic studies.</p>

Combined effects of defoliation and water stress on pine growth and non-structural carbohydrates
<p>Climate change is expected to increase both pest insect damage and the occurrence of severe drought. There is therefore a need to better understand the combined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of biotic and abiotic damage on tree growth in order to predict the multi-factorial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of climate change on forest ecosystem productivity. Indeed, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of stress interactions on tree growth is an increasingly important topic that greatly lacks experiments and data, and it is unlikely that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong> of combined stresses can be extrapolated from the outcomes of studies that focused on a single stress. We developed an original manipulative study under real field conditions where we applied artificial defoliation and induced water stress on 10-year-old (∼10 m high) maritime pine trees (<i>Pinus pinaster</i> Ait.). Tree response to combined stresses was quantitatively assessed following tree secondary growth and carbohydrate pools. Such a design allowed us to address the crucial question of combined stresses on trees under stand conditions, sharing soil supplies with neighboring trees. Our initial hypotheses were that (i) moderate defoliation can limit the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong> of water stress on tree growth through reduced transpiration demand by a tree canopy partly defoliated and that (ii) defoliation results in reduced non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) pools, affecting tree tolerance to drought. Our results showed additive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of defoliation and water stress on tree growth and contradict our initial hypothesis. Indeed, under stand conditions, we found that partial defoliation does not limit the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong> of water stress through reduced transpiration. Our study also highlighted that, even if NSC in all organs were affected by defoliation, tree response to water stress was not triggered. We found that stem NSC were maintained or increased during the entire growing season, supporting literature-based hypotheses such as an active maintenance of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic system or another limiting resource for tree growth under defoliation. We also observed a significant decrease in root carbohydrates, which suggests a shift in the root carbon balance under defoliation. The decrease in carbohydrate supply under defoliation may not counterbalance the carbon use for mineral and water uptakes or a translocation to other tissues.</p>

Cost effectiveness of patellofemoral <i>versus</i> total knee arthroplasty in younger patients
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Patellofemoral arthroplasty (PFA) has experienced significant   improvements in implant survivorship with second generation designs.   This has renewed interest in PFA as an alternative to total knee   arthroplasty (TKA) for younger active patients with isolated patellofemoral   osteoarthritis (PF OA). We analysed the cost-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>iveness of PFA <i>versus</i> TKA   for the management of isolated PF OA in the United States-based   population.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We used a Markov transition state model to compare cost-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>iveness   between PFA and TKA. Simulated patients were aged 60 (base case)   and 50 years. Lifetime costs (2015 United States dollars), quality-adjusted   life year (QALY) gains and incremental cost-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>iveness ratio   (ICER) were calculated from a healthcare payer perspective. Annual rates   of revision were derived from the National Joint Registry for England,   Wales, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man. Deterministic and probabilistic   sensitivity analysis was performed for all parameters against a   $50 000/QALY willingness to pay. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>PFA was more expensive ($49 811 <i>versus</i> $46 632)   but more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive (14.3 QALYs <i>versus</i> 13.3 QALYs)   over a lifetime horizon. The ICER associated with the additional   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>iveness of PFA was $3097. The model was mainly sensitive to utility   values, with PFA remaining cost-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive when its utility exceeded   that of TKA by at least 1.0%. PFA provided incremental benefits   at no increased cost when annual rates of revision decreased by   24.5%. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Recent improvements in rates of implant of survival have made   PFA an economically beneficial joint-preserving procedure in younger   patients, delaying TKA until implant failure or tibiofemoral OA   progression. The present study quantified the minimum required marginal   benefit for PFA to be cost-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive compared with TKA and identified survivorship   targets for PFA to become both less expensive and more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive.

Antibody-Mediated Inhibition of Tspan12 Ameliorates Vasoproliferative Retinopathy Through Suppression of β-Catenin Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Anti-angiogenic biologicals represent an important concept for the treatment of vasoproliferative diseases. However, the need for continued treatment, the presence of nonresponders, and the risk of long-term side <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s limit the success of existing therapeutic agents. Although Tspan12 has been shown to regulate retinal vascular development, nothing is known about its involvement in neovascular disease and its potential as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of vasoproliferative diseases.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Rodent models of retinal neovascular disease, including the mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy and the very low density lipoprotein receptor knockout mouse model were analyzed for Tspan/β-catenin regulation. Screening of a phage display of a human combinatorial antibody (Ab) library was used for the development of a high-affinity Ab against Tspan12. Therapeutic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of the newly developed Ab on vascular endothelial cells were tested in vitro and in vivo in the oxygen-induced retinopathy and very low density lipoprotein receptor knockout mouse model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The newly developed anti-Tspan12 Ab exhibited potent inhibitory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s on endothelial cell migration and tube formation. Mechanistic studies confirmed that the Ab inhibited the interaction between Tspan12 and Frizzled-4 and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ively modulates β-catenin levels and target genes in vascular endothelial cells. Tspan12/β-catenin signaling was activated in response to acute and chronic stress in the oxygen-induced retinopathy and very low density lipoprotein receptor mouse model of proliferative retinopathy. Intravitreal application of the Ab showed significant therapeutic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s in both models without inducing negative side <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s on retina function. Moreover, combined intravitreal injection of the Ab with a known vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor, Aflibercept, resulted in significant enhancement of the therapeutic efficacy of each monotherapy. Combination therapy with the Tspan12 blocking antibody can be used to reduce anti-vascular endothelial growth factor doses, thus decreasing the risk of long-term off-target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Tspan12/β-catenin signaling is critical for the progression of vasoproliferative disease.

The Cost-Effectiveness of Antibiotic Prophylaxis for Patients at Risk of Infective Endocarditis

Health service costs and benefits (measured as quality-adjusted life-years) were estimated. Rates of IE before and after the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance were available to estimate prophylactic efficacy. AP adverse event rates were derived from recent UK data, and resource implications were based on English Hospital Episode Statistics.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>AP was less costly and more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive than no AP for all patients at risk of IE.

AP was even more cost-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive in patients at high risk of IE. Only a marginal reduction in annual IE rates (1.44 cases in high-risk and 33 cases in all at-risk patients) would be required for AP to be considered cost-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive at £20 000 ($26 600) per quality-adjusted life-year. Annual cost savings of £5.5 to £8.2 million ($7.3–$10.9 million) and health gains >2600 quality-adjusted life-years could be achieved from reinstating AP in England.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>AP is cost-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive for preventing IE, particularly in those at high risk.

Simulated browsing affects leaf shedding phenology and litter quality of oak and birch saplings
<p>Herbivore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s on leaf litter can have a strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong> on ecosystem nutrient cycling. Although such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s are well described for insect herbivory, research on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>s of browsing by mammalian herbivores on leaf litter dynamics and nutrient cycling has been more limited, particularly at the level of the individual plant. Clipping treatments (66% shoot removal twice, plus unclipped) were applied to analyse the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of browsing on the phenology (start date and pattern of leaf shedding) and leaf litter quality (nitrogen (N), soluble sugars, starch and total non-structural carbohydrate concentrations, plus C : N ratios) of <i>Betula pubescens</i> Ehrh. and <i>Quercus petraea</i> [Matt.] Liebl. saplings. Clipping decreased leaf litter biomass and delayed leaf senescence and shedding, but did not change the phenological timing of litterfall between senescence and shedding. The quality of leaf litter of both species was increased by simulated browsing, through an increase in N and carbohydrate concentrations (mainly soluble sugars) and a decreased C : N ratio. This is the first evidence we are aware of that browsing may cause changes in leaf shedding phenology, delaying the process without altering its pattern. Our results also indicate that simulated browsing increases the quality of leaf litter. However, the potential positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of browsing on N cycling through litter quality may be offset by its negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong> on the amount of N shed per tree.</p>

Quantifying the evolution of individual scientific impact
<p>Despite the frequent use of numerous quantitative indicators to gauge the professional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong> of a scientist, little is known about how scientific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong> emerges and evolves in time. Here, we quantify the changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong> and productivity throughout a career in science, finding that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>, as measured by influential publications, is distributed randomly within a scientist’s sequence of publications.

Potent Thrombolytic Effect of <i>N</i>-Acetylcysteine on Arterial Thrombi
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Platelet cross-linking during arterial thrombosis involves von Willebrand Factor (VWF) multimers. Therefore, proteolysis of VWF appears promising to disaggregate platelet-rich thrombi and restore vessel patency in acute thrombotic disorders such as ischemic stroke, acute coronary syndrome, or acute limb ischemia. <i>N</i>-Acetylcysteine (NAC, a clinically approved mucolytic drug) can reduce intrachain disulfide bonds in large polymeric proteins. In the present study, we postulated that NAC might cleave the VWF multimers inside occlusive thrombi, thereby leading to their dissolution and arterial recanalization.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Experimental models of thrombotic stroke induced by either intra-arterial thrombin injection or ferric chloride application followed by measurement of cerebral blood flow using a combination of laser Doppler flowmetry and MRI were performed to uncover the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of NAC on arterial thrombi. To investigate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of NAC on larger vessels, we also performed ferric chloride–induced carotid artery thrombosis. In vitro experiments were performed to study the molecular bases of NAC thrombolytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>, including platelet aggregometry, platelet-rich thrombi lysis assays, thromboelastography (ROTEM), and high-shear VWF string formation using microfluidic devices. We also investigated the putative prohemorrhagic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of NAC in a mouse model of intracranial hemorrhage induced by in situ collagenase type VII injection.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We demonstrated that intravenous NAC administration promotes lysis of arterial thrombi that are resistant to conventional approaches such as recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator, direct thrombin inhibitors, and antiplatelet treatments. Through in vitro and in vivo experiments, we provide evidence that the molecular target underlying the thrombolytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of NAC is principally the VWF that cross-link platelets in arterial thrombi. Coadministration of NAC and a nonpeptidic GpIIb/IIIa inhibitor further improved its thrombolytic efficacy, essentially by accelerating thrombus dissolution and preventing rethrombosis. Thus, in a new large-vessel thromboembolic stroke model in mice, this cotreatment significantly improved ischemic lesion size and neurological outcome. It is important to note that NAC did not worsen hemorrhagic stroke outcome, suggesting that it exerts thrombolytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s without significantly impairing normal hemostasis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We provide evidence that NAC is an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive and safe alternative to currently available antithrombotic agents to restore vessel patency after arterial occlusion.</p></sec>

Interferon Regulatory Factor 4 Inhibits Neointima Formation by Engaging Krüppel-Like Factor 4 Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The mechanisms underlying neointima formation remain unclear. Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), which are key innate immune regulators, play important roles in cardiometabolic diseases. However, the function of IRF4 in arterial restenosis is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>IRF4 expression was first detected in human and mouse restenotic arteries. Then, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of IRF4 on neointima formation were evaluated with universal IRF4-deficient mouse and rat carotid artery injury models. We performed immunostaining to identify IRF4-expressing cells in the lesions. Smooth muscle cell (SMC)–specific IRF4-knockout (KO) and -transgenic (TG) mice were generated to evaluate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of SMC-IRF4 on neointima formation. We used microarray, bioinformatics analysis, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay to identify the downstream signals of IRF4 and to verify the targets in vitro. We compared SMC-IRF4-KO/Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4)–TG mice with SMC-IRF4-KO mice and SMC-specific IRF4-TG/KLF4-KO mice with SMC-specific IRF4-TG mice to investigate whether the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of IRF4 on neointima formation is KLF4-dependent. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of IRF4 on SMC phenotype switching was also evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>IRF4 expression in both the human and mouse restenotic arteries is eventually downregulated. Universal IRF4 ablation potentiates neointima formation in both mice and rats. Immunostaining indicated that IRF4 was expressed primarily in SMCs in restenotic arteries. After injury, SMC-IRF4-KO mice developed a thicker neointima than control mice. This change was accompanied by increased SMC proliferation and migration.

Evidence for Hydraulic Vulnerability Segmentation and Lack of Xylem Refilling under Tension
<p>The vascular system of grapevine (<i>Vitis</i> spp.) has been reported as being highly vulnerable, even though grapevine regularly experiences seasonal drought. Consequently, stomata would remain open below water potentials that would generate a high loss of stem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductivity via xylem embolism. This situation would necessitate daily cycles of embolism repair to restore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic function. However, a more parsimonious explanation is that some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic techniques are prone to artifacts in species with long vessels, leading to the overestimation of vulnerability. The aim of this study was to provide an unbiased assessment of (1) the vulnerability to drought-induced embolism in perennial and annual organs and (2) the ability to refill embolized vessels in two <i>Vitis</i> species X-ray micro-computed tomography observations of intact plants indicated that both <i>Vitis</i> <i>vinifera</i> and <i>Vitis</i> <i>riparia</i> were relatively vulnerable, with the pressure inducing 50% loss of stem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductivity = −1.7 and −1.3 MPa, respectively. In <i>V. vinifera</i>, both the stem and petiole had similar sigmoidal vulnerability curves but differed in pressure inducing 50% loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductivity (−1.7 and −1 MPa for stem and petiole, respectively). Refilling was not observed as long as bulk xylem pressure remained negative (e.g. at the apical part of the plants; −0.11 ± 0.02 MPa) and change in percentage loss of conductivity was 0.02% ± 0.01%. However, positive xylem pressure was observed at the basal part of the plant (0.04 ± 0.01 MPa), leading to a recovery of conductance (change in percentage loss of conductivity = −0.24% ± 0.12%). Our findings provide evidence that grapevine is unable to repair embolized xylem vessels under negative pressure, but its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic vulnerability segmentation provides significant protection of the perennial stem.</p>

Cardioprotective Role of Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells in Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a heterogeneous population of cells that expand in cancer, inflammation, and infection and negatively regulate inflammation and the immune response. Heart failure (HF) is a complex clinical syndrome wherein inflammation induction and incomplete resolution can potentially contribute to HF development and progression. However, the role of MDSCs in HF remains unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The percentage of MDSCs in patients with HF and in mice with pressure overload–induced HF using isoproterenol infusion or transverse aortic constriction (TAC) was detected by flow cytometry. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of MDSCs on isoproterenol- or TAC-induced HF were observed on depleting MDSCs with 5-fluorouracil (50 mg/kg) or gemcitabine (120 mg/kg), transferring purified MDSCs, or enhancing endogenous MDSCs with rapamycin (2 mg·kg<sup>−1</sup>·d<sup>−1</sup>). Hypertrophic markers and inflammatory factors were detected by ELISA, real-time polymerase chain reaction, or Western blot. Cardiac functions were determined by echocardiography and hemodynamic analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The percentage of human leukocyte antigen-D–related (HLA-DR)<sup>−</sup>CD33<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> MDSCs in the blood of patients with HF was significantly increased and positively correlated with disease severity and increased plasma levels of cytokines, including interleukin-6, interleukin-10, and transforming growth factor–β. Furthermore, MDSCs derived from patients with HF inhibited T-cell proliferation and interferon-γ secretion. Similar results were observed in TAC- and isoproterenol-induced HF in mice. Pharmaceutical depletion of MDSCs significantly exacerbated isoproterenol- and TAC-induced pathological cardiac remodeling and inflammation, whereas adoptive transfer of MDSCs prominently rescued isoproterenol- and TAC-induced HF. Consistently, administration of rapamycin significantly increased endogenous MDSCs by suppressing their differentiation and improved isoproterenol- and TAC-induced HF, but MDSC depletion mostly blocked beneficial rapamycin-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s. Mechanistically, MDSC-secreted molecules suppressed isoproterenol-induced hypertrophy and proinflammatory gene expression in cardiomyocytes in a coculture system. Neutralization of interleukin-10 blunted both monocytic MDSC- and granulocytic MDSC–mediated anti-inflammatory and antihypertrophic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s, but treatment with a nitric oxide inhibitor only partially blocked the antihypertrophic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of monocytic MDSCs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings revealed a cardioprotective role of MDSCs in HF by their antihypertrophic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s on cardiomyocytes and anti-inflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s through interleukin-10 and nitric oxide.

An empirical study of the wound effect on sap flux density measured with thermal dissipation probes
<p>The insertion of thermal dissipation (TD) sensors on tree stems for sap flux density (SFD) measurements can lead to SFD underestimations due to a wound formation close to the drill hole. However, the wound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> has not been assessed experimentally for this method yet. Here, we propose an empirical approach to investigate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of the wound healing on measured sap flux with TD probes. The approach was performed for both, diffuse-porous (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i> (Linnaeus)) and ring-porous (<i>Quercus petraea</i> (Lieblein)) species. Thermal dissipation probes were installed on different dates along the growing season to document the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of the dynamic wound formation. The trees were cut in autumn and additional sensors were installed in the cut stems, therefore, without potential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of wound development. A range of water pressures was applied to the stem segments and SFDs were simultaneously measured by TD sensors as well as gravimetrically in the laboratory. The formation of wounds around sensors installed in living tree stems led to underestimation of SFD by 21.4 ± 3 and 47.5 ± 3.8% in beech and oak, respectively. The differences between SFD underestimations of diffuse-porous beech and ring-porous oak were, however, not statistically significant. Sensors with 5-, 11- and 22-week-old wounds also showed no significant differences, which implies that the influence of wound formation on SFD estimates was completed within the first few weeks after perforation. These results were confirmed by time courses of SFD measurements in the field. Field SFD values decreased immediately after sensor installation and reached stable values after ~2 weeks with similar underestimations to the ones observed in the laboratory. We therefore propose a feasible approach to correct directly field observations of SFD for potential underestimations due to the wound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>.</p>

Aerosol-driven droplet concentrations dominate coverage and water of oceanic low-level clouds
<p>A lack of reliable estimates of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) aerosols over oceans has severely limited our ability to quantify their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s on cloud properties and extent of cooling by reflecting solar radiation—a key uncertainty in anthropogenic climate forcing. We introduce a methodology for ascribing cloud properties to CCN and isolating the aerosol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s from meteorological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s. Its application showed that for a given meteorology, CCN explains three-fourths of the variability in the radiative cooling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of clouds, mainly through affecting shallow cloud cover and water path. This reveals a much greater sensitivity of cloud radiative forcing to CCN than previously reported, which means too much cooling if incorporated into present climate models. This suggests the existence of compensating aerosol warming <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s yet to be discovered, possibly through deep clouds.</p>

Going with the Flow: Multiscale Insights into the Composite Nature of Water Transport in Roots
<p>As water often limits crop production, a more complete understanding of plant water capture and transport is necessary. Here, we developed MECHA, a mathematical model that computes the flow of water across the root at the scale of walls, membranes, and plasmodesmata of individual cells, and used it to test hypotheses related to root water transport in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). The model uses detailed root anatomical descriptions and a minimal set of experimental cell properties, including the conductivity of plasma membranes, cell walls, and plasmodesmata, which yield quantitative and scale-consistent estimations of water pathways and root radial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductivity (<i>k</i><sub>r</sub>). MECHA revealed that the mainstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic theories derived independently at the cell and root segment scales are compatible only if osmotic potentials within the apoplastic domains are uniform. The results suggested that the convection-diffusion of apoplastic solutes explained most of the offset between estimated <i>k</i><sub>r</sub> in pressure clamp and osmotic experiments, while the contribution of water-filled intercellular spaces was limited. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses quantified the relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong> of cortex and endodermis cell conductivity of plasma membranes on root <i>k</i><sub>r</sub> and suggested that only the latter contributed substantially to <i>k</i><sub>r</sub> due to the composite nature of water flow across roots. The explicit root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic anatomy framework brings insights into contradictory interpretations of experiments from the literature and suggests experiments to efficiently address questions pertaining to root water relations. Its scale consistency opens avenues for cross-scale communication in the world of root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ics.</p>

The Causes of Leaf Hydraulic Vulnerability and Its Influence on Gas Exchange in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>The influence of the dynamics of leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductance (<i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub>) diurnally and during dehydration on stomatal conductance and photosynthesis remains unclear. Using the model species Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> ecotype Columbia-0), we applied a multitiered approach including physiological measurements, high-resolution x-ray microcomputed tomography, and modeling at a range of scales to characterize (1) <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> decline during dehydration; (2) its basis in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductances of leaf xylem and outside-xylem pathways (<i>K</i><sub>ox</sub>); (3) the dependence of its dynamics on irradiance; (4) its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong> on diurnal patterns of stomatal conductance and photosynthetic rate; and (5) its influence on gas exchange and survival under simulated drought regimes. Arabidopsis leaves showed strong vulnerability to dehydration diurnally in both gas exchange and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductance, despite lack of xylem embolism or conduit collapse above the turgor loss point, indicating a pronounced sensitivity of <i>K</i><sub>ox</sub> to dehydration. <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> increased under higher irradiance in well-hydrated leaves across the full range of water potential, but no shift in <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> vulnerability was observed. Modeling indicated that responses to dehydration and irradiance are likely attributable to changes in membrane permeability and that a dynamic <i>K</i><sub>ox</sub> would contribute strongly to stomatal closure, improving performance, survival, and efficient water use during drought. These findings for Columbia-0 provide a baseline for assessing variation across genotypes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic traits and their influence on gas exchange during dehydration.</p>

A Putative Protein <i>O</i>-Fucosyltransferase Facilitates Pollen Tube Penetration through the Stigma<i>–</i>Style Interface
<p>During pollen-pistil interactions in angiosperms, the male gametophyte (pollen) germinates to produce a pollen tube. To fertilize ovules located within the female pistil, the pollen tube must physically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">penetr</span></strong>ate specialized tissues. Whereas the process of pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">penetr</span></strong>ation through the pistil has been anatomically well described, the genetic regulation remains poorly understood. In this study, we identify a novel Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) gene, <i>O-FUCOSYLTRANSFERASE1</i> (<i>AtOFT1</i>), which plays a key role in pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">penetr</span></strong>ation through the stigma-style interface. Semi-in vivo growth assays demonstrate that <i>oft1</i> mutant pollen tubes have a reduced ability to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">penetr</span></strong>ate the stigma-style interface, leading to a nearly 2,000-fold decrease in <i>oft1</i> pollen transmission efficiency and a 5- to 10-fold decreased seed set. We also demonstrate that AtOFT1 is localized to the Golgi apparatus, indicating its potential role in cellular glycosylation events. Finally, we demonstrate that <i>AtOFT1</i> and other similar Arabidopsis genes represent a novel clade of sequences related to metazoan protein <i>O</i>-fucosyltransferases and that mutation of residues that are important for <i>O</i>-fucosyltransferase activity compromises AtOFT1 function in vivo. The results of this study elucidate a physiological function for AtOFT1 in pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">penetr</span></strong>ation through the stigma-style interface and highlight the potential importance of protein <i>O</i>-glycosylation events in pollen-pistil interactions.</p>

Global Analysis of Gene Expression in Response to Whole-Chromosome Aneuploidy in Hexaploid Wheat
<p>Aneuploidy, a condition of unbalanced chromosome content, represents a large-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> mutation that bears significant relevance to human health and microbe adaptation. As such, extensive studies of aneuploidy have been conducted in unicellular model organisms and cancer cells. Aneuploidy also frequently is associated with plant polyploidization, but its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong> on gene expression and its relevance to polyploid genome evolution/functional innovation remain largely unknown. Here, we used a panel of diverse types of whole-chromosome aneuploidy of hexaploid wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>), all under the common genetic background of cv Chinese Spring, to systemically investigate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong> of aneuploidy on genome-, subgenome-, and chromosome-wide gene expression. Compared with prior findings in haploid or diploid aneuploid systems, we unravel additional and novel features of alteration in global gene expression resulting from the two major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>s of aneuploidy, cis- and trans-regulation, as well as dosage compensation. We show that the expression-altered genes map evenly along each chromosome, with no evidence for coregulating aggregated expression domains. However, chromosomes and subgenomes in hexaploid wheat are unequal in their responses to aneuploidy with respect to the number of genes being dysregulated. Strikingly, homeologous chromosomes do not differ from nonhomologous chromosomes in terms of aneuploidy-induced trans-acting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s, suggesting that the three constituent subgenomes of hexaploid wheat are largely uncoupled at the transcriptional level of gene regulation. Together, our findings shed new insights into the functional interplay between homeologous chromosomes and interactions between subgenomes in hexaploid wheat, which bear implications to further our understanding of allopolyploid genome evolution and efforts in breeding new allopolyploid crops.</p>

Outside-Xylem Vulnerability, Not Xylem Embolism, Controls Leaf Hydraulic Decline during Dehydration<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[CC-BY]</sup></xref>
<p>Leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic supply is crucial to maintaining open stomata for CO<sub>2</sub> capture and plant growth. During drought-induced dehydration, the leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductance (<i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub>) declines, which contributes to stomatal closure and, eventually, to leaf death. Previous studies have tended to attribute the decline of <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> to embolism in the leaf vein xylem. We visualized at high resolution and quantified experimentally the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic vulnerability of xylem and outside-xylem pathways and modeled their respective influences on plant water transport. Evidence from all approaches indicated that the decline of <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> during dehydration arose first and foremost due to the vulnerability of outside-xylem tissues. In vivo x-ray microcomputed tomography of dehydrating leaves of four diverse angiosperm species showed that, at the turgor loss point, only small fractions of leaf vein xylem conduits were embolized, and substantial xylem embolism arose only under severe dehydration. Experiments on an expanded set of eight angiosperm species showed that outside-xylem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic vulnerability explained 75% to 100% of <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> decline across the range of dehydration from mild water stress to beyond turgor loss point. Spatially explicit modeling of leaf water transport pointed to a role for reduced membrane conductivity consistent with published data for cells and tissues. Plant-scale modeling suggested that outside-xylem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic vulnerability can protect the xylem from tensions that would induce embolism and disruption of water transport under mild to moderate soil and atmospheric droughts. These findings pinpoint outside-xylem tissues as a central locus for the control of leaf and plant water transport during progressive drought.</p>

The Genotype–Phenotype Map of Yeast Complex Traits: Basic Parameters and the Role of Natural Selection
<p>Most phenotypic traits are controlled by many genes, but a global picture of the genotype–phenotype map (GPM) is lacking. For example, in no species do we know generally how many genes affect a trait and how large these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s are. It is also unclear to what extent GPMs are shaped by natural selection. Here we address these fundamental questions using the reverse genetic data of 220 morphological traits in 4,718 budding yeast strains, each of which lacks a nonessential gene. We show that 1) the proportion of genes affecting a trait varies from <1% to >30%, averaging 6%, 2) most traits are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>ed by many more small-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> genes than large-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> genes, and 3) the mean <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of all nonessential genes on a trait decreases precipitously as the estimated importance of the trait to fitness increases. An analysis of 3,116 yeast gene expression traits in 754 gene-deletion strains reveals a similar pattern. These findings illustrate the power of genome-wide reverse genetics in genotype–phenotype mapping, uncover an enormous range of genetic complexity of phenotypic traits, and suggest that the GPM of cellular organisms has been shaped by natural selection for mutational robustness.</p>

<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To validate the English language Forgotten Joint Score-12 (FJS-12)   as a tool to evaluate the outcome of hip and knee arthroplasty in   a United Kingdom population.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>All patients undergoing surgery between January and August 2014   were eligible for inclusion. Prospective data were collected from   205 patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA) and 231 patients   undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Outcomes were assessed   with the FJS-12 and the Oxford Hip and Knee Scores (OHS, OKS) pre-operatively,   then at six and 12 months post-operatively. Internal consistency,   convergent validity, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> size, relative validity and ceiling   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s were determined.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Data for the TKA and THA patients showed high internal consistency   for the FJS-12 (Cronbach α = 0.97 in TKAs, 0.98 in THAs). Convergent   validity with the Oxford Scores was high (r = 0.85 in TKAs, r =   0.79 for THAs). From six to 12 months, the change was higher for   the FJS-12 than for the OHS in THA patients (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> size d = 0.21 <i>versus</i> -0.03). Ceiling   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s at one-year follow-up were low for the FJS-12 with just   3.9% (TKA) and 8.8% (THA) of patients achieving the best possible   score.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The FJS-12 has strong measurement properties in terms of validity,   internal consistency and sensitivity to change in TKA and THA patients.

Improving Assessment of Drug Safety Through Proteomics
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Early detection of adverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of novel therapies and understanding of their mechanisms could improve the safety and efficiency of drug development. We have retrospectively applied large-scale proteomics to blood samples from ILLUMINATE (Investigation of Lipid Level Management to Understand its Impact in Atherosclerotic Events), a trial of torcetrapib (a cholesterol ester transfer protein inhibitor), that involved 15 067 participants at high cardiovascular risk. ILLUMINATE was terminated at a median of 550 days because of significant absolute increases of 1.2% in cardiovascular events and 0.4% in mortality with torcetrapib. The aims of our analysis were to determine whether a proteomic analysis might reveal biological mechanisms responsible for these harmful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s and whether harmful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of torcetrapib could have been detected early in the ILLUMINATE trial with proteomics.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A nested case-control analysis of paired plasma samples at baseline and at 3 months was performed in 249 participants assigned to torcetrapib plus atorvastatin and 223 participants assigned to atorvastatin only. Within each treatment arm, cases with events were matched to controls 1:1. Main outcomes were a survey of 1129 proteins for discovery of biological pathways altered by torcetrapib and a 9-protein risk score validated to predict myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, or death.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Plasma concentrations of 200 proteins changed significantly with torcetrapib. Their pathway analysis revealed unexpected and widespread changes in immune and inflammatory functions, as well as changes in endocrine systems, including in aldosterone function and glycemic control. At baseline, 9-protein risk scores were similar in the 2 treatment arms and higher in participants with subsequent events. At 3 months, the absolute 9-protein derived risk increased in the torcetrapib plus atorvastatin arm compared with the atorvastatin-only arm by 1.08% (<i>P</i>=0.0004). Thirty-seven proteins changed in the direction of increased risk of 49 proteins previously associated with cardiovascular and mortality risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Heretofore unknown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of torcetrapib were revealed in immune and inflammatory functions. A protein-based risk score predicted harm from torcetrapib within just 3 months. A protein-based risk assessment embedded within a large proteomic survey may prove to be useful in the evaluation of therapies to prevent harm to patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

A Novel α-Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide Analogue Protects Against End-Organ Damage in Experimental Hypertension, Cardiac Hypertrophy, and Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Research into the therapeutic potential of α-calcitonin gene–related peptide (α-CGRP) has been limited because of its peptide nature and short half-life. Here, we evaluate whether a novel potent and long-lasting (<i>t</i><sub>½</sub> ≥7 hours) acylated α-CGRP analogue (αAnalogue) could alleviate and reverse cardiovascular disease in 2 distinct murine models of hypertension and heart failure in vivo.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The ability of the αAnalogue to act selectively via the CGRP pathway was shown in skin by using a CGRP receptor antagonist. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of the αAnalogue on angiotensin II–induced hypertension was investigated over 14 days. Blood pressure was measured by radiotelemetry. The ability of the αAnalogue to modulate heart failure was studied in an abdominal aortic constriction model of murine cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure over 5 weeks. Extensive ex vivo analysis was performed via RNA analysis, Western blot, and histology.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The angiotensin II–induced hypertension was attenuated by cotreatment with the αAnalogue (50 nmol·kg<sup>–1</sup>·d<sup>–1</sup>, SC, at a dose selected for lack of long-term hypotensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s at baseline). The αAnalogue protected against vascular, renal, and cardiac dysfunction, characterized by reduced hypertrophy and biomarkers of fibrosis, remodeling, inflammation, and oxidative stress. In a separate study, the αAnalogue reversed angiotensin II–induced hypertension and associated vascular and cardiac damage. The αAnalogue was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive over 5 weeks in a murine model of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. It preserved heart function, assessed by echocardiography, while protecting against adverse cardiac remodeling and apoptosis. Moreover, treatment with the αAnalogue was well tolerated with neither signs of desensitization nor behavioral changes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These findings, in 2 distinct models, provide the first evidence for the therapeutic potential of a stabilized αAnalogue, by mediating (1) antihypertensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s, (2) attenuating cardiac remodeling, and (3) increasing angiogenesis and cell survival to protect against and limit damage associated with the progression of cardiovascular diseases. This indicates the therapeutic potential of the CGRP pathway and the possibility that this injectable CGRP analogue may be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive in cardiac disease.</p></sec>

Prospective Study of Adenosine on Atrioventricular Nodal Conduction in Pediatric and Young Adult Patients After Heart Transplantation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Supraventricular tachycardia is common after heart transplantation. Adenosine, the standard therapy for treating supraventricular tachycardia in children and adults without transplantation, is relatively contraindicated after transplantation because of a presumed risk of prolonged atrioventricular block in denervated hearts. This study tested whether adenosine caused prolonged asystole after transplantation and if it was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive in blocking atrioventricular nodal conduction in these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This was a single-center prospective clinical study including healthy heart transplant recipients 6 months to 25 years of age presenting for routine cardiac catheterization during 2015 to 2016. After catheterization, a transvenous pacing catheter was placed and adenosine was given following a dose-escalation protocol until atrioventricular block was achieved. The incidence of clinically significant asystole (≥12 seconds after adenosine) was quantified. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of patient characteristics on adenosine dose required to produce atrioventricular block and duration of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> were also measured.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Eighty patients completed adenosine testing. No patient (0%; 95% confidence interval, 0–3) required rescue ventricular pacing. Atrioventricular block was observed in 77 patients (96%; 95% confidence interval, 89–99). The median longest atrioventricular block was 1.9 seconds (interquartile range, 1.4–3.2 seconds), with a mean duration of adenosine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of 4.3±2.0 seconds. No patient characteristic significantly predicted the adenosine dose to produce atrioventricular block or duration of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>. Results were similar across patient weight categories.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Adenosine induces atrioventricular block in healthy pediatric and young adult heart transplant recipients with minimal risk when low initial doses are used (25 μg/kg; 1.5 mg if ≥60 kg) and therapy is gradually escalated.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Low-Dose Paclitaxel–Coated Versus Uncoated Percutaneous Transluminal Balloon Angioplasty for Femoropopliteal Peripheral Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Numerous studies have reported favorable outcomes using drug-coated balloons (DCBs) for treatment of symptomatic peripheral artery disease of the superficial femoral and popliteal arteries. However, the treatment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> compared with an uncoated balloon has differed greatly among the randomized trials, with better outcomes observed with higher-dose DCBs. This European trial was designed to assess the safety and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>iveness of a next-generation low-dose (2-µg/mm<sup>2</sup> surface dose of paclitaxel) DCB.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This was a prospective, randomized, multicenter, single-blinded trial. Patients were randomized (3:1) to treatment with a low-dose DCB or an uncoated percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) balloon. The primary safety end point was a composite of freedom from device- and procedure-related death through 30 days after the procedure and freedom from target limb major amputation and clinically driven target lesion revascularization through 12 months after the procedure. The primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>iveness end point was primary patency at 12 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Patients were randomized to treatment with a DCB (222 patients, 254 lesions) or uncoated PTA balloon (72 patients, 79 lesions) after successful predilatation. Mean lesion length was 7.2 and 7.1 cm, and 19.2% and 19.0% of lesions represented total occlusions, respectively. The primary safety end point was met, and superiority was demonstrated; freedom from a primary safety event was 94.1% (193 of 205) with DCB and 83.3% (50 of 60) with PTA, for a difference of 10.8% (95% confidence interval, 0.9%–23.0%). The primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>iveness end point was met, and superiority of DCB over PTA was achieved (83.9% [188 of 224] versus 60.6% [40 of 66]; <i>P</i><0.001). Outcomes with DCB were also superior to PTA per the Kaplan-Meier estimate for primary patency (89.0% versus 65.0% at 365 days; log-rank <i>P</i><0.001) and for rates of clinically driven target lesion revascularization (5.9% versus 16.7%; <i>P</i>=0.014).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Superiority with a low-dose DCB for femoropopliteal interventions was demonstrated over PTA for both the safety and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>iveness end points.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

High-Fiber Diet and Acetate Supplementation Change the Gut Microbiota and Prevent the Development of Hypertension and Heart Failure in Hypertensive Mice
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Dietary intake of fruit and vegetables is associated with lower incidence of hypertension, but the mechanisms involved have not been elucidated. Here, we evaluated the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of a high-fiber diet and supplementation with the short-chain fatty acid acetate on the gut microbiota and the prevention of cardiovascular disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Gut microbiome, cardiorenal structure/function, and blood pressure were examined in sham and mineralocorticoid excess–treated mice with a control diet, high-fiber diet, or acetate supplementation. We also determined the renal and cardiac transcriptome of mice treated with the different diets.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We found that high consumption of fiber modified the gut microbiota populations and increased the abundance of acetate-producing bacteria independently of mineralocorticoid excess. Both fiber and acetate decreased gut dysbiosis, measured by the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes, and increased the prevalence of <i>Bacteroides acidifaciens</i>. Compared with mineralocorticoid-excess mice fed a control diet, both high-fiber diet and acetate supplementation significantly reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressures, cardiac fibrosis, and left ventricular hypertrophy. Acetate had similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s and markedly reduced renal fibrosis. Transcriptome analyses showed that the protective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of high fiber and acetate were accompanied by the downregulation of cardiac and renal <i>Egr1</i>, a master cardiovascular regulator involved in cardiac hypertrophy, cardiorenal fibrosis, and inflammation. We also observed the upregulation of a network of genes involved in circadian rhythm in both tissues and downregulation of the renin-angiotensin system in the kidney and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling in the heart.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>A diet high in fiber led to changes in the gut microbiota that played a protective role in the development of cardiovascular disease.

Protective Effects of Ticagrelor on Myocardial Injury After Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor antagonist ticagrelor has been shown to be clinically superior to clopidogrel. Although the underlying mechanisms remain elusive, ticagrelor may exert off-target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s through adenosine-related mechanisms. We aimed to investigate whether ticagrelor reduces myocardial injury to a greater extent than clopidogrel after myocardial infarction (MI) at a similar level of platelet inhibition and to determine the underlying mechanisms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Pigs received the following before MI induction: (1) placebo-control; (2) a loading dose of clopidogrel (600 mg); (3) a loading dose of ticagrelor (180 mg); or (4) a loading dose of ticagrelor followed by an adenosine A1/A2-receptor antagonist [8-(<i>p</i>-sulfophenyl)theophylline, 4 mg/kg intravenous] to determine the potential contribution of adenosine in ticagrelor-related cardioprotection. Animals received the corresponding maintenance doses of the antiplatelet agents during the following 24 hours and underwent 3T-cardiac MRI analysis. Platelet inhibition was monitored by ADP-induced platelet aggregation. In the myocardium, we assessed the expression and activation of proteins known to modulate edema formation, including aquaporin-4 and AMP-activated protein kinase and its downstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ors CD36 and endothelial nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Clopidogrel and ticagrelor exerted a high and consistent antiplatelet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> (68.2% and 62.2% of platelet inhibition, respectively, on challenge with 20 μmol/L ADP) that persisted up to 24 hours post-MI (<i>P</i><0.05). All groups showed comparable myocardial area-at-risk and cardiac worsening after MI induction. 3T-Cardiac MRI analysis revealed that clopidogrel- and ticagrelor-treated animals had a significantly smaller extent of MI than placebo-control animals (15.7 g left ventricle and 12.0 g left ventricle versus 22.8 g left ventricle, respectively). Yet, ticagrelor reduced infarct size to a significantly greater extent than clopidogrel (further 23.5% reduction; <i>P</i>=0.0026), an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> supported by troponin-I assessment and histopathologic analysis (<i>P</i>=0.0021). Furthermore, in comparison with clopidogrel, ticagrelor significantly diminished myocardial edema by 24.5% (<i>P</i>=0.004), which correlated with infarct mass (<i>r</i>=0.73; <i>P</i><0.001). 8-(<i>p</i>-Sulfophenyl)theophylline administration abolished the cardioprotective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of ticagrelor over clopidogrel. At a molecular level, aquaporin-4 expression decreased and the expression and activation of AMP-activated protein kinase signaling and cyclooxygenase-2 increased in the ischemic myocardium of ticagrelor- versus clopidogrel-treated animals (<i>P</i><0.05). These protein changes were not observed in those animals administered the adenosine receptor blocker 8-(<i>p</i>-sulfophenyl)theophylline.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Ticagrelor, beyond its antiplatelet efficacy, exerts cardioprotective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s by reducing necrotic injury and edema formation via adenosine-dependent mechanisms.</p></sec>

Impaired Malate and Fumarate Accumulation Due to the Mutation of the Tonoplast Dicarboxylate Transporter Has Little Effects on Stomatal Behavior
<p>Malate is a central metabolite involved in a multiplicity of plant metabolic pathways, being associated with mitochondrial metabolism and playing significant roles in stomatal movements. Vacuolar malate transport has been characterized at the molecular level and is performed by at least one carrier protein and two channels in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) vacuoles. The absence of the Arabidopsis tonoplast Dicarboxylate Transporter (tDT) in the <i>tdt</i> knockout mutant was associated previously with an impaired accumulation of malate and fumarate in leaves. Here, we investigated the consequences of this lower accumulation on stomatal behavior and photosynthetic capacity as well as its putative metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>s. Neither the stomatal conductance nor the kinetic responses to dark, light, or high CO<sub>2</sub> were highly affected in <i>tdt</i> plants. In addition, we did not observe any <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong> on stomatal aperture following incubation with abscisic acid, malate, or citrate. Furthermore, an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> on photosynthetic capacity was not observed in the mutant lines. However, leaf mitochondrial metabolism was affected in the <i>tdt</i> plants. Levels of the intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle were altered, and increases in both light and dark respiration were observed. We conclude that manipulation of the tonoplastic organic acid transporter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>ed mitochondrial metabolism, while the overall stomatal and photosynthetic capacity were unaffected.</p>

Root Tip Shape Governs Root Elongation Rate under Increased Soil Strength
<p>Increased soil strength due to soil compaction or soil drying is a major limitation to root growth and crop productivity. Roots need to exert higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">penetr</span></strong>ation force, resulting in increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">penetr</span></strong>ation stress when elongating in soils of greater strength. This study aimed to quantify how the genotypic diversity of root tip geometry and root diameter influences root elongation under different levels of soil strength and to determine the extent to which roots adjust to increased soil strength. Fourteen wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) varieties were grown in soil columns packed to three bulk densities representing low, moderate, and high soil strength. Under moderate and high soil strength, smaller root tip radius-to-length ratio was correlated with higher genotypic root elongation rate, whereas root diameter was not related to genotypic root elongation. Based on cavity expansion theory, it was found that smaller root tip radius-to-length ratio reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">penetr</span></strong>ation stress, thus enabling higher root elongation rates in soils with greater strength. Furthermore, it was observed that roots could only partially adjust to increased soil strength. Root thickening was bounded by a maximum diameter, and root tips did not become more acute in response to increased soil strength. The obtained results demonstrated that root tip geometry is a pivotal trait governing root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">penetr</span></strong>ation stress and root elongation rate in soils of greater strength. Hence, root tip shape needs to be taken into account when selecting for crop varieties that may tolerate high soil strength.</p>

Excess Diffuse Light Absorption in Upper Mesophyll Limits CO<sub>2</sub> Drawdown and Depresses Photosynthesis
<p>In agricultural and natural systems, diffuse light can enhance plant primary productivity due to deeper <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">penetr</span></strong>ation into and greater irradiance of the entire canopy. However, for individual sun-grown leaves from three species, photosynthesis is actually less efficient under diffuse compared with direct light. Despite its potential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong> on canopy-level productivity, the mechanism for this leaf-level diffuse light photosynthetic depression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> is unknown. Here, we investigate if the spatial distribution of light absorption relative to electron transport capacity in sun- and shade-grown sunflower (<i>Helianthus annuus</i>) leaves underlies its previously observed diffuse light photosynthetic depression. Using a new one-dimensional porous medium finite element gas-exchange model parameterized with light absorption profiles, we found that weaker <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">penetr</span></strong>ation of diffuse versus direct light into the mesophyll of sun-grown sunflower leaves led to a more heterogenous saturation of electron transport capacity and lowered its CO<sub>2</sub> concentration drawdown capacity in the intercellular airspace and chloroplast stroma. This decoupling of light availability from photosynthetic capacity under diffuse light is sufficient to generate an 11% decline in photosynthesis in sun-grown but not shade-grown leaves, primarily because thin shade-grown leaves similarly distribute diffuse and direct light throughout the mesophyll. Finally, we illustrate how diffuse light photosynthetic depression could overcome enhancement in canopies with low light extinction coefficients and/or leaf area, pointing toward a novel direction for future research.</p>

Apparent Overinvestment in Leaf Venation Relaxes Leaf Morphological Constraints on Photosynthesis in Arid Habitats
<p>Leaf veins supply the mesophyll with water that evaporates when stomata are open to allow CO<sub>2</sub> uptake for photosynthesis. Theoretical analyses suggest that water is optimally distributed in the mesophyll when the lateral distance between veins (<i>d</i><sub>x</sub>) is equal to the distance from these veins to the epidermis (<i>d</i><sub>y</sub>), expressed as <i>d</i><sub>x</sub>:<i>d</i><sub>y</sub> ≈ 1. Although this theory is supported by observations of many derived angiosperms, we hypothesize that plants in arid environments may reduce <i>d</i><sub>x</sub>:<i>d</i><sub>y</sub> below unity owing to climate-specific functional adaptations of increased leaf thickness and increased vein density. To test our hypothesis, we assembled leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic, morphological, and photosynthetic traits of 68 species from the <i>Eucalyptus</i> and <i>Corymbia</i> genera (termed eucalypts) along an aridity gradient in southwestern Australia. We inferred the potential gas-exchange advantage of reducing <i>d</i><sub>x</sub> beyond <i>d</i><sub>y</sub> using a model that links leaf morphology and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ics to photosynthesis. Our observations reveal that eucalypts in arid environments have thick amphistomatous leaves with high vein densities, resulting in <i>d</i><sub>x</sub>:<i>d</i><sub>y</sub> ratios that range from 1.6 to 0.15 along the aridity gradient. Our model suggests that, as leaves become thicker, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of reducing <i>d</i><sub>x</sub> beyond <i>d</i><sub>y</sub> is to offset the reduction in leaf gas exchange that would result from maintaining <i>d</i><sub>x</sub>:<i>d</i><sub>y</sub> at unity. This apparent overinvestment in leaf venation may be explained from the selective pressure of aridity, under which traits associated with long leaf life span, high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic and thermal capacitances, and high potential rates of leaf water transport confer a competitive advantage.</p>

Mechanical Failure of Fine Root Cortical Cells Initiates Plant Hydraulic Decline during Drought
<p>Root systems perform the crucial task of absorbing water from the soil to meet the demands of a transpiring canopy. Roots are thought to operate like electrical fuses, which break when carrying an excessive load under conditions of drought stress. Yet the exact site and sequence of this dysfunction in roots remain elusive. Using in vivo x-ray computed microtomography, we found that drought-induced mechanical failure (i.e. lacunae formation) in fine root cortical cells is the initial and primary driver of reduced fine root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductivity (Lp<sub>r</sub>) under mild to moderate drought stress. Cortical lacunae started forming under mild drought stress (−0.6 MPa Ψ<sub>stem</sub>), coincided with a dramatic reduction in Lp<sub>r</sub>, and preceded root shrinkage or significant xylem embolism. Only under increased drought stress was embolism formation observed in the root xylem, and it appeared first in the fine roots (50% loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductivity [P<sub>50</sub>] reached at −1.8 MPa) and then in older, coarse roots (P<sub>50</sub> = −3.5 MPa). These results suggest that cortical cells in fine roots function like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic fuses that decouple plants from drying soil, thus preserving the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic integrity of the plant’s vascular system under early stages of drought stress. Cortical lacunae formation led to permanent structural damage of the root cortex and nonrecoverable Lp<sub>r</sub>, pointing to a role in fine root mortality and turnover under drought stress.</p>

Epistasis and Pleiotropy Affect the Modularity of the Genotype–Phenotype Map of Cross-Resistance in HIV-1
<p>The genotype–phenotype (GP) map is a central concept in evolutionary biology as it describes the mapping of molecular genetic variation onto phenotypic trait variation. Our understanding of that mapping remains partial, especially when trying to link functional clustering of pleiotropic gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s with patterns of phenotypic trait co-variation. Only on rare occasions have studies been able to fully explore that link and tend to show poor correspondence between modular structures within the GP map and among phenotypes. By dissecting the structure of the GP map of the replicative capacity of HIV-1 in 15 drug environments, we provide a detailed view of that mapping from mutational pleiotropic variation to phenotypic co-variation, including epistatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of a set of amino-acid substitutions in the reverse transcriptase and protease genes. We show that epistasis increases the pleiotropic degree of single mutations and provides modularity to the GP map of drug resistance in HIV-1. Moreover, modules of epistatic pleiotropic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s within the GP map match the phenotypic modules of correlated replicative capacity among drug classes. Epistasis thus increases the evolvability of cross-resistance in HIV by providing more drug- and class-specific pleiotropic profiles to the main <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of the mutations. We discuss the implications for the evolution of cross-resistance in HIV.</p>

Strong Epistatic Interactions within a Single Protein
<p>A central question in protein molecular evolution is whether an amino acid that occurs at a given site makes an independent contribution to fitness or whether its contribution depends on other amino acid sites in the protein sequence, a phenomenon known as intragenic epistasis. In the absence of intragenic epistasis, natural selection acts on a protein mutation independent of its genetic background, and the experimentally determined fitness for a mutation should be the same across all genetic backgrounds. We tested this hypothesis by using site-directed mutagenesis to introduce a well-characterized deleterious single amino acid substitution in 56 different hepatitis C virus NS3 protease variants. The catalytic efficiency of the mutated proteases was determined and compared with the corresponding wild-type protein. Fitness <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s ranged from lethality to significantly beneficial. Although primarily deleterious and lethal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s were observed (41 and 5 out of 56 tested variants, respectively), deleterious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s ranged from near neutral (−26.7% reduction of fitness) to near lethal (−98.5%). Our findings demonstrate that the introduced amino acid substitution has different fitness <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s in different protein variants and provide independent support for the relevant role of intragenic epistasis in protein evolution.</p>

A Comprehensive, High-Resolution Map of a Gene’s Fitness Landscape
<p>Mutations are central to evolution, providing the genetic variation upon which selection acts. A mutation’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> on the suitability of a gene to perform a particular function (gene fitness) can be positive, negative, or neutral. Knowledge of the distribution of fitness <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s (DFE) of mutations is fundamental for understanding evolutionary dynamics, molecular-level genetic variation, complex genetic disease, the accumulation of deleterious mutations, and the molecular clock. We present comprehensive DFEs for point and codon mutants of the <i>Escherichia coli TEM-1</i> β-lactamase gene and missense mutations in the TEM-1 protein. These DFEs provide insight into the inherent benefits of the genetic code’s architecture, support for the hypothesis that mRNA stability dictates codon usage at the beginning of genes, an extensive framework for understanding protein mutational tolerance, and evidence that mutational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s on protein thermodynamic stability shape the DFE. Contrary to prevailing expectations, we find that deleterious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of mutation primarily arise from a decrease in specific protein activity and not cellular protein levels.</p>

The role of light in mediating the effects of ocean acidification on coral calcification
<p>We tested the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of light and <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> on the calcification and survival of <i>Pocillopora damicornis</i> recruits settled from larvae released in southern Taiwan. In March 2011, recruits were incubated at 31, 41, 70, 122 and 226 μmol photons m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> under ambient (493 μatm) and high <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> (878 μatm). After 5 days, calcification was measured gravimetrically and survivorship estimated as the number of living recruits. Calcification was affected by the interaction of <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> with light, and at 493 μatm <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> the response to light intensity resembled a positive parabola. At 878 μatm <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub>, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of light on calcification differed from that observed at 493 μatm <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub>, with the result that there were large differences in calcification between 493 μatm and 878 μatm <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> at intermediate light intensities (<i>ca</i>. 70 μmol photons m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>), but similar rates of calcification at the highest and lowest light intensities. Survivorship was affected by light and <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub>, and was highest at 122 μmol photons m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> in both <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> treatments, but was unrelated to calcification. In June 2012 the experiment was repeated, and again the results suggested that exposure to high <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> decreased calcification of <i>P. damicornis</i> recruits at intermediate light intensities, but not at lower or higher intensities. Together, our findings demonstrate that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> on coral recruits can be light dependent, with inhibitory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of high <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> on calcification at intermediate light intensities that disappear at both higher and lower light intensities.</p>

Reconstruction of non-contained acetabular defects with impaction grafting, a reinforcement mesh and a cemented polyethylene acetabular component
<p>This review summarises the technique of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>ion   grafting with mesh augmentation for the treatment of uncontained   acetabular defects in revision hip arthroplasty.</p><p>The ideal acetabular revision should restore bone stock, use   a small socket in the near-anatomic position, and provide durable   fixation. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>ion bone grafting, which has been in use for over   40 years, offers the ability to achieve these goals in uncontained   defects. The precepts of modern, revision <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>ion grafting are   that the segmental or cavitary defects must be supported with a   mesh; the contained cavity is filled with vigorously <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>ed morselised   fresh-frozen allograft; and finally, acrylic cement is used to stabilise   the graft and provide rigid, long-lasting fixation of the revised   acetabular component.</p><p>Favourable results have been published with this technique.

Phenotypic Consequences of a Genetic Predisposition to Enhanced Nitric Oxide Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Nitric oxide signaling plays a key role in the regulation of vascular tone and platelet activation. Here, we seek to understand the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong> of a genetic predisposition to enhanced nitric oxide signaling on risk for cardiovascular diseases, thus informing the potential utility of pharmacological stimulation of the nitric oxide pathway as a therapeutic strategy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We analyzed the association of common and rare genetic variants in 2 genes that mediate nitric oxide signaling (Nitric Oxide Synthase 3 [<i>NOS3</i>] and Guanylate Cyclase 1, Soluble, Alpha 3 [<i>GUCY1A3</i>]) with a range of human phenotypes. We selected 2 common variants (rs3918226 in <i>NOS3</i> and rs7692387 in <i>GUCY1A3</i>) known to associate with increased <i>NOS3</i> and <i>GUCY1A3</i> expression and reduced mean arterial pressure, combined them into a genetic score, and standardized this exposure to a 5 mm Hg reduction in mean arterial pressure. Using individual-level data from 335 464 participants in the UK Biobank and summary association results from 7 large-scale genome-wide association studies, we examined the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of this nitric oxide signaling score on cardiometabolic and other diseases. We also examined whether rare loss-of-function mutations in <i>NOS3</i> and <i>GUCY1A3</i> were associated with coronary heart disease using gene sequencing data from the Myocardial Infarction Genetics Consortium (n=27 815).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A genetic predisposition to enhanced nitric oxide signaling was associated with reduced risks of coronary heart disease (odds ratio, 0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31-0.45; <i>P</i>=5.5*10<sup>–26</sup>], peripheral arterial disease (odds ratio 0.42; 95% CI, 0.26-0.68; <i>P</i>=0.0005), and stroke (odds ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.37-0.76; <i>P</i>=0.0006). In a mediation analysis, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of the genetic score on decreased coronary heart disease risk extended beyond its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> on blood pressure. Conversely, rare variants that inactivate the <i>NOS3</i> or <i>GUCY1A3</i> genes were associated with a 23 mm Hg higher systolic blood pressure (95% CI, 12-34; <i>P</i>=5.6*10<sup>–5</sup>) and a 3-fold higher risk of coronary heart disease (odds ratio, 3.03; 95% CI, 1.29-7.12; <i>P</i>=0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>A genetic predisposition to enhanced nitric oxide signaling is associated with reduced risks of coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, and stroke.

Antiarrhythmic Drugs for Nonshockable-Turned-Shockable Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) commonly presents with nonshockable rhythms (asystole and pulseless electric activity). It is unknown whether antiarrhythmic drugs are safe and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive when nonshockable rhythms evolve to shockable rhythms (ventricular fibrillation/pulseless ventricular tachycardia [VF/VT]) during resuscitation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Adults with nontraumatic OHCA, vascular access, and VF/VT anytime after ≥1 shock(s) were prospectively randomized, double-blind, to receive amiodarone, lidocaine, or placebo by paramedics. Patients presenting with initial shock-refractory VF/VT were previously reported. The current study was a prespecified analysis in a separate cohort that initially presented with nonshockable OHCA and was randomized on subsequently developing shock-refractory VF/VT. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes included discharge functional status and adverse drug-related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 37 889 patients with OHCA, 3026 with initial VF/VT and 1063 with initial nonshockable-turned-shockable rhythms were treatment-eligible, were randomized, and received their assigned drug. Baseline characteristics among patients with nonshockable-turned-shockable rhythms were balanced across treatment arms, except that recipients of a placebo included fewer men and were less likely to receive bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Active-drug recipients in this cohort required fewer shocks, supplemental doses of their assigned drug, and ancillary antiarrhythmic drugs than recipients of a placebo (<i>P</i><0.05). In all, 16 (4.1%) amiodarone, 11 (3.1%) lidocaine, and 6 (1.9%) placebo-treated patients survived to hospital discharge (<i>P</i>=0.24). No significant interaction between treatment assignment and discharge survival occurred with the initiating OHCA rhythm (asystole, pulseless electric activity, or VF/VT). Survival in each of these categories was consistently higher with active drugs, although the trends were not statistically significant. Adjusted absolute differences (95% confidence interval) in survival from nonshockable-turned-shockable arrhythmias with amiodarone versus placebo were 2.3% (−0.3, 4.8), <i>P</i>=0.08, and for lidocaine versus placebo 1.2% (−1.1, 3.6), <i>P</i>=0.30. More than 50% of these survivors were functionally independent or required minimal assistance. Drug-related adverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s were infrequent.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Outcome from nonshockable-turned-shockable OHCA is poor but not invariably fatal. Although not statistically significant, point estimates for survival were greater after amiodarone or lidocaine than placebo, without increased risk of adverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s or disability and consistent with previously observed favorable trends from treatment of initial shock-refractory VF/VT with these drugs.

Leaf Amino Acid Supply Affects Photosynthetic and Plant Nitrogen Use Efficiency under Nitrogen Stress
<p>The coordinated distribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> to source leaves and sinks is essential for supporting leaf metabolism while also supplying sufficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> to seeds for development. This study aimed to understand how regulated amino acid allocation to leaves affects photosynthesis and overall plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> use efficiency in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and how soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> availability influences these processes. Arabidopsis plants with a knockout of <i>AAP2</i>, encoding an amino acid permease involved in xylem-to-phloem transfer of root-derived amino acids, were grown in low-, moderate-, and high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> environments. We analyzed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> allocation to shoot tissues, photosynthesis, and photosynthetic and plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> use efficiency in these knockout plants. Our results demonstrate that, independent of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> conditions, <i>aap2</i> plants allocate more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> to leaves than wild-type plants. Increased leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> supply positively affected chlorophyll and Rubisco levels, photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> use efficiency, and carbon assimilation and transport to sinks. The <i>aap2</i> plants outperformed wild-type plants with respect to growth, seed yield and carbon storage pools, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> use efficiency in both high and deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> environments. Overall, this study demonstrates that increasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> allocation to leaves represents an effective strategy for improving carbon fixation and photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> use efficiency. The results indicate that an optimized coordination of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> and carbon partitioning processes is critical for high oilseed production in Arabidopsis, including in plants exposed to limiting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> conditions.</p>

Convergent evidence for widespread rock nitrogen sources in Earth’s surface environment
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> availability is a pivotal control on terrestrial carbon sequestration and global climate change. Historical and contemporary views assume that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> enters Earth’s land-surface ecosystems from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>e. Here we demonstrate that bedrock is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> source that rivals <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> inputs across major sectors of the global terrestrial environment. Evidence drawn from the planet’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> balance, geochemical proxies, and our spatial weathering model reveal that ~19 to 31 teragrams of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> are mobilized from near-surface rocks annually. About 11 to 18 teragrams of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> are chemically weathered in situ, thereby increasing the unmanaged (preindustrial) terrestrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> balance from 8 to 26%. These findings provide a global perspective to reconcile Earth’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> budget, with implications for nutrient-driven controls over the terrestrial carbon sink.</p>

Singlet Oxygen Plays an Essential Role in the Root’s Response to Osmotic Stress
<p>The high osmotic potentials in plants subjected to drought stress can be mimicked by the application of high molecular weight polyethylene glycol. Here, we quantified the effects of exposure to polyethylene glycol on the growth of the main and lateral roots of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings. The effects on root growth were highly correlated with the appearance of singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>, as visualized using the singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>-specific probe singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> sensor green. The production of singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> was followed by cell death, as indicated by the intracellular accumulation of propidium iodide due to the loss of membrane integrity. Cell death began in the epidermal region of the root tip and spread in a dynamic manner to meristematic sections. In parallel, gene expression changes specific to the presence of singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> were observed. The accumulation of other reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species, namely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong>, peroxide, nitric oxide, and superoxide, did not correlate with cell death. In addition, both the singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> scavenger His and the lip<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ase inhibitor salicylhydroxamic acid specifically inhibited singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> accumulation and cell death. These results suggest a light-independent, type-I source of singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> production. Serpin-protease interactions were used as a model to assess the possibility of vacuolar-type cell death. Osmotic stress induced the accumulation of complexes between the cytoplasmic serpin AtSERPIN1 and its cognate vacuolar proteases, indicating that vacuolar integrity was compromised. These findings imply that singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> plays an essential role in conveying the root response to osmotic stress.</p>

Metabolic recycling of ammonia via glutamate dehydrogenase supports breast cancer biomass
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ammonia</span></strong> is a ubiquitous by-product of cellular metabolism; however, the biological consequences of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ammonia</span></strong> production are not fully understood, especially in cancer. We found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ammonia</span></strong> is not merely a toxic waste product but is recycled into central amino acid metabolism to maximize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> utilization. In our experiments, human breast cancer cells primarily assimilated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ammonia</span></strong> through reductive amination catalyzed by glutamate de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong>ase (GDH); secondary reactions enabled other amino acids, such as proline and aspartate, to directly acquire this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong>. Metabolic recycling of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ammonia</span></strong> accelerated proliferation of breast cancer. In mice, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ammonia</span></strong> accumulated in the tumor microenvironment and was used directly to generate amino acids through GDH activity. These data show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ammonia</span></strong> is not only a secreted waste product but also a fundamental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> source that can support tumor biomass.</p>

Coordination-induced weakening of ammonia, water, and hydrazine X–H bonds in a molybdenum complex
<p>Although scores of transition metal complexes incorporating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ammonia</span></strong> or water ligands have been characterized over the past century, little is known about how coordination influences the strength of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> bonds. Here we report the synthesis of a molybdenum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ammonia</span></strong> complex supported by terpyridine and phosphine ligands that lowers the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> bond dissociation free energy from 99.5 (gas phase) to an experimentally measured value of 45.8 kilocalories per mole (agreeing closely with a value of 45.1 kilocalories per mole calculated by density functional theory). This bond weakening enables spontaneous di<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> evolution upon gentle heating, as well as the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong>ation of styrene. Analogous molybdenum complexes promote di<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> evolution from coordinated water and hydrazine.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
A Synthetic Oxygen Sensor for Plants Based on Animal Hypoxia Signaling
<p>Due to the involvement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> in many essential metabolic reactions, all living organisms have developed molecular systems that allow adaptive physiological and metabolic transitions depending on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> availability. In mammals, the expression of hypoxia-response genes is controlled by the heterodimeric Hypoxia-Inducible Factor. The activity of this transcriptional regulator is linked mainly to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>-dependent hydroxylation of conserved proline residues in its α-subunit, carried out by prolyl-hydroxylases, and subsequent ubiquitination via the E3 ligase von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor, which targets Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-α to the proteasome. By exploiting bioengineered versions of this mammalian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> sensor, we designed and optimized a synthetic device that drives gene expression in an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>-dependent fashion in plants. Transient assays in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mesophyll protoplasts indicated that a combination of the yeast Gal4/upstream activating sequence system and the mammalian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> sensor machinery can be used effectively to engineer a modular, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>-inducible transcriptional regulator. This synthetic device also was shown to be selectively controlled by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> in whole plants when its components were expressed stably in Arabidopsis seedlings. We envision the exploitation of our genetically encoded controllers to generate plants able to switch gene expression selectively depending on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> availability, thereby providing a proof of concept for the potential of synthetic biology to assist agricultural practices in environments with variable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> provision.</p>

Cell structural changes in the mesophyll of Norway spruce needles by elevated ozone and elevated temperature in open-field exposure during cold acclimation
<p>The effects of elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ozon</span></strong>e (1.4× ambient) and temperature (ambient +1.3 °C) alone and in combination were studied on the needle cell structure of soil-grown Norway spruce seedlings in the late growing season and winter. Temperature treatment continued over winter and lengthened the snow-free period. Elevated temperature caused microscopic changes related to photosynthesis (decreased chloroplast size and increased number), carbon storage (reduced starch and increased cytoplasmic lipids) and defence (decreased mitochondrial size and proportion per cytoplasm, increased peroxisomes and plastoglobuli, altered appearance of tannins). The results suggest increased oxidative stress by elevated temperature and altered allocation of limited carbon reserve to defence. The number of peroxisomes and plastoglobuli remained high in the outer cells of needles of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ozon</span></strong>e-exposed seedlings but decreased in the inner cells. This may indicate defence allocation to cells close to the stomata and surface, which are experiencing more oxidative stress. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ozon</span></strong>e reduced winter hardiness based on seasonal changes in chloroplast shape and location in the cells. The effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ozon</span></strong>e became evident at the end of the growing season, indicating the effect of cumulative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ozon</span></strong>e dose or that the seedlings were vulnerable to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ozon</span></strong>e at the later phases of winter hardening. Elevated temperature increased cellular damage in early winter and visible damage in spring, and the damage was enhanced by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ozon</span></strong>e. In conclusion, the study suggests that modest air temperature elevation increases stress at the cell structural level in spruce seedlings and is enhanced by low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ozon</span></strong>e elevation. Future climatic conditions where snow cover is formed later or is lacking but temperatures are low can increase the risk of severe seedling damage, and current and future predicted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ozon</span></strong>e concentrations increase this risk.</p>

Simultaneous high-resolution pH and spectrophotometric recordings of oxygen binding in blood microvolumes
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> equilibrium curves have been widely used to understand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> transport in numerous organisms. A major challenge has been to monitor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> binding characteristics and concomitant pH changes as they occur <i>in vivo</i>, in limited sample volumes. Here we report a technique allowing highly resolved and simultaneous monitoring of pH and blood pigment saturation in minute blood volumes. We equipped a gas diffusion chamber with a broad-range fibre-optic spectrophotometer and a micro-pH optode and recorded changes of pigment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ation along <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> partial pressure (<i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>) and pH gradients to test the setup. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> binding parameters derived from measurements in only 15 μl of haemolymph from the cephalopod <i>Octopus vulgaris</i> showed low instrumental error (0.93%) and good agreement with published data. Broad-range spectra, each resolving 2048 data points, provided detailed insight into the complex absorbance characteristics of diverse blood types. After consideration of photobleaching and intrinsic fluorescence, pH optodes yielded accurate recordings and resolved a sigmoidal shift of 0.03 pH units in response to changing <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> from 0 to 21 kPa. Highly resolved continuous recordings along pH gradients conformed to stepwise measurements at low rates of pH changes. In this study we showed that a diffusion chamber upgraded with a broad-range spectrophotometer and an optical pH sensor accurately characterizes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> binding with minimal sample consumption and manipulation. We conclude that the modified diffusion chamber is highly suitable for experimental biologists who demand high flexibility, detailed insight into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> binding as well as experimental and biological accuracy combined in a single setup.</p>

Rapid mitochondrial adjustments in response to short-term hypoxia and re-oxygenation in the Pacific oyster, <i>Crassostrea gigas</i>
<p>As <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> concentrations in marine coastal habitats can fluctuate rapidly and drastically, sessile marine organisms such as the oyster <i>Crassostrea gigas</i> can experience marked and rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> variations. In this study, we investigated the responses of oyster gill mitochondria to short-term hypoxia (3 and 12 h, at 1.7 mg O<sub>2</sub> l<sup>−1</sup>) and subsequent re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ation. Mitochondrial respiratory rates (states 3 and 4 stimulated by glutamate) and phosphorylation efficiency [respiratory control ratio (RCR) and the relationship between ADP and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> consumption (ADP/O)] were measured. Cytochrome <i>c</i> oxidase (CCO) activity and cytochrome concentrations (<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>c</i>) were measured to investigate the rearrangements of respiratory chain subunits. The potential implication of an alternative oxidase (AOX) was investigated using an inhibitor of the respiratory chain (antimycin A) and through gene expression analysis in gills and digestive gland. Results indicate a downregulation of mitochondrial capacity, with 60% inhibition of respiratory rates after 12 h of hypoxia. RCR remained stable, while ADP/O increased after 12 h of hypoxia and 1 h of re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ation, suggesting increased phosphorylation efficiency. CCO showed a fast and remarkable increase of its catalytic activity only after 3 h of hypoxia. AOX mRNA levels showed similar patterns in gills and digestive gland, and were upregulated after 12 and 24 h of hypoxia and during re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ation. Results suggest a set of controls regulating mitochondrial functions in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> fluctuations, and demonstrate the fast and extreme plasticity of oyster mitochondria in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> variations.</p>

Architecture of the complete oxygen-sensing FixL-FixJ two-component signal transduction system
<p>The symbiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong>-fixing bacterium <i>Bradyrhizobium japonicum</i> is critical to the agro-industrial production of soybean because it enables the production of high yields of soybeans with little use of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong>ous fertilizers. The FixL and FixJ two-component system (TCS) of this bacterium ensures that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> fixation is only stimulated under conditions of low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>. When it is not bound to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>, the histidine kinase FixL undergoes autophosphorylation and transfers phosphate from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to the response regulator FixJ, which, in turn, stimulates the expression of genes required for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> fixation. We purified full-length <i>B. japonicum</i> FixL and FixJ proteins and defined their structures individually and in complex using small-angle x-ray scattering, crystallographic, and in silico modeling techniques. Comparison of active and inactive forms of FixL suggests that intramolecular signal transduction is driven by local changes in the sensor domain and in the coiled-coil region connecting the sensor and histidine kinase domains. We also found that FixJ exhibits conformational plasticity not only in the monomeric state but also in tetrameric complexes with FixL during phosphotransfer. This structural characterization of a complete TCS contributes both a mechanistic and evolutionary understanding to TCS signal relay, specifically in the context of the control of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> fixation in root nodules.</p>

Fluid-induced aseismic fault slip outpaces pore-fluid migration
<p>Earthquake swarms attributed to subsurface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> injection are usually assumed to occur on faults destabilized by increased pore-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> pressures. However, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> injection could also activate aseismic slip, which might outpace pore-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> migration and transmit earthquake-triggering stress changes beyond the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>-pressurized region. We tested this theoretical prediction against data derived from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>-injection experiments that activated and measured slow, aseismic slip on preexisting, shallow faults. We found that the pore pressure and slip history imply a fault whose strength is the product of a slip-weakening friction coefficient and the local effective normal stress. Using a coupled shear-rupture model, we derived constraints on the hydromechanical parameters of the actively deforming fault. The inferred aseismic rupture front propagates faster and to larger distances than the diffusion of pressurized pore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>.</p>

Histone modifiers are oxygen sensors
<p>Approximately 2.6 billion years ago, during the Proterozoic period, the evolution of photosynthesis in cyanobacteria led to the introduction of the by-product of this reaction, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>, into Earth's <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>e (<i>1</i>). This great oxidative event heralded the rise of multicellular organisms, which are almost totally dependent on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> as an efficient fuel for metabolism and as a cofactor in many critical physiological enzymatic reactions. Central to this adaptation, and to allow cellular physiology across a wide range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> concentrations (tensions), metazoans have evolved the highly conserved hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway (<i>2</i>). This is important for both physiological and pathological processes that occur in a hypoxic microenvironment, including embryogenesis, stem cell homeostasis, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. It has long been observed that hypoxia induces histone lysine hypermethylation, a form of epigenetic chromatin modification. However, whether this represents a direct sensing of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> tension or an indirect effect, perhaps through the HIF pathway, has not been established (<i>3</i>). On pages 1222 and 1217 of this issue, Batie <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) and Chakraborty <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>), respectively, resolve this question, demonstrating in different cellular systems that the activity of the lysine-specific demethylases (KDMs) KDM5A and KDM6A is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> sensitive, and thereby identifying them as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> sensors.</p>

Physiological correlates of symbiont migration during bleaching of two octocoral species
<p>Perturbed colonies of <i>Phenganax parrini</i> and <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. exhibit migration of symbionts of <i>Symbiodinium</i> spp. into the stolons. Densitometry and visual inspection indicated that polyps bleached while stolons did not. When migration was triggered by temperature, light and confinement, colonies of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. decreased rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> formation in the light (due to the effects of perturbation on photosynthesis and respiration) and increased rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> uptake in the dark (due to the effects of perturbation on respiration alone). Colonies of <i>P. parrini</i>, by contrast, showed no significant changes in either aspect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> metabolism. When migration was triggered by light and confinement, colonies of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. showed decreased rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> formation in the light and increased rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> uptake in the dark, while colonies of <i>P. parrini</i> maintained the former and increased the latter. During symbiont migration into their stolons, colonies of both species showed dramatic increases in reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species (ROS), as visualized with a fluorescent probe, with stolons of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. exhibiting a nearly immediate increase of ROS. Differences in symbiont type may explain the greater sensitivity of colonies of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. Using fluorescent probes, direct measurements of migrating symbionts in the stolons of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. showed higher levels of reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> species and lower levels of ROS than the surrounding host tissue. As measured by native fluorescence, levels of NAD(P)H in the stolons were unaffected by perturbation. Symbiont migration thus correlates with dramatic physiological changes and may serve as a marker for coral condition.</p>

The Chinese soft-shelled turtle, <i>Pelodiscus sinensis</i>, decreases nitrogenous excretion, reduces urea synthesis and suppresses ammonia production during emersion
<p>The objective of this study was to examine the effects of 6 days of emersion on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> metabolism and excretion in the Chinese soft-shelled turtle, <i>Pelodiscus sinensis</i>. Despite having a soft shell with a cutaneous surface that is known to be water permeable, <i>P. sinensis</i> lost only ~2% of body mass and was able to maintain its hematocrit and plasma osmolality, [Na<sup>+</sup>] and [Cl<sup>−</sup>] during 6 days of emersion. During emersion, it ameliorated water loss by reducing urine output, which led to a reduction (by 29–76%) in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ammonia</span></strong> excretion. In comparison, there was a more prominent reduction (by 82–99%) in urea excretion during emersion due to a lack of water to flush the buccopharyngeal epithelium, which is known to be the major route of urea excretion. Consequently, emersion resulted in an apparent shift from ureotely to ammonotely in <i>P. sinensis</i>. Although urea concentration increased in several tissues, the excess urea accumulated could only account for 13–22% of the deficit in urea excretion. Hence, it can be concluded that a decrease (~80%) in urea synthesis occurred in <i>P. sinensis</i> during the 6 days of emersion. Indeed, emersion led to significant decreases in the activity of some ornithine–urea cycle enzymes (argininosuccinate synthetase/argininosuccinate lyase and arginase) from the liver of <i>P. sinensis</i>. As a decrease in urea synthesis occurred without the accumulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ammonia</span></strong> and total free amino acids, it can be deduced that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ammonia</span></strong> production through amino acid catabolism was suppressed with a proportional reduction in proteolysis in <i>P. sinensis</i> during emersion. Indeed, calculated results revealed that there could be a prominent decrease (~88%) in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ammonia</span></strong> production in turtles after 6 days of emersion. In summary, despite being ureogenic and ureotelic in water, <i>P. sinensis</i> adopted a reduction in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ammonia</span></strong> production, instead of increased urea synthesis, as the major strategy to ameliorate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ammonia</span></strong> toxicity and problems associated with dehydration during terrestrial exposure.</p>

Histone demethylase KDM6A directly senses oxygen to control chromatin and cell fate
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> sensing is central to metazoan biology and has implications for human disease. Mammalian cells express multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>-dependent enzymes called 2-oxoglutarate (OG)-dependent di<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ases (2-OGDDs), but they vary in their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> affinities and hence their ability to sense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>. The 2-OGDD histone demethylases control histone methylation. Hypoxia increases histone methylation, but whether this reflects direct effects on histone demethylases or indirect effects caused by the hypoxic induction of the HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor) transcription factor or the 2-OG antagonist 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) is unclear. Here, we report that hypoxia promotes histone methylation in a HIF- and 2-HG–independent manner. We found that the H3K27 histone demethylase KDM6A/UTX, but not its paralog KDM6B, is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> sensitive. KDM6A loss, like hypoxia, prevented H3K27 demethylation and blocked cellular differentiation. Restoring H3K27 methylation homeostasis in hypoxic cells reversed these effects. Thus, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> directly affects chromatin regulators to control cell fate.</p>

Chemical interactions between Saturn’s atmosphere and its rings
<p>The Pioneer and Voyager spacecraft made close-up measurements of Saturn’s ionosphere and upper <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>e in the 1970s and 1980s that suggested a chemical interaction between the rings and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>e. Exploring this interaction provides information on ring composition and the influence on Saturn’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>e from infalling material. The Cassini Ion Neutral Mass Spectrometer sampled in situ the region between the D ring and Saturn during the spacecraft’s Grand Finale phase. We used these measurements to characterize the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic structure and material influx from the rings. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic He/H<sub>2</sub> ratio is 10 to 16%. Volatile compounds from the rings (methane; <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon monoxid</span></strong>e and/or molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong>), as well as larger organic-bearing grains, are flowing inward at a rate of 4800 to 45,000 kilograms per second.</p>

Dust grains fall from Saturn’s D-ring into its equatorial upper atmosphere
<p>The sizes of Saturn’s ring particles range from meters (boulders) to nanometers (dust). Determination of the rings’ ages depends on loss processes, including the transport of dust into Saturn’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>e. During the Grand Finale orbits of the Cassini spacecraft, its instruments measured tiny dust grains that compose the innermost D-ring of Saturn. The nanometer-sized dust experiences collisions with exospheric (upper <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>e) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> and molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong>, which forces it to fall from the ring into the ionosphere and lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>e. We used the Magnetospheric Imaging Instrument to detect and characterize this dust transport and also found that diffusion dominates above and near the altitude of peak ionospheric density. This mechanism results in a mass deposition into the equatorial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>e of ~5 kilograms per second, constraining the age of the D-ring.</p>

Insulator-metal transition in dense fluid deuterium

Late inception of a resiliently oxygenated upper ocean
<p>Rising oceanic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> levels through time have been crucial to enhanced habitability of surface Earth environments. Few redox proxies can track secular variations in dissolved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> concentrations around threshold levels for metazoan survival in the upper ocean. We present an extensive compilation of iodine-to-calcium ratios (I/Ca) in marine carbonates. Our record supports a major rise in the partial pressure of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>e at ~400 million years (Ma) ago and reveals a step change in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ation of the upper ocean to relatively sustainable near-modern conditions at ~200 Ma ago. An Earth system model demonstrates that a shift in organic matter remineralization to greater depths, which may have been due to increasing size and biomineralization of eukaryotic plankton, likely drove the I/Ca signals at ~200 Ma ago.</p>

Mars’ atmospheric history derived from upper-atmosphere measurements of <sup>38</sup>Ar/<sup>36</sup>Ar
<p>The history of Mars’ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>e is important for understanding the geological evolution and potential habitability of the planet. We determine the amount of gas lost to space through time using measurements of the upper-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic structure made by the Mars <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>e and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) spacecraft. We derive the structure of <sup>38</sup>Ar/<sup>36</sup>Ar between the homopause and exobase altitudes. Fractionation of argon occurs as a result of loss of gas to space by pickup-ion sputtering, which preferentially removes the lighter atom. The measurements require that 66% of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic argon has been lost to space. Thus, a large fraction of Mars’ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic gas has been lost to space, contributing to the transition in climate from an early, warm, wet environment to today’s cold, dry <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>e.</p>

Global atmospheric particle formation from CERN CLOUD measurements
<p>Fundamental questions remain about the origin of newly formed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic aerosol particles because data from laboratory measurements have been insufficient to build global models. In contrast, gas-phase chemistry models have been based on laboratory kinetics measurements for decades.

The simulations and a comparison with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic observations show that nearly all nucleation throughout the present-day <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>e involves <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ammonia</span></strong> or biogenic organic compounds, in addition to sulfuric acid. A considerable fraction of nucleation involves ions, but the relatively weak dependence on ion concentrations indicates that for the processes studied, variations in cosmic ray intensity do not appreciably affect climate through nucleation in the present-day <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>e.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Root Bending Is Antagonistically Affected by Hypoxia and ERF-Mediated Transcription via Auxin Signaling
<p>When plants encounter soil water logging or flooding, roots are the first organs to be confronted with reduced gas diffusion resulting in limited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> supply. Since roots do not generate photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>, they are rapidly faced with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> shortage rendering roots particularly prone to damage. While metabolic adaptations to low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> conditions, which ensure basic energy supply, have been well characterized, adaptation of root growth and development have received less attention. In this study, we show that hypoxic conditions cause the primary root to grow sidewise in a low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> environment, possibly to escape soil patches with reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> availability. This growth behavior is reversible in that gravitropic growth resumes when seedlings are returned to normoxic conditions. Hypoxic root bending is inhibited by the group VII ethylene response factor (ERFVII) RAP2.12, as <i>rap2.12-1</i> seedlings show exaggerated primary root bending. Furthermore, overexpression of the ERFVII member <i>HRE2</i> inhibits root bending, suggesting that primary root growth direction at hypoxic conditions is antagonistically regulated by hypoxia and hypoxia-activated ERFVIIs. Root bending is preceded by the establishment of an auxin gradient across the root tip as quantified with DII-VENUS and is synergistically enhanced by hypoxia and the auxin transport inhibitor naphthylphthalamic acid. The protein abundance of the auxin efflux carrier PIN2 is reduced at hypoxic conditions, a response that is suppressed by RAP2.12 overexpression, suggesting antagonistic control of auxin flux by hypoxia and ERFVII. Taken together, we show that hypoxia triggers an escape response of the primary root that is controlled by ERFVII activity and mediated by auxin signaling in the root tip.</p>

The Liverwort, <i>Marchantia</i>, Drives Alternative Electron Flow Using a Flavodiiron Protein to Protect PSI
<p>The diffusion efficiency of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>e, like that of CO<sub>2</sub>, is approximately 10<sup>4</sup> times greater than that in aqueous environments. Consequently, terrestrial photosynthetic organisms need mechanisms to protect against potential oxidative damage. The liverwort <i>Marchantia polymorpha</i>, a basal land plant, has habitats where it is exposed to both water and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>e. Furthermore, like cyanobacteria, <i>M. polymorpha</i> has genes encoding flavodiiron proteins (FLV). In cyanobacteria, FLVs mediate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>-dependent alternative electron flow (AEF) to suppress the production of reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species. Here, we investigated whether FLVs are required for the protection of photosynthesis in <i>M. polymorpha</i>. A mutant deficient in the FLV1 isozyme (Δ<i>MpFlv1</i>) sustained photooxidative damage to photosystem I (PSI) following repetitive short-saturation pulses of light. Compared with the wild type (Takaragaike-1), Δ<i>MpFlv1</i> showed the same photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> evolution rate but a lower electron transport rate during the induction phase of photosynthesis. Additionally, the reaction center chlorophyll in PSI, P700, was highly reduced in Δ<i>MpFlv1</i> but not in Takaragaike-1. These results indicate that the gene product of <i>MpFlv1</i> drives AEF to oxidize PSI, as in cyanobacteria. Furthermore, FLV-mediated AEF supports the production of a proton motive force to possibly induce the nonphotochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence and suppress electron transport in the cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub>/<i>f</i> complex. After submerging the thalli, a decrease in photosystem II operating efficiency was observed, particularly in Δ<i>MpFlv1</i>, which implies that species living in these sorts of habitats require FLV-mediated AEF.</p>

A Comprehensively Curated Genome-Scale Two-Cell Model for the Heterocystous Cyanobacterium <i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120
<p><i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120 is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong>-fixing filamentous cyanobacterium. Under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong>-limiting conditions, a fraction of the vegetative cells in each filament terminally differentiate to nongrowing heterocysts. Heterocysts are metabolically and structurally specialized to enable O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> fixation. The functionality of the filament, as an association of vegetative cells and heterocysts, is postulated to depend on metabolic exchange of electrons, carbon, and fixed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong>. In this study, we compile and evaluate a comprehensive curated stoichiometric model of this two-cell system, with the objective function based on the growth of the filament under diazotrophic conditions. The predicted growth rate under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong>-replete and -deplete conditions, as well as the effect of external carbon and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> sources, was thereafter verified. Furthermore, the model was utilized to comprehensively evaluate the optimality of putative metabolic exchange reactions between heterocysts and vegetative cells. The model suggested that optimal growth requires at least four exchange metabolites. Several combinations of exchange metabolites resulted in predicted growth rates that are higher than growth rates achieved by only considering exchange of metabolites previously suggested in the literature. The curated model of the metabolic network of <i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120 enhances our ability to understand the metabolic organization of multicellular cyanobacteria and provides a platform for further study and engineering of their metabolism.</p>

Above- and belowground controls on water use by trees of different wood types in an eastern US deciduous forest
<p>Stomata control tree transpiration by sensing and integrating environmental signals originating in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>e and soil, and co-occurring species may differ in inherent stomatal sensitivity to these above- and belowground signals and in the types of signals to which they respond. Stomatal responsiveness to environmental signals is likely to differ across species having different types of wood (e.g., ring-porous, diffuse-porous and coniferous) because each wood type differs in the structure, size and spatial distribution of its xylem conduits as well as in the scaling of hydraulic properties with stem diameter. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of variation in soil water availability and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vapor</span></strong>ative demand on stomatal regulation of transpiration in seven co-occurring temperate deciduous forest species representing three wood types. We measured whole-tree sap flux and soil and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic variables in a mixed deciduous forest in central Pennsylvania over the course of a growing season characterized by severe drought and large fluctuations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vapor</span></strong> pressure deficit (<i>D</i>). The relative sensitivity of sap flux to soil drying was ∼2.2–2.3 times greater in the diffuse-porous and coniferous species than in the ring-porous species. Stomata of the ring-porous oaks were only about half as responsive to increased <i>D</i> as those of trees of the other two wood types. These differences in responsiveness to changes in the below- and aboveground environment implied that regulation of leaf water potential in the ring-porous oaks was less stringent than that in the diffuse-porous angiosperms or the conifers. The results suggest that increases in the frequency or intensity of summer droughts in the study region could have multiple consequences for forest function, including altered successional time courses or climax species composition and cumulative effects on whole-tree architecture, resulting in a structural and physiological legacy that would restrict the ability of trees to respond rapidly to more favorable growth conditions.</p>

Microtubules tune mechanotransduction through NOX2 and TRPV4 to decrease sclerostin abundance in osteocytes
<p>The adaptation of the skeleton to its mechanical environment is orchestrated by mechanosensitive osteocytes, largely by regulating the abundance of sclerostin, a secreted inhibitor of bone formation. We defined a microtubule-dependent mechanotransduction pathway that linked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> shear stress to reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species (ROS) and calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) signals that led to a reduction in sclerostin abundance in cultured osteocytes. We demonstrated that microtubules stabilized by detyrosination, a reversible posttranslational modification of polymerized α-tubulin, determined the stiffness of the cytoskeleton, which set the mechanoresponsive range of cultured osteocytes to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> shear stress. We showed that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> shear stress through the microtubule network activated NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2)–generated ROS that target the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel TRPV4 to elicit Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Furthermore, tuning the abundance of detyrosinated tubulin affected cytoskeletal stiffness to define the mechanoresponsive range of cultured osteocytes to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> shear stress. Finally, we demonstrated that NOX2-ROS elicited Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals that activated the kinase CaMKII to decrease the abundance of sclerostin protein. Together, these discoveries may identify potentially druggable targets for regulating osteocyte mechanotransduction to affect bone quality.</p>

Deep-diving sea lions exhibit extreme bradycardia in long-duration dives
<p>Heart rate and peripheral blood flow distribution are the primary determinants of the rate and pattern of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> store utilisation and ultimately breath-hold duration in marine endotherms. Despite this, little is known about how otariids (sea lions and fur seals) regulate heart rate (<i>f</i><sub>H</sub>) while diving. We investigated dive <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> in five adult female California sea lions (<i>Zalophus californianus</i>) during foraging trips by instrumenting them with digital electrocardiogram (ECG) loggers and time depth recorders. In all dives, dive <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> (number of beats/duration; 50±9 beats min<sup>−1</sup>) decreased compared with surface rates (113±5 beats min<sup>−1</sup>), with all dives exhibiting an instantaneous <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> below resting (<54 beats min<sup>−1</sup>) at some point during the dive. Both dive <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> and minimum instantaneous <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> significantly decreased with increasing dive duration. Typical instantaneous <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> profiles of deep dives (>100 m) consisted of: (1) an initial rapid decline in <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> resulting in the lowest instantaneous <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> of the dive at the end of descent, often below 10 beats min<sup>−1</sup> in dives longer than 6 min in duration; (2) a slight increase in <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> to ~10–40 beats min<sup>−1</sup> during the bottom portion of the dive; and (3) a gradual increase in <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> during ascent with a rapid increase prior to surfacing. Thus, <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> regulation in deep-diving sea lions is not simply a progressive bradycardia. Extreme bradycardia and the presumed associated reductions in pulmonary and peripheral blood flow during late descent of deep dives should (a) contribute to preservation of the lung <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> store, (b) increase dependence of muscle on the myoglobin-bound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> store, (c) conserve the blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> store and (d) help limit the absorption of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> at depth. This <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> profile during deep dives of sea lions may be characteristic of deep-diving marine endotherms that dive on inspiration as similar <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> profiles have been recently documented in the emperor penguin, another deep diver that dives on inspiration.</p>

Antifreeze proteins in the primary urine of larvae of the beetle <i>Dendroides canadensis</i>
<p>To avoid freezing while overwintering beneath the bark of fallen trees, <i>Dendroides canadensis</i> (Coleoptera: Pyrochroidae) larvae produce a family of antifreeze proteins (DAFPs) that are transcribed in specific tissues and have specific compartmental fates. DAFPs and associated thermal hysteresis activity (THA) have been shown previously in hemolymph and midgut <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>, but the presence of DAFPs has not been explored in primary urine, a potentially important site that can contain endogenous ice-nucleating compounds that could induce freezing. A maximum mean THA of 2.65±0.33°C was observed in primary urine of winter-collected <i>D. canadensis</i> larvae. THA in primary urine increased significantly through autumn, peaked in the winter and decreased through spring to levels of 0.2–0.3°C in summer, in a pattern similar to that of hemolymph and midgut <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>. THA was also found in hindgut <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> and excreted rectal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>, suggesting that these larvae not only concentrate AFPs in the hindgut, but also excrete AFPs from the rectal cavity. Based on <i>dafp</i> transcripts isolated from Malpighian tubule epithelia, cDNAs were cloned and sequenced, identifying the presence of transcripts encoding 24 DAFP isoforms. Six of these Malpighian tubule DAFPs were known previously, but 18 are new. We also provide functional evidence that DAFPs can inhibit ice nucleators present in insect primary urine. This is potentially critical because <i>D. canadensis</i> larvae die if frozen, and therefore ice formation in any body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>, including the urine, would be lethal.</p>

Spectrally resolved helium absorption from the extended atmosphere of a warm Neptune-mass exoplanet
<p>Stellar heating causes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>es of close-in exoplanets to expand and escape. These extended <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>es are difficult to observe because their main spectral signature—neutral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> at ultraviolet wavelengths—is strongly absorbed by interstellar medium. We report the detection of the near-infrared triplet of neutral helium in the transiting warm Neptune-mass exoplanet HAT-P-11b by using ground-based, high-resolution observations. The helium feature is repeatable over two independent transits, with an average absorption depth of 1.08 ± 0.05%. Interpreting absorption spectra with three-dimensional simulations of the planet’s upper <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>e suggests that it extends beyond 5 planetary radii, with a large-scale height and a helium mass loss rate of ≲3 × 10<sup>5</sup> grams per second. A net blue-shift of the absorption might be explained by high-altitude winds flowing at 3 kilometers per second from day to night-side.</p>

Recurrent cortical circuits implement concentration-invariant odor coding
<p>Animals rely on olfaction to find food, attract mates, and avoid predators. To support these behaviors, they must be able to identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">odor</span></strong>s across different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">odor</span></strong>ant concentrations. The neural circuit operations that implement this concentration invariance remain unclear. We found that despite concentration-dependence in the olfactory bulb (OB), representations of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">odor</span></strong> identity were preserved downstream, in the piriform cortex (PCx). The OB cells responding earliest after inhalation drove robust responses in sparse subsets of PCx neurons. Recurrent collateral connections broadcast their activation across the PCx, recruiting global feedback inhibition that rapidly truncated and suppressed cortical activity for the remainder of the sniff, discounting the impact of slower, concentration-dependent OB inputs. Eliminating recurrent collateral output amplified PCx <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">odor</span></strong> responses rendered the cortex steeply concentration-dependent and abolished concentration-invariant identity decoding.</p>

The turbulent cascade in five dimensions
<p>To the naked eye, turbulent flows exhibit whirls of many different sizes. To each size, or scale, corresponds a fraction of the total energy resulting from a cascade in five dimensions: scale, time, and three-dimensional space. Understanding this process is critical to strategies for modeling geophysical and industrial flows. By tracking the flow regions containing energy in different scales, we have detected the statistical predominance of a cross-scale link whereby <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> lumps of energy at scale Δ appear within lumps of scale 2Δ and die within those of scale Δ/2. Our approach uncovers the energy cascade in a simple water-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>, offering insights for turbulence models while paving the way for similar analyses in conducting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>s, quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>s, and plasmas.</p>

Complete measurement of helicity and its dynamics in vortex tubes
<p>Helicity, a topological measure of the intertwining of vortices in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> flow, is a conserved quantity in inviscid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>s but can be dissipated by viscosity in real flows. Despite its relevance across a range of flows, helicity in real <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>s remains poorly understood because the entire quantity is challenging to measure. We measured the total helicity of thin-core vortex tubes in water. For helical vortices that are stretched or compressed by a second vortex, we found conservation of total helicity. For an isolated helical vortex, we observed evolution toward and maintenance of a constant helicity state after the dissipation of twist helicity by viscosity. Our results show that helicity can remain constant even in a viscous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> and provide an improved basis for understanding and manipulating helicity in real flows.</p>

HAT-P-26b: A Neptune-mass exoplanet with a well-constrained heavy element abundance
<p>A correlation between giant-planet mass and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic heavy elemental abundance was first noted in the past century from observations of planets in our own Solar System and has served as a cornerstone of planet-formation theory. Using data from the Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescopes from 0.5 to 5 micrometers, we conducted a detailed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic study of the transiting Neptune-mass exoplanet HAT-P-26b. We detected prominent H<sub>2</sub>O absorption bands with a maximum base-to-peak amplitude of 525 parts per million in the transmission spectrum. Using the water abundance as a proxy for metallicity, we measured HAT-P-26b’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic heavy element content ([Formula] times solar). This likely indicates that HAT-P-26b’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>e is primordial and obtained its gaseous envelope late in its disk lifetime, with little contamination from metal-rich planetesimals.</p>

Rewiring metabolism under oxygen deprivation

Transition from turbulent to coherent flows in confined three-dimensional active fluids
<p>Transport of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> through a pipe is essential for the operation of macroscale machines and micro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>ic devices. Conventional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>s only flow in response to external pressure. We demonstrate that an active isotropic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>, composed of microtubules and molecular motors, autonomously flows through meter-long three-dimensional channels. We establish control over the magnitude, velocity profile, and direction of the self-organized flows and correlate these to the structure of the extensile microtubule bundles. The inherently three-dimensional transition from bulk-turbulent to confined-coherent flows occurs concomitantly with a transition in the bundle orientational order near the surface and is controlled by a scale-invariant criterion related to the channel profile. The nonequilibrium transition of confined isotropic active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>s can be used to engineer self-organized soft machines.</p>

Direct observation of individual hydrogen atoms at trapping sites in a ferritic steel

First, we charged a ferritic steel with deuterium by means of electrolytic loading to achieve a high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> concentration. We then immobilized it in the microstructure with a cryogenic transfer protocol before atom probe tomography (APT) analysis.

Furthermore, with this method the experiment can be feasibly replicated in any APT-equipped laboratory by using a simple cold chain.</p>

Archaeal (Per)Chlorate Reduction at High Temperature: An Interplay of Biotic and Abiotic Reactions

The archaeal perchlorate reduction pathway shares limited similarity with bacterial perchlorate reduction: Instead of producing chloride and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>, enzymatically produced chlorite reacts with sulfide to produce oxidized sulfur compounds. Because hyperthermophilic anaerobic archaea similar to <i>A. fulgidus</i> are thought to have been among the first complex organisms to evolve on Earth, they may have started creating oxidized conditions in some habitats before the emergence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>-generating photosynthesis.</p></sec>

BZR1 Mediates Brassinosteroid-Induced Autophagy and Nitrogen Starvation in Tomato
<p>Autophagy, an innate cellular destructive mechanism, plays crucial roles in plant development and responses to stress. Autophagy is known to be stimulated or suppressed by multiple molecular processes, but the role of phytohormone signaling in autophagy is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the transcripts of autophagy-related genes (<i>ATGs</i>) and the formation of autophagosomes are triggered by enhanced levels of brassinosteroid (BR). Furthermore, the BR-activated transcription factor brassinazole-resistant1 (BZR1), a positive regulator of the BR signaling pathway, is involved in BR-induced autophagy. Treatment with BR enhanced the formation of autophagosomes and the transcripts of <i>ATGs</i> in <i>BZR1</i>-overexpressing plants, while the effects of BR were compromised in <i>BZR1</i>-silenced plants. Yeast one-hybrid analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with quantitative polymerase chain reaction revealed that BZR1 bound to the promoters of <i>ATG2</i> and <i>ATG6</i>. The BR-induced formation of autophagosomes decreased in <i>ATG2</i>- and <i>ATG6</i>-silenced plants. Moreover, exogenous application of BR enhanced chlorophyll content and autophagosome formation and decreased the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> starvation. Leaf chlorosis and chlorophyll degradation were exacerbated in <i>BZR1</i>-silenced plants and the BR biosynthetic mutant <i>d<sup>^im</sup></i> but were alleviated in <i>BZR1</i>- and <i>BZR1-1D</i>-overexpressing plants under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> starvation. Meanwhile, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> starvation-induced expression of <i>ATGs</i> and autophagosome formation were compromised in both <i>BZR1</i>-silenced and <i>d<sup>^im</sup></i> plants but were increased in <i>BZR1</i>- and <i>BZR1-1D</i>-overexpressing plants. Taken together, our results suggest that BZR1-dependent BR signaling up-regulates the expression of <i>ATGs</i> and autophagosome formation, which plays a critical role in the plant response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> starvation in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>).</p>

Chlorophyll Can Be Reduced in Crop Canopies with Little Penalty to Photosynthesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The hypothesis that reducing chlorophyll content (Chl) can increase canopy photosynthesis in soybeans was tested using an advanced model of canopy photosynthesis. The relationship among leaf Chl, leaf optical properties, and photosynthetic biochemical capacity was measured in 67 soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) accessions showing large variation in leaf Chl. These relationships were integrated into a biophysical model of canopy-scale photosynthesis to simulate the intercanopy light environment and carbon assimilation capacity of canopies with wild type, a Chl-deficient mutant (<i>Y11y11</i>), and 67 other mutants spanning the extremes of Chl to quantify the impact of variation in leaf-level Chl on canopy-scale photosynthetic assimilation and identify possible opportunities for improving canopy photosynthesis through Chl reduction. These simulations demonstrate that canopy photosynthesis should not increase with Chl reduction due to increases in leaf reflectance and nonoptimal distribution of canopy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong>. However, similar rates of canopy photosynthesis can be maintained with a 9% savings in leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> resulting from decreased Chl. Additionally, analysis of these simulations indicate that the inability of Chl reductions to increase photosynthesis arises primarily from the connection between Chl and leaf reflectance and secondarily from the mismatch between the vertical distribution of leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> and the light absorption profile. These simulations suggest that future work should explore the possibility of using reduced Chl to improve canopy performance by adapting the distribution of the “saved” <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> within the canopy to take greater advantage of the more deeply penetrating light.</p>

Dynamics of Ethylene Production in Response to Compatible Nod Factor
<p>Establishment of symbiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong>-fixation in legumes is regulated by the plant hormone ethylene, but it has remained unclear whether and how its biosynthesis is regulated by the symbiotic pathway. We established a sensitive ethylene detection system for <i>Lotus japonicus</i> and found that ethylene production increased as early as 6 hours after inoculation with <i>Mesorhizobium loti</i>. This ethylene response was dependent on Nod factor production by compatible rhizobia. Analyses of nodulation mutants showed that perception of Nod factor was required for ethylene emission, while downstream transcription factors including CYCLOPS, NIN, and ERN1 were not required for this response. Activation of the nodulation signaling pathway in spontaneously nodulating mutants was also sufficient to elevate ethylene production. Ethylene signaling is controlled by EIN2, which is duplicated in <i>L. japonicus</i>. We obtained a <i>L. japonicus Ljein2a Ljein2b</i> double mutant that exhibits complete ethylene insensitivity and confirms that these two genes act redundantly in ethylene signaling. Consistent with this redundancy, both <i>LjEin2a</i> and <i>LjEin2b</i> are required for negative regulation of nodulation and <i>Ljein2a Ljein2b</i> double mutants are hypernodulating and hyperinfected. We also identified an unexpected role for ethylene in the onset of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> fixation, with the <i>Ljein2a Ljein2b</i> double mutant showing severely reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> fixation. These results demonstrate that ethylene production is an early and sustained nodulation response that acts at multiple stages to regulate infection, nodule organogenesis, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> fixation in <i>L. japonicus</i>.</p>

Predicting Dynamic Metabolic Demands in the Photosynthetic Eukaryote <i>Chlorella vulgaris</i>
<p>Phototrophic organisms exhibit a highly dynamic proteome, adapting their biomass composition in response to diurnal light/dark cycles and nutrient availability. Here, we used experimentally determined biomass compositions over the course of growth to determine and constrain the biomass objective function (BOF) in a genome-scale metabolic model of <i>Chlorella vulgaris</i> UTEX 395 over time. Changes in the BOF, which encompasses all metabolites necessary to produce biomass, influence the state of the metabolic network thus directly affecting predictions. Simulations using dynamic BOFs predicted distinct proteome demands during heterotrophic or photoautotrophic growth. Model-driven analysis of extracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> concentrations and predicted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> uptake rates revealed an intracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> pool, which contains 38% of the total <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> provided in the medium for photoautotrophic and 13% for heterotrophic growth. Agreement between flux and gene expression trends was determined by statistical comparison. Accordance between predicted flux trends and gene expression trends was found for 65% of multisubunit enzymes and 75% of allosteric reactions. Reactions with the highest agreement between simulations and experimental data were associated with energy metabolism, terpenoid biosynthesis, fatty acids, nucleotides, and amino acid metabolism. Furthermore, predicted flux distributions at each time point were compared with gene expression data to gain new insights into intracellular compartmentalization, specifically for transporters. A total of 103 genes related to internal transport reactions were identified and added to the updated model of <i>C. vulgaris</i>, <i>i</i>CZ946, thus increasing our knowledgebase by 10% for this model green alga.</p>

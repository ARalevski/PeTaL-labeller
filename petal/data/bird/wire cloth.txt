Prevalence and Predictors of Cholesterol Screening, Awareness, and Statin Treatment Among US Adults With Familial Hypercholesterolemia or Other Forms of Severe Dyslipidemia (1999–2014)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and other extreme elevations in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol significantly increase the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; however, recent data suggest that prescription rates for statins remain low in these patients. National rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing, awareness, and treatment with statins among individuals with FH or severe dyslipidemia are unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data from the 1999 to 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were used to estimate prevalence rates of self-reported <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing, awareness, and statin therapy among US adults (n=42 471 weighted to represent 212 million US adults) with FH (defined using the Dutch Lipid Clinic criteria) and with severe dyslipidemia (defined as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels ≥190 mg/dL). Logistic regression was used to identify sociodemographic and clinical correlates of hypercholesterolemia awareness and statin therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The estimated US prevalence of definite/probable FH was 0.47% (standard error, 0.03%) and of severe dyslipidemia was 6.6% (standard error, 0.2%). The frequency of cholesterol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing and awareness was high (>80%) among adults with definite/probable FH or severe dyslipidemia; however, statin use was uniformly low (52.3% [standard error, 8.2%] of adults with definite/probable FH and 37.6% [standard error, 1.2%] of adults with severe dyslipidemia). Only 30.3% of patients with definite/probable FH on statins were taking a high-intensity statin. The prevalence of statin use in adults with severe dyslipidemia increased over time (from 29.4% to 47.7%) but not faster than trends in the general population (from 5.7% to 17.6%). Older age, health insurance status, having a usual source of care, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and having a personal history of early atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease were associated with higher statin use.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Despite the high prevalence of cholesterol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing and awareness, only ≈50% of adults with FH are on statin therapy, with even fewer prescribed a high-intensity statin; young and uninsured patients are at the highest risk for lack of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing and for undertreatment. This study highlights an imperative to improve the frequency of cholesterol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing and statin prescription rates to better identify and treat this high-risk population. Additional studies are needed to better understand how to close these gaps in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing and treatment.</p></sec>

Outcome of the Swedish Nationwide Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Screening Program
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>A general abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing program, targeting 65-year-old men, has gradually been introduced in Sweden since 2006 and reached nationwide coverage in 2015. The aim of this study was to determine the outcome of this program.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data on the number of invited and examined men, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing-detected AAAs, AAAs operated on, and surgical outcome were retrieved from all 21 Swedish counties for the years 2006 through 2014. AAA-specific mortality data were retrieved from the Swedish Cause of Death Registry. A linear regression analysis was used to estimate the effect on AAA-specific mortality among all men ≥65 years of age for the observed time period. The long-term effects were projected by using a validated Markov model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 302 957 men aged 65 years invited, 84% attended. The prevalence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing-detected AAA was 1.5%. After a mean of 4.5 years, 29% of patients with AAA had been operated on, with a 30-day mortality rate of 0.9% (1.3% after open repair and 0.3% after endovascular repair, <i>P</i><0.001). The introduction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing was associated with a significant reduction in AAA-specific mortality (mean, 4.0% per year of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing, <i>P</i>=0.020). The number needed to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong> and the number needed to operate on to prevent 1 premature death were 667 and 1.5, respectively. With a total population of 9.5 million, the Swedish national AAA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing program was predicted to annually prevent 90 premature deaths from AAA and to gain 577 quality-adjusted life-years. The incremental cost-efficiency ratio was estimated to be €7770 per quality-adjusted life-years.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing 65-year-old men for AAA is an effective preventive health measure and is highly cost-effective in a contemporary setting. These findings confirm the results from earlier randomized controlled trials and model studies in a large population-based setting of the importance for future healthcare decision making.</p></sec>

Histopathology reveals correlative and unique phenotypes in a high-throughput mouse phenotyping screen
<p>The Mouse Genetics Project (MGP) at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute aims to generate and phenotype over 800 genetically modified mouse lines over the next 5 years to gain a better understanding of mammalian gene function and provide an invaluable resource to the scientific community for follow-up studies. Phenotyping includes the generation of a standardized biobank of paraffin-embedded tissues for each mouse line, but histopathology is not routinely performed. In collaboration with the Pathology Core of the Centre for Modeling Human Disease (CMHD) we report the utility of histopathology in a high-throughput primary phenotyping <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>. Histopathology was assessed in an unbiased selection of 50 mouse lines with (<i>n</i>=30) or without (<i>n</i>=20) clinical phenotypes detected by the standard MGP primary phenotyping <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>. Our findings revealed that histopathology added correlating morphological data in 19 of 30 lines (63.3%) in which the primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong> detected a phenotype. In addition, seven of the 50 lines (14%) presented significant histopathology findings that were not associated with or predicted by the standard primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>. Three of these seven lines had no clinical phenotype detected by the standard primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>. Incidental and strain-associated background lesions were present in all mutant lines with good concordance to wild-type controls. These findings demonstrate the complementary and unique contribution of histopathology to high-throughput primary phenotyping of mutant mice.</p>

Plant Chemical Genetics: From Phenotype-Based Screens to Synthetic Biology
<p>The treatment of a biological system with small molecules to specifically perturb cellular functions is commonly referred to as chemical biology. Small molecules are used commercially as drugs, herbicides, and fungicides in different systems, but in recent years they are increasingly exploited as tools for basic research. For instance, chemical genetics involves the discovery of small-molecule effectors of various cellular functions through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>s of compound libraries. Whereas the drug discovery field has largely been driven by target-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing approaches followed by drug optimization, chemical genetics in plant systems tends to be fueled by more general phenotype-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>s, opening the possibility to identify a wide range of small molecules that are not necessarily directly linked to the process of interest. Here, we provide an overview of the current progress in chemical genetics in plants, with a focus on the discoveries regarding small molecules identified in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>s designed with a basic biology perspective. We reflect on the possibilities that lie ahead and discuss some of the potential pitfalls that might be encountered upon adopting a given chemical genetics approach.</p>

Late presentation of developmental dysplasia of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Despite the presence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing programmes, infants continue   to present with late developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), the   impact of which is significant. The aim of this study was to assess   infants with late presenting dislocation of the hip despite universal   clinical neonatal and selective ultrasound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between 01 January 1997 to 31 December 2011, a prospective, longitudinal   study was undertaken of a cohort of 64 670 live births. Late presenting   dislocation was defined as presentation after three months of age.   Diagnosis was confirmed by ultrasound and plain radiography.

Screening for Biologically Annotated Drugs That Trigger Triacylglycerol Accumulation in the Diatom <i>Phaeodactylum</i>
<p>Microalgae are a promising feedstock for the production of triacylglycerol (TAG) for a variety of potential applications, ranging from food and human health to biofuels and green chemistry. However, obtaining high TAG yields is challenging. A phenotypic assay for the accumulation of oil droplets was developed to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong> a library of 1,200 drugs, annotated with pharmacology information, to select compounds that trigger TAG accumulation in the diatom <i>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</i>. Using this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>, we identified 34 molecules acting in a dose-dependent manner. Previously characterized targets of these compounds include cell division and cell signaling effectors, membrane receptors and transporters, and sterol metabolism. Among the five compounds possibly acting on sterol metabolism, we focused our study on ethynylestradiol, a synthetic form of estrogen that is used in contraceptive pills and known for its ecological impact as an endocrine disruptor. Ethynylestradiol impaired the production of very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, destabilized the galactolipid versus phospholipid balance, and triggered the recycling of fatty acids from membrane lipids to TAG. The <i>P. tricornutum</i> transcriptomic response to treatment with ethynylestradiol was consistent with the reallocation of carbon from sterols to acetyl-coenzyme A and TAG. The mode of action and catabolism of ethynylestradiol are unknown but might involve several up-regulated cytochrome P450 proteins. A fatty acid elongase, Δ6-ELO-B1, might be involved in the impairment of very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids and fatty acid turnover. This phenotypic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong> opens new perspectives for the exploration of novel bioactive molecules, potential target genes, and pathways controlling TAG biosynthesis. It also unraveled the sensitivity of diatoms to endocrine disruptors, highlighting an impact of anthropogenic pollution on phytoplankton.</p>

Branched Pectic Galactan in Phloem-Sieve-Element Cell Walls: Implications for Cell Mechanics
<p>A major question in plant biology concerns the specification and functional differentiation of cell types. This is in the context of constraints imposed by networks of cell walls that both adhere cells and contribute to the form and function of developing organs. Here, we report the identification of a glycan epitope that is specific to phloem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">siev</span></strong>e element cell walls in several systems. A monoclonal antibody, designated LM26, binds to the cell wall of phloem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">siev</span></strong>e elements in stems of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), <i>Miscanthus</i> x <i>giganteus</i>, and notably sugar beet (<i>Beta vulgaris</i>) roots where phloem identification is an important factor for the study of phloem unloading of Suc. Using microarrays of synthetic oligosaccharides, the LM26 epitope has been identified as a β-1,6-galactosyl substitution of β-1,4-galactan requiring more than three backbone residues for optimized recognition. This branched galactan structure has previously been identified in garlic (<i>Allium sativum</i>) bulbs in which the LM26 epitope is widespread throughout most cell walls including those of phloem cells. Garlic bulb cell wall material has been used to confirm the association of the LM26 epitope with cell wall pectic rhamnogalacturonan-I polysaccharides. In the phloem tissues of grass stems, the LM26 epitope has a complementary pattern to that of the LM5 linear β-1,4-galactan epitope, which is detected only in companion cell walls. Mechanical probing of transverse sections of <i>M</i>. x <i>giganteus</i> stems and leaves by atomic force microscopy indicates that phloem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">siev</span></strong>e element cell walls have a lower indentation modulus (indicative of higher elasticity) than companion cell walls.</p>

Arabidopsis <i>ACTIN-DEPOLYMERIZING FACTOR3</i> Is Required for Controlling Aphid Feeding from the Phloem
<p>The actin cytoskeleton network has an important role in plant cell growth, division, and stress response. Actin-depolymerizing factors (ADFs) are a group of actin-binding proteins that contribute to reorganization of the actin network. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>ADF3</i> is required in the phloem for controlling infestation by <i>Myzus persicae</i> Sulzer, commonly known as the green peach aphid (GPA), which is an important phloem sap-consuming pest of more than fifty plant families. In agreement with a role for the actin-depolymerizing function of ADF3 in defense against the GPA, we show that resistance in <i>adf3</i> was restored by overexpression of the related ADF4 and the actin cytoskeleton destabilizers, cytochalasin D and latrunculin B. Electrical monitoring of the GPA feeding behavior indicates that the GPA stylets found <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">siev</span></strong>e elements faster when feeding on the <i>adf3</i> mutant compared to the wild-type plant. In addition, once they found the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">siev</span></strong>e elements, the GPA fed for a more prolonged period from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">siev</span></strong>e elements of <i>adf3</i> compared to the wild-type plant. The longer feeding period correlated with an increase in fecundity and population size of the GPA and a parallel reduction in callose deposition in the <i>adf3</i> mutant. The <i>adf3</i>-conferred susceptibility to GPA was overcome by expression of the <i>ADF3</i> coding sequence from the phloem-specific <i>SUC2</i> promoter, thus confirming the importance of <i>ADF3</i> function in the phloem. We further demonstrate that the <i>ADF3</i>-dependent defense mechanism is linked to the transcriptional up-regulation of <i>PHYTOALEXIN-DEFICIENT4</i>, which is an important regulator of defenses against the GPA.</p>

Sucrose Transporter Localization and Function in Phloem Unloading in Developing Stems
<p>How sucrose transporters (SUTs) regulate phloem unloading in monocot stems is poorly understood and particularly so for species storing high Suc concentrations. To this end, <i>Sorghum bicolor</i> SUTs SbSUT1 and SbSUT5 were characterized by determining their transport properties heterologously expressed in yeast or <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes, and their in planta cellular and subcellular localization. The plasma membrane-localized SbSUT1 and SbSUT5 exhibited a strong selectivity for Suc and high Suc affinities in <i>X. laevis</i> oocytes at pH 5—SbSUT1, 6.3 ± 0.7 m<sc>m,</sc> and SbSUT5, 2.4 ± 0.5 m<sc>m</sc> Suc. The Suc affinity of SbSUT1 was dependent on membrane potential and pH. In contrast, SbSUT5 Suc affinity was independent of membrane potential and pH but supported high transport rates at neutral pH. Suc transport by the tonoplast localized SbSUT4 could not be detected using yeast or <i>X. laevis</i> oocytes. Across internode development, SUTs, other than SbSUT4, were immunolocalized to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">siev</span></strong>e elements, while for elongating and recently elongated internodes, SUTs also were detected in storage parenchyma cells. We conclude that apoplasmic Suc unloading from de-energized protophloem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">siev</span></strong>e elements in meristematic zones may be mediated by reversal of SbSUT1 and/or by uniporting SWEETs. Storage parenchyma localized SbSUT1 and SbSUT5 may accumulate Suc from the stem apoplasms of elongating and recently elongated internodes, whereas SbSUT4 may function to release Suc from vacuoles. Transiting from an apoplasmic to symplasmic unloading pathway as the stem matures, SbSUT1 and SbSUT5 increasingly function in Suc retrieval into metaphloem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">siev</span></strong>e elements to maintain a high turgor to drive symplasmic unloading by bulk flow.</p>

Biomimetic shark skin: design, fabrication and hydrodynamic function
<p>Although the functional properties of shark skin have been of considerable interest to both biologists and engineers because of the complex hydrodynamic effects of surface roughness, no study to date has successfully <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fabric</span></strong>ated a flexible biomimetic shark skin that allows detailed study of hydrodynamic function. We present the first study of the design, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fabric</span></strong>ation and hydrodynamic testing of a synthetic, flexible, shark skin membrane. A three-dimensional (3D) model of shark skin denticles was constructed using micro-CT imaging of the skin of the shortfin mako (<i>Isurus oxyrinchus</i>). Using 3D printing, thousands of rigid synthetic shark denticles were placed on flexible membranes in a controlled, linear-arrayed pattern. This flexible 3D printed shark skin model was then tested in water using a robotic flapping device that allowed us to either hold the models in a stationary position or move them dynamically at their self-propelled swimming speed. Compared with a smooth control model without denticles, the 3D printed shark skin showed increased swimming speed with reduced energy consumption under certain motion programs. For example, at a heave frequency of 1.5 Hz and an amplitude of ±1 cm, swimming speed increased by 6.6% and the energy cost-of-transport was reduced by 5.9%. In addition, a leading-edge vortex with greater vorticity than the smooth control was generated by the 3D printed shark skin, which may explain the increased swimming speeds. The ability to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fabric</span></strong>ate synthetic biomimetic shark skin opens up a wide array of possible manipulations of surface roughness parameters, and the ability to examine the hydrodynamic consequences of diverse skin denticle shapes present in different shark species.</p>

Perioperative Myocardial Injury After Noncardiac Surgery
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Perioperative myocardial injury (PMI) seems to be a contributor to mortality after noncardiac surgery. Because the vast majority of PMIs are asymptomatic, PMI usually is missed in the absence of systematic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed a prospective diagnostic study enrolling consecutive patients undergoing noncardiac surgery who had a planned postoperative stay of ≥24 hours and were considered at increased cardiovascular risk. All patients received a systematic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing using serial measurements of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T in clinical routine. PMI was defined as an absolute high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T increase of ≥14 ng/L from preoperative to postoperative measurements. Furthermore, mortality was compared among patients with PMI not fulfilling additional criteria (ischemic symptoms, new ECG changes, or imaging evidence of loss of viable myocardium) required for the diagnosis of spontaneous acute myocardial infarction versus those that did.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>From 2014 to 2015 we included 2018 consecutive patients undergoing 2546 surgeries. Patients had a median age of 74 years and 42% were women. PMI occurred after 397 of 2546 surgeries (16%; 95% confidence interval, 14%–17%) and was accompanied by typical chest pain in 24 of 397 patients (6%) and any ischemic symptoms in 72 of 397 (18%). Crude 30-day mortality was 8.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.7–12.0) in patients with PMI versus 1.5% (95% CI, 0.9–2.0) in patients without PMI (<i>P</i><0.001).

FAK–Src signalling is important to renal collecting duct morphogenesis: discovery using a hierarchical screening technique
<p>This report describes a hierarchical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing technique for identification of pathways that control the morphogenesis of the renal collecting duct system. The multi-step <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong> involves a first round using a 2-dimensional, cell-line-based scrape-healing assay, then a second round using a 3-dimensional tubulogenesis assay; both of these rounds use new cell lines described in this report. The final stage is <i>ex vivo</i> organ culture. We demonstrate the utility of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong> by using it to identify the FAK–Src-pathway signalling as being important for collecting duct development, specifically for the cell proliferation on which this development depends.</p>

The receptor tyrosine kinase HIR-1 coordinates HIF-independent responses to hypoxia and extracellular matrix injury
<p>Inadequate tissue oxygen, or hypoxia, is a central concept in the pathophysiology of ischemic disorders and cancer. Hypoxia promotes extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, cellular metabolic adaptation, and cancer cell metastasis. To discover new pathways through which cells respond to hypoxia, we performed a large-scale forward genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong> in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> and identified a previously uncharacterized receptor tyrosine kinase named HIR-1. Loss of function in <i>hir-1</i> phenocopied the impaired ECM integrity associated with hypoxia or deficiency in the oxygen-dependent dual oxidase, heme peroxidases, or cuticular collagens involved in ECM homeostasis. Genetic suppressor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>s identified NHR-49 and MDT-15 as transcriptional regulators downstream of HIR-1. Furthermore, <i>hir-1</i> mutants showed defects in adapting to and recovering from prolonged severe hypoxia. We propose that <i>C. elegans</i> HIR-1 coordinates hypoxia-inducible factor–independent responses to hypoxia and hypoxia-associated ECM remodeling through mechanisms that are likely conserved in other organisms.</p>

Identification of Toll-like receptor signaling inhibitors based on selective activation of hierarchically acting signaling proteins
<p>Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize various pathogen- and host tissue–derived molecules and initiate inflammatory immune responses. Exaggerated or prolonged TLR activation, however, can lead to etiologically diverse diseases, such as bacterial sepsis, metabolic and autoimmune diseases, or stroke. Despite the apparent medical need, no small-molecule drugs against TLR pathways are clinically available. This may be because of the complex signaling mechanisms of TLRs, which are governed by a series of protein-protein interactions initiated by Toll/interleukin-1 receptor homology domains (TIR) found in TLRs and the cytoplasmic adaptor proteins TIRAP and MyD88. Oligomerization of TLRs with MyD88 or TIRAP leads to the recruitment of members of the IRAK family of kinases and the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF6. We developed a phenotypic drug <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing system based on the inducible homodimerization of either TIRAP, MyD88, or TRAF6, that ranked hits according to their hierarchy of action. From a bioactive compound library, we identified methyl-piperidino-pyrazole (MPP) as a TLR-specific inhibitor. Structure-activity relationship analysis, quantitative proteomics, protein-protein interaction assays, and cellular thermal shift assays suggested that MPP targets the TIR domain of MyD88. Chemical evolution of the original MPP scaffold generated compounds with selectivity for distinct TLRs that interfered with specific TIR interactions. Administration of an MPP analog to mice protected them from TLR4-dependent inflammation. These results validate this phenotypic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing approach and suggest that the MPP scaffold could serve as a starting point for the development of anti-inflammatory drugs.</p>

CDK12-mediated transcriptional regulation of noncanonical NF-κB components is essential for signaling
<p>Members of the family of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) transcription factors are critical for multiple cellular processes, including regulating innate and adaptive immune responses, cell proliferation, and cell survival. Canonical NF-κB complexes are retained in the cytoplasm by the inhibitory protein IκBα, whereas noncanonical NF-κB complexes are retained by p100. Although activation of canonical NF-κB signaling through the IκBα kinase complex is well studied, few regulators of the NF-κB–inducing kinase (NIK)–dependent processing of noncanonical p100 to p52 and the subsequent nuclear translocation of p52 have been identified. We discovered a role for cyclin-dependent kinase 12 (CDK12) in transcriptionally regulating the noncanonical NF-κB pathway. High-content phenotypic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing identified the compound 919278 as a specific inhibitor of the lymphotoxin β receptor (LTβR), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily member 12A (FN14)–dependent nuclear translocation of p52, but not of the TNF-α receptor–mediated nuclear translocation of p65. Chemoproteomics identified CDK12 as the target of 919278. CDK12 inhibition by 919278, the CDK inhibitor THZ1, or siRNA-mediated knockdown resulted in similar global transcriptional changes and prevented the LTβR- and FN14-dependent expression of <i>MAP3K14</i> (which encodes NIK) as well as NIK accumulation by reducing phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II. By coupling a phenotypic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong> with chemoproteomics, we identified a pathway for the activation of the noncanonical NF-κB pathway that could serve as a therapeutic target in autoimmunity and cancer.</p>

Hyperactive locomotion in a <i>Drosophila</i> model is a functional readout for the synaptic abnormalities underlying fragile X syndrome
<p>Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common cause of heritable intellectual disability and autism and affects ~1 in 4000 males and 1 in 8000 females. The discovery of effective treatments for FXS has been hampered by the lack of effective animal models and phenotypic readouts for drug <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing. FXS ensues from the epigenetic silencing or loss-of-function mutation of the <i>fragile X mental retardation 1</i> (<i>FMR1</i>) gene, which encodes an RNA binding protein that associates with and represses the translation of target mRNAs. We previously found that the activation of LIM kinase 1 (LIMK1) downstream of augmented synthesis of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type 2 receptor (BMPR2) promotes aberrant synaptic development in mouse and <i>Drosophila</i> models of FXS and that these molecular and cellular markers were correlated in patients with FXS. We report that larval locomotion is augmented in a <i>Drosophila</i> FXS model. Genetic or pharmacological intervention on the BMPR2-LIMK pathway ameliorated the synaptic abnormality and locomotion phenotypes of FXS larvae, as well as hyperactivity in an FXS mouse model. Our study demonstrates that (i) the BMPR2-LIMK pathway is a promising therapeutic target for FXS and (ii) the locomotion phenotype of FXS larvae is a quantitative functional readout for the neuromorphological phenotype associated with FXS and is amenable to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing novel FXS therapeutics.</p>

An ER surface retrieval pathway safeguards the import of mitochondrial membrane proteins in yeast
<p>The majority of organellar proteins are translated on cytosolic ribosomes and must be sorted correctly to function. Targeting routes have been identified for organelles such as peroxisomes and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). However, little is known about the initial steps of targeting of mitochondrial proteins. In this study, we used a genome-wide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong> in yeast and identified factors critical for the intracellular sorting of the mitochondrial inner membrane protein Oxa1. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong> uncovered an unexpected path, termed ER-SURF, for targeting of mitochondrial membrane proteins. This pathway retrieves mitochondrial proteins from the ER surface and reroutes them to mitochondria with the aid of the ER-localized chaperone Djp1. Hence, cells use the expanse of the ER surfaces as a fail-safe to maximize productive mitochondrial protein targeting.</p>

Domain-focused CRISPR screen identifies HRI as a fetal hemoglobin regulator in human erythroid cells
<p>Increasing fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels in adult red blood cells provides clinical benefit to patients with sickle cell disease and some forms of β-thalassemia. To identify potentially druggable HbF regulators in adult human erythroid cells, we employed a protein kinase domain–focused CRISPR-Cas9–based genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong> with a newly optimized single-guide RNA scaffold. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong> uncovered the heme-regulated inhibitor HRI (also known as EIF2AK1), an erythroid-specific kinase that controls protein translation, as an HbF repressor. HRI depletion markedly increased HbF production in a specific manner and reduced sickling in cultured erythroid cells. Diminished expression of the HbF repressor BCL11A accounted in large part for the effects of HRI depletion. Taken together, these results suggest HRI as a potential therapeutic target for hemoglobinopathies.</p>

Bottom-up synthesis of multifunctional nanoporous graphene

Here we report a bottom-up method to synthesize nanoporous graphene comprising an ordered array of pores separated by ribbons, which can be tuned down to the 1-nanometer range. The size, density, morphology, and chemical composition of the pores are defined with atomic precision by the design of the molecular precursors. Our electronic characterization further reveals a highly anisotropic electronic structure, where orthogonal one-dimensional electronic bands with an energy gap of ∼1 electron volt coexist with confined pore states, making the nanoporous graphene a highly versatile semiconductor for simultaneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">siev</span></strong>ing and electrical sensing of molecular species.</p>

Cancer detection: Seeking signals in blood
<p>Most cancers are detected when they cause symptoms that lead to medical evaluation. Unfortunately, in too many cases this results in diagnosis of cancers that are locally invasive or already metastatic and hence no longer curable with surgical resection or radiation treatment.

Size effect in ion transport through angstrom-scale slits

We report ion transport through ultimately narrow slits that are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fabric</span></strong>ated by effectively removing a single atomic plane from a bulk crystal. The atomically flat angstrom-scale slits exhibit little surface charge, allowing elucidation of the role of steric effects. We find that ions with hydrated diameters larger than the slit size can still permeate through, albeit with reduced mobility. The confinement also leads to a notable asymmetry between anions and cations of the same diameter. Our results provide a platform for studying the effects of angstrom-scale confinement, which is important for the development of nanofluidics, molecular separation, and other nanoscale technologies.</p>

The Citrus Transcription Factor CsMADS6 Modulates Carotenoid Metabolism by Directly Regulating Carotenogenic Genes
<p>Although remarkable progress has been made toward understanding carotenoid biosynthesis, the mechanisms that regulate the transcription of carotenogenic genes remain poorly understood. Lycopene β-cyclases (LCYb) are critical enzymes located at the branch point of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway. Here, we used the promoter sequence of <i>LCYb1</i> as bait in a yeast one-hybrid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong> for promoter-binding proteins from sweet orange (<i>Citrus sinensis</i>). This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong> identified a MADS transcription factor, CsMADS6, that was coordinately expressed with fruit development and coloration. Acting as a nucleus-localized transcriptional activator, CsMADS6 directly bound the promoter of <i>LCYb1</i> and activated its expression. Overexpression of <i>CsMADS6</i> in citrus calli increased carotenoid contents and induced the expression of <i>LCYb1</i> and other carotenogenic genes, including <i>phytoene synthase</i> (<i>PSY</i>), <i>phytoene desaturase</i> (<i>PDS</i>), and <i>carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase1</i> (<i>CCD1</i>). CsMADS6 up-regulated the expression of <i>PSY</i>, <i>PDS</i>, and <i>CCD1</i> by directly binding to their promoters, which suggested the multitargeted regulation of carotenoid metabolism by CsMADS6. In addition, the ectopic expression of <i>CsMADS6</i> in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) affected carotenoid contents and the expression of carotenogenic genes. The sepals of <i>CsMADS6</i>-overexpressing tomato lines exhibited dramatic changes in carotenoid profiles, accompanied by changes in plastid ultrastructure. Global transcriptome analysis of transgenic sepals revealed that CsMADS6 regulates a series of pathways that promote increases in flux through the carotenoid pathway. Overall, these findings establish that CsMADS6 directly regulates <i>LCYb1</i> and other carotenogenic genes to coordinately and positively modulate carotenoid metabolism in plants, which may provide strategies to improve the nutritional quality of crops.</p>

Identification of a New Host Factor Required for Antiviral RNAi and Amplification of Viral siRNAs
<p>Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are processed from virus-specific dsRNA to direct antiviral RNA interference (RNAi) in diverse eukaryotic hosts. We have recently performed a sensitized genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and identified two related phospholipid flippases required for antiviral RNAi and the amplification of virus-derived siRNAs by plant RNA-dependent RNA polymerase1 (RDR1) and RDR6. Here we report the identification and cloning of <i>ANTIVIRAL RNAI</i>-<i>DEFECTIVE2</i> (<i>AVI2</i>) from the same genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>. <i>AVI2</i> encodes a multispan transmembrane protein broadly conserved in plants and animals with two homologous human proteins known as magnesium transporters. We show that <i>avi2</i> mutant plants display no developmental defects and develop severe disease symptoms after infection with a mutant <i>Cucumber mosaic virus</i> (CMV) defective in RNAi suppression. <i>AVI2</i> is induced by CMV infection, particularly in veins, and is required for antiviral RNAi and RDR6-dependent biogenesis of viral siRNAs. AVI2 is also necessary for Dicer-like2-mediated amplification of 22-nucleotide viral siRNAs induced in <i>dcl4</i> mutant plants by infection, but dispensable for RDR6-dependent biogenesis of endogenous transacting siRNAs. Further genetic studies illustrate that AVI2 plays a partially redundant role with AVI2H, the most closely related member in the <i>AVI2</i> gene family, in RDR1-dependent biogenesis of viral siRNAs and the endogenous virus-activated siRNAs (vasi-RNAs). Interestingly, we discovered a specific genetic interaction of AVI2 with AVI1 flippase that is critical for plant development. We propose that AVI1 and AVI2 participate in the virus-induced formation of the RDR1/RDR6-specific, membrane-bound RNA synthesis compartment, essential for the biogenesis of highly abundant viral siRNAs and vasi-RNAs.</p>

A Genetic Screen for Impaired Systemic RNAi Highlights the Crucial Role of DICER-LIKE 2
<p>Posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS) of transgenes involves abundant 21-nucleotide small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and low-abundance 22-nucleotide siRNAs produced from double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) by DCL4 and DCL2, respectively. However, DCL2 facilitates the recruitment of RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE 6 (RDR6) to ARGONAUTE 1-derived cleavage products, resulting in more efficient amplification of secondary and transitive dsRNA and siRNAs. Here, we describe a reporter system where RDR6-dependent PTGS is initiated by restricted expression of an inverted-repeat dsRNA specifically in the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) root tip, allowing a genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong> to identify mutants impaired in RDR6-dependent systemic PTGS. Our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong> identified <i>dcl2</i> but not <i>dcl4</i> mutants. Moreover, grafting experiments showed that DCL2, but not DCL4, is required in both the source rootstock and the recipient shoot tissue for efficient RDR6-dependent systemic PTGS. Furthermore, <i>dcl4</i> rootstocks produced more DCL2-dependent 22-nucleotide siRNAs than the wild type and showed enhanced systemic movement of PTGS to grafted shoots. Thus, along with its role in recruiting RDR6 for further amplification of PTGS, DCL2 is crucial for RDR6-dependent systemic PTGS.</p>

Variation in Leaf Respiration Rates at Night Correlates with Carbohydrate and Amino Acid Supply
<p>Plant respiration can theoretically be fueled by and dependent upon an array of central metabolism components; however, which ones are responsible for the quantitative variation found in respiratory rates is unknown. Here, large-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>s revealed 2-fold variation in nighttime leaf respiration rate (R<sub>N</sub>) among mature leaves from an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) natural accession collection grown under common favorable conditions. R<sub>N</sub> variation was mostly maintained in the absence of genetic variation, which emphasized the low heritability of R<sub>N</sub> and its plasticity toward relatively small environmental differences within the sampling regime. To pursue metabolic explanations for leaf R<sub>N</sub> variation, parallel metabolite level profiling and assays of total protein and starch were performed. Within an accession, R<sub>N</sub> correlated strongly with stored carbon substrates, including starch and dicarboxylic acids, as well as sucrose, major amino acids, shikimate, and salicylic acid. Among different accessions, metabolite-R<sub>N</sub> correlations were maintained with protein, sucrose, and major amino acids but not stored carbon substrates. A complementary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong> of the effect of exogenous metabolites and effectors on leaf R<sub>N</sub> revealed that (1) R<sub>N</sub> is stimulated by the uncoupler FCCP and high levels of substrates, demonstrating that both adenylate turnover and substrate supply can limit leaf R<sub>N</sub>, and (2) inorganic nitrogen did not stimulate R<sub>N</sub>, consistent with limited nighttime nitrogen assimilation. Simultaneous measurements of R<sub>N</sub> and protein synthesis revealed that these processes were largely uncorrelated in mature leaves. These results indicate that differences in preceding daytime metabolic activities are the major source of variation in mature leaf R<sub>N</sub> under favorable controlled conditions.</p>

Trimethylguanosine Synthase1 (TGS1) Is Essential for Chilling Tolerance
<p>Chilling stress is a major factor limiting plant development and crop productivity. Because the plant response to chilling is so complex, we are far from understanding the genes important in the response to chilling. To identify new genes important in chilling tolerance, we conducted a novel mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>, combining a confirmed SALK T-DNA insertion collection with traditional forward genetics. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ed a pool of more than 3700 confirmed homozygous SALK T-DNA insertion lines for visible defects under prolonged growth at 5°C. Of the chilling-sensitive mutants we observed, mutations at one locus were characterized in detail. This gene, At1g45231, encodes an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) trimethylguanosine synthase (TGS1), previously uncharacterized in the plant kingdom. We confirmed that Arabidopsis TGS1 is a functional ortholog of other trimethylguanosine synthases based both on its in vitro methyltransferase activity and on its ability to rescue the cold-growth inhibition of a <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae tgs1Δ</i> mutant in vivo. While <i>tgs1</i> mutant plants grew normally at 22°C, their vegetative and reproductive growth was severely compromised under chilling conditions. When we transgenically expressed <i>TGS1</i> in the mutant plants, the chilling-sensitive phenotype was relieved, demonstrating that TGS1 is required for chilling tolerance.</p>

<p>Homogalacturonan (HG) is the main component of pectins. HG methylesterification has recently emerged as a key determinant controlling cell attachment, organ formation, and phyllotaxy. However, whether and how HG methylesterification affects intercellular metabolite transport has rarely been reported. Here, we identified and characterized knockout mutants of the rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) <i>OsQUA2</i> gene encoding a putative pectin methyltransferase. <i>Osqua2</i> mutants exhibit a remarkable decrease in the degree of methylesterification of HG in the culm-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">siev</span></strong>e element cell wall and a markedly reduced grain yield. The culm of <i>Osqua2</i> mutant plants contains excessive sucrose (Suc), and a <sup>13</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> feeding experiment showed that the Suc overaccumulation in the culm was caused by blocked Suc translocation. These and other findings demonstrate that OsQUA2 is essential for maintaining a high degree of methylesterification of HG in the rice culm-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">siev</span></strong>e element cell wall, which may be critical for efficient Suc partitioning and grain filling. In addition, our results suggest that the apoplastic pathway is involved in long-distance Suc transport in rice. The identification and characterization of the <i>OsQUA2</i> gene and its functionality revealed a previously unknown contribution of HG methylesterification and provided insight into how modification of the cell wall regulates intercellular transport in plants.</p>

Heteroblastic Development of Transfer Cells Is Controlled by the microRNA miR156/SPL Module
<p>We report that wall ingrowth deposition in phloem parenchyma (PP) transfer cells (TCs) in leaf veins of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) represents a novel trait of heteroblasty. Development of PP TCs involves extensive deposition of wall ingrowths adjacent to cells of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">siev</span></strong>e element/companion cell complex. These PP TCs potentially facilitate phloem loading by enhancing efflux of symplasmic Suc for subsequent active uptake into cells of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">siev</span></strong>e element/companion cell complex. PP TCs with extensive wall ingrowths are ubiquitous in mature cotyledons and juvenile leaves, but dramatically less so in mature adult leaves, an observation consistent with PP TC development reflecting vegetative phase change (VPC) in Arabidopsis. Consistent with this conclusion, the abundance of PP TCs with extensive wall ingrowths varied across rosette development in three ecotypes displaying differing durations of juvenile phase, and extensive deposition of wall ingrowths was observed in rejuvenated leaves following prolonged defoliation. PP TC development across juvenile, transition, and adult leaves correlated positively with levels of miR156, a major regulator of VPC in plants, and corresponding changes in wall ingrowth deposition were observed when miR156 was overexpressed or its activity suppressed by target mimicry. Analysis of plants carrying miR156-resistant forms of <i>SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN LIKE</i> (<i>SPL</i>) genes showed that wall ingrowth deposition was increased in <i>SPL9</i>-group but not <i>SPL3</i>-group genes, indicating that <i>SPL9</i>-group genes may function as negative regulators of wall ingrowth deposition in PP TCs. Collectively, our results point to wall ingrowth deposition in PP TCs being under control of the genetic program regulating VPC.</p>

High complexity of aquatic irradiance may have driven the evolution of four-dimensional colour vision in shallow-water fish
<p>Humans use three cone photoreceptor classes for colour vision, yet many birds, reptiles and shallow-water fish are tetrachromatic and use four cone classes. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing pigments, which narrow the spectrum of photoreceptors in birds and diurnal reptiles, render visual systems with four cone classes more efficient. To date, however, the question of tetrachromacy in shallow-water fish that, like humans, lack <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing pigments, is still unsolved. We raise the possibility that tetrachromacy in fish has evolved in response to higher spectral complexity of underwater light. We compared the dimensionality of colour vision in humans and fish by examining the spectral complexity of the colour signal reflected from objects into their eyes. We show that fish require four to six cone classes to reconstruct the colour signal of aquatic objects at the accuracy level achieved by humans viewing terrestrial objects. This is because environmental light, which alters the colour signals, is more complex and contains more spectral fluctuations underwater than on land. We further show that fish cones are better suited than human cones to detect these spectral fluctuations, suggesting that the capability of fish cones to detect high-frequency fluctuations in the colour signal confers an advantage. Taken together, we propose that tetrachromacy in fish has evolved to enhance the reconstruction of complex colour signals in shallow aquatic environments. Of course, shallow-water fish might possess fewer than four cone classes; however, this would come with the inevitable loss in accuracy of signal reconstruction.</p>

Clicky hip alone is not a true risk factor for developmental dysplasia of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>A clicky hip is a common referral for clinical and sonographic   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing for developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). There is   controversy regarding whether it represents a true risk factor for   pathological DDH. Therefore a 20-year prospective, longitudinal,   observational study was undertaken to assess the relationship between   the presence of a neonatal clicky hip and pathological DDH.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 362 infants from 1997 to 2016 were referred with clicky   hips to our ‘one-stop’ paediatric hip <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing clinic. Hips were   assessed clinically for instability and by ultrasound imaging using   a simplified Graf/Harcke classification. Dislocated or dislocatable   hips were classified as Graf Type IV hips.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean age at presentation was 13.8 weeks (12.8 to 14.7). In   all 351 out of 362 children (97.0%) had Graf Type I hips (normal)   that required no treatment. Nine children (2.5%) had Graf Type II   hips but all resolved to Graf Type I hips on follow-up scans. One   child (0.3%) had Graf Type III hip dysplasia and one child (0.3%)   had an irreducible hip dislocation. The two pathological hips were   associated with unilateral limited hip abduction. Mean referrals increased   from 12.9 to 23.3 each year (p = 0.002) from the first decade of   the study to the second, driven by increasing primary care referrals   (5.5 <i>versus</i> 16.7 per year, p < 0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Most clicky hips required no treatment other than reassurance   to parents. Clicky hips with a normal hip examination should be   considered a variant of normal childhood and not a risk factor for   DDH. However, an abnormal hip examination including unilateral limited   hip abduction should prompt urgent further investigations.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1533–6.</p></sec>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
Generation and validation of a zebrafish model of EAST (epilepsy, ataxia, sensorineural deafness and tubulopathy) syndrome
<p>Recessive mutations in <i>KCNJ10</i>, which encodes an inwardly rectifying potassium channel, were recently identified as the cause of EAST syndrome, a severe and disabling multi-organ disorder consisting of epilepsy, ataxia, sensorineural deafness and tubulopathy that becomes clinically apparent with seizures in infancy. A <i>Kcnj10</i> knockout mouse shows postnatal mortality and is therefore not suitable for drug discovery. Because zebrafish are ideal for <i>in vivo</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing for potential therapeutics, we tested whether <i>kcnj10</i> knockdown in zebrafish would fill this need. We cloned zebrafish <i>kcnj10</i> and demonstrated that its function is equivalent to that of human <i>KCNJ10</i>. We next injected splice- and translation-blocking <i>kcnj10</i> antisense morpholino oligonucleotides and reproduced the cardinal symptoms of EAST syndrome – ataxia, epilepsy and renal tubular defects. Several of these phenotypes could be assayed in an automated manner. We could rescue the morphant phenotype with complementary RNA (cRNA) encoding human wild-type KCNJ10, but not with cRNA encoding a KCNJ10 mutation identified in individuals with EAST syndrome. Our results suggest that zebrafish will be a valuable tool to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong> for compounds that are potentially therapeutic for EAST syndrome or its individual symptoms. Knockdown of <i>kcnj10</i> represents the first zebrafish model of a salt-losing tubulopathy, which has relevance for blood pressure control.</p>

Large Cardiac Muscle Patches Engineered From Human Induced-Pluripotent Stem Cell–Derived Cardiac Cells Improve Recovery From Myocardial Infarction in Swine
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Here, we generated human cardiac muscle patches (hCMPs) of clinically relevant dimensions (4 cm × 2 cm × 1.25 mm) by suspending cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells that had been differentiated from human induced-pluripotent stem cells in a fibrin scaffold and then culturing the construct on a dynamic (rocking) platform.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In vitro assessments of hCMPs suggest maturation in response to dynamic culture stimulation. In vivo assessments were conducted in a porcine model of myocardial infarction (MI). Animal groups included: MI hearts treated with 2 hCMPs (MI+hCMP, n=13), MI hearts treated with 2 cell-free open fibrin patches (n=14), or MI hearts with neither experimental patch (n=15); a fourth group of animals underwent sham surgery (Sham, n=8). Cardiac function and infarct size were evaluated by MRI, arrhythmia incidence by implanted loop recorders, and the engraftment rate by calculation of quantitative polymerase chain reaction measurements of expression of the human Y chromosome. Additional studies examined the myocardial protein expression profile changes and potential mechanisms of action that related to exosomes from the cell patch.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The hCMPs began to beat synchronously within 1 day of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fabric</span></strong>ation, and after 7 days of dynamic culture stimulation, in vitro assessments indicated the mechanisms related to the improvements in electronic mechanical coupling, calcium-handling, and force generation, suggesting a maturation process during the dynamic culture. The engraftment rate was 10.9±1.8% at 4 weeks after the transplantation. The hCMP transplantation was associated with significant improvements in left ventricular function, infarct size, myocardial wall stress, myocardial hypertrophy, and reduced apoptosis in the periscar boarder zone myocardium. hCMP transplantation also reversed some MI-associated changes in sarcomeric regulatory protein phosphorylation. The exosomes released from the hCMP appeared to have cytoprotective properties that improved cardiomyocyte survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We have <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fabric</span></strong>ated a clinically relevant size of hCMP with trilineage cardiac cells derived from human induced-pluripotent stem cells. The hCMP matures in vitro during 7 days of dynamic culture. Transplantation of this type of hCMP results in significantly reduced infarct size and improvements in cardiac function that are associated with reduction in left ventricular wall stress. The hCMP treatment is not associated with significant changes in arrhythmogenicity.</p></sec>

Latent Rheumatic Heart Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing echocardiography has emerged as a potentially powerful tool for early diagnosis of rheumatic heart disease (RHD). The utility of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing echocardiography hinges on the rate of RHD progression and the ability of penicillin prophylaxis to improve outcome. We report the longitudinal outcomes of a cohort of children with latent RHD and identify risk factors for unfavorable outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This was a prospective natural history study conducted under the Ugandan RHD registry. Children with latent RHD and ≥1 year of follow-up were included. All echocardiograms were re-reviewed by experts (2012 World Heart Federation criteria) for inclusion and evidence of change. Bi- and multivariable logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and Cox proportional hazards models, as well, were developed to search for risk factors for unfavorable outcome and compare progression-free survival between those treated and not treated with penicillin. Propensity and other matching methods with sensitivity analysis were implemented for the evaluation of the penicillin effect.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Blinded review confirmed 227 cases of latent RHD: 164 borderline and 63 definite (42 mild, 21 moderate/severe). Median age at diagnosis was 12 years and median follow-up was 2.3 years (interquartile range, 2.0–2.9). Penicillin prophylaxis was prescribed in 49.3% with overall adherence of 84.7%. Of children with moderate-to-severe definite RHD, 47.6% had echocardiographic progression (including 2 deaths), and 9.5% had echocardiographic regression. Children with mild definite and borderline RHD showed 26% and 9.8% echocardiographic progression and 45.2% and 46.3% echocardiographic improvement, respectively. Of those with mild definite RHD or borderline RHD, more advanced disease category, younger age, and morphological mitral valve features were risk factors for an unfavorable outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Latent RHD is a heterogeneous diagnosis with variable disease outcomes. Children with moderate to severe latent RHD have poor outcomes. Children with both borderline and mild definite RHD are at substantial risk of progression. Although long-term outcome remains unclear, the initial change in latent RHD may be evident during the first 1 to 2 years following diagnosis. Natural history data are inherently limited, and a randomized clinical trial is needed to definitively determine the impact of penicillin prophylaxis on the trajectory of latent RHD.</p></sec>

Assessment of Remote Heart Rhythm Sampling Using the AliveCor Heart Monitor to Screen for Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Asymptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF) is increasingly common in the aging population and implicated in many ischemic strokes. Earlier identification of AF with appropriate anticoagulation may decrease stroke morbidity and mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a randomized controlled trial of AF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing using an AliveCor Kardia monitor attached to a WiFi-enabled iPod to obtain ECGs (iECGs) in ambulatory patients. Patients ≥65 years of age with a CHADS-VASc score ≥2 free from AF were randomized to the iECG arm or routine care (RC). iECG participants acquired iECGs twice weekly over 12 months (plus additional iECGs if symptomatic) onto a secure study server with overread by an automated AF detection algorithm and by a cardiac physiologist and/or consultant cardiologist. Time to diagnosis of AF was the primary outcome measure. The overall cost of the devices, ECG interpretation, and patient management were captured and used to generate the cost per AF diagnosis in iECG patients. Clinical events and patient attitudes/experience were also evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We studied 1001 patients (500 iECG, 501 RC) who were 72.6±5.4 years of age; 534 were female. Mean CHADS-VASc score was 3.0 (heart failure, 1.4%; hypertension, 54%; diabetes mellitus, 30%; prior stroke/transient ischemic attack, 6.5%; arterial disease, 15.9%; all CHADS-VASc risk factors were evenly distributed between groups). Nineteen patients in the iECG group were diagnosed with AF over the 12-month study period versus 5 in the RC arm (hazard ratio, 3.9; 95% confidence interval=1.4–10.4; <i>P</i>=0.007) at a cost per AF diagnosis of $10 780 (£8255). There was a similar number of stroke/transient ischemic attack/systemic embolic events (6 versus 10, iECG versus RC; hazard ratio=0.61; 95% confidence interval=0.22–1.69; <i>P</i>=0.34). The majority of iECG patients were satisfied with the device, finding it easy to use without restricting activities or causing anxiety.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing with twice-weekly single-lead iECG with remote interpretation in ambulatory patients ≥65 years of age at increased risk of stroke is significantly more likely to identify incident AF than RC over a 12-month period.

Germline Loss-of-Function Mutations in EPHB4 Cause a Second Form of Capillary Malformation-Arteriovenous Malformation (CM-AVM2) Deregulating RAS-MAPK Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Most arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are localized and occur sporadically. However, they also can be multifocal in autosomal-dominant disorders, such as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and capillary malformation (CM)-AVM. Previously, we identified <i>RASA1</i> mutations in 50% of patients with CM-AVM. Herein we studied non-RASA1 patients to further elucidate the pathogenicity of CMs and AVMs.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a genome-wide linkage study on a CM-AVM family. Whole-exome sequencing was also performed on 9 unrelated CM-AVM families. We identified a candidate gene and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ed it in a large series of patients. The influence of several missense variants on protein function was also studied in vitro.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We found evidence for linkage in 2 loci. Whole-exome sequencing data unraveled 4 distinct damaging variants in <i>EPHB4</i> in 5 families that cosegregated with CM-AVM. Overall, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing of <i>EPHB4</i> detected 47 distinct mutations in 54 index patients: 27 led to a premature stop codon or splice-site alteration, suggesting loss of function. The other 20 are nonsynonymous variants that result in amino acid substitutions. In vitro expression of several mutations confirmed loss of function of EPHB4. The clinical features included multifocal CMs, telangiectasias, and AVMs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We found <i>EPHB4</i> mutations in patients with multifocal CMs associated with AVMs. The phenotype, CM-AVM2, mimics <i>RASA1</i>-related CM-AVM1 and also hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. <i>RASA1</i>-encoded p120RASGAP is a direct effector of EPHB4. Our data highlight the pathogenetic importance of this interaction and indicts EPHB4-RAS-ERK signaling pathway as a major cause for AVMs.</p></sec>

Insulin-Like Growth Factor 1 Receptor-Dependent Pathway Drives Epicardial Adipose Tissue Formation After Myocardial Injury
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Epicardial adipose tissue volume and coronary artery disease are strongly associated, even after accounting for overall body mass.

This differentiation process required Wt1 expression in this lineage and was stimulated by insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) activation. IGF1R inhibition within this lineage significantly reduced its adipogenic differentiation in the context of exogenous, IGF1-modified mRNA stimulation. Moreover, IGF1R inhibition significantly reduced Wt1 lineage cell differentiation into adipocytes after myocardial infarction.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our results establish IGF1R signaling as a key pathway that governs epicardial adipose tissue formation in the context of myocardial injury by redirecting the fate of Wt1<sup>+</sup> lineage cells.

Proteomic Analysis Implicates Translationally Controlled Tumor Protein as a Novel Mediator of Occlusive Vascular Remodeling in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a lethal disease characterized by excessive proliferation of pulmonary vascular endothelial cells (ECs).

Therefore, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ed for dysregulated proteins in blood-outgrowth ECs of HPAH patients with <i>BMPR2</i> mutations compared with healthy control subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>A total of 416 proteins were detected with 2-dimensional PAGE in combination with liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry analysis, of which 22 exhibited significantly altered abundance in blood-outgrowth ECs from patients with HPAH. One of these proteins, translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP), was selected for further study because of its well-established role in promoting tumor cell growth and survival. Immunostaining showed marked upregulation of TCTP in lungs from patients with HPAH and idiopathic PAH, associated with remodeled vessels of complex lesions. Increased TCTP expression was also evident in the SU5416 rat model of severe and irreversible PAH, associated with intimal lesions, colocalizing with proliferating ECs and the adventitia of remodeled vessels but not in the vascular media. Furthermore, silencing of TCTP expression increased apoptosis and abrogated the hyperproliferative phenotype of blood-outgrowth ECs from patients with HPAH, raising the possibility that TCTP may be a link in the emergence of apoptosis-resistant, hyperproliferative vascular cells after EC apoptosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion—</title><p>Proteomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screen</span></strong>ing identified TCTP as a novel mediator of endothelial prosurvival and growth signaling in PAH, possibly contributing to occlusive pulmonary vascular remodeling triggered by EC apoptosis.</p></sec>

Gcorn Plant: A Database for Retrieving Functional and Evolutionary Traits of Plant Genes
<p>Gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>y helps us understand gene function and speciation. The number of plant genes and species registered in public databanks is continuously increasing. It is useful to associate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>ous genes of various plants to better understand plant speciation. We designed the Gcorn plant database for the retrieval of information on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>y and evolution of a plant gene of interest. Amino acid sequences of 73 species (62 land plants and 11 green algae), containing 2,682,261 sequences, were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Reference Sequence database. Based on NCBI BLAST searches between these sequences, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>ous genes were grouped at various thresholds of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>y indices devised by the authors. To show functional and evolutionary traits of a gene of interest, a phylogenetic tree, connecting genes with high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>y indices, and line charts of the numbers of genes with various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>y indices, are depicted. In addition, such indices are projected on a network graph in which species studied are connected based on the ratios of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>ous genes, and on a phylogenetic tree for species based on NCBI Taxonomy. Gcorn plant provides information on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>ous genes at various virtual time points along with speciation in plants.</p>

Control of meiotic pairing and recombination by chromosomally tethered 26<i>S</i> proteasome
<p>During meiosis, paired <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>ous chromosomes (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>s) become linked via the synaptonemal complex (SC) and crossovers. Crossovers mediate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong> segregation and arise from self-inflicted double-strand breaks (DSBs). Here, we identified a role for the proteasome, the multisubunit protease that degrades proteins in the nucleus and cytoplasm, in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong> juxtaposition and crossing over. Without proteasome function, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>s failed to pair and instead remained associated with non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>ous chromosomes. Although dispensable for noncrossover formation, a functional proteasome was required for a coordinated transition that entails SC assembly between longitudinally organized chromosome axes and stable strand exchange of crossover-designated DSBs. Notably, proteolytic core and regulatory proteasome particles were recruited to chromosomes by Zip3, the ortholog of mammalian E3 ligase RNF212, and SC protein Zip1 . We conclude that proteasome functions along meiotic chromosomes are evolutionarily conserved.</p>

The Persistent Homology Mathematical Framework Provides Enhanced Genotype-to-Phenotype Associations for Plant Morphology
<p>Efforts to understand the genetic and environmental conditioning of plant morphology are hindered by the lack of flexible and effective tools for quantifying morphology. Here, we demonstrate that persistent-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>y-based topological methods can improve measurement of variation in leaf shape, serrations, and root architecture. We apply these methods to 2D images of leaves and root systems in field-grown plants of a domesticated introgression line population of tomato (<i>Solanum pennellii</i>). We find that compared with some commonly used conventional traits, (1) persistent-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>y-based methods can more comprehensively capture morphological variation; (2) these techniques discriminate between genotypes with a larger normalized effect size and detect a greater number of unique quantitative trait loci (QTLs); (3) multivariate traits, whether statistically derived from univariate or persistent-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>y-based traits, improve our ability to understand the genetic basis of phenotype; and (4) persistent-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>y-based techniques detect unique QTLs compared to conventional traits or their multivariate derivatives, indicating that previously unmeasured aspects of morphology are now detectable. The QTL results further imply that genetic contributions to morphology can affect both the shoot and root, revealing a pleiotropic basis to natural variation in tomato. Persistent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>y is a versatile framework to quantify plant morphology and developmental processes that complements and extends existing methods.</p>

OsbZIP48, a HY5 Transcription Factor Ortholog, Exerts Pleiotropic Effects in Light-Regulated Development
<p>Plants have evolved an intricate network of sensory photoreceptors and signaling components to regulate their development. Among the light signaling components identified to date, HY5, a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor, has been investigated extensively. However, most of the work on HY5 has been carried out in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), a dicot. In this study, based on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>y search and phylogenetic analysis, we identified three <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>s of AtHY5 in monocots; however, AtHYH (HY5 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>s are absent in the monocots analyzed. Out of the three <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>s identified in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), we have functionally characterized <i>OsbZIP48</i>. <i>OsbZIP48</i> was able to complement the <i>Athy5</i> mutant. OsbZIP48 protein levels are developmentally regulated in rice. Moreover, the OsbZIP48 protein does not degrade in dark-grown rice and <i>Athy5</i> seedlings complemented with <i>OsbZIP48</i>, which is in striking contrast to AtHY5. In comparison with <i>AtHY5</i>, which does not cause any change in hypocotyl length when overexpressed in Arabidopsis, the overexpression of full-length <i>OsbZIP48</i> in rice transgenics reduced the plant height considerably. Microarray analysis revealed that <i>OsKO2</i>, which encodes <i>ent</i>-kaurene oxidase 2 of the gibberellin biosynthesis pathway, is down-regulated in <i>OsbZIP48<sup>OE</sup></i> and up-regulated in <i>OsbZIP48<sup>KD</sup></i> transgenics as compared with the wild type. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that OsbZIP48 binds directly to the <i>OsKO2</i> promoter. The RNA interference lines and the T-DNA insertional mutant of <i>OsbZIP48</i> showed seedling-lethal phenotypes despite the fact that roots were more proliferative during early stages of development in the T-DNA insertional mutant. These data provide credible evidence that OsbZIP48 performs more diverse functions in a monocot system like rice in comparison with its Arabidopsis ortholog, HY5.</p>

Understanding and Manipulating Meiotic Recombination in Plants
<p>Meiosis is a specialized cell division, essential in most reproducing organisms to halve the number of chromosomes, thereby enabling the restoration of ploidy levels during fertilization. A key step of meiosis is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>ous recombination, which promotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>ous pairing and generates crossovers (COs) to connect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>ous chromosomes until their separation at anaphase I. These CO sites, seen cytologically as chiasmata, represent a reciprocal exchange of genetic information between two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>ous nonsister chromatids. This gene reshuffling during meiosis has a significant influence on evolution and also plays an essential role in plant breeding, because a successful breeding program depends on the ability to bring the desired combinations of alleles on chromosomes. However, the number and distribution of COs during meiosis is highly constrained. There is at least one CO per chromosome pair to ensure accurate segregation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>s, but in most organisms, the CO number rarely exceeds three regardless of chromosome size. Moreover, their positions are not random on chromosomes but exhibit regional preference. Thus, genes in recombination-poor regions tend to be inherited together, hindering the generation of novel allelic combinations that could be exploited by breeding programs. Recently, much progress has been made in understanding meiotic recombination. In particular, many genes involved in the process in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) have been identified and analyzed. With the coming challenges of food security and climate change, and our enhanced knowledge of how COs are formed, the interest and needs in manipulating CO formation are greater than ever before. In this review, we focus on advances in understanding meiotic recombination and then summarize the attempts to manipulate CO formation. Last, we pay special attention to the meiotic recombination in polyploidy, which is a common genomic feature for many crop plants.</p>

Dual phosphorylation of Ric-8A enhances its ability to mediate G protein α subunit folding and to stimulate guanine nucleotide exchange
<p>Resistance to inhibitors of cholinesterase-8A (Ric-8A) and Ric-8B are essential biosynthetic chaperones for heterotrimeric G protein α subunits. We provide evidence for the direct regulation of Ric-8A cellular activity by dual phosphorylation. Using proteomics, Western blotting, and mutational analyses, we determined that Ric-8A was constitutively phosphorylated at five serines and threonines by the protein kinase CK2. Phosphorylation of Ser<sup>435</sup> and Thr<sup>440</sup> in rat Ric-8A (corresponding to Ser<sup>436</sup> and Thr<sup>441</sup> in human Ric-8A) was required for high-affinity binding to Gα subunits, efficient stimulation of Gα subunit guanine nucleotide exchange, and mediation of Gα subunit folding. The CK2 consensus sites that contain Ser<sup>435</sup> and Thr<sup>440</sup> are conserved in Ric-8 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>s from worms to mammals. We found that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>ous residues in mouse Ric-8B, Ser<sup>468</sup> and Ser<sup>473</sup>, were also phosphorylated. Mutation of the genomic copy of <i>ric-8</i> in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> to encode alanine in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>ous sites resulted in characteristic <i>ric-8</i> reduction-of-function phenotypes that are associated with defective G<sub>q</sub> and G<sub>s</sub> signaling, including reduced locomotion and defective egg laying. The <i>C. elegans ric-8</i> phosphorylation site mutant phenotypes were partially rescued by chemical stimulation of G<sub>q</sub> signaling. These results indicate that dual phosphorylation represents a critical form of conserved Ric-8 regulation and demonstrate that Ric-8 proteins are needed for effective Gα signaling. The position of the CK2-phosphorylated sites within a structural model of Ric-8A reveals that these sites contribute to a key acidic and negatively charged surface that may be important for its interactions with Gα subunits.</p>

Factors influencing meiotic recombination revealed by whole-genome sequencing of single sperm
<p>Recombination is critical to meiosis and evolution, yet many aspects of the physical exchange of DNA via crossovers remain poorly understood. We report an approach for single-cell whole-genome DNA sequencing by which we sequenced 217 individual hybrid mouse sperm, providing a kilobase-resolution genome-wide map of crossovers. Combining this map with molecular assays measuring stages of recombination, we identified factors that affect crossover probability, including PRDM9 binding on the non-initiating template <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong> and telomere proximity. These factors also influence the time for sites of recombination-initiating DNA double-strand breaks to find and engage their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>s, with rapidly engaging sites more likely to form crossovers. We show that chromatin environment on the template <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong> affects positioning of crossover breakpoints. Our results also offer insights into recombination in the pseudoautosomal region.</p>

Multiplexed gene synthesis in emulsions for exploring protein functional landscapes
<p>Improving our ability to construct and functionally characterize DNA sequences would broadly accelerate progress in biology. Here, we introduce DropSynth, a scalable, low-cost method to build thousands of defined gene-length constructs in a pooled (multiplexed) manner. DropSynth uses a library of barcoded beads that pull down the oligonucleotides necessary for a gene’s assembly, which are then processed and assembled in water-in-oil emulsions. We used DropSynth to successfully build more than 7000 synthetic genes that encode phylogenetically diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>s of two essential genes in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. We tested the ability of phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>s to complement a knockout <i>E. coli</i> strain in multiplex, revealing core functional motifs and reasons underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong> incompatibility. DropSynth coupled with multiplexed functional assays allows us to rationally explore sequence-function relationships at an unprecedented scale.</p>

The Largest Subunit of DNA Polymerase Delta Is Required for Normal Formation of Meiotic Type I Crossovers
<p>Meiotic recombination contributes to the maintenance of the association between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>ous chromosomes (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>s) and ensures the accurate segregation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>s during anaphase I, thus facilitating the redistribution of alleles among progeny. Meiotic recombination is initiated by the programmed formation of DNA double strand breaks, the repair of which requires DNA synthesis, but the role of DNA synthesis proteins during meiosis is largely unknown. Here, we hypothesized that the lagging strand-specific DNA Polymerase δ (POL δ) might be required for meiotic recombination, based on a previous analysis of DNA Replication Factor1 that suggested a role for lagging strand synthesis in meiotic recombination. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), complete mutation of the catalytic subunit of POL δ, encoded by <i>AtPOLD1</i>, leads to embryo lethality. Therefore, we used a meiocyte-specific knockdown strategy to test this hypothesis. Reduced expression of <i>AtPOLD1</i> in meiocytes caused decreased fertility and meiotic defects, including incomplete synapsis, the formation of multivalents, chromosome fragmentation, and improper segregation. Analysis of meiotic crossover (CO) frequencies showed that <i>AtPOLD1<sup>RNAi</sup></i> plants had significantly fewer interference-sensitive COs than the wild type, indicating that AtPOL δ participates in type I CO formation. <i>AtPOLD1<sup>RNAi</sup> atpol2a</i> double mutant meiocytes displayed more severe meiotic phenotypes than those of either single mutant, suggesting that the function of AtPOLD1 and AtPOL2A is not identical in meiotic recombination. Given that POL δ is highly conserved among eukaryotes, we hypothesize that the described role of POL δ here in meiotic recombination likely exists widely in eukaryotes.</p>

<i>OsMADS6</i> Controls Flower Development by Activating Rice <i>FACTOR OF DNA METHYLATION LIKE1</i>
<p><i>OsMADS6</i>, an ancient <i>AGAMOUS-LIKE6</i> (<i>AGL6</i>)-like gene, has essential functions in specifying floral organ and meristem identity in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). However, how <i>AGL6</i> genes control flower development remains largely unknown. In this study, we report that OsMADS6 directly targets <i>FACTOR OF DNA METHYLATION LIKE 1</i> (<i>OsFDML1</i>), a rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong> of the <i>SUPPRESSOR OF GENE SILENCING3</i>-like gene <i>FACTOR OF DNA METHYLATION 1</i> (<i>FDM1</i>) from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Arabidopsis <i>FDM1</i> is involved in RNA-directed DNA methylation and <i>OsFDML1</i> regulates flower development. The expression of <i>OsFDML1</i> overlaps with that of <i>OsMADS6</i> in the palea primordia and the ovule, and OsMADS6 directly promotes <i>OsFDML1</i> expression through binding to regions containing putative CArG motifs within the <i>OsFDML1</i> promoter during rice spikelet development. Consistent with the phenotypes of <i>osmads6</i> mutants, the <i>osfdml1</i> mutants showed floral defects, including altered palea identity with lemma-like shape containing no marginal region of palea, increased numbers of stigmas and fused carpels, and meristem indeterminacy. Moreover, transgenic plants overexpressing <i>OsFDML1</i> displayed floral defects, such as abnormal paleae. Phylogenetic analysis showed that <i>OsFDML1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>s exist only in terrestrial plants. In addition, protein-protein interaction assays showed that OsFDML1 interacts with its close paralog OsFDML2, similar to the activity of OsFDML1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>s in Arabidopsis. These results provide insight into how the ancient <i>AGL6</i> gene regulates floral development.</p>

RECX Interacts with Mitochondrial RECA to Maintain Mitochondrial Genome Stability
<p>The chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes are essential for photosynthesis and respiration, respectively. RECA and RECG, which are plant-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>s of the bacterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>ous recombination repair proteins RecA and RecG, maintain organelle genome stability by suppressing aberrant recombination between short dispersed repeats (SDRs) in the moss <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. In this study, we analyzed the plant-specific factor RECX, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong> of bacterial RecX that regulates RecA. RECX fused to GFP colocalized with mitochondrial RECA1 and chloroplast RECA2 on mitochondrial and chloroplast nucleoids, respectively. Knockout (KO) and overexpression (OEX) of <i>RECX</i> did not alter the <i>P. patens</i> morphological phenotype. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA, however, showed that products from recombination between SDRs increased significantly in <i>RECX</i> OEX mitochondria and modestly in <i>RECX</i> KO mitochondria. By contrast, analysis of chloroplast DNA revealed no substantial alteration in the number of products from recombination between SDRs in <i>RECX</i> KO and OEX chloroplasts. Yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed interactions between RECX and RECA1 and between RECX and RECA2. Expression profiles showed a positive correlation between <i>RECX</i> and factors maintaining the stability of both organelle genomes and <i>RECA1</i>. Collectively, these results suggest that RECX maintains mitochondrial genome stability, likely by modulating RECA1 activity, and that the compromised function of RECX induces mitochondrial genome instability.</p>

Homologues of the RPW8 Resistance Protein Are Localized to the Extrahaustorial Membrane that Is Likely Synthesized De Novo
<p>Upon penetration of the host cell wall, the powdery mildew fungus develops a feeding structure named the haustorium in the invaded host cell. Concomitant with haustorial biogenesis, the extrahaustorial membrane (EHM) is formed to separate the haustorium from the host cell cytoplasm. The Arabidopsis resistance protein RPW8.2 is specifically targeted to the EHM where it activates haustorium-targeted resistance against powdery mildew. RPW8.2 belongs to a small family with six members in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>s of RPW8 (HR) 1 to HR4 are also localized to the EHM and contribute to resistance has not been determined. Here, we report that overexpression of <i>HR1</i>, <i>HR2</i>, or <i>HR3</i> led to enhanced resistance to powdery mildew, while genetic depletion of <i>HR2</i> or <i>HR3</i> resulted in enhanced susceptibility, indicating that these <i>RPW8</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>s contribute to basal resistance. Interestingly, we found that N-terminally YFP-tagged HR1 to HR3 are also EHM-localized. This suggests that EHM-targeting is an ancestral feature of the RPW8 family. Indeed, two RPW8 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>s from <i>Brassica oleracea</i> tested also exhibit EHM-localization. Domain swapping analysis between HR3 and RPW8.2 suggests that sequence diversification in the N-terminal 146 amino acids of RPW8.2 probably functionally distinguishes it from other family members. Moreover, we found that N-terminally YFP-tagged HR3 is also localized to the plasma membrane and the fungal penetration site (the papilla) in addition to the EHM. Using this unique feature of YFP-HR3, we obtained preliminary evidence to suggest that the EHM is unlikely derived from invagination of the plasma membrane, rather it may be mainly synthesized de novo.</p>

Ultrafast Approximation for Phylogenetic Bootstrap
<p>Nonparametric bootstrap has been a widely used tool in phylogenetic analysis to assess the clade support of phylogenetic trees. However, with the rapidly growing amount of data, this task remains a computational bottleneck. Recently, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">approxim</span></strong>ation methods such as the RAxML rapid bootstrap (RBS) and the Shimodaira–Hasegawa-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">approxim</span></strong>ate likelihood ratio test have been introduced to speed up the bootstrap. Here, we suggest an ultrafast bootstrap <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">approxim</span></strong>ation approach (UFBoot) to compute the support of phylogenetic groups in maximum likelihood (ML) based trees. To achieve this, we combine the resampling estimated log-likelihood method with a simple but effective collection scheme of candidate trees. We also propose a stopping rule that assesses the convergence of branch support values to automatically determine when to stop collecting candidate trees. UFBoot achieves a median speed up of 3.1 (range: 0.66–33.3) to 10.2 (range: 1.32–41.4) compared with RAxML RBS for real DNA and amino acid alignments, respectively. Moreover, our extensive simulations show that UFBoot is robust against moderate model violations and the support values obtained appear to be relatively unbiased compared with the conservative standard bootstrap. This provides a more direct interpretation of the bootstrap support. We offer an efficient and easy-to-use software (available at <ext-link>http://www.cibiv.at/software/iqtree</ext-link>) to perform the UFBoot analysis with ML tree inference.</p>

The Repertoires of Ubiquitinating and Deubiquitinating Enzymes in Eukaryotic Genomes
<p>Reversible protein ubiquitination regulates virtually all known cellular activities. Here, we present a quantitatively evaluated and broadly applicable method to predict eukaryotic ubiquitinating enzymes (UBE) and deubiquitinating enzymes (DUB) and its application to 50 distinct genomes belonging to four of the five major phylogenetic supergroups of eukaryotes: unikonts (including metazoans, fungi, choanozoa, and amoebozoa), excavates, chromalveolates, and plants. Our method relies on a collection of profile hidden Markov models, and we demonstrate its superior performance (coverage and classification accuracy >99%) by identifying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">approxim</span></strong>ately 25% and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">approxim</span></strong>ately 35% additional UBE and DUB genes in yeast and human, which had not been reported before. In yeast, we predict 85 UBE and 24 DUB genes, for 814 UBE and 107 DUB genes in the human genome. Most UBE and DUB families are present in all eukaryotic lineages, with plants and animals harboring massively enlarged repertoires of ubiquitin ligases. Unicellular organisms, on the other hand, typically harbor less than 300 UBEs and less than 40 DUBs per genome. Ninety-one UBE/DUB genes are orthologous across all four eukaryotic supergroups, and these likely represent a primordial core of enzymes of the ubiquitination system probably dating back to the first eukaryotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">approxim</span></strong>ately 2 billion years ago.

Lateral Gene Transfer from the Dead
<p>In phylogenetic studies, the evolution of molecular sequences is assumed to have taken place along the phylogeny traced by the ancestors of extant species. In the presence of lateral gene transfer, however, this may not be the case, because the species lineage from which a gene was transferred may have gone extinct or not have been sampled. Because it is not feasible to specify or reconstruct the complete phylogeny of all species, we must describe the evolution of genes outside the represented phylogeny by modeling the speciation dynamics that gave rise to the complete phylogeny. We demonstrate that if the number of sampled species is small compared with the total number of existing species, the overwhelming majority of gene transfers involve speciation to and evolution along extinct or unsampled lineages. We show that the evolution of genes along extinct or unsampled lineages can to good <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">approxim</span></strong>ation be treated as those of independently evolving lineages described by a few global parameters. Using this result, we derive an algorithm to calculate the probability of a gene tree and recover the maximum-likelihood reconciliation given the phylogeny of the sampled species. Examining 473 near-universal gene families from 36 cyanobacteria, we find that nearly a third of transfer events (28%) appear to have topological signatures of evolution along extinct species, but only <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">approxim</span></strong>ately 6% of transfers trace their ancestry to before the common ancestor of the sampled cyanobacteria.

RasGRP1 promotes amphetamine-induced motor behavior through a Rhes interaction network (“Rhesactome”) in the striatum
<p>The striatum of the brain coordinates motor function. Dopamine-related drugs may be therapeutic to patients with striatal neurodegeneration, such as Huntington’s disease (HD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD), but these drugs have unwanted side effects. In addition to stimulating the release of norepinephrine, amphetamines, which are used for narcolepsy and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), trigger dopamine release in the striatum. The guanosine triphosphatase Ras <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong> enriched in the striatum (Rhes) inhibits dopaminergic signaling in the striatum, is implicated in HD and L-dopa–induced dyskinesia, and has a role in striatal motor control. We found that the guanine nucleotide exchange factor RasGRP1 inhibited Rhes-mediated control of striatal motor activity in mice. RasGRP1 stabilized Rhes, increasing its synaptic accumulation in the striatum. Whereas partially Rhes-deficient (<i>Rhes</i><sup><i>+/−</i></sup>) mice had an enhanced locomotor response to amphetamine, this phenotype was attenuated by coincident depletion of RasGRP1. By proteomic analysis of striatal lysates from <i>Rhes</i>-heterozygous mice with wild-type or partial or complete knockout of <i>Rasgrp1</i>, we identified a diverse set of Rhes-interacting proteins, the “Rhesactome,” and determined that RasGRP1 affected the composition of the amphetamine-induced Rhesactome, which included PDE2A (phosphodiesterase 2A; a protein associated with major depressive disorder), LRRC7 (leucine-rich repeat–containing 7; a protein associated with bipolar disorder and ADHD), and DLG2 (discs large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong> 2; a protein associated with chronic pain). Thus, this Rhes network provides insight into striatal effects of amphetamine and may aid the development of strategies to treat various neurological and psychological disorders associated with the striatal dysfunction.</p>

Structure of the C-terminal guanine nucleotide exchange factor module of Trio in an autoinhibited conformation reveals its oncogenic potential
<p>The C-terminal guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) module of Trio (TrioC) transfers signals from the Gα<sub>q/11</sub> subfamily of heterotrimeric G proteins to the small guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) RhoA, enabling Gα<sub>q/11</sub>-coupled G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) to control downstream events, such as cell motility and gene transcription. This conserved signal transduction axis is crucial for tumor growth in uveal melanoma. Previous studies indicate that the GEF activity of the TrioC module is autoinhibited, with release of autoinhibition upon Gα<sub>q/11</sub> binding. Here, we determined the crystal structure of TrioC in its basal state and found that the pleckstrin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>y (PH) domain interacts with the Dbl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>y (DH) domain in a manner that occludes the Rho GTPase binding site, thereby suggesting the molecular basis of TrioC autoinhibition. Biochemical and biophysical assays revealed that disruption of the autoinhibited conformation destabilized and activated the TrioC module in vitro. Last, mutations in the DH-PH interface found in patients with cancer activated TrioC and, in the context of full-length Trio, led to increased abundance of guanosine triphosphate–bound RhoA (RhoA·GTP) in human cells. These mutations increase mitogenic signaling through the RhoA axis and, therefore, may represent cancer drivers operating in a Gα<sub>q/11</sub>-independent manner.</p>

Structures and gating mechanism of human TRPM2
<p>Transient receptor potential (TRP) melastatin 2 (TRPM2) is a cation channel associated with numerous diseases. It has a C-terminal NUDT9 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>y (NUDT9H) domain responsible for binding adenosine diphosphate (ADP)–ribose (ADPR), and both ADPR and calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) are required for TRPM2 activation. Here we report cryo–electron microscopy structures of human TRPM2 alone, with ADPR, and with ADPR and Ca<sup>2+</sup>. NUDT9H forms both intra- and intersubunit interactions with the N-terminal TRPM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>y region (MHR1/2/3) in the apo state but undergoes conformational changes upon ADPR binding, resulting in rotation of MHR1/2 and disruption of the intersubunit interaction. The binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> further engages transmembrane helices and the conserved TRP helix to cause conformational changes at the MHR arm and the lower gating pore to potentiate channel opening. These findings explain the molecular mechanism of concerted TRPM2 gating by ADPR and Ca<sup>2+</sup> and provide insights into the gating mechanism of other TRP channels.</p>

Guanine glycation repair by DJ-1/Park7 and its bacterial homologs
<p>DNA damage induced by reactive carbonyls (mainly methylglyoxal and glyoxal), called DNA glycation, is quantitatively as important as oxidative damage. DNA glycation is associated with increased mutation frequency, DNA strand breaks, and cytotoxicity. However, in contrast to guanine oxidation repair, how glycated DNA is repaired remains undetermined. Here, we found that the parkinsonism-associated protein DJ-1 and its bacterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>s Hsp31, YhbO, and YajL could repair methylglyoxal- and glyoxal-glycated nucleotides and nucleic acids. DJ-1–depleted cells displayed increased levels of glycated DNA, DNA strand breaks, and phosphorylated p53. Deglycase-deficient bacterial mutants displayed increased levels of glycated DNA and RNA and exhibited strong mutator phenotypes. Thus, DJ-1 and its prokaryotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>s constitute a major nucleotide repair system that we name guanine glycation repair.</p>

The biosynthetic pathway of coenzyme F430 in methanogenic and methanotrophic archaea
<p>Methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR) is the key enzyme of methanogenesis and anaerobic methane oxidation. The activity of MCR is dependent on the unique nickel-containing tetrapyrrole known as coenzyme F430. We used comparative genomics to identify the coenzyme F430 biosynthesis (<i>cfb</i>) genes and characterized the encoded enzymes from <i>Methanosarcina acetivorans</i> C2A. The pathway involves nickelochelation by a nickel-specific chelatase, followed by amidation to form Ni-sirohydrochlorin <i>a</i>,<i>c</i>-diamide. Next, a primitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong> of nitrogenase mediates a six-electron reduction and γ-lactamization reaction before a Mur ligase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong> forms the six-membered carbocyclic ring in the final step of the pathway. These data show that coenzyme F430 can be synthesized from sirohydrochlorin using Cfb enzymes produced heterologously in a nonmethanogen host and identify several targets for inhibitors of biological methane formation.</p>

Mitochondrial Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Contributes to Auxin-Regulated Organ Development
<p>Pyruvate dehydrogenase is the first enzyme (E1) of the PDH complex (PDC). This multienzyme complex contains E1, E2, and E3 components and controls the entry of carbon into the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle to enable cellular energy production. The E1 component of the PDC is composed of an E1α catalytic subunit and an E1β regulatory subunit. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), there are two mitochondrial E1α <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>s encoded by <i>IAA-CONJUGATE-RESISTANT 4</i> (<i>IAR4</i>) and <i>IAR4-LIKE</i> (<i>IAR4L</i>), and one mitochondrial E1β <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>. Although IAR4 was reported to be involved in auxin conjugate sensitivity and auxin homeostasis in root development, its precise role remains unknown. Here, we provide experimental evidence that mitochondrial PDC E1 contributes to polar auxin transport during organ development. We performed genetic screens for factors involved in cotyledon development and identified an uncharacterized mutant, <i>macchi-bou 1</i> (<i>mab1</i>). <i>MAB1</i> encodes a mitochondrial PDC E1β subunit that can form both a homodimer and a heterodimer with IAR4. The <i>mab1</i> mutation impaired MAB1 homodimerization, reduced the abundance of IAR4 and IAR4L, weakened PDC enzymatic activity, and diminished mitochondrial respiration. A metabolomics analysis showed significant changes in metabolites including amino acids in <i>mab1</i> and, in particular, identified an accumulation of Ala. These results suggest that MAB1 is a component of the Arabidopsis mitochondrial PDC E1. Furthermore, in <i>mab1</i> mutants and seedlings where the TCA cycle was pharmacologically blocked, we found reduced abundance of the PIN-FORMED (PIN) auxin efflux carriers, possibly due to impaired PIN recycling and enhanced PIN degradation in vacuoles. Therefore, we suggest that <i>mab1</i> induces defective polar auxin transport via metabolic abnormalities.</p>

<i>PINOID</i> Is Required for Formation of the Stigma and Style in Rice
<p>The stigma is the entry point for sexual reproduction in plants, but the mechanisms underlying stigma development are largely unknown. Here, we disrupted putative auxin biosynthetic and signaling genes to evaluate their roles in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) development. Disruption of the rice <i>PINOID</i> (<i>OsPID</i>) gene completely eliminated the development of stigmas, and overexpression of <i>OsPID</i> led to overproliferation of stigmas, suggesting that <i>OsPID</i> is a key determinant for stigma development. Interestingly, <i>ospid</i> mutants did not display defects in flower initiation, nor did they develop any pin-like inflorescences, a characteristic phenotype observed in <i>pid</i> mutants in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). We constructed double mutants of <i>OsPID</i> and its closest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>, <i>OsPIDb</i>, yet the double mutants still did not develop any pin-like inflorescences, indicating that either <i>ospid</i> is compensated by additional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>ous genes or <i>OsPID</i> has different functions in rice compared with <i>PID</i> in other organisms. We then knocked out one of the <i>NAKED PINS IN YUC MUTANTS</i> (<i>NPY</i>) genes, which cause the formation of pin-like inflorescences in Arabidopsis when compromised, in the <i>ospid</i> background. The <i>ospid osnpy2</i> double mutants developed pin-like inflorescences, which were phenotypically similar to <i>pid</i> mutants in Arabidopsis and maize, demonstrating that the roles of <i>OsPID</i> in inflorescence development are likely masked by redundant partners. This work identified a key determinant for stigma development in rice and revealed a complex picture of the <i>PID</i> gene in rice development. Furthermore, the stigma-less <i>ospid</i> mutants are potentially useful in producing hybrid rice.</p>

A Family of NAI2-Interacting Proteins in the Biogenesis of the ER Body and Related Structures
<p>Plants produce different types of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived vesicles that accumulate and transport proteins, lipids, and metabolites. In the Brassicales, a distinct ER-derived structure called the ER body is found throughout the epidermis of cotyledons, hypocotyls, and roots. NAI2 is a key factor for ER body formation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>s of NAI2 are found only in the Brassicales and therefore may have evolved specifically to enable ER body formation. Here, we report that three related Arabidopsis NAI2-interacting proteins (NAIP1, NAIP2, and NAIP3) play a critical role in the biogenesis of ER bodies and related structures. Analysis using GFP fusions revealed that all three NAIPs are components of the ER bodies found in the cotyledons, hypocotyls, and roots. Genetic analysis with <i>naip</i> mutants indicates that they have a critical and redundant role in ER body formation. NAIP2 and NAIP3 are also components of other vesicular structures likely derived from the ER that are formed independent of NAI2 and are present not only in the cotyledons, hypocotyls, and roots, but also in the rosettes. Thus, while NAIP1 is a specialized ER body component, NAIP2 and NAIP3 are components of different types of ER-derived structures. Analysis of chimeric NAIP proteins revealed that their N-terminal domains play a major role in the functional specialization between NAIP1 and NAIP3. Unlike NAI2, NAIPs have <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>s in all plants; therefore, NAIP-containing ER structures, from which the ER bodies in the Brassicales may have evolved, are likely to be present widely in plants.</p>

OsDER1 Is an ER-Associated Protein Degradation Factor That Responds to ER Stress
<p>Endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD) plays an important role in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality control. To date, little is known about the retrotranslocation machinery in the plant ERAD pathway. We obtained a DERLIN-like protein (OsDER1) through a SWATH-based quantitative proteomic analysis of ER membrane proteins extracted from ER-stressed rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) seeds. OsDER1, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong> of yeast and mammal DER1, is localized in the ER and accumulates significantly under ER stress. Overexpression or suppression of OsDER1 in rice leads to activation of the unfolded protein response and hypersensitivity to ER stress, and suppression results in floury, shrunken seeds. In addition, the expression levels of polyubiquitinated proteins increased markedly in <i>OsDER1</i> overexpression or suppression transgenic rice. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that OsDER1 interacted with OsHRD1, OsHRD3, and OsCDC48, the essential components of the canonical ERAD pathway. Furthermore, OsDER1 associated with the signal peptide peptidase, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong> of a component of the alternative ERAD pathway identified recently in yeast and mammals. Our data suggest that OsDER1 is linked to the ERAD pathway.</p>

PROTEIN PHOSHATASE 2A B’<i>α</i> and <i>β</i> Maintain Centromeric Sister Chromatid Cohesion during Meiosis in Arabidopsis
<p>The correct separation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>ous chromosomes during meiosis I, and sister chromatids during meiosis II, relies on the tight control of the cohesion complex. The phosphorylation and subsequent cleavage of the meiotic recombination protein REC8 (REC8-like family protein [SYN1] in Arabidopsis [<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>]), the α-kleisin subunit of the cohesion ring, along the chromosome arms at meiosis I allows crossovers and separation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>ous chromosomes without chromatid dissociation. REC8 continues to localize and function at the centromeres up to metaphase II and, in yeast and vertebrates, is protected from cleavage by means of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)-mediated dephosphorylation. Here, we show that, in plants, centromeric sister chromatid cohesion until meiosis II also requires the activity of a PP2A-type phosphatase complex. The combined absence of the regulatory subunits PP2AB′α and PP2AB′β leads to the premature loss of chromosome cohesion in meiosis I. Male meiocytes of the <i>pp2ab′αβ</i> double mutant display premature depletion of SYN1. The PP2AA1 structural and B′α regulatory subunit localize specifically to centromeres until metaphase II, supporting a role for the PP2A complex in the SYN1-mediated maintenance of centromeric cohesion in plant meiosis.</p>

The Regulation of Sporopollenin Biosynthesis Genes for Rapid Pollen Wall Formation
<p>Sporopollenin is the major component of the outer pollen wall (sexine). It is synthesized using a pathway of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">approxim</span></strong>ately eight genes in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). MALE STERILITY188 (MS188) and its direct upstream regulator ABORTED MICROSPORES (AMS) are two transcription factors essential for tapetum development. Here, we show that all the sporopollenin biosynthesis proteins are specifically expressed in the tapetum and are secreted into anther locules. MS188, a MYB transcription factor expressed in the tapetum, directly regulates the expression of <i>POLYKETIDE SYNTHASE A</i> (<i>PKSA</i>), <i>PKSB</i>, <i>MALE STERILE2</i> (<i>MS2</i>), and a CYTOCHROME P450 gene (<i>CYP703A2</i>). By contrast, the expression of <i>CYP704B1</i>, <i>ACYL-COA SYNTHETASE5</i> (<i>ACOS5</i>), <i>TETRAKETIDE a-PYRONE REDUCTASE1</i> (<i>TKPR1</i>) and <i>TKPR2</i> are significantly reduced in <i>ams</i> mutants but not affected in <i>ms188</i> mutants. However, MS188 but not AMS can activate the expression of <i>CYP704B1</i>, <i>ACOS5</i>, and <i>TKPR1</i>. In <i>ms188</i>, dominant suppression of MS188 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>s reduced the expression of these genes, suggesting that MS188 and other MYB family members play redundant roles in activating their expression. The expression of some sporopollenin synthesis genes (<i>PKSA</i>, <i>PKSB</i>, <i>TKPR2</i>, <i>CYP704B1</i>, and <i>ACOS5</i>) was rescued when <i>MS188</i> was expressed in <i>ams</i>. Therefore, MS188 is a key regulator for activation of sporopollenin synthesis, and AMS and MS188 may form a feed-forward loop that activates the expression of the sporopollenin biosynthesis pathway for rapid pollen wall formation.</p>

Identification of ASYNAPTIC4, a Component of the Meiotic Chromosome Axis
<p>During the leptotene stage of prophase I of meiosis, chromatids become organized into a linear looped array via a protein axis that forms along the loop bases. Establishment of the axis is essential for the subsequent synapsis of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>ous chromosome pairs and the progression of recombination to form genetic crossovers. Here, we describe ASYNAPTIC4 (ASY4), a meiotic axis protein in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). ASY4 is a small coiled-coil protein that exhibits limited sequence similarity with the carboxyl-terminal region of the axis protein ASY3. We used enhanced yellow fluorescent protein-tagged ASY4 to show that ASY4 localizes to the chromosome axis throughout prophase I. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation revealed that ASY4 interacts with ASY1 and ASY3, and yeast two-hybrid analysis confirmed a direct interaction between ASY4 and ASY3. Mutants lacking full-length ASY4 exhibited defective axis formation and were unable to complete synapsis. Although the initiation of recombination appeared to be unaffected in the <i>asy4</i> mutant, the number of crossovers was reduced significantly, and crossovers tended to group in the distal parts of the chromosomes. We conclude that ASY4 is required for normal axis and crossover formation. Furthermore, our data suggest that ASY3/ASY4 are the functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>s of the mammalian SYCP2/SYCP3 axial components.</p>

Plant Temperature Acclimation and Growth Rely on Cytosolic Ribosome Biogenesis Factor Homologs
<p>Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) REI1-LIKE (REIL) proteins, REIL1 and REIL2, are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>s of a yeast ribosome biogenesis factor that participates in late cytoplasmic 60S ribosomal subunit maturation. Here, we report that the inhibited growth of the <i>reil1-1 reil2-1</i> mutant at 10°C can be rescued by the expression of amino-terminal FLUORESCENT PROTEIN (FP)-REIL fusions driven by the <i>UBIQUITIN10</i> promoter, allowing the analysis of REIL function in planta. Arabidopsis REIL1 appears to be functionally conserved, based on the cytosolic localization of FP-REIL1 and the interaction of native REIL1 with the 60S subunit in wild-type plants. In contrast to its yeast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>s, REIL1 also was present in translating ribosome fractions. Systems analysis revealed that wild-type Arabidopsis remodels the cytosolic translation machinery when grown at 10°C by accumulating cytosolic ribosome subunits and inducing the expression of cytosolic ribosomal RNA, ribosomal genes, ribosome biogenesis factors, and translation initiation or elongation factors. In the <i>reil1-1 reil2-1</i> mutant, all processes associated with inhibited growth were delayed, although the plants maintained cellular integrity or acquired freezing tolerance. REIL proteins also were implicated in plant-specific processes: nonacclimated <i>reil1-1 reil2-1</i> exhibited cold-acclimation responses, including activation of the DREB/CBF regulon. In addition, acclimated <i>reil1-1 reil2-1</i> plants failed to activate <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T</i> expression in mature leaves. Therefore, in the wild type, REIL function may contribute to temperature perception by suppressing premature cold responses during growth at nonstressful temperatures. In conclusion, we suggest that Arabidopsis REIL proteins influence cold-induced plant ribosome remodeling and enhance the accumulation of cytosolic ribosome subunits after cold shift either by de novo synthesis or by recycling them from the translating ribosome fraction.</p>

The Chickpea <i>Early Flowering 1</i> (<i>Efl1</i>) Locus Is an Ortholog of Arabidopsis <i>ELF3</i>
<p>In climates that experience short growing seasons due to drought, heat, or end-of-season frost, early flowering is a highly desirable trait for chickpea (<i>Cicer arietinum</i>). In this study, we mapped, sequenced, and characterized <i>Early flowering3</i> (<i>Efl3</i>), an ortholog of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>EARLY FLOWERING3</i> (<i>ELF3</i>) that confers early flowering in chickpea. In a recombinant inbred line population derived from a cross between CDC Frontier and ICCV 96029, this gene was mapped to the site of a quantitative trait locus on Ca5 that explained 59% of flowering time variation under short days. Sequencing of <i>ELF3</i> in ICCV 96029 revealed an 11-bp deletion in the first exon that was predicted to result in a premature stop codon. The effect of this mutation was tested by transgenic complementation in the Arabidopsis <i>elf3-1</i> mutant, with the CDC Frontier form of <i>CaELF3a</i> partially complementing <i>elf3-1</i> while the ICCV 96029 form had no effect on flowering time. While induction of <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>s was very early in ICCV 96029, an analysis of circadian clock function failed to show any clear loss of rhythm in the expression of clock genes in ICCV 96029 grown under continuous light, suggesting redundancy with other <i>ELF3</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>s or possibly an alternative mode of action for this gene in chickpea. The 11-bp deletion was associated with early flowering in global chickpea germplasm but was not widely distributed, indicating that this mutation arose relatively recently.</p>

The Pseudoenzyme PDX1.2 Sustains Vitamin B<sub>6</sub> Biosynthesis as a Function of Heat Stress<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plants sense temperature changes and respond by altering growth and metabolic activity to acclimate to the altered environmental conditions. The B vitamins give rise to vital coenzymes that are indispensable for growth and development but their inherent reactive nature renders them prone to destruction especially under stress conditions. Therefore, plant survival strategies would be expected to include mechanisms to sustain B vitamin supply under demanding circumstances. Here, using the example of vitamin B<sub>6</sub>, we investigate the regulation of biosynthesis across eudicot and monocot species under heat stress. Most eudicots carry a pseudoenzyme PDX1.2 that is a noncatalytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong> of the PDX1 subunit of the vitamin B<sub>6</sub> biosynthesis protein machinery, PYRIDOXINE BIOSYNTHESIS PROTEIN1. Using Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) as models, we show that <i>PDX1</i>.<i>2</i> is transcriptionally regulated by the HSFA1 transcription factor family. Monocots only carry catalytic <i>PDX1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>s that do not respond to heat stress as demonstrated for rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), suggesting fundamental differences in the regulation of vitamin B<sub>6</sub> biosynthesis across the two lineages. Investigation of the molecular mechanism of <i>PDX1</i>.<i>2</i> transcription reveals two alternative transcriptional start sites, one of which is exclusive to heat stress. Further data suggest that PDX1.2 leads to stabilization of the catalytic PDX1s under heat stress conditions, which would serve to maintain vitamin B<sub>6</sub> homeostasis in times of need in eudicots that carry this gene. Our analyses indicate an important abiotic stress tolerance strategy in several eudicots, which has not been evolutionarily adapted (or is not required) by monocots such as grasses.</p>

A <i>β</i>-Ketoacyl-CoA Synthase Is Involved in Rice Leaf Cuticular Wax Synthesis and Requires a CER2-LIKE Protein as a Cofactor
<p>Cuticular waxes are complex mixtures of very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) and their derivatives, forming a natural barrier on aerial surfaces of terrestrial plants against biotic and abiotic stresses. In VLCFA biosynthesis, β-ketoacyl-CoA synthase (KCS) is the key enzyme, catalyzing the first reaction in fatty acid elongation and determining substrate specificity. We isolated a rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) <i>wax crystal-sparse leaf 4</i> (<i>WSL4</i>) gene using a map-based cloning strategy. <i>WSL4</i> is predicted to encode a KCS, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong> of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) CER6. Complementation of the mutant <i>wsl4-1</i> with <i>WSL4</i> genomic DNA rescued the cuticular wax-deficient phenotype, confirming the function of <i>WSL4</i>. The load of wax components longer than 30 carbons (C30) and C28 were reduced markedly in <i>wsl4-1</i> and <i>wsl4-2</i> mutants, respectively. Overexpression of <i>WSL4</i> increased the cuticular wax load in rice leaves. We further isolated a cofactor of WSL4, OsCER2, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong> of Arabidopsis CER2, by coimmunoprecipitation and confirmed their physical interaction by split-ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid experiments. Expression of <i>WSL4</i> alone in <i>elo3</i> yeast cells resulted in increased C24 but did not produce VLCFAs of greater length, whereas expressing <i>OsCER2</i> alone showed no effect. Coexpression of <i>WSL4</i> and <i>OsCER2</i> in <i>elo3</i> yeast cells yielded fatty acids up to C30. OsCER2 with a mutated HxxxD motif (H172E, D176A, and D176H) interrupted its interaction with WSL4 and failed to elongate VLCFAs past C24 when expressed with WSL4 in <i>elo3</i> yeast cells. These results demonstrated that WSL4 was involved in VLCFA elongation beyond C22 and that elongation beyond C24 required the participation of OsCER2.</p>

Physical Mapping of Amplified Copies of the 5-Enolpyruvylshikimate-3-Phosphate Synthase Gene in Glyphosate-Resistant <i>Amaranthus tuberculatus</i><xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Recent and rapid evolution of resistance to glyphosate, the most widely used herbicides, in several weed species, including common waterhemp (<i>Amaranthus tuberculatus</i>), poses a serious threat to sustained crop production. We report that glyphosate resistance in <i>A</i>. <i>tuberculatus</i> was due to amplification of the 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-P synthase (<i>EPSPS</i>) gene, which encodes the molecular target of glyphosate. There was a positive correlation between <i>EPSPS</i> gene copies and its transcript expression. We analyzed the distribution of <i>EPSPS</i> copies in the genome of <i>A</i>. <i>tuberculatus</i> using fluorescence in situ hybridization on mitotic metaphase chromosomes and interphase nuclei. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis mapped the <i>EPSPS</i> gene to pericentromeric regions of two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>ous chromosomes in glyphosate sensitive <i>A</i>. <i>tuberculatus</i>. In glyphosate-resistant plants, a cluster of <i>EPSPS</i> genes on the pericentromeric region on one pair of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>ous chromosomes was detected. Intriguingly, two highly glyphosate-resistant plants harbored an additional chromosome with several <i>EPSPS</i> copies besides the native chromosome pair with <i>EPSPS</i> copies. These results suggest that the initial event of <i>EPSPS</i> gene duplication may have occurred because of unequal recombination mediated by repetitive DNA. Subsequently, gene amplification may have resulted via several other mechanisms, such as chromosomal rearrangements, deletion/insertion, transposon-mediated dispersion, or possibly by interspecific hybridization. This report illustrates the physical mapping of amplified <i>EPSPS</i> copies in <i>A</i>. <i>tuberculatus</i>.</p>

Physiological Characterization of a Plant Mitochondrial Calcium Uniporter in Vitro and in Vivo<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Over the recent years, several proteins that make up the mitochondrial calcium uniporter complex (MCUC) mediating Ca<sup>2+</sup>uptake into the mitochondrial matrix have been identified in mammals, including the channel-forming protein MCU. Although six <i>MCU</i> gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>s are conserved in the model plant Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) in which mitochondria can accumulate Ca<sup>2+</sup>, a functional characterization of plant MCU <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>s has been lacking. Using electrophysiology, we show that one isoform, AtMCU1, gives rise to a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable channel activity that can be observed even in the absence of accessory proteins implicated in the formation of the active mammalian channel. Furthermore, we provide direct evidence that AtMCU1 activity is sensitive to the mitochondrial calcium uniporter inhibitors Ruthenium Red and Gd<sup>3+</sup>, as well as to the Arabidopsis protein MICU, a regulatory MCUC component. AtMCU1 is prevalently expressed in roots, localizes to mitochondria, and its absence causes mild changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics as assessed by in vivo measurements in Arabidopsis root tips. Plants either lacking or overexpressing AtMCU1 display root mitochondria with altered ultrastructure and show shorter primary roots under restrictive growth conditions. In summary, our work adds evolutionary depth to the investigation of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport, indicates that AtMCU1, together with MICU as a regulator, represents a functional configuration of the plant mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake complex with differences to the mammalian MCUC, and identifies a new player of the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation network in plants.</p>

Resolvase OsGEN1 Mediates DNA Repair by Homologous Recombination<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Yen1/GEN1 are canonical Holliday junction resolvases that belong to the RAD2/XPG family. In eukaryotes, such as budding yeast, mice, worms, and humans, Yen1/GEN1 work together with Mus81-Mms4/MUS81-EME1 and Slx1-Slx4/SLX1-SLX4 in DNA repair by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>ous recombination to maintain genome stability. In plants, the biological function of Yen1/GEN1 remains largely unclear. In this study, we characterized the loss of function mutants of <i>OsGEN1</i> and <i>OsSEND1</i>, a pair of paralogs of Yen1/GEN1 in rice (<i>Oryza</i> <i>sativa</i>). We first investigated the role of <i>OsGEN1</i> during meiosis and found a reduction in chiasma frequency by ∼6% in <i>osgen1</i> mutants, compared to the wild type, suggesting a possible involvement of OsGEN1 in the formation of crossovers. Postmeiosis, OsGEN1 foci were detected in wild-type microspore nuclei, but not in the <i>osgen1</i> mutant concomitant with an increase in double-strand breaks. Persistent double-strand breaks led to programmed cell death of the male gametes and complete male sterility. In contrast, depletion of <i>OsSEND1</i> had no effects on plant development and did not enhance <i>osgen1</i> defects. Our results indicate that OsGEN1 is essential for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>ous recombinational DNA repair at two stages of microsporogenesis in rice.</p>

Direct Determination of the Mutation Rate in the Bumblebee Reveals Evidence for Weak Recombination-Associated Mutation and an Approximate Rate Constancy in Insects
<p>Accurate knowledge of the mutation rate provides a base line for inferring expected rates of evolution, for testing evolutionary hypotheses and for estimation of key parameters. Advances in sequencing technology now permit direct estimates of the mutation rate from sequencing of close relatives. Within insects there have been three prior such estimates, two in nonsocial insects (<i>Drosophila</i>: 2.8 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> per bp per haploid genome per generation; <i>Heliconius</i>: 2.9 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>) and one in a social species, the honeybee (3.4 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>). Might the honeybee’s rate be ∼20% higher because it has an exceptionally high recombination rate and recombination may be directly or indirectly mutagenic? To address this possibility, we provide a direct estimate of the mutation rate in the bumblebee (<i>Bombus terrestris</i>), this being a close relative of the honeybee but with a much lower recombination rate. We confirm that the crossover rate of the bumblebee is indeed much lower than honeybees (8.7 cM/Mb vs. 37 cM/Mb). Importantly, we find no significant difference in the mutation rates: we estimate for bumblebees a rate of 3.6 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> per haploid genome per generation (95% confidence intervals 2.38 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> and 5.37 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>) which is just 5% higher than the estimate that of honeybees. Both genomes have <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">approxim</span></strong>ately one new mutation per haploid genome per generation. While we find evidence for a direct coupling between recombination and mutation (also seen in honeybees), the effect is so weak as to leave almost no footprint on any between-species differences. The similarity in mutation rates suggests an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">approxim</span></strong>ate constancy of the mutation rate in insects.</p>

Whole-Genome Sequencing of Tibetan Macaque (<i>Macaca thibetana</i>) Provides New Insight into the Macaque Evolutionary History
<p>Macaques are the most widely distributed nonhuman primates and used as animal models in biomedical research. The availability of full-genome sequences from them would be essential to both biomedical and primate evolutionary studies. Previous studies have reported whole-genome sequences from rhesus macaque (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>) and cynomolgus macaque (<i>M. fascicularis</i>, CE), both of which belong to the <i>fascicularis</i> group. Here, we present a 37-fold coverage genome sequence of the Tibetan macaque (<i>M. thibetana</i>; TM). TM is an endemic species to China belonging to the <i>sinica</i> group<i>.</i> On the basis of mapping to the rhesus macaque genome, we identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">approxim</span></strong>ately 11.9 million single-nucleotide variants), of which 3.9 million were TM specific, as assessed by comparison two Chinese rhesus macaques (CR) and two CE genomes. Some genes carried TM-specific homozygous nonsynonymous variants (TSHNVs), which were scored as deleterious in human by both PolyPhen-2 and SIFT (Sorting Tolerant From Intolerant) and were enriched in the eye disease genes. In total, 273 immune response and disease-related genes carried at least one TSHNV. The heterozygosity rates of two CRs (0.002617 and 0.002612) and two CEs (0.003004 and 0.003179) were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">approxim</span></strong>ately three times higher than that of TM (0.000898). Polymerase chain reaction resequencing of 18 TM individuals showed that 29 TSHNVs exhibited high allele frequencies, thus confirming their low heterozygosity. Genome-wide genetic divergence analysis demonstrated that TM was more closely related to CR than to CE. We further detected unusual low divergence regions between TM and CR. In addition, after applying statistical criteria to detect putative introgression regions (PIRs) in the TM genome, up to 239,620 kb PIRs (8.84% of the genome) were identified. Given that TM and CR have overlapping geographical distributions, had the same refuge during the Middle Pleistocene, and show similar mating behaviors, it is highly likely that there was an ancient introgression event between them. Moreover, demographic inferences revealed that TM exhibited a similar demographic history as other macaques until 0.5 Ma, but then it maintained a lower effective population size until present time. Our study has provided new insight into the macaque evolutionary history, confirming hybridization events between macaque species groups based on genome-wide data.</p>

FUBAR: A Fast, Unconstrained Bayesian AppRoximation for Inferring Selection
<p>Model-based analyses of natural selection often categorize sites into a relatively small number of site classes. Forcing each site to belong to one of these classes places unrealistic constraints on the distribution of selection parameters, which can result in misleading inference due to model misspecification. We present an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">approxim</span></strong>ate hierarchical Bayesian method using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) routine that ensures robustness against model misspecification by averaging over a large number of predefined site classes. This leaves the distribution of selection parameters essentially unconstrained, and also allows sites experiencing positive and purifying selection to be identified orders of magnitude faster than by existing methods. We demonstrate that popular random effects likelihood methods can produce misleading results when sites assigned to the same site class experience different levels of positive or purifying selection—an unavoidable scenario when using a small number of site classes. Our Fast Unconstrained Bayesian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">approxim</span></strong>ation (FUBAR) is unaffected by this problem, while achieving higher power than existing unconstrained (fixed effects likelihood) methods. The speed advantage of FUBAR allows us to analyze larger data sets than other methods: We illustrate this on a large influenza hemagglutinin data set (3,142 sequences). FUBAR is available as a batch file within the latest HyPhy distribution (<ext-link>http://www.hyphy.org</ext-link>), as well as on the Datamonkey web server (<ext-link>http://www.datamonkey.org/</ext-link>).</p>

Building Phylogenetic Trees from Molecular Data with MEGA
<p>Phylogenetic analysis is sometimes regarded as being an intimidating, complex process that requires expertise and years of experience. In fact, it is a fairly straightforward process that can be learned quickly and applied effectively. This Protocol describes the several steps required to produce a phylogenetic tree from molecular data for novices. In the example illustrated here, the program MEGA is used to implement all those steps, thereby eliminating the need to learn several programs, and to deal with multiple file formats from one step to another (Tamura K, Peterson D, Peterson N, Stecher G, Nei M, Kumar S. 2011. MEGA5: molecular evolutionary genetics analysis using maximum likelihood, evolutionary distance, and maximum parsimony methods. <i>Mol Biol Evol</i>. 28:2731–2739). The first step, identification of a set of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>ous sequences and downloading those sequences, is implemented by MEGA's own browser built on top of the Google Chrome toolkit. For the second step, alignment of those sequences, MEGA offers two different algorithms: ClustalW and MUSCLE. For the third step, construction of a phylogenetic tree from the aligned sequences, MEGA offers many different methods. Here we illustrate the maximum likelihood method, beginning with MEGA's Models feature, which permits selecting the most suitable substitution model. Finally, MEGA provides a powerful and flexible interface for the final step, actually drawing the tree for publication. Here a step-by-step protocol is presented in sufficient detail to allow a novice to start with a sequence of interest and to build a publication-quality tree illustrating the evolution of an appropriate set of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>s of that sequence. MEGA is available for use on PCs and Macs from <ext-link>www.megasoftware.net</ext-link>.</p>

Artemin, a diapause-specific chaperone, contributes to the stress tolerance of <i>Artemia franciscana</i> cysts and influences their release from females
<p>Females of the crustacean <i>Artemia franciscana</i> produce either motile nauplii or gastrula stage embryos enclosed in a shell impermeable to nonvolatile compounds and known as cysts. The encysted embryos enter diapause, a state of greatly reduced metabolism and profound stress tolerance. Artemin, a diapause-specific ferritin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong> in cysts has molecular chaperone activity <i>in vitro</i>. Artemin represents 7.2% of soluble protein in cysts, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">approxim</span></strong>ately equal to the amount of p26, a small heat shock protein. However, there is almost twice as much artemin mRNA in cysts as compared with p26 mRNA, suggesting that artemin mRNA is translated less efficiently. RNA interference employing the injection of artemin double-stranded RNA into the egg sacs of <i>A. franciscana</i> females substantially reduced artemin mRNA and protein in cysts. Decreasing artemin diminished desiccation and freezing tolerance of cysts, demonstrating a role for this protein in stress resistance. Knockdown of artemin increased the time required for complete discharge of a brood of cysts carried within a female from a few hours up to 4 days, an effect weakened in successive broods. Artemin, an abundant molecular chaperone, contributes to stress tolerance of <i>A. franciscana</i> cysts while influencing their development and/or exit from females.</p>

Genome-Wide Landscape of Alternative Splicing Events in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>
<p>Recently, <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i> has emerged as a model plant for studying monocot grasses and cereal crops. Using assembled expressed transcript sequences and subsequent mapping to the corresponding genome, we identified 1219 alternative splicing (AS) events spanning across 2021 putatively assembled transcripts generated from 941 genes. Approximately, 6.3% of expressed genes are alternatively spliced in <i>B. distachyon</i>. We observed that a majority of the identified AS events were related to retained introns (55.5%), followed by alternative acceptor sites (16.7%). We also observed a low percentage of exon skipping (5.0%) and alternative donor site events (8.8%). The ‘complex event’ that consists of a combination of two or more basic splicing events accounted for ∼14.0%. Comparative AS transcript analysis revealed 163 and 39 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>ous pairs between <i>B. distachyon</i> and <i>Oryza sativa</i> and between <i>B. distachyon</i> and <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, respectively<i>.</i> In all, we found 16 AS transcripts to be conserved in all 3 species. AS events and related putative assembled transcripts annotation can be systematically browsed at Plant Alternative Splicing Database (<ext-link>http://proteomics.ysu.edu/altsplice/plant/</ext-link>).</p>

Inference of Natural Selection from Interspersed Genomic Elements Based on Polymorphism and Divergence
<p>Complete genome sequences contain valuable information about natural selection, but this information is difficult to access for short, widely scattered noncoding elements such as transcription factor binding sites or small noncoding RNAs. Here, we introduce a new computational method, called <i>I</i>nference of <i>N</i>atural <i>S</i>election from <i>I</i>nterspersed <i>G</i>enomically co<i>H</i>erent elemen<i>T</i>s (INSIGHT), for measuring the influence of natural selection on such elements. INSIGHT uses a generative probabilistic model to contrast patterns of polymorphism and divergence in the elements of interest with those in flanking neutral sites, pooling weak information from many short elements in a manner that accounts for variation among loci in mutation rates and coalescent times. The method is able to disentangle the contributions of weak negative, strong negative, and positive selection based on their distinct effects on patterns of polymorphism and divergence. It obtains information about divergence from multiple outgroup genomes using a general statistical phylogenetic approach. The INSIGHT model is efficiently fitted to genome-wide data using an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">approxim</span></strong>ate expectation maximization algorithm. Using simulations, we show that the method can accurately estimate the parameters of interest even in complex demographic scenarios, and that it significantly improves on methods based on summary statistics describing polymorphism and divergence. To demonstrate the usefulness of INSIGHT, we apply it to several classes of human noncoding RNAs and to GATA2-binding sites in the human genome.</p>

Molecular Evolution of α-Latrotoxin, the Exceptionally Potent Vertebrate Neurotoxin in Black Widow Spider Venom
<p>Black widow spiders (members of the genus <i>Latrodectus</i>) are widely feared because of their potent neurotoxic venom. α-Latrotoxin is the vertebrate-specific toxin responsible for the dramatic effects of black widow envenomation. The evolution of this toxin is enigmatic because only two α-latrotoxin sequences are known. In this study, ∼4 kb α-latrotoxin sequences and their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homolog</span></strong>s were characterized from a diversity of <i>Latrodectus</i> species, and representatives of <i>Steatoda</i> and <i>Parasteatoda</i>, establishing the wide distribution of latrotoxins across the mega-diverse spider family Theridiidae. Across black widow species, α-latrotoxin shows ≥94% nucleotide identity and variability consistent with purifying selection. Multiple codon and branch-specific estimates of the nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution rate ratio also suggest a long history of purifying selection has acted on α-latrotoxin across <i>Latrodectus</i> and <i>Steatoda</i>. However, α-latrotoxin is highly divergent in amino acid sequence between these genera, with 68.7% of protein differences involving non-conservative substitutions, evidence for positive selection on its physiochemical properties and particular codons, and an elevated rate of nonsynonymous substitutions along α-latrotoxin’s <i>Latrodectus</i> branch. Such variation likely explains the efficacy of red-back spider, <i>L. hasselti</i>, antivenom in treating bites from other <i>Latrodectus</i> species, and the weaker neurotoxic symptoms associated with <i>Steatoda</i> and <i>Parasteatoda</i> bites. Long-term purifying selection on α-latrotoxin indicates its functional importance in black widow venom, even though vertebrates are a small fraction of their diet. The greater differences between <i>Latrodectus</i> and <i>Steatoda</i> α-latrotoxin, and their relationships to invertebrate-specific latrotoxins, suggest a shift in α-latrotoxin toward increased vertebrate toxicity coincident with the evolution of widow spiders.</p>

The limits of applicability of the sound exposure level (SEL) metric to temporal threshold shifts (TTS) in beluga whales, <i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>
<p>The influence of fatiguing sound level and duration on post-exposure temporary threshold shift (TTS) was investigated in two beluga whales (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>). The fatiguing sound was half-octave noise with a center frequency of 22.5 kHz. TTS was measured at a test frequency of 32 kHz. Thresholds were measured by recording rhythmic evoked potentials (the envelope following response) to a test series of short (eight cycles) tone pips with a pip rate of 1000 s<sup>−1</sup>. TTS increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">approxim</span></strong>ately proportionally to the dB measure of both sound pressure (sound pressure level, SPL) and duration of the fatiguing noise, as a product of these two variables. In particular, when the noise parameters varied in a manner that maintained the product of squared sound pressure and time (sound exposure level, SEL, which is equivalent to the overall noise energy) at a constant level, TTS was not constant. Keeping SEL constant, the highest TTS appeared at an intermediate ratio of SPL to sound duration and decreased at both higher and lower ratios. Multiplication (SPL multiplied by log duration) better described the experimental data than an equal-energy (equal SEL) model. The use of SEL as a sole universal metric may result in an implausible assessment of the impact of a fatiguing sound on hearing thresholds in odontocetes, including under-evaluation of potential risks.</p>

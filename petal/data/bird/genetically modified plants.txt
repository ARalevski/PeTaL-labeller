Integrated Consensus Map of Cultivated Peanut and Wild Relatives Reveals Structures of the A and B Genomes of <i>Arachis</i> and Divergence of the Legume Genomes
<p>The complex, tetraploid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e structure of peanut (<i>Arachis hypogaea</i>) has obstructed advances in genetics and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ics in the species. The aim of this study is to understand the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e structure of <i>Arachis</i> by developing a high-density integrated consensus map. Three recombinant inbred line populations derived from crosses between the A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e diploid species, <i>Arachis duranensis</i> and <i>Arachis stenosperma</i>; the B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e diploid species, <i>Arachis ipaënsis</i> and <i>Arachis magna</i>; and between the AB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e tetraploids, <i>A. hypogaea</i> and an artificial amphidiploid (<i>A. ipaënsis</i> × <i>A. duranensis</i>)<sup>4×</sup>, were used to construct genetic linkage maps: 10 linkage groups (LGs) of 544 cM with 597 loci for the A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e; 10 LGs of 461 cM with 798 loci for the B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e; and 20 LGs of 1442 cM with 1469 loci for the AB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e. The resultant maps plus 13 published maps were integrated into a consensus map covering 2651 cM with 3693 marker loci which was anchored to 20 consensus LGs corresponding to the A and B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. The comparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ics with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequences of <i>Cajanus cajan</i>, <i>Glycine max</i>, <i>Lotus japonicus</i>, and <i>Medicago truncatula</i> revealed that the <i>Arachis</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e has segmented synteny relationship to the other legumes. The comparative maps in legumes, integrated tetraploid consensus maps, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e-specific diploid maps will increase the genetic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic understanding of <i>Arachis</i> and should facilitate molecular breeding.</p>

Tree Physiology
Revisiting the sequencing of the first tree genome: <i>Populus trichocarpa</i>
<p>Ten years ago, it was announced that the Joint <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e Institute with funds provided by the Department of Energy, Office of Science, Biological and Environmental Research would sequence the black cottonwood (<i>Populus trichocarpa</i> Torr. & Gray) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e. This landmark decision was the culmination of work by the forest science community to develop <i>Populus</i> as a model system. Since its public release in late 2006, the availability of the <i>Populus</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e has spawned research in plant biology, morphology, genetics and ecology. Here we address how the tree physiologist has used this resource. More specifically, we revisit our earlier contention that the rewards of sequencing the <i>Populus</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e would depend on how quickly scientists working with woody perennials could adopt molecular approaches to investigate the mechanistic underpinnings of basic physiological processes. Several examples illustrate the integration of functional and comparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ics into the forest sciences, especially in areas that target improved understanding of the developmental differences between woody perennials and herbaceous annuals (e.g., phase transitions). Sequencing the <i>Populus</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e and the availability of genetic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic resources has also been instrumental in identifying candidate genes that underlie physiological and morphological traits of interest. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e-enabled research has advanced our understanding of how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>e and genotype are related and provided insights into the genetic mechanisms whereby woody perennials adapt to environmental stress. In the future, we anticipate that low-cost, high-throughput sequencing will continue to facilitate research in tree physiology and enhance our understanding at scales of individual organisms and populations. A challenge remains, however, as to how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic resources, including the <i>Populus</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e, can be used to understand ecosystem function. Although examples are limited, progress in this area is encouraging and will undoubtedly improve as future research targets the many unique aspects of <i>Populus</i> as a keystone species in terrestrial ecosystems.</p>

Multi-Omics Driven Assembly and Annotation of the Sandalwood (<i>Santalum album</i>) Genome
<p>Indian sandalwood (<i>Santalum album</i>) is an important tropical evergreen tree known for its fragrant heartwood-derived essential oil and its valuable carving wood. Here, we applied an integrated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic, transcriptomic, and proteomic approach to assemble and annotate the Indian sandalwood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e. Our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequencing resulted in the establishment of a draft map of the smallest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e for any woody tree species to date (221 Mb). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e annotation predicted 38,119 protein-coding genes and 27.42% repetitive DNA elements. In-depth proteome analysis revealed the identities of 72,325 unique peptides, which confirmed 10,076 of the predicted genes. The addition of transcriptomic and proteo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic approaches resulted in the identification of 53 novel proteins and 34 gene-correction events that were missed by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic approaches. Proteo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic analysis also helped in reassigning 1,348 potential noncoding RNAs as bona fide protein-coding messenger RNAs. Gene expression patterns at the RNA and protein levels indicated that peptide sequencing was useful in capturing proteins encoded by nuclear and organellar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es alike. Mass spectrometry-based proteomic evidence provided an unbiased approach toward the identification of proteins encoded by organellar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. Such proteins are often missed in transcriptome data sets due to the enrichment of only messenger RNAs that contain poly(A) tails. Overall, the use of integrated omic approaches enhanced the quality of the assembly and annotation of this nonmodel plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e. The availability of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data will enhance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ics-assisted breeding, germplasm characterization, and conservation of sandalwood trees.</p>

Systematic Biology
Phylogenetic Signal Variation in the Genomes of <i>Medicago</i> (Fabaceae)
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e-scale data offer the opportunity to clarify phylogenetic relationships that are difficult to resolve with few loci, but they can also identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic regions with evolutionary history distinct from that of the species history. We collected whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequence data from 29 taxa in the legume genus <i>Medicago</i>, then aligned these sequences to the <i>Medicago truncatula</i> reference <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e to confidently identify 87 596 variable homologous sites. We used this data set to estimate phylogenetic relationships among <i>Medicago</i> species, to investigate the number of sites needed to provide robust phylogenetic estimates and to identify specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic regions supporting topologies in conflict with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e-wide phylogeny. Our full <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic data set resolves relationships within the genus that were previously intractable. Subsampling the data reveals considerable variation in phylogenetic signal and power in smaller subsets of the data. Even when sampling 5000 sites, no random sample of the data supports a topology identical to that of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e-wide phylogeny. Phylogenetic relationships estimated from 500-site sliding windows revealed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e regions supporting several alternative species relationships among recently diverged taxa, consistent with the expected effects of deep coalescence or introgression in the recent history of <i>Medicago</i>.

Healthy Roots and Leaves: Comparative Genome Structure of Horseradish and Watercress
<p>Horseradish (<i>Armoracia rusticana</i>) and watercress (<i>Nasturtium officinale</i>) are economically important cruciferous vegetable species with limited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic resources. We used comparative chromosome painting to identify the extent of chromosomal collinearity between horseradish and watercress, and to reconstruct the origin and evolution of the two tetraploid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es (2<i>n</i> = 4<i>x</i> = 32). Our results show that horseradish and watercress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es originated from a common ancestral (<i>n</i> = 8) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e, structurally resembling the Ancestral Crucifer Karyotype (<i>n</i> = 8), which, however, contained two unique translocation chromosomes (AK6/8 and AK8/6). Except for a 2.4-Mb unequal chromosome translocation in watercress, both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es are structurally identical. The structural similarity of the two parental sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es might suggest an autotetraploid origin of horseradish and watercress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. The sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e stasis, apart from the single-chromosome translocation, indicates that homeologous recombination played a limited role in postpolyploid evolution in both tetraploid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. The octoploid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e of one-rowed watercress (<i>N. microphyllum</i>, 2<i>n</i> = 8<i>x</i> = 64), structurally mirroring the tetraploid horseradish and watercress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es, originated via autopolyploidization from the immediate tetraploid predecessor of watercress or hybridization between this and another now-extinct tetraploid <i>Nasturtium</i> species. These comparative cyto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic maps in horseradish and watercress represent a first stepping stone for future whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequencing efforts and genetic improvement of both crop species.</p>

Correlation between genome reduction and bacterial growth
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e reduction by removing dispensable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic sequences in bacteria is commonly used in both fundamental and applied studies to determine the minimal genetic requirements for a living system or to develop highly efficient bioreactors. Nevertheless, whether and how the accumulative loss of dispensable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic sequences disturbs bacterial growth remains unclear. To investigate the relationship between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e reduction and growth, a series of <i>Escherichia coli</i> strains carrying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es reduced in a stepwise manner were used. Intensive growth analyses revealed that the accumulation of multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic deletions caused decreases in the exponential growth rate and the saturated cell density in a deletion-length-dependent manner as well as gradual changes in the patterns of growth dynamics, regardless of the growth media. Accordingly, a perspective growth model linking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e evolution to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e engineering was proposed. This study provides the first demonstration of a quantitative connection between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic sequence and bacterial growth, indicating that growth rate is potentially associated with dispensable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic sequences.</p>

Monophyletic Origin and Evolution of the Largest Crucifer Genomes
<p>Clade E, or the <i>Hesperis</i> clade, is one of the major Brassicaceae (Crucifereae) clades, comprising some 48 genera and 351 species classified into seven tribes and is distributed predominantly across arid and montane regions of Asia. Several taxa have socioeconomic significance, being important ornamental but also weedy and invasive species. From the comparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic perspective, the clade is noteworthy as it harbors species with the largest crucifer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es but low numbers of chromosomes (<i>n</i> = 5–7). By applying comparative cytogenetic analysis and whole-chloroplast phylogenetics, we constructed, to our knowledge, the first partial and complete cytogenetic maps for selected representatives of clade E tribes and investigated their relationships in a family-wide context. The <i>Hesperis</i> clade is a well-supported monophyletic lineage comprising seven tribes: Anchonieae, Buniadeae, Chorisporeae, Dontostemoneae, Euclidieae, Hesperideae, and Shehbazieae. The clade diverged from other Brassicaceae crown-group clades during the Oligocene, followed by subsequent Miocene tribal diversifications in central/southwestern Asia. The inferred ancestral karyotype of clade E (CEK; <i>n</i> = 7) originated from an older <i>n</i> = 8 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e, which also was the purported progenitor of tribe Arabideae (KAA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e). In most taxa of clade E, the seven linkage groups of CEK either remained conserved (Chorisporeae) or were reshuffled by chromosomal translocations (Euclidieae). In 50% of Anchonieae and Hesperideae species, the CEK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e has undergone descending dysploidy toward <i>n</i> = 6 (−5). These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic data elucidate early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e evolution in Brassicaceae and pave the way for future whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequencing and assembly efforts in this as yet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ically neglected group of crucifer plants.</p>

Whole-Genome Sequencing of Tibetan Macaque (<i>Macaca thibetana</i>) Provides New Insight into the Macaque Evolutionary History
<p>Macaques are the most widely distributed nonhuman primates and used as animal models in biomedical research. The availability of full-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequences from them would be essential to both biomedical and primate evolutionary studies. Previous studies have reported whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequences from rhesus macaque (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>) and cynomolgus macaque (<i>M. fascicularis</i>, CE), both of which belong to the <i>fascicularis</i> group. Here, we present a 37-fold coverage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequence of the Tibetan macaque (<i>M. thibetana</i>; TM). TM is an endemic species to China belonging to the <i>sinica</i> group<i>.</i> On the basis of mapping to the rhesus macaque <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e, we identified approximately 11.9 million single-nucleotide variants), of which 3.9 million were TM specific, as assessed by comparison two Chinese rhesus macaques (CR) and two CE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. Some genes carried TM-specific homozygous nonsynonymous variants (TSHNVs), which were scored as deleterious in human by both PolyPhen-2 and SIFT (Sorting Tolerant From Intolerant) and were enriched in the eye disease genes. In total, 273 immune response and disease-related genes carried at least one TSHNV. The heterozygosity rates of two CRs (0.002617 and 0.002612) and two CEs (0.003004 and 0.003179) were approximately three times higher than that of TM (0.000898). Polymerase chain reaction resequencing of 18 TM individuals showed that 29 TSHNVs exhibited high allele frequencies, thus confirming their low heterozygosity. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e-wide genetic divergence analysis demonstrated that TM was more closely related to CR than to CE. We further detected unusual low divergence regions between TM and CR. In addition, after applying statistical criteria to detect putative introgression regions (PIRs) in the TM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e, up to 239,620 kb PIRs (8.84% of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e) were identified. Given that TM and CR have overlapping geographical distributions, had the same refuge during the Middle Pleistocene, and show similar mating behaviors, it is highly likely that there was an ancient introgression event between them. Moreover, demographic inferences revealed that TM exhibited a similar demographic history as other macaques until 0.5 Ma, but then it maintained a lower effective population size until present time. Our study has provided new insight into the macaque evolutionary history, confirming hybridization events between macaque species groups based on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e-wide data.</p>

Efficient Inference of Recombination Hot Regions in Bacterial Genomes
<p>In eukaryotes, detailed surveys of recombination rates have shown variation at multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic scales and the presence of “hotspots” of highly elevated recombination. In bacteria, studies of recombination rate variation are less developed, in part because there are few analysis methods that take into account the clonal context within which bacterial evolution occurs. Here, we focus in particular on identifying “hot regions” of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e where DNA is transferred frequently between isolates. We present a computationally efficient algorithm based on the recently developed “chromosome painting” algorithm, which characterizes patterns of haplotype sharing across a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e. We compare the average <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e wide painting, which principally reflects clonal descent, with the painting for each site which additionally reflects the specific deviations at the site due to recombination. Using simulated data, we show that hot regions have consistently higher deviations from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e wide average than normal regions. We applied our approach to previously analyzed <i>Escherichia coli</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es and revealed that the new method is highly correlated with the number of recombination events affecting each site inferred by ClonalOrigin, a method that is only applicable to small numbers of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. Furthermore, we analyzed recombination hot regions in <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i> by using 200 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. We identified three recombination hot regions, which are enriched for genes related to membrane proteins. Our approach and its implementation, which is downloadable from <ext-link>https://github.com/bioprojects/orderedPainting</ext-link>, will help to develop a new phase of population <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic studies of recombination in prokaryotes.</p>

MAPINS, a Highly Efficient Detection Method That Identifies Insertional Mutations and Complex DNA Rearrangements
<p>Insertional mutagenesis, in which a piece of exogenous DNA is integrated randomly into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic DNA of the recipient cell, is a useful method to generate new mutants with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>es of interest. The unicellular green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> is an outstanding model for studying many biological processes. We developed a new computational algorithm, MAPINS (mapping insertions), to efficiently identify insertion sites created by the integration of an <i>APHVIII</i> (<i>aminoglycoside 3′-phosphotransferase VIII</i>) cassette that confers paromomycin resistance. Using whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequencing data, this method eliminates the need for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic DNA manipulation and retains all the sequencing information provided by paired-end sequencing. We experimentally verified 38 insertion sites out of 41 sites (93%) identified by MAPINS from 20 paromomycin-resistant strains. Using meiotic analysis of 18 of these strains, we identified insertion sites that completely cosegregate with paromomycin resistance. In six of the seven strains with a mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>e, we demonstrated complete cosegregation of the mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>e and the verified insertion site. In addition, we provide direct evidence of complex rearrangements of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic DNA in five strains, three of which involve the <i>APHVIII</i> insertion site. We suggest that strains obtained by insertional mutagenesis are more complicated than expected from previous analyses in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>. To map the locations of some complex insertions, we designed 49 molecular markers based on differences identified via whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequencing between wild-type strains CC-124 and CC-125. Overall, MAPINS provides a low-cost, efficient method to characterize insertional mutants in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>.</p>

Hierarchically Aligning 10 Legume Genomes Establishes a Family-Level Genomics Platform
<p>Mainly due to their economic importance, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es of 10 legumes, including soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>), wild peanut (<i>Arachis duranensis</i> and <i>Arachis ipaensis</i>), and barrel medic (<i>Medicago truncatula</i>), have been sequenced. However, a family-level comparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ics analysis has been unavailable. With grape (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) and selected legume <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es as outgroups, we managed to perform a hierarchical and event-related alignment of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es and deconvoluted layers of homologous regions produced by ancestral polyploidizations or speciations. Consequently, we illustrated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic fractionation characterized by widespread gene losses after the polyploidizations. Notably, high similarity in gene retention between recently duplicated chromosomes in soybean supported the likely autopolyploidy nature of its tetraploid ancestor. Moreover, although most gene losses were nearly random, largely but not fully described by geometric distribution, we showed that polyploidization contributed divergently to the copy number variation of important gene families. Besides, we showed significantly divergent evolutionary levels among legumes and, by performing synonymous nucleotide substitutions at synonymous sites correction, redated major evolutionary events during their expansion. This effort laid a solid foundation for further <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ics exploration in the legume research community and beyond. We describe only a tiny fraction of legume comparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ics analysis that we performed; more information was stored in the newly constructed Legume Comparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ics Research Platform (<ext-link>www.legumegrp.org</ext-link>).</p>

Histopathology reveals correlative and unique phenotypes in a high-throughput mouse phenotyping screen

In collaboration with the Pathology Core of the Centre for Modeling Human Disease (CMHD) we report the utility of histopathology in a high-throughput primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ing screen. Histopathology was assessed in an unbiased selection of 50 mouse lines with (<i>n</i>=30) or without (<i>n</i>=20) clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>es detected by the standard MGP primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ing screen. Our findings revealed that histopathology added correlating morphological data in 19 of 30 lines (63.3%) in which the primary screen detected a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>e. In addition, seven of the 50 lines (14%) presented significant histopathology findings that were not associated with or predicted by the standard primary screen. Three of these seven lines had no clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>e detected by the standard primary screen. Incidental and strain-associated background lesions were present in all mutant lines with good concordance to wild-type controls. These findings demonstrate the complementary and unique contribution of histopathology to high-throughput primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ing of mutant mice.</p>

Replication timing programs are predictive of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic features and activity and are considered to be functional readouts of chromatin organization. Although replication timing programs have been described for yeast and animal systems, much less is known about the temporal regulation of plant DNA replication or its relationship to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequence and chromatin structure. We used the thymidine analog, 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine, in combination with flow sorting and Repli-Seq to describe, at high-resolution, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e-wide replication timing program for Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) Col-0 suspension cells. We identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic regions that replicate predominantly during early, mid, and late S phase, and correlated these regions with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic features and with data for chromatin state, accessibility, and long-distance interaction. Arabidopsis chromosome arms tend to replicate early while pericentromeric regions replicate late. Early and mid-replicating regions are gene-rich and predominantly euchromatic, while late regions are rich in transposable elements and primarily heterochromatic. However, the distribution of chromatin states across the different times is complex, with each replication time corresponding to a mixture of states. Early and mid-replicating sequences interact with each other and not with late sequences, but early regions are more accessible than mid regions. The replication timing program in Arabidopsis reflects a bipartite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic organization with early/mid-replicating regions and late regions forming separate, noninteracting compartments. The temporal order of DNA replication within the early/mid compartment may be modulated largely by chromatin accessibility.</p>

Identification of Novel Growth Regulators in Plant Populations Expressing Random Peptides
<p>The use of chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ics approaches allows the identification of small molecules that integrate into biological systems, thereby changing discrete processes that influence growth, development, or metabolism. Libraries of chemicals are applied to living systems, and changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>e are observed, potentially leading to the identification of new growth regulators. This work describes an approach that is the nexus of chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ics and synthetic biology. Here, each plant in an extensive population synthesizes a unique small peptide arising from a transgene composed of a randomized nucleic acid sequence core flanked by translational start, stop, and cysteine-encoding (for disulfide cyclization) sequences. Ten and 16 amino acid sequences, bearing a core of six and 12 random amino acids, have been synthesized in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants. Populations were screened for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>es from the seedling stage through senescence. Dozens of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>es were observed in over 2,000 plants analyzed. Ten conspicuous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>es were verified through separate transformation and analysis of multiple independent lines. The results indicate that these populations contain sequences that often influence discrete aspects of plant biology. Novel peptides that affect photosynthesis, flowering, and red light response are described. The challenge now is to identify the mechanistic integrations of these peptides into biochemical processes. These populations serve as a new tool to identify small molecules that modulate discrete plant functions that could be produced later in transgenic plants or potentially applied exogenously to impart their effects. These findings could usher in a new generation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">agricultur</span></strong>al growth regulators, herbicides, or defense compounds.</p>

Genomic Basis of Adaptive Evolution: The Survival of Amur Ide (<i>Leuciscu</i>s <i>waleckii</i>) in an Extremely Alkaline Environment
<p>The Amur ide (<i>Leuciscus waleckii</i>) is a cyprinid fish that is widely distributed in Northeast Asia. The Lake Dali Nur population inhabits one of the most extreme aquatic environments on Earth, with an alkalinity up to 50 mmol/L (pH 9.6), thus providing an exceptional model with which to characterize the mechanisms of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic evolution underlying adaptation to extreme environments. Here, we developed the reference <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e assembly for <i>L. waleckii</i> from Lake Dali Nur. Intriguingly, we identified unusual expanded long terminal repeats (LTRs) with higher nucleotide substitution rates than in many other teleosts, suggesting their more recent insertion into the <i>L. waleckii</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e. We also identified expansions in genes encoding egg coat proteins and natriuretic peptide receptors, possibly underlying the adaptation to extreme environmental stress. We further sequenced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es of 10 additional individuals from freshwater and 18 from Lake Dali Nur populations, and we detected a total of 7.6 million SNPs from both populations. In a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e scan and comparison of these two populations, we identified a set of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic regions under selective sweeps that harbor genes involved in ion homoeostasis, acid-base regulation, unfolded protein response, reactive oxygen species elimination, and urea excretion. Our findings provide comprehensive insight into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic mechanisms of teleost fish that underlie their adaptation to extreme alkaline environments.</p>

Wild emmer genome architecture and diversity elucidate wheat evolution and domestication
<p>Wheat (<i>Triticum</i> spp.) is one of the founder crops that likely drove the Neolithic transition to sedentary agrarian societies in the Fertile Crescent more than 10,000 years ago. Identifying genetic modifications underlying wheat’s domestication requires knowledge about the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e of its allo-tetraploid progenitor, wild emmer (<i>T. turgidum</i> ssp. <i>dicoccoides</i>). We report a 10.1-gigabase assembly of the 14 chromosomes of wild tetraploid wheat, as well as analyses of gene content, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e architecture, and genetic diversity. With this fully assembled polyploid wheat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e, we identified the causal mutations in <i>Brittle Rachis 1</i> (<i>TtBtr1</i>) genes controlling shattering, a key domestication trait. A study of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic diversity among wild and domesticated accessions revealed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic regions bearing the signature of selection under domestication.

Recursive Paleohexaploidization Shaped the Durian Genome
<p>The durian (<i>Durio zibethinus</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e has recently become available, and analysis of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e reveals two paleopolyploidization events previously inferred as shared with cotton (<i>Gossypium</i> spp.). Here, we reanalyzed the durian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e in comparison with other well-characterized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. We found that durian and cotton were actually affected by different polyploidization events: hexaploidization in durian ∼19–21 million years ago (mya) and decaploidization in cotton ∼13–14 mya. Previous interpretations of shared polyploidization events may have resulted from the elevated evolutionary rates in cotton genes due to the decaploidization and insufficient consideration of the complexity of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. The decaploidization elevated evolutionary rates of cotton genes by ∼64% compared to durian and explained a previous ∼4-fold over dating of the event. In contrast, the hexaploidization in durian did not prominently elevate gene evolutionary rates, likely due to its long generation time. Moreover, divergent evolutionary rates probably explain 98.4% of reconstructed phylogenetic trees of homologous genes being incongruent with expected topology. The findings provide further insight into the roles played by polypoidization in the evolution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es and genes, and they suggest revisiting existing reconstructed phylogenetic trees.</p>

RECX Interacts with Mitochondrial RECA to Maintain Mitochondrial Genome Stability
<p>The chloroplast and mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es are essential for photosynthesis and respiration, respectively. RECA and RECG, which are plant-specific homologs of the bacterial homologous recombination repair proteins RecA and RecG, maintain organelle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e stability by suppressing aberrant recombination between short dispersed repeats (SDRs) in the moss <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. In this study, we analyzed the plant-specific factor RECX, a homolog of bacterial RecX that regulates RecA. RECX fused to GFP colocalized with mitochondrial RECA1 and chloroplast RECA2 on mitochondrial and chloroplast nucleoids, respectively. Knockout (KO) and overexpression (OEX) of <i>RECX</i> did not alter the <i>P. patens</i> morphological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>e. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA, however, showed that products from recombination between SDRs increased significantly in <i>RECX</i> OEX mitochondria and modestly in <i>RECX</i> KO mitochondria. By contrast, analysis of chloroplast DNA revealed no substantial alteration in the number of products from recombination between SDRs in <i>RECX</i> KO and OEX chloroplasts. Yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed interactions between RECX and RECA1 and between RECX and RECA2. Expression profiles showed a positive correlation between <i>RECX</i> and factors maintaining the stability of both organelle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es and <i>RECA1</i>. Collectively, these results suggest that RECX maintains mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e stability, likely by modulating RECA1 activity, and that the compromised function of RECX induces mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e instability.</p>

Dynamic Interplay between Nucleoid Segregation and Genome Integrity in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> Chloroplasts
<p>The chloroplast (cp) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e is organized as nucleoids that are dispersed throughout the cp stroma. Previously, a cp homolog of bacterial recombinase RecA (cpRECA) was shown to be involved in the maintenance of cp <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e integrity by repairing damaged chloroplast DNA and by suppressing aberrant recombination between short dispersed repeats in the moss <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. Here, overexpression and knockdown analysis of cpRECA in the green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> revealed that cpRECA was involved in cp nucleoid dynamics as well as having a role in maintaining cp <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e integrity. Overexpression of <i>cpRECA</i> tagged with yellow fluorescent protein or hemagglutinin resulted in the formation of giant filamentous structures that colocalized exclusively to chloroplast DNA and cpRECA localized to cp nucleoids in a heterogenous manner. Knockdown of <i>cpRECA</i> led to a significant reduction in cp nucleoid number that was accompanied by nucleoid enlargement. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>e resembled those of gyrase inhibitor-treated cells and <i>monokaryotic chloroplast</i> mutant cells and suggested that cpRECA was involved in organizing cp nucleoid dynamics. The cp <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e also was destabilized by induced recombination between short dispersed repeats in <i>cpRECA-</i>knockdown cells and gyrase inhibitor-treated cells. Taken together, these results suggest that cpRECA and gyrase are both involved in nucleoid dynamics and the maintenance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e integrity and that the mechanisms underlying these processes may be intimately related in <i>C. reinhardtii</i> cps.</p>

Epistasis and Pleiotropy Affect the Modularity of the Genotype–Phenotype Map of Cross-Resistance in HIV-1
<p>The genotype–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>e (GP) map is a central concept in evolutionary biology as it describes the mapping of molecular genetic variation onto <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ic trait variation. Our understanding of that mapping remains partial, especially when trying to link functional clustering of pleiotropic gene effects with patterns of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ic trait co-variation. Only on rare occasions have studies been able to fully explore that link and tend to show poor correspondence between modular structures within the GP map and among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>es. By dissecting the structure of the GP map of the replicative capacity of HIV-1 in 15 drug environments, we provide a detailed view of that mapping from mutational pleiotropic variation to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ic co-variation, including epistatic effects of a set of amino-acid substitutions in the reverse transcriptase and protease genes. We show that epistasis increases the pleiotropic degree of single mutations and provides modularity to the GP map of drug resistance in HIV-1. Moreover, modules of epistatic pleiotropic effects within the GP map match the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ic modules of correlated replicative capacity among drug classes. Epistasis thus increases the evolvability of cross-resistance in HIV by providing more drug- and class-specific pleiotropic profiles to the main effects of the mutations. We discuss the implications for the evolution of cross-resistance in HIV.</p>

Source of CpG Depletion in the HIV-1 Genome
<p>The dinucleotide CpG is highly underrepresented in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). To identify the source of CpG depletion in the HIV-1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e, we investigated two biological mechanisms: (1) CpG methylation-induced transcriptional silencing and (2) CpG recognition by Toll-like receptors (TLRs). We hypothesized that HIV-1 has been under selective evolutionary pressure by these mechanisms leading to the reduction of CpG in its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e. A CpG depleted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e would enable HIV-1 to avoid methylation-induced transcriptional silencing and/or to avoid recognition by TLRs that identify foreign CpG sequences. We investigated these two hypotheses by determining the sequence context dependency of CpG depletion and comparing it with that of CpG methylation and TLR recognition. We found that in both human and HIV-1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es the CpG motifs flanked by T/A were depleted most and those flanked by C/G were depleted least. Similarly, our analyses of human methylome data revealed that the CpG motifs flanked by T/A were methylated most and those flanked by C/G were methylated least. Given that a similar CpG depletion pattern was observed for the human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e within which CpGs are not likely to be recognized by TLRs, we argue that the main source of CpG depletion in HIV-1 is likely host-induced methylation. Analyses of CpG motifs in over 100 viruses revealed that this unique CpG representation pattern is specific to the human and simian immunodeficiency viruses.</p>

The Roles of Mutation, Selection, and Expression in Determining Relative Rates of Evolution in Mitochondrial versus Nuclear Genomes
<p>Eukaryotes rely on proteins encoded by the nuclear and mitochondrial (mt) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es, which interact within multisubunit complexes such as oxidative-phosphorylation enzymes. Although selection is thought to be less efficient on the asexual mt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e, in bilaterian animals the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions (<i>ω</i>) is lower in mt- compared with nuclear-encoded OXPHOS subunits, suggesting <i>stronger</i> effects of purifying selection in the mt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e. Because high levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene express</span></strong>ion constrain protein sequence evolution, one proposed resolution to this paradox is that mt genes are expressed more highly than nuclear genes. To test this hypothesis, we investigated expression and sequence evolution of mt and nuclear genes from 84 diverse eukaryotes that vary in mt gene content and mutation rate. We found that the relationship between mt and nuclear <i>ω</i> values varied dramatically across eukaryotes. In contrast, transcript abundance is consistently higher for mt genes than nuclear genes, regardless of which genes happen to be in the mt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e. Consequently, expression levels cannot be responsible for the differences in <i>ω</i>. Rather, 84% of the variance in the ratio of <i>ω</i> values between mt and nuclear genes could be explained by differences in mutation rate between the two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. We relate these findings to the hypothesis that high rates of mt mutation select for compensatory changes in the nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e. We also propose an explanation for why mt transcripts consistently outnumber their nuclear counterparts, with implications for mitonuclear protein imbalance and aging.</p>

To facilitate studies of seaweed biology, we decoded the draft <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e of <i>C. okamuranus</i> S-strain. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e size of <i>C. okamuranus</i> was estimated as ∼140 Mbp, smaller than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es of two other brown algae, <i>Ectocarpus siliculosus</i> and <i>Saccharina japonica</i>. Sequencing with ∼100× coverage yielded an assembly of 541 scaffolds with N50 = 416 kbp. Together with transcriptomic data, we estimated that the <i>C. okamuranus</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e contains 13,640 protein-coding genes, approximately 94% of which have been confirmed with corresponding mRNAs.

Bloomsbury report on mouse embryo phenotyping: recommendations from the IMPC workshop on embryonic lethal screening
<p>Identifying genes that are important for embryo development is a crucial first step towards understanding their many functions in driving the ordered growth, differentiation and organogenesis of embryos. It can also shed light on the origins of developmental disease and congenital abnormalities. Current international efforts to examine gene function in the mouse provide a unique opportunity to pinpoint genes that are involved in embryogenesis, owing to the emergence of embryonic lethal knockout mutants. Through internationally coordinated efforts, the International Knockout Mouse Consortium (IKMC) has generated a public resource of mouse knockout strains and, in April 2012, the International Mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ing Consortium (IMPC), supported by the EU InfraCoMP programme, convened a workshop to discuss developing a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ing pipeline for the investigation of embryonic lethal knockout lines.

As expected, 2 previously reported miR-22 target genes, MECP2 (methyl-CpG binding protein 2) and histone deacetylase 4, exhibited a regulatory role in VSMC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ic modulation. A transcriptional regulator and oncoprotein, EVI1 (ecotropic virus integration site 1 protein homolog), has been identified as a novel miR-22 target gene in VSMC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ic modulation. It is noteworthy that overexpression of miR-22 in the injured vessels significantly reduced the expression of its target genes, decreased VSMC proliferation, and inhibited neointima formation in wire-injured femoral arteries, whereas the opposite effect was observed with local application of a miR-22 inhibitor to injured arteries. We next examined the clinical relevance of miR-22 expression and its target genes in human femoral arteries. We found that miR-22 expression was significantly reduced, whereas MECP2 and EVI1 expression levels were dramatically increased, in diseased in comparison with healthy femoral human arteries. This inverse relationship between miR-22 and MECP2 and EVI1 was evident in both healthy and diseased human femoral arteries.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our data demonstrate that miR-22 and EVI1 are novel regulators of VSMC function, specifically during neointima hyperplasia, offering a novel therapeutic opportunity for treating vascular diseases.</p></sec>

<p>The Zika outbreak, spread by the <i>Aedes aegypti</i> mosquito, highlights the need to create high-quality assemblies of large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es in a rapid and cost-effective way. Here we combine Hi-C data with existing draft assemblies to generate chromosome-length scaffolds. We validate this method by assembling a human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e, de novo, from short reads alone (67× coverage). We then combine our method with draft sequences to create <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e assemblies of the mosquito disease vectors <i>Ae</i>.<i> aegypti</i> and <i>Culex quinquefasciatus</i>, each consisting of three scaffolds corresponding to the three chromosomes in each species. These assemblies indicate that almost all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic rearrangements among these species occur within, rather than between, chromosome arms. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e assembly procedure we describe is fast, inexpensive, and accurate, and can be applied to many species.</p>

Bug mapping and fitness testing of chemically synthesized chromosome X
<p>Debugging a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequence is imperative for successfully building a synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e. As part of the effort to build a designer eukaryotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e, yeast synthetic chromosome X (synX), designed as 707,459 base pairs, was synthesized chemically. SynX exhibited good fitness under a wide variety of conditions. A highly efficient mapping strategy called pooled PCRTag mapping (PoPM), which can be generalized to any watermarked synthetic chromosome, was developed to identify genetic alterations that affect cell fitness (“bugs”). A series of bugs were corrected that included a large region bearing complex amplifications, a growth defect mapping to a recoded sequence in <i>FIP1</i>, and a loxPsym site affecting promoter function of <i>ATP2</i>. PoPM is a powerful tool for synthetic yeast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e debugging and an efficient strategy for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>e-genotype mapping.</p>

Regeneration of <i>Solanum tuberosum</i> Plants from Protoplasts Induces Widespread Genome Instability
<p>Nontransgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e editing in regenerable protoplasts, plant cells free of their cell wall, could revolutionize crop improvement because it reduces regulatory and technical complexity. However, plant tissue culture is known to engender frequent unwanted variation, termed somaclonal variation. To evaluate the contribution of large-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e instability to this phenomenon, we analyzed potatoes (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>) regenerated from either protoplasts or stem explants for copy number changes by comparison of Illumina read depth. Whereas a control set of eight plants that had been propagated by cuttings displayed no changes, all 15 protoplast regenerants tested were affected by aneuploidy or structural chromosomal changes. Certain chromosomes displayed segmental deletions and duplications ranging from one to many. Resampling different leaves of the same plant found differences in three regenerants, indicating frequent persistence of instability. By comparison, 33 regenerants from stem explants used for <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated transformation displayed less frequent but still considerable (18%) large-scale copy number changes. Repetition of certain instability patterns suggested greater susceptibility in specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic sites. These results indicate that tissue culture, depending on the protocol used, can induce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic instability resulting in large-scale changes likely to compromise final plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>e.</p>

Efficient Replication of the Plastid Genome Requires an Organellar Thymidine Kinase
<p>Thymidine kinase (TK) is a key enzyme of the salvage pathway that recycles thymidine nucleosides to produce deoxythymidine triphosphate. Here, we identified the single TK of maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), denoted CPTK1, as necessary in the replication of the plastidial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e (cpDNA), demonstrating the essential function of the salvage pathway during chloroplast biogenesis. CPTK1 localized to both plastids and mitochondria, and its absence resulted in an albino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>e, reduced cpDNA copy number and a severe deficiency in plastidial ribosomes. Mitochondria were not affected, indicating they are less reliant on the salvage pathway. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) TKs, TK1A and TK1B, apparently resulted from a gene duplication after the divergence of monocots and dicots. Similar but less-severe effects were observed for Arabidopsis <i>tk1a tk1b</i> double mutants in comparison to those in maize <i>cptk1</i>. TK1B was important for cpDNA replication and repair in conditions of replicative stress but had little impact on the mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>e. In the maize <i>cptk1</i> mutant, the DNA from the small single-copy region of the plastidial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e was reduced to a greater extent than other regions, suggesting preferential abortion of replication in this region. This was accompanied by the accumulation of truncated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es that resulted, at least in part, from unfaithful microhomology-mediated repair. These and other results suggest that the loss of normal cpDNA replication elicits the mobilization of new replication origins around the <i>rpoB</i> (beta subunit of plastid-encoded RNA polymerase) transcription unit and imply that increased transcription at <i>rpoB</i> is associated with the initiation of cpDNA replication.</p>

Large Crown Root Number Improves Topsoil Foraging and Phosphorus Acquisition
<p>Suboptimal phosphorus (P) availability is a primary constraint to plant growth on Earth. We tested the hypothesis that maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) genotypes with large crown root number (CN) will have shallower rooting depth and improved P acquisition from low-P soils. Maize recombinant inbred lines with contrasting CN were evaluated under suboptimal P availability in greenhouse mesocosms and the field. Under P stress in mesocosms, the large-CN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>e had 48% greater root respiration, 24% shallower rooting depth, 32% greater root length density in the topsoil, 37% greater leaf P concentration, 48% greater leaf photosynthesis, 33% greater stomatal conductance, and 44% greater shoot biomass than the small-CN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>e. Under P stress in the field, the large-CN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>e had 32% shallower rooting depth, 51% greater root length density in the topsoil, 44% greater leaf P concentration, 18% greater leaf photosynthesis, 21% greater stomatal conductance, 23% greater shoot biomass at anthesis, and 28% greater yield than the small-CN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>e. These results support the hypothesis that large CN improves plant P acquisition from low-P soils by reducing rooting depth and increasing topsoil foraging. The large-CN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>e merits consideration as a selection target to improve P capture in maize and possibly other cereal crops.</p>

The Long Intergenic Noncoding RNA (LincRNA) Landscape of the Soybean Genome
<p>Long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) are emerging as important regulators of diverse biological processes. However, our understanding of lincRNA abundance and function remains very limited especially for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">agricultur</span></strong>ally important plants. Soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) is a major legume crop plant providing over a half of global oilseed production. Moreover, soybean can form symbiotic relationships with <i>Rhizobium</i> bacteria to fix atmospheric nitrogen. Soybean has a complex paleopolyploid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e and exhibits many vegetative and floral development complexities. Soybean cultivars have photoperiod requirements restricting its use and productivity. Molecular regulators of these legume-specific developmental processes remain enigmatic. Long noncoding RNAs may play important regulatory roles in soybean growth and development. In this study, over one billion RNA-seq read pairs from 37 samples representing nine tissues were used to discover 6,018 lincRNA loci. The lincRNAs were shorter than protein-coding transcripts and had lower expression levels and more sample specific expression. Few of the loci were found to be conserved in two other legume species (chickpea [<i>Cicer arietinum</i>] and <i>Medicago truncatula</i>), but almost 200 homeologous lincRNAs in the soybean <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e were detected. Protein-coding gene-lincRNA coexpression analysis suggested an involvement of lincRNAs in stress response, signal transduction, and developmental processes. Positional analysis of lincRNA loci implicated involvement in transcriptional regulation. lincRNA expression from centromeric regions was observed especially in actively dividing tissues, suggesting possible roles in cell division. Integration of publicly available <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e-wide association data with the lincRNA map of the soybean <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e uncovered 23 lincRNAs potentially associated with agronomic traits.</p>

LTR_retriever: A Highly Accurate and Sensitive Program for Identification of Long Terminal Repeat Retrotransposons
<p>Long terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTR-RTs) are prevalent in plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. The identification of LTR-RTs is critical for achieving high-quality gene annotation. Based on the well-conserved structure, multiple programs were developed for the de novo identification of LTR-RTs; however, these programs are associated with low specificity and high false discovery rates. Here, we report LTR_retriever, a multithreading-empowered Perl program that identifies LTR-RTs and generates high-quality LTR libraries from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic sequences. LTR_retriever demonstrated significant improvements by achieving high levels of sensitivity (91%), specificity (97%), accuracy (96%), and precision (90%) in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). LTR_retriever is also compatible with long sequencing reads. With 40k self-corrected PacBio reads equivalent to 4.5× <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e coverage in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the constructed LTR library showed excellent sensitivity and specificity. In addition to canonical LTR-RTs with 5′-TG…CA-3′ termini, LTR_retriever also identifies noncanonical LTR-RTs (non-TGCA), which have been largely ignored in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e-wide studies. We identified seven types of noncanonical LTRs from 42 out of 50 plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. The majority of noncanonical LTRs are <i>Copia</i> elements, with which the LTR is four times shorter than that of other <i>Copia</i> elements, which may be a result of their target specificity. Strikingly, non-TGCA <i>Copia</i> elements are often located in genic regions and preferentially insert nearby or within genes, indicating their impact on the evolution of genes and their potential as mutagenesis tools.</p>

Division Plane Orientation Defects Revealed by a Synthetic Double Mutant Phenotype
<p>TANGLED1 (TAN1) and AUXIN-INDUCED-IN-ROOTS9 (AIR9) are microtubule-binding proteins that localize to the division site in plants. Their function in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) remained unclear because neither <i>tan1</i> nor <i>air9</i> single mutants have a strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>e. We show that <i>tan1 air9</i> double mutants have a synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>e consisting of short, twisted roots with disordered cortical microtubule arrays that are hypersensitive to a microtubule-depolymerizing drug. The <i>tan1 air9</i> double mutants have significant defects in division plane orientation due to failures in placing the new cell wall at the correct division site. Full-length TAN1 fused to yellow fluorescent protein, <i>TAN1-YFP</i>, and several deletion constructs were transformed into the double mutant to assess which regions of TAN1 are required for its function in root growth, root twisting, and division plane orientation. <i>TAN1-YFP</i> expressed in <i>tan1 air9</i> significantly rescued the double mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>e in all three respects. Interestingly, TAN1 missing the first 126 amino acids, TAN1-ΔI-YFP, failed to rescue the double mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>e, while TAN1 missing a conserved middle region, TAN1-ΔII-YFP, significantly rescued the mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>e in terms of root growth and division plane orientation but not root twisting. We use the <i>tan1 air9</i> double mutant to discover new functions for TAN1 and AIR9 during phragmoplast guidance and root morphogenesis.</p>

Catastrophic Unbalanced Genome Rearrangements Cause Somatic Loss of Berry Color in Grapevine
<p>Grape (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) color somatic variants that can be used to develop new grapevine cultivars occasionally appear associated with deletion events of uncertain origin. To understand the mutational mechanisms generating somatic structural variation in grapevine, we compared the Tempranillo Blanco (TB) white berry somatic variant with its black berry ancestor, Tempranillo Tinto. Whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequencing uncovered a catastrophic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e rearrangement in TB that caused the hemizygous deletion of 313 genes, including the loss of the functional copy for the <i>MYB</i> transcription factors required for anthocyanin pigmentation in the berry skin. Loss of heterozygosity and decreased copy number delimited interspersed monosomic and disomic regions in the right arm of linkage groups 2 and 5. At least 11 validated clustered breakpoints involving intrachromosomal and interchromosomal translocations between three linkage groups flanked the deleted fragments, which, according to segregation analyses, are phased in a single copy of each of the affected chromosomes. These hallmarks, along with the lack of homology between breakpoint joins and the randomness of the order and orientation of the rearranged fragments, are all consistent with a chromothripsis-like pattern generated after chromosome breakage and illegitimate rejoining. This unbalanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e reshuffling has additional consequences in reproductive development. In TB, lack of sexual transmission of rearranged chromosomes associates with low gamete viability, which compromises fruit set and decreases fruit production. Our findings show that catastrophic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e rearrangements arise spontaneously and stabilize during plant somatic growth. These dramatic rearrangements generate new interesting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>es that can be selected for the improvement of vegetatively propagated plant species.</p>

The Genetic Basis of Plant Architecture in 10 Maize Recombinant Inbred Line Populations
<p>Plant architecture is a key factor affecting planting density and grain yield in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). However, the genetic mechanisms underlying plant architecture in diverse genetic backgrounds have not been fully addressed. Here, we performed a large-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ing of 10 plant architecture-related traits and dissected the genetic loci controlling these traits in 10 recombinant inbred line populations derived from 14 diverse genetic backgrounds. Nearly 800 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with major and minor effects were identified as contributing to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ic variation of plant architecture-related traits. Ninety-two percent of these QTLs were detected in only one population, confirming the diverse genetic backgrounds of the mapping populations and the prevalence of rare alleles in maize. The numbers and effects of QTLs are positively associated with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ic variation in the population, which, in turn, correlates positively with parental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ic and genetic variations. A large proportion (38.5%) of QTLs was associated with at least two traits, suggestive of the frequent occurrence of pleiotropic loci or closely linked loci. Key developmental genes, which previously were shown to affect plant architecture in mutant studies, were found to colocalize with many QTLs. Five QTLs were further validated using the segregating populations developed from residual heterozygous lines present in the recombinant inbred line populations. Additionally, one new plant height QTL, <i>qPH3</i>, has been fine-mapped to a 600-kb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic region where three candidate genes are located. These results provide insights into the genetic mechanisms controlling plant architecture and will benefit the selection of ideal plant architecture in maize breeding.</p>

<i>ATX3</i>, <i>ATX4</i>, and <i>ATX5</i> Encode Putative H3K4 Methyltransferases and Are Critical for Plant Development
<p>Methylation of Lys residues in the tail of the H3 histone is a key regulator of chromatin state and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene express</span></strong>ion, conferred by a large family of enzymes containing an evolutionarily conserved SET domain. One of the main types of SET domain proteins are those controlling H3K4 di- and trimethylation. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) encodes 12 such proteins, including five ARABIDOPSIS TRITHORAX (ATX) proteins and seven ATX-Related proteins. Here, we examined three until-now-unexplored ATX proteins, ATX3, ATX4, and ATX5. We found that they exhibit similar domain structures and expression patterns and are redundantly required for vegetative and reproductive development. Concurrent disruption of the <i>ATX3</i>, <i>ATX4</i>, and <i>ATX5</i> genes caused marked reduction in H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 levels <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e-wide and resulted in thousands of genes expressed ectopically. Furthermore, <i>atx3</i>/<i>atx4</i>/<i>atx5</i> triple mutants resulted in exaggerated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>es when combined with the <i>atx2</i> mutant but not with <i>atx1</i>. Together, we conclude that <i>ATX3</i>, <i>ATX4</i>, and <i>ATX5</i> are redundantly required for H3K4 di- and trimethylation at thousands of sites located across the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic features associated with targeted regions are different from the <i>ATXR3</i>/<i>SDG2</i>-controlled sites in Arabidopsis.</p>

The Plastid Genome of <i>Polytoma uvella</i> Is the Largest Known among Colorless Algae and Plants and Reflects Contrasting Evolutionary Paths to Nonphotosynthetic Lifestyles
<p>The loss of photosynthesis is frequently associated with parasitic or pathogenic lifestyles, but it also can occur in free-living, plastid-bearing lineages. A common consequence of becoming nonphotosynthetic is the reduction in size and gene content of the plastid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e. In exceptional circumstances, it can even result in the complete loss of the plastid DNA (ptDNA) and its associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene express</span></strong>ion system, as reported recently in several lineages, including the nonphotosynthetic green algal genus <i>Polytomella</i>. Closely related to <i>Polytomella</i> is the polyphyletic genus <i>Polytoma</i>, the members of which lost photosynthesis independently of <i>Polytomella</i>. Species from both genera are free-living organisms that contain nonphotosynthetic plastids, but unlike <i>Polytomella</i>, <i>Polytoma</i> members have retained a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e in their colorless plastid. Here, we present the plastid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e of <i>Polytoma uvella</i>: to our knowledge, the first report of ptDNA from a nonphotosynthetic chlamydomonadalean alga. The <i>P. uvella</i> ptDNA contains 25 protein-coding genes, most of which are related to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene express</span></strong>ion and none are connected to photosynthesis. However, despite its reduced coding capacity, the <i>P. uvella</i> ptDNA is inflated with short repeats and is tens of kilobases larger than the ptDNAs of its closest known photosynthetic relatives, <i>Chlamydomonas leiostraca</i> and <i>Chlamydomonas applanata</i>. In fact, at approximately 230 kb, the ptDNA of <i>P. uvella</i> represents the largest plastid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e currently reported from a nonphotosynthetic alga or plant. Overall, the <i>P. uvella</i> and <i>Polytomella</i> plastid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es reveal two very different evolutionary paths following the loss of photosynthesis: expansion and complete deletion, respectively. We hypothesize that recombination-based DNA-repair mechanisms are at least partially responsible for the different evolutionary outcomes observed in such closely related nonphotosynthetic algae.</p>

Hybridization in Plants: Old Ideas, New Techniques

With the growing availability of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic tools and advancements in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic analyses, it is becoming increasingly clear that gene flow between divergent taxa can generate new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ic diversity, allow for adaptation to novel environments, and contribute to speciation. Hybridization can have immediate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ic consequences through the expression of hybrid vigor. On longer evolutionary time scales, hybridization can lead to local adaption through the introgression of novel alleles and transgressive segregation and, in some cases, result in the formation of new hybrid species. Studying both the abundance and the evolutionary consequences of hybridization has deep historical roots in plant biology. Many of the hypotheses concerning how and why hybridization contributes to biological diversity currently being investigated were first proposed tens and even hundreds of years ago. In this Update, we discuss how new advancements in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic and genetic tools are revolutionizing our ability to document the occurrence of and investigate the outcomes of hybridization in plants.</p>

CTDGFinder: A Novel Homology-Based Algorithm for Identifying Closely Spaced Clusters of Tandemly Duplicated Genes
<p>Closely spaced clusters of tandemly duplicated genes (CTDGs) contribute to the diversity of many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>es, including chemosensation, snake venom, and animal body plans. CTDGs have traditionally been identified subjectively as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic neighborhoods containing several gene duplicates in close proximity; however, CTDGs are often highly variable with respect to gene number, intergenic distance, and synteny. This lack of formal definition hampers the study of CTDG evolutionary dynamics and the discovery of novel CTDGs in the exponentially growing body of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic data. To address this gap, we developed a novel homology-based algorithm, CTDGFinder, which formalizes and automates the identification of CTDGs by examining the physical distribution of individual members of families of duplicated genes across chromosomes. Application of CTDGFinder accurately identified CTDGs for many well-known gene clusters (e.g., Hox and beta-globin gene clusters) in the human, mouse and 20 other mammalian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. Differences between previously annotated gene clusters and our inferred CTDGs were due to the exclusion of nonhomologs that have historically been considered parts of specific gene clusters, the inclusion or absence of genes between the CTDGs and their corresponding gene clusters, and the splitting of certain gene clusters into distinct CTDGs. Examination of human genes showing tissue-specific enhancement of their expression by CTDGFinder identified members of several well-known gene clusters (e.g., cytochrome P450s and olfactory receptors) and revealed that they were unequally distributed across tissues. By formalizing and automating CTDG identification, CTDGFinder will facilitate understanding of CTDG evolutionary dynamics, their functional implications, and how they are associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ic diversity.</p>

Genome-Wide Biases in the Rate and Molecular Spectrum of Spontaneous Mutations in <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> and <i>Vibrio fischeri</i>
<p>The vast diversity in nucleotide composition and architecture among bacterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es may be partly explained by inherent biases in the rates and spectra of spontaneous mutations. Bacterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es with multiple chromosomes are relatively unusual but some are relevant to human health, none more so than the causative agent of cholera, <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>. Here, we present the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e-wide mutation spectra in wild-type and mismatch repair (MMR) defective backgrounds of two <i>Vibrio</i> species, the low-%GC squid symbiont <i>V. fischeri</i> and the pathogen <i>V. cholerae</i>, collected under conditions that greatly minimize the efficiency of natural selection. In apparent contrast to their high diversity in nature, both wild-type <i>V. fischeri</i> and <i>V. cholerae</i> have among the lowest rates for base-substitution mutations (bpsms) and insertion–deletion mutations (indels) that have been measured, below 10<sup>−</sup><sup>3</sup>/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e/generation. <i>Vibrio fischeri</i> and <i>V. cholerae</i> have distinct mutation spectra, but both are AT-biased and produce a surprising number of multi-nucleotide indels. Furthermore, the loss of a functional MMR system caused the mutation spectra of these species to converge, implying that the MMR system itself contributes to species-specific mutation patterns. Bpsm and indel rates varied among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e regions, but do not explain the more rapid evolutionary rates of genes on chromosome 2, which likely result from weaker purifying selection. More generally, the very low mutation rates of <i>Vibrio</i> species correlate inversely with their immense population sizes and suggest that selection may not only have maximized replication fidelity but also optimized other polygenic traits relative to the constraints of genetic drift.</p>

The Genotype–Phenotype Map of Yeast Complex Traits: Basic Parameters and the Role of Natural Selection
<p>Most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ic traits are controlled by many genes, but a global picture of the genotype–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>e map (GPM) is lacking. For example, in no species do we know generally how many genes affect a trait and how large these effects are. It is also unclear to what extent GPMs are shaped by natural selection. Here we address these fundamental questions using the reverse genetic data of 220 morphological traits in 4,718 budding yeast strains, each of which lacks a nonessential gene. We show that 1) the proportion of genes affecting a trait varies from <1% to >30%, averaging 6%, 2) most traits are impacted by many more small-effect genes than large-effect genes, and 3) the mean effect of all nonessential genes on a trait decreases precipitously as the estimated importance of the trait to fitness increases. An analysis of 3,116 yeast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene express</span></strong>ion traits in 754 gene-deletion strains reveals a similar pattern. These findings illustrate the power of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e-wide reverse genetics in genotype–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>e mapping, uncover an enormous range of genetic complexity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ic traits, and suggest that the GPM of cellular organisms has been shaped by natural selection for mutational robustness.</p>

<p>Studies on beetle/tree fungal symbionts typically characterize the ecological and geographic distributions of the fungal populations. There is limited understanding of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e-wide evolutionary processes that act within and between species as such fungi adapt to different environments, leading to physiological differences and reproductive isolation. Here, we assess <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic evidence for such evolutionary processes by extending our recent work on <i>Grosmannia clavigera</i>, which is vectored by the mountain pine beetle and jeffrey pine beetle. We report the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequences of an additional 11 <i>G. clavigera</i> (Gc) sensu lato strains from the two known sibling species, <i>Grosmannia</i> sp. (Gs) and Gc. The 12 fungal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es are structurally similar, showing large-scale synteny within and between species. We identified 103,430 single-nucleotide variations that separated the <i>Grosmannia</i> strains into divergent Gs and Gc clades, and further divided each of these clades into two subclades, one of which may represent an additional species. Comparing variable genes between these lineages, we identified truncated genes and potential pseudogenes, as well as seven genes that show evidence of positive selection. As these variable genes are involved in secondary metabolism and in detoxifying or utilizing host-tree defense chemicals (e.g., polyketide synthases, oxidoreductases, and mono-oxygenases), their variants may reflect adaptation to the specific chemistries of the host trees <i>Pinus contorta</i>, <i>P. ponderosa</i>, and <i>P. jeffreyi</i>. This work provides a comprehensive resource for developing informative markers for landscape population <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ics of these ecologically and economically important fungi, and an approach that could be extended to other beetle–tree-associated fungi.</p>

Expansion of Secretin-Like G Protein-Coupled Receptors and Their Peptide Ligands via Local Duplications Before and After Two Rounds of Whole-Genome Duplication
<p>In humans, the secretin-like G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family comprises 15 members with 18 corresponding peptide ligand genes. Although members have been identified in a large variety of vertebrate and nonvertebrate species, the origin and relationship of these proteins remain unresolved. To address this issue, we employed large-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e comparisons to identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e fragments with conserved synteny and matched these fragments to linkage groups in reconstructed early gnathostome ancestral chromosomes (<i>GAC</i>). This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e comparison revealed that most receptor and peptide genes were clustered in three <i>GAC</i> linkage groups and suggested that the ancestral forms of five peptide subfamilies (corticotropin-releasing hormone-like, calcitonin-like, parathyroid hormone-like, glucagon-like, and growth hormone-releasing hormone-like) and their cognate receptor families emerged through tandem local gene duplications before two rounds (2R) of whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e duplication. These subfamily genes have, then, been amplified by 2R whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e duplication, followed by additional local duplications and gene loss prior to the divergence of land vertebrates and teleosts. This study delineates a possible evolutionary scenario for whole secretin-like peptide and receptor family members and may shed light on evolutionary mechanisms for expansion of a gene family with a large number of paralogs.</p>

Inference of Natural Selection from Interspersed Genomic Elements Based on Polymorphism and Divergence
<p>Complete <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequences contain valuable information about natural selection, but this information is difficult to access for short, widely scattered noncoding elements such as transcription factor binding sites or small noncoding RNAs. Here, we introduce a new computational method, called <i>I</i>nference of <i>N</i>atural <i>S</i>election from <i>I</i>nterspersed <i>G</i>enomically co<i>H</i>erent elemen<i>T</i>s (INSIGHT), for measuring the influence of natural selection on such elements. INSIGHT uses a generative probabilistic model to contrast patterns of polymorphism and divergence in the elements of interest with those in flanking neutral sites, pooling weak information from many short elements in a manner that accounts for variation among loci in mutation rates and coalescent times. The method is able to disentangle the contributions of weak negative, strong negative, and positive selection based on their distinct effects on patterns of polymorphism and divergence. It obtains information about divergence from multiple outgroup <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es using a general statistical phylogenetic approach. The INSIGHT model is efficiently fitted to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e-wide data using an approximate expectation maximization algorithm. Using simulations, we show that the method can accurately estimate the parameters of interest even in complex demographic scenarios, and that it significantly improves on methods based on summary statistics describing polymorphism and divergence. To demonstrate the usefulness of INSIGHT, we apply it to several classes of human noncoding RNAs and to GATA2-binding sites in the human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e.</p>

Draft genome sequence of an inbred line of <i>Chenopodium quinoa</i>, an allotetraploid crop with great environmental adaptability and outstanding nutritional properties
<p><i>Chenopodium quinoa</i> Willd. (quinoa) originated from the Andean region of South America, and is a pseudocereal crop of the Amaranthaceae family. Quinoa is emerging as an important crop with the potential to contribute to food security worldwide and is considered to be an optimal food source for astronauts, due to its outstanding nutritional profile and ability to tolerate stressful environments. Furthermore, plant pathologists use quinoa as a representative diagnostic host to identify virus species. However, molecular analysis of quinoa is limited by its genetic heterogeneity due to outcrossing and its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e complexity derived from allotetraploidy. To overcome these obstacles, we established the inbred and standard quinoa accession Kd that enables rigorous molecular analysis, and presented the draft <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequence of Kd, using an optimized combination of high-throughput next generation sequencing on the Illumina Hiseq 2500 and PacBio RS II sequencers. The <i>de novo</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e assembly contained 25 k scaffolds consisting of 1 Gbp with N50 length of 86 kbp. Based on these data, we constructed the free-access Quinoa <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e DataBase (QGDB). Thus, these findings provide insights into the mechanisms underlying agronomically important traits of quinoa and the effect of allotetraploidy on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e evolution.</p>

Genome sequence of <i>Aspergillus luchuensis</i> NBRC 4314
<p>Awamori is a traditional distilled beverage made from steamed Thai-Indica rice in Okinawa, Japan. For brewing the liquor, two microbes, local kuro (black) koji mold <i>Aspergillus luchuensis</i> and awamori yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> are involved. In contrast, that yeasts are used for ethanol fermentation throughout the world, a characteristic of Japanese fermentation industries is the use of <i>Aspergillus</i> molds as a source of enzymes for the maceration and saccharification of raw materials. Here we report the draft <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e of a kuro (black) koji mold, <i>A. luchuensis</i> NBRC 4314 (RIB 2604). The total length of nonredundant sequences was nearly 34.7 Mb, comprising approximately 2,300 contigs with 16 telomere-like sequences. In total, 11,691 genes were predicted to encode proteins. Most of the housekeeping genes, such as transcription factors and <i>N</i>-and <i>O</i>-glycosylation system, were conserved with respect to <i>Aspergillus niger</i> and <i>Aspergillus oryzae</i>. An alternative oxidase and acid-stable α-amylase regarding citric acid production and fermentation at a low pH as well as a unique glutamic peptidase were also found in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e. Furthermore, key biosynthetic gene clusters of ochratoxin A and fumonisin B were absent when compared with <i>A. niger</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e, showing the safety of <i>A. luchuensis</i> for food and beverage production. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e information will facilitate not only comparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ics with industrial kuro-koji molds, but also molecular breeding of the molds in improvements of awamori fermentation.</p>

ChloroMitoSSRDB: Open Source Repository of Perfect and Imperfect Repeats in Organelle Genomes for Evolutionary Genomics
<p>Microsatellites or simple sequence repeats (SSRs) are repetitive stretches of nucleotides (A, T, G, C) that are distributed either as single base pair stretches or as a combination of two- to six-nucleotides units that are non-randomly distributed within coding and in non-coding regions of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e. ChloroMitoSSRDB is a complete curated web-oriented relational database of perfect and imperfect repeats in organelle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. The present version of the database contains perfect and imperfect SSRs of 2161 organelle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es (1982 mitochondrial and 179 chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es). We detected a total of 5838 chloroplast perfect SSRs, 37 297 chloroplast imperfect SSRs, 5898 mitochondrial perfect SSRs and 50 355 mitochondrial imperfect SSRs across these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. The repeats have been further hyperlinked to the annotated gene regions (coding or non-coding) and a link to the corresponding gene record in National Center for Biotechnology Information(<ext-link>www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</ext-link>) to identify and understand the positional relationship of the repetitive tracts. ChloroMitoSSRDB is connected to a user-friendly web interface that provides useful information associated with the location of the repeats (coding and non-coding), size of repeat, motif and length polymorphism, etc. ChloroMitoSSRDB will serve as a repository for developing functional markers for molecular phylogenetics, estimating molecular variation across species. Database URL: ChloroMitoSSRDB can be accessed as an open source repository at <ext-link>www.mcr.org.in/chloromitossrdb</ext-link>.</p>

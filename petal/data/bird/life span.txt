Prospective Countywide Surveillance and Autopsy Characterization of Sudden Cardiac Death
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Studies of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> (SCD) use emergency medical services records, <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> certificates, or definitions that infer cause of <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>; thus, the true incidence of SCD is unknown. Over 90% of SCDs occur out-of-hospital; nonforensic autopsies are rarely performed, and therefore causes of <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> are presumed. We conducted a medical examiner–based investigation to determine the precise incidence and autopsy-defined causes of all SCDs in an entire metropolitan area. We hypothesized that postmortem investigation would identify actual sudden arrhythmic <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>s among presumed SCDs.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Between February 1, 2011, and March 1, 2014, we prospectively identified all incident <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>s attributed to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (emergency medical services primary impression, cardiac arrest) between 18 to 90 years of age in San Francisco County for autopsy, toxicology, and histology via medical examiner surveillance of consecutive out-of-hospital <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>s, all reported by law. We obtained comprehensive records to determine whether out-of-hospital cardiac arrest <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>s met World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for SCD. We reviewed <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> certificates filed quarterly for missed SCDs. Autopsy-defined sudden arrhythmic <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>s had no extracardiac cause of <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> or acute heart failure.

From these, we identified 912 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>s; 541 (59%) met WHO SCD criteria (mean 62.8 years, 69% male) and 525 (97%) were autopsied. Eighty-nine additional WHO-defined SCDs occurred within 3 weeks of active medical care with the <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> certificate signed by the attending physician, ineligible for autopsy but included in the countywide WHO-defined SCD incidence of 29.6/100 000 person-years, highest in black men (<i>P</i><0.0001). Of 525 WHO-defined SCDs, 301 (57%) had no cardiac history. Leading causes of <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> were coronary disease (32%), occult overdose (13.5%), cardiomyopathy (10%), cardiac hypertrophy (8%), and neurological (5.5%). Autopsy-defined sudden arrhythmic <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>s were 55.8% (293/525) of overall, 65% (78/120) of witnessed, and 53% (215/405) of unwitnessed WHO-defined SCDs (<i>P</i>=0.024); 286 of 293 (98%) had structural cardiac disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Forty percent of <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>s attributed to stated cardiac arrest were not sudden or unexpected, and nearly half of presumed SCDs were not arrhythmic.

Potential Deaths Averted and Serious Adverse Events Incurred From Adoption of the SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) Intensive Blood Pressure Regimen in the United States
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) demonstrated a 27% reduction in all-cause <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ity with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) goal of <120 versus <140 mm Hg among US adults at high cardiovascular disease risk but without diabetes mellitus, stroke, or heart failure. To quantify the potential benefits and risks of SPRINT intensive goal implementation, we estimated the <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>s prevented and excess serious adverse events incurred if the SPRINT intensive SBP treatment goal were implemented in all eligible US adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>SPRINT eligibility criteria were applied to the 1999 to 2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and linked with the National <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> Index through December 2011.

Sex Difference in Patients With Ischemic Heart Failure Undergoing Surgical Revascularization
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Female sex is conventionally considered a risk factor for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and has been included as a poor prognostic factor in multiple cardiac operative risk evaluation scores. We aimed to investigate the association of sex and the long-term benefit of CABG in patients with ischemic left ventricular dysfunction enrolled in the prospective STICH trial (Surgical Treatment for Ischemic Heart Failure Study).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The STICH trial randomized 1212 patients (148 [12%] women and 1064 [88%] men) with coronary artery disease and left ventricular ejection fraction ≤35% to CABG+medical therapy (MED) versus MED alone.

A Population-Based Study of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Treatment in Finland 2000 to 2014
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In the event of rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ity is very high. AAA prevalence and incidence of ruptures have been reported to be decreasing. The treatment of AAA has also undergone a change in recent decades with a shift toward endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). Our aim was to evaluate how these changes have affected the elective and emergency treatment of AAA and their results in Finland.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>All patients treated for AAA in Finland, a country with a population of 5.5 million, during 2000 to 2014 were searched from the registry of the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare. Data on all patients who had died of AAA during the same time period were obtained from Statistics Finland. The data were combined and analyzed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The annual incidence of ruptured AAA was 16.4 per 100 000 population over 50 years and decreased significantly during the study period. Over half of the 4949 patients who had a ruptured AAA died outside the hospital. Thirty-day <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ity after emergency repair was 39.4%. Intact AAA repairs numbered 4956. The absolute number of annual repairs increased during the study period, and the use of EVAR became the dominant method of elective repair. Thirty-day <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ity in elective AAA repair dropped significantly from 6.3% in 2000 to 2004 to 2.7% in 2010 to 2014 mostly because of the increased number of EVAR procedures with lower <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ity. Long-term <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ity in patients treated with EVAR was higher than in patients treated with open repair. <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ity after elective AAA repair was primarily attributable to cardiovascular causes, but there was a slightly higher proportion of AAA-related late <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>s in patients treated with EVAR.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Ruptured AAA incidence for men >65 years has declined by nearly 30% in Finland, likely because of the decrease in AAA prevalence. The treatment results have improved as well for both elective and emergency repair. Increased use of EVAR has resulted in a decrease of <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ity after elective AAA repair, but results of open repair have improved as well. However, late <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ity from elective EVAR is surprisingly high in comparison with open repair, which may have been exaggerated by patient selection.</p></sec>

Association of Statin Dose With Amputation and Survival in Patients With Peripheral Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Statin dose guidelines for patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) are largely based on coronary artery disease and stroke data. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of statin intensity on PAD outcomes of amputation and <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using an observational cohort study design and a validated algorithm, we identified patients with incident PAD (2003–2014) in the national Veterans Affairs data. Highest statin intensity exposure (high-intensity versus low-to-moderate–intensity versus antiplatelet therapy but no statin use) was determined within 1 year of diagnosis of PAD. Outcomes of interest were lower extremity amputations and <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>. The association of statin intensity with incident amputation and <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ity was assessed with Kaplan-Meier plots, Cox proportional hazards modeling, propensity score–matched analysis, and sensitivity and subgroup analyses, as well, to reduce confounding.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In 155 647 patients with incident PAD, more than a quarter (28%) were not on statins. Use of high-intensity statins was lowest in patients with PAD only (6.4%) in comparison with comorbid coronary/carotid disease (18.4%). Incident amputation and <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ity risk declined significantly with any statin use in comparison with the antiplatelet therapy–only group. In adjusted Cox models, the high-intensity statin users were associated with lower amputation risk and <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ity in comparison with antiplatelet therapy–only users (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.61–0.74 and hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.70–0.77, respectively). Low-to-moderate–intensity statins also had significant reductions in the risk of amputation and <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ity (hazard ratio amputation, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.75– 0.86; hazard ratio <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.81–0.86) in comparison with no statins (antiplatelet therapy only), but effect size was significantly weaker than the high-intensity statins (<i>P</i><0.001). The association of high-intensity statins with lower amputation and <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> risk remained significant and robust in propensity score–matched, sensitivity, and subgroup analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Statins, especially high-intensity formulations, are underused in patients with PAD. This is the first population-based study to show that high-intensity statin use at the time of PAD diagnosis is associated with a significant reduction in limb loss and <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ity in comparison with low-to-moderate–intensity statin users, and patients treated only with antiplatelet medications but not with statins, as well.</p></sec>

Systolic Blood Pressure Trajectory, Frailty, and All-Cause Mortality >80 Years of Age
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Clinical trials show benefit from lowering systolic blood pressure (SBP) in people ≥80 years of age, but nonrandomized epidemiological studies suggest lower SBP may be associated with higher <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ity. This study aimed to evaluate associations of SBP with all-cause <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ity by frailty category >80 years of age and to evaluate SBP trajectories before <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A population-based cohort study was conducted using electronic health records of 144 403 participants ≥80 years of age registered with family practices in the United Kingdom from 2001 to 2014. Participants were followed for ≤5 years. Clinical records of SBP were analyzed. Frailty status was classified using the e-Frailty Index into the categories of fit, mild, moderate, and severe. All-cause <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ity was evaluated by frailty status and mean SBP in Cox proportional-hazards models.

For women with severe frailty, rates were 16.8, 25.2, and 39.6, respectively. SBP trajectories showed an accelerated decline in the last 2 years of life. The relative odds of SBP <120 mm Hg were higher in the last 3 months of life than 5 years previously in both treated (odds ratio, 6.06; 95% confidence interval, 5.40–6.81) and untreated (odds ratio, 6.31; 95% confidence interval, 5.30–7.52) patients. There was no evidence of intensification of antihypertensive therapy in the final 2 years of life.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>A terminal decline of SBP in the final 2 years of life suggests that nonrandomized epidemiological associations of low SBP with higher <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ity may be accounted for by reverse causation if participants with lower blood pressure values are closer, on average, to the end of life.</p></sec>

Specialized Adult Congenital Heart Disease Care
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Clinical guidelines recommend specialized care for adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) patients. In reality, few patients receive such dedicated care. We sought to examine the impact of specialized care on ACHD patient <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We examined referral rates to specialized ACHD centers and ACHD patient <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ity rates between 1990 and 2005 in the population-based Quebec Congenital Heart Disease database (n=71 467). This period covers several years before and after the publication of guidelines endorsing specialized care for ACHD patients. A time-series design, based on Joinpoint and Poisson regression analyses, was used to assess the changes in annual referral and patient <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ity rates. The association between specialized ACHD care and all-cause <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ity was assessed in both case–control and cohort studies. The time-series analysis demonstrated a significant increase in referral rates to specialized ACHD centers in 1997 (rate ratio, +7.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI], +6.6% to +8.2%). In parallel, a significant reduction in expected ACHD patient <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ity was observed after year 2000 (rate ratio, −5.0%;95% CI, −10.8% to −0.8%). In exploratory post hoc cohort and case–control analyses, specialized ACHD care was independently associated with reduced <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ity (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.65–0.94) and a reduced odds of <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> (adjusted odds ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.08–0.97), respectively. This effect was predominantly driven by patients with severe congenital heart disease (hazard ratio, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.22–0.67).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>A significant increase in referrals to specialized ACHD centers followed the introduction of the clinical guidelines. Moreover, referral to specialized ACHD care was independently associated with a significant <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ity reduction.

Mean potassium at discharge was 4.3±0.48 mEq/L. Hypokalemia (<3.5 mEq/L), normokalemia (3.5–5.0 mEq/L), and hyperkalemia (>5 mEq/L) were observed at the index admission in 77 (3.6%), 1965 (90.8%), and 122 (5.6%) patients, respectively. At a median follow-up of 2.8 years (range, 0.03–12.8 years), 1090 patients died (50.4%). On a continuous scale, the multivariable-adjusted association of potassium values and <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ity revealed a nonlinear association (U-shaped) with higher risk at both ends of its distribution (omnibus <i>P</i>=0.001).

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Dead or Alive? Using Membrane Failure and Chlorophyll <i>a</i> Fluorescence to Predict Plant Mortality from Drought
<p>Climate models predict widespread increases in both drought intensity and duration in the next decades. Although water deficiency is a significant determinant of plant survival, limited understanding of plant responses to extreme drought impedes forecasts of both forest and crop productivity under increasing aridity. Drought induces a suite of physiological responses; however, we lack an accurate mechanistic description of plant response to lethal drought that would improve predictive understanding of <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ity under altered climate conditions. Here, proxies for leaf cellular damage, chlorophyll <i>a</i> fluorescence, and electrolyte leakage were directly associated with failure to recover from drought upon rewatering in <i>Brassica</i> <i>rapa</i> (genotype R500) and thus define the exact timing of drought-induced <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>. We validated our results using a second genotype (imb211) that differs substantially in life history traits. Our study demonstrates that whereas changes in carbon dynamics and water transport are critical indicators of drought stress, they can be unrelated to visible metrics of <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ity, i.e. lack of meristematic activity and regrowth. In contrast, membrane failure at the cellular scale is the most proximate cause of <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>. This hypothesis was corroborated in two gymnosperms (<i>Picea engelmannii</i> and <i>Pinus contorta</i>) that experienced lethal water stress in the field and in laboratory conditions. We suggest that measurement of chlorophyll <i>a</i> fluorescence can be used to operationally define plant <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> arising from drought, and improved plant characterization can enhance surface model predictions of drought <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ity and its consequences to ecosystem services at a global scale.</p>

Empagliflozin and Clinical Outcomes in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Established Cardiovascular Disease, and Chronic Kidney Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, reduced cardiovascular morbidity and <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial (Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients). Urinary glucose excretion with empagliflozin decreases with declining renal function, resulting in less potency for glucose lowering in patients with kidney disease. We investigated the effects of empagliflozin on clinical outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, established cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, established cardiovascular disease, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥30 mL·min<sup>−1</sup>·1.73 m<sup>−2</sup> at screening were randomized to receive empagliflozin 10 mg, empagliflozin 25 mg, or placebo once daily in addition to standard of care.

Long-Term Outcomes in Patients With Type 2 Myocardial Infarction and Myocardial Injury
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury are common in clinical practice, but long-term consequences are uncertain. We aimed to define long-term outcomes and explore risk stratification in patients with type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We identified consecutive patients (n=2122) with elevated cardiac troponin I concentrations (≥0.05 µg/L) at a tertiary cardiac center. All diagnoses were adjudicated as per the universal definition of myocardial infarction. The primary outcome was all-cause <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>. Secondary outcomes included major adverse cardiovascular events (eg, nonfatal myocardial infarction or cardiovascular <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>) and noncardiovascular <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>. To explore competing risks, cause-specific hazard ratios were obtained using Cox regression models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The adjudicated index diagnosis was type 1 or 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury in 1171 (55.2%), 429 (20.2%), and 522 (24.6%) patients, respectively. At 5 years, all-cause <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> rates were higher in those with type 2 myocardial infarction (62.5%) or myocardial injury (72.4%) compared with type 1 myocardial infarction (36.7%). The majority of excess <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>s in those with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury were because of noncardiovascular causes (hazard ratio, 2.32; 95% confidence interval, 1.92–2.81 versus type 1 myocardial infarction). Despite this finding, the observed crude major adverse cardiovascular event rates were similar between groups (30.6% versus 32.6%), with differences apparent after adjustment for covariates (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.69–0.96). Coronary heart disease was an independent predictor of major adverse cardiovascular events in those with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury (hazard ratio, 1.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.31–2.24).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Despite an excess in noncardiovascular <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>, patients with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury have a similar crude rate of major adverse cardiovascular events as those with type 1 myocardial infarction.

The CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex controls Atg7-dependent cell death and heart function
<p>Shortening and removal of the polyadenylate [poly(A)] tail of mRNA, a process called deadenylation, is a key step in mRNA decay that is mediated through the CCR4-NOT (carbon catabolite repression 4–negative on TATA-less) complex. In our investigation of the regulation of mRNA deadenylation in the heart, we found that this complex was required to prevent cell <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>. Conditional deletion of the CCR4-NOT complex components Cnot1 or Cnot3 resulted in the formation of autophagic vacuoles and cardiomyocyte <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>, leading to lethal heart failure accompanied by long QT intervals. Cnot3 bound to and shortened the poly(A) tail of the mRNA encoding the key autophagy regulator Atg7. In <i>Cnot3</i>-depleted hearts, <i>Atg7</i> expression was posttranscriptionally increased. Genetic ablation of <i>Atg7</i>, but not <i>Atg5</i>, increased survival and partially restored cardiac function of <i>Cnot1</i> or <i>Cnot3</i> knockout mice. We further showed that in <i>Cnot3</i>-depleted hearts, Atg7 interacted with p53 and modulated p53 activity to induce the expression of genes encoding cell <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>–promoting factors in cardiomyocytes, indicating that defects in deadenylation in the heart aberrantly activated Atg7 and p53 to promote cell <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>. Thus, mRNA deadenylation mediated by the CCR4-NOT complex is crucial to prevent Atg7-induced cell <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> and heart failure, suggesting a role for mRNA deadenylation in targeting autophagy genes to maintain normal cardiac homeostasis.</p>

Changing dynamics of the drug overdose epidemic in the United States from 1979 through 2016
<p>Better understanding of the dynamics of the current U.S. overdose epidemic may aid in the development of more effective prevention and control strategies. We analyzed records of 599,255 <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>s from 1979 through 2016 from the National Vital Statistics System in which accidental drug poisoning was identified as the main cause of <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>. By examining all available data on accidental poisoning <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>s back to 1979 and showing that the overall 38-year curve is exponential, we provide evidence that the current wave of opioid overdose <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>s (due to prescription opioids, heroin, and fentanyl) may just be the latest manifestation of a more fundamental longer-term process.

The plateau of human mortality: Demography of longevity pioneers
<p>Theories about biological limits to life <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> and evolutionary shaping of human <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">longev</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ity depend on facts about <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ity at extreme ages, but these facts have remained a matter of debate. Do hazard curves typically level out into high plateaus eventually, as seen in other species, or do exponential increases persist? In this study, we estimated hazard rates from data on all inhabitants of Italy aged 105 and older between 2009 and 2015 (born 1896–1910), a total of 3836 documented cases. We observed level hazard curves, which were essentially constant beyond age 105. Our estimates are free from artifacts of aggregation that limited earlier studies and provide the best evidence to date for the <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">exist</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ence of extreme-age <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ity plateaus in humans.</p>

Singlet Oxygen Plays an Essential Role in the Root’s Response to Osmotic Stress
<p>The high osmotic potentials in plants subjected to drought stress can be mimicked by the application of high molecular weight polyethylene glycol. Here, we quantified the effects of exposure to polyethylene glycol on the growth of the main and lateral roots of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings. The effects on root growth were highly correlated with the appearance of singlet oxygen, as visualized using the singlet oxygen-specific probe singlet oxygen sensor green. The production of singlet oxygen was followed by cell <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>, as indicated by the intracellular accumulation of propidium iodide due to the loss of membrane integrity. Cell <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> began in the epidermal region of the root tip and spread in a dynamic manner to meristematic sections. In parallel, gene expression changes specific to the presence of singlet oxygen were observed. The accumulation of other reactive oxygen species, namely hydrogen, peroxide, nitric oxide, and superoxide, did not correlate with cell <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>. In addition, both the singlet oxygen scavenger His and the lipoxygenase inhibitor salicylhydroxamic acid specifically inhibited singlet oxygen accumulation and cell <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>. These results suggest a light-independent, type-I source of singlet oxygen production. Serpin-protease interactions were used as a model to assess the possibility of vacuolar-type cell <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>. Osmotic stress induced the accumulation of complexes between the cytoplasmic serpin AtSERPIN1 and its cognate vacuolar proteases, indicating that vacuolar integrity was compromised. These findings imply that singlet oxygen plays an essential role in conveying the root response to osmotic stress.</p>

Involvement of Adapter Protein Complex 4 in Hypersensitive Cell Death Induced by Avirulent Bacteria<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plant immunity to avirulent bacterial pathogens is associated with subcellular membrane dynamics including fusion between the vacuolar and plasma membranes, resulting in hypersensitive cell <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>. Here, we report that ADAPTOR PROTEIN COMPLEX-4 (AP-4) subunits are involved in plant immunity associated with hypersensitive cell <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>. We isolated a mutant with a defect in resistance to an avirulent strain of <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv. <i>tomato</i> (<i>Pto</i>) DC3000 <i>avrRpm1</i> from a vacuolar protein sorting mutant library of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The mutant was identical to <i>gfs4-1</i>, which has a mutation in the gene encoding the AP-4 subunit AP4B. Thus, we focused on AP4B and another subunit, AP4E. All of the mutants (<i>ap4b-3</i>, <i>ap4b-4</i>, <i>ap4e-1</i>, and <i>ap4e-2</i>) were defective in hypersensitive cell <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> and resistance to <i>Pto</i> DC3000 with the type III effector AvrRpm1 or AvrRpt2, both of which are recognized on the plasma membrane, while they showed slightly enhanced susceptibility to the type-III-secretion-deficient <i>P. syringae</i> strain <i>hrcC</i>. On the other hand, both <i>ap4b-3</i> and <i>ap4b-4</i> showed no defect in resistance to <i>Pto</i> DC3000 with the type III effector AvrRps4, which is recognized in the cytosol and does not induce hypersensitive cell <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>. Upon infection with <i>Pto</i> DC3000 <i>avrRpt2</i>, the <i>ap4b-3</i> and <i>ap4b-4</i> leaf cells did not show fusion between vacuolar and plasma membranes, whereas the wild-type leaf cells did. These results suggest that AP-4 contributes to cell <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>-associated immunity, possibly via membrane fusion, after type III effector-recognition on the plasma membrane.</p>

BcXYG1, a Secreted Xyloglucanase from <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>, Triggers Both Cell Death and Plant Immune Responses
<p>In search of <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> cell <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>-inducing proteins, we found a xyloglucanase (BcXYG1) that induced strong necrosis and a resistance response in dicot plants. Expression of the <i>BcXYG1</i> gene was strongly induced during the first 12 h post inoculation, and analysis of disease dynamics using PathTrack showed that a <i>B. cinerea</i> strain overexpressing <i>BcXYG1</i> produced early local necrosis, supporting a role of BcXYG1 as an early cell <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>-inducing factor. The xyloglucanase activity of BcXYG1 was not necessary for the induction of necrosis and plant resistance, as a mutant of BcXYG1 lacking the xyloglucanase enzymatic activity retained both functions. Residues in two exposed loops on the surface of BcXYG1 were found to be necessary for the induction of cell <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> but not to induce plant resistance. Further analyses showed that BcXYG1 is apoplastic and possibly interacts with the proteins of the plant cell membrane and also that the BcXYG1 cell <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>-promoting signal is mediated by the leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases BAK1 and SOBIR1. Our findings support the role of cell <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>-inducing proteins in establishing the infection of necrotrophic pathogens and highlight the recognition of fungal apoplastic proteins by the plant immune system as an important mechanism of resistance against this class of pathogens.</p>

At last evaluation, 277 patients (91%) are alive at 62±13 years of age, including 89% in New York Heart Association class I or II. No difference was found in outcome measures for patients with AF and age- and sex-matched patients with HCM without AF. Four percent of patients with AF died of HCM-related causes (n=11), with annual <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ity 0.7%; <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ity directly attributable to AF (thromboembolism without prophylactic anticoagulation) was 0.1% per year (n=2 patients). Patients were treated with antiarrhythmic drugs (most commonly amiodarone [n=103] or sotalol [n=78]) and AF catheter ablation (n=49) or the Maze procedure at surgical myectomy (n=72). Freedom from AF recurrence at 1 year was 44% for ablation patients and 75% with the Maze procedure (<i>P</i><0.001). Embolic events were less common with anticoagulation prophylaxis (4/233, 2%) than without (9/66, 14%) (<i>P</i><0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Transient symptomatic episodes of AF, often responsible for impaired quality of life, are unpredictable in frequency and timing, but amenable to effective contemporary treatments, and infrequently progress to permanent AF. AF is not a major contributor to heart failure morbidity or a cause of arrhythmic sudden <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>; when treated, it is associated with low disease-related <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ity, no different than for patients without AF. AF is an uncommon primary cause of <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> in HCM virtually limited to embolic stroke, supporting a low threshold for initiating anticoagulation therapy.</p></sec>

Conscious Sedation Versus General Anesthesia for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Conscious sedation is used during transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with limited evidence as to the safety and efficacy of this practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The National Cardiovascular Data Registry Society of Thoracic Surgeons/American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry was used to characterize the anesthesia choice and clinical outcomes of all US patients undergoing elective percutaneous transfemoral TAVR between April 1, 2014, and June 30, 2015. Raw and inverse probability of treatment-weighted analyses were performed to compare patients undergoing TAVR with general anesthesia with patients undergoing TAVR with conscious sedation on an intention-to-treat basis for the primary outcome of in-hospital <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ity, and secondary outcomes including 30-day <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ity, in-hospital and 30-day <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>/stroke, procedural success, intensive care unit and hospital length-of-stay, and rates of discharge to home. Post hoc falsification end point analyses were performed to evaluate for residual confounding.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Conscious sedation was used in 1737/10 997 (15.8%) cases with a significant trend of increasing usage over the time period studied (<i>P</i> for trend<0.001). In raw analyses, intraprocedural success with conscious sedation and general anesthesia was similar (98.2% versus 98.5%, <i>P</i>=0.31). The conscious sedation group was less likely to experience in-hospital (1.6% versus 2.5%, <i>P</i>=0.03) and 30-day <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> (2.9% versus 4.1%, <i>P</i>=0.03). Conversion from conscious sedation to general anesthesia was noted in 102 of 1737 (5.9%) of conscious sedation cases. After inverse probability of treatment-weighted adjustment for 51 covariates, conscious sedation was associated with lower procedural success (97.9% versus 98.6%, <i>P</i><0.001) and a reduced rate of <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ity at the in-hospital (1.5% versus 2.4%, <i>P</i><0.001) and 30-day (2.3% versus 4.0%, <i>P</i><0.001) time points. Conscious sedation was associated with reductions in procedural inotrope requirement, intensive care unit and hospital length of stay (6.0 versus 6.5 days, <i>P</i><0.001), and combined 30-day <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>/stroke rates (4.8% versus 6.4%, <i>P</i><0.001). Falsification end point analyses of vascular complications, bleeding, and new pacemaker/defibrillator implantation demonstrated no significant differences between groups after adjustment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In US practice, conscious sedation is associated with briefer length of stay and lower in-hospital and 30-day <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ity in comparison with TAVR with general anesthesia in both unadjusted and adjusted analyses.

We also determined sex-specific 10th and 90th percentile limits for these measures using quantile regression in 401 participants free of prevalent cardiovascular disease and risk factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Each measure of diastolic function was robustly associated with N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide and incident HF or <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>. ARIC-based reference limits for TDI e’ (4.6 and 5.2 cm/s for septal and lateral TDI e’, respectively) were substantially lower than guideline cut points (7 and 10 cm/s, respectively), whereas E/e’ and left atrial size demonstrated good agreement with guideline cut points. TDI e’ was nonlinearly associated with incident HF or <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>, with inflection points for risk supportive of ARIC-based limits. ARIC-based limits for diastolic function improved risk discrimination over guideline-based cut points based on the integrated discrimination improvement (<i>P</i><0.001) and continuous net reclassification improvement (<i>P</i><0.001), reclassifying 42% of the study population as having normal diastolic function. We replicate these findings in the Copenhagen City Heart Study.

Prognostic Value of Follow-Up Hemodynamic Variables After Initial Management in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Hemodynamic variables such as cardiac index and right atrial pressure have consistently been associated with survival in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) at the time of diagnosis. Recent studies have suggested that pulmonary arterial compliance may also predict prognosis in PAH. The prognostic importance of hemodynamic values achieved after treatment initiation is less well established.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Our objective was to evaluate the prognostic importance of clinical and hemodynamic variables during follow-up, including pulmonary arterial compliance, after initial management in PAH. We evaluated incident patients with idiopathic, drug- and toxin-induced, or heritable PAH enrolled in the French pulmonary hypertension registry between 2006 and 2016 who had a follow-up right-sided heart catheterization (RHC). The primary outcome was <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> or lung transplantation. We used stepwise Cox regression and the Kaplan-Meier method to assess variables obtained at baseline and at first follow-up RHC.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 981 patients, a primary outcome occurred in 331 patients (33.7%) over a median follow-up duration of 2.8 years (interquartile range, 1.1–4.6 years). In a multivariable model considering only baseline variables, no hemodynamic variables independently predicted prognosis. Median time to first follow-up RHC was 4.6 months (interquartile range, 3.7–7.8 months). At first follow-up RHC (n=763), New York Heart Association functional class, 6-minute walk distance, stroke volume index (SVI), and right atrial pressure were independently associated with <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> or lung transplantation, adjusted for age, sex, and type of PAH. Pulmonary arterial compliance did not independently predict outcomes at baseline or during follow-up. The adjusted hazard ratio for SVI was 1.28 (95% confidence interval, 1.11–1.49; <i>P</i><0.01) per 10-mL/m<sup>2</sup> decrease and for right atrial pressure was 1.05 (95% confidence interval, 1.02–1.09; <i>P</i><0.01) per 1–mm Hg increase. Among patients who had 2 (n=355) or 3 (n=193) low-risk prognostic features at follow-up, including a cardiac index ≥2.5 L·min<sup>−1</sup>·m<sup>−2</sup>, 6-minute walk distance >440 m, and New York Heart Association class I or II functional class, lower SVI was still associated with higher rates of <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> or lung transplantation (<i>P</i><0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>SVI and right atrial pressure were the hemodynamic variables that were independently associated with <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> or lung transplantation at first follow-up RHC after initial PAH treatment.

The cohort included 549 patients randomized and treated in the SVR trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Transplant-free survival for the RVPAS versus modified Blalock–Taussig shunt groups did not differ at 6 years (64% versus 59%, <i>P</i>=0.25) or with all available follow-up of 7.1±1.6 years (log-rank <i>P</i>=0.13). The RVPAS versus modified Blalock–Taussig shunt treatment effect had nonproportional hazards (<i>P</i>=0.009); the hazard ratio (HR) for <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> or transplant favored the RVPAS before stage II surgery (HR, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.48–0.92). The effect of shunt type on <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> or transplant was not statistically significant between stage II to Fontan surgery (HR, 1.36; 95% confidence interval, 0.86–2.17; <i>P</i>=0.17) or after the Fontan procedure (HR, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.33–1.74; <i>P</i>=0.52). By 6 years, patients with RVPAS had a higher incidence of catheter interventions (0.38 versus 0.23/patient-year, <i>P</i><0.001), primarily because of more interventions between the stage II and Fontan procedures (HR, 1.72; 95% confidence interval, 1.00–3.03).

Association Between Hospital Volume, Processes of Care, and Outcomes in Patients Admitted With Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Hospital volume is frequently used as a structural metric for assessing quality of care, but its utility in patients admitted with acute heart failure (HF) is not well characterized. Accordingly, we sought to determine the relationship between admission volume, process-of-care metrics, and short- and long-term outcomes in patients admitted with acute HF.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients enrolled in the Get With The Guidelines-HF registry with linked Medicare inpatient data at 342 hospitals were assessed. Volume was assessed both as a continuous variable, and quartiles based on the admitting hospital annual HF case volume, as well: 5 to 38 (quartile 1), 39 to 77 (quartile 2), 78 to 122 (quartile 3), 123 to 457 (quartile 4). The main outcome measures were (1) process measures at discharge (achievement of HF achievement, quality, reporting, and composite metrics); (2) 30-day <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ity and hospital readmission; and (3) 6-month <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ity and hospital readmission. Adjusted logistic and Cox proportional hazards models were used to study these associations with hospital volume.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 125 595 patients with HF were included. Patients admitted to high-volume hospitals had a higher burden of comorbidities. On multivariable modeling, lower-volume hospitals were significantly less likely to be adherent to HF process measures than higher-volume hospitals. Higher hospital volume was not associated with a difference in in-hospital (odds ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.94–1.05; <i>P</i>=0.78) or 30-day <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ity (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.97–1.01; <i>P</i>=0.26), or 30-day readmissions (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.97–1.00; <i>P</i>=0.10). There was a weak association of higher volumes with lower 6-month <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ity (hazard ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97–0.99; <i>P</i>=0.001) and lower 6-month all-cause readmissions (hazard ratio, 0.98; 95%, CI 0.97–1.00; <i>P</i>=0.025).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our analysis of a large contemporary prospective national quality improvement registry of older patients with HF indicates that hospital volume as a structural metric correlates with process measures, but not with 30-day outcomes, and only marginally with outcomes up to 6 months of follow-up. Hospital profiling should focus on participation in systems of care, adherence to process metrics, and risk-standardized outcomes rather than on hospital volume itself.</p></sec>

Cardiovascular Outcomes and Risks After Initiation of a Sodium Glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitor
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Clinical trials have shown cardiovascular benefits and potential risks from sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i). Trials may have limited ability to address individual end points or safety concerns.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed a population-based cohort study among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with established cardiovascular disease newly initiated on antihyperglycemic agents within the US Department of Defense Military Health System between April 1, 2013, and December 31, 2016. Incidence rates, hazard ratios (HRs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for time to first composite end point of all-cause <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ity and hospitalization for heart failure event, major adverse cardiovascular events (defined as all-cause <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ity, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke), and individual end points were evaluated using conditional Cox models comparing new SGLT2i users with other antihyperglycemic agents. The exploratory safety end point was below-knee lower extremity amputation. Intent-to-treat and on-treatment analyses were performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>After propensity matching, 25 258 patients were followed for a median of 1.6 years. Compared with non-SGLT2i, initiation of SGLT2i was associated with a lower rate of all-cause <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ity and hospitalization for heart failure (1.73 versus 3.01 events per 100 person-years; HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.50–0.65) and major adverse cardiovascular events (2.31 versus 3.45 events per 100 person-years; HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.60–0.75). SGLT2i initiation was also associated with an ≈2-fold higher risk of below-knee lower extremity amputation (0.17 versus 0.09 events per 100 person-years; HR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.12–3.51). Because of the disproportionate canagliflozin exposure in the database, the majority of amputations were observed on canagliflozin. Results were consistent in the on-treatment analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In this high-risk cohort, initiation of SGLT2i was associated with lower risk of all-cause <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ity, hospitalization for heart failure, and major adverse cardiovascular events and higher risk of below-knee lower extremity amputation. Findings underscore the potential benefit and risks to be aware of when initiating SGLT2i. It remains unclear whether the below-knee lower extremity amputation risk extends across the class of medication, because the study was not powered to make comparisons among individual treatments.</p></sec>

Predictors and Association With Clinical Outcomes of the Changes in Exercise Capacity After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>At present, there are no objective data specifically examining the clinical impact of variations in exercise capacity post–transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). We describe the changes in exercise capacity between baseline and 6 months post-TAVR, and ascertain factors associated with and clinical implications of a lack of improvement in exercise capacity post-TAVR.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A total of 305 patients (mean age, 79±9 years; 44% men; Society of Thoracic Surgeons predicted risk <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ity score, 6.7±4.2%) undergoing TAVR completed both baseline and follow-up exercise capacity assessments at 6 months post-TAVR. Exercise capacity was evaluated by the 6-minute walk test (6MWT). Clinical outcomes were compared between patients displaying greater than (n=152; improving group) versus less than (n=153; nonimproving group) the median percentage change in distance walked between baseline and 6-month follow-up examinations. The primary outcome measure was clinical event rates, measured from the 6-month post-TAVR period onward. Further dichotomization according to baseline 6MWT distance (less than versus more than median walking distance, or slow walker versus fast walker) was also assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The mean overall distances walked pre- and post-TAVR (6 months post-TAVR) were 204±119 and 263±116 m, respectively (Δ6MWT=60±106 m), with 219 (72%) patients demonstrating an increase in their walking distance (median percentage increase of the entire population was 20% [interquartile range, 0%–80%]). Factors independently correlated with reduced exercise capacity improvement included a range of baseline clinical characteristics (older age, female sex, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; <i>P</i><0.05 for all), periprocedural major or life-threatening bleeding (<i>P</i>=0.009) and new-onset anemia at 6 months post-TAVR (<i>P</i>=0.009). Failure to improve the 6MWT distance by at least 20% was independently associated with all-cause <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ity (<i>P</i>=0.002) and cardiovascular <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">death</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> or rehospitalization for cardiovascular causes (<i>P</i>=0.001). Baseline slow walkers who were able to improve the 6MWT distance presented with significantly better outcomes than nonimprovers (<i>P</i>=0.01 for all-cause <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">mortal</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ity; <i>P</i>=0.001 for cardiovascular end point).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Approximately one-third of patients undergoing TAVR did not improve their exercise capacity postprocedure. The lack of functional improvement post-TAVR was predicted by a mix of baseline and periprocedural factors translating into poorer clinical outcomes. These results suggest that systematically implementing exercise capacity assessment pre- and post-TAVR may help to improve patient risk stratification.</p></sec>

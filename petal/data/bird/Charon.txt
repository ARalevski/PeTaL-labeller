Global drainage patterns and the origins of topographic relief on Earth, Mars, and Titan
<p>Rivers have eroded the topography of Mars, Titan, and Earth, creating diverse landscapes. However, the dominant processes that generated topography on Titan (and to some extent on early Mars) are not well known. We analyzed drainage patterns on all three bodies and found that large drainages, which record interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>ns between deformat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>n and eros<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>nal modificat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>n, conform much better to long-wavelength topography on Titan and Mars than on Earth. We use a numerical landscape evolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>n model to demonstrate that short-wavelength deformat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>n causes drainage direct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>ns to diverge from long-wavelength topography, as observed on Earth. We attribute the observed differences to ancient long-wavelength topography on Mars, recent or ongoing generat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>n of long-wavelength relief on Titan, and the creat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>n of short-wavelength relief by plate tectonics on Earth.</p>

Juno observations of spot structures and a split tail in Io-induced aurorae on Jupiter
<p>Jupiter’s aurorae are produced in its upper atmosphere when incoming high-energy electrons precipitate along the planet’s magnetic field lines. A northern and a southern main auroral oval are visible, surrounded by small emiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>n features associated with the Galilean moons. We present infrared observat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>ns, obtained with the Juno spacecraft, showing that in the case of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>, this emiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>n exhibits a swirling pattern that is similar in appearance to a von Kéèèárméèèáán vortex street. Well downstream of the main auroral spots, the extended tail is split in two. Both of Ganymede’s footprints also appear as a pair of emiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>n features, which may provide a remote measure of Ganymede’s magnetosphere. These features suggest that the magnetohydrodynamic interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>n between Jupiter and its moon is more complex than prev<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>usly anticipated.</p>

Terahertz field–induced ferroelectricity in quantum paraelectric SrTiO<sub>3</sub>
<p>“Hidden phases” are metastable collective states of matter that are typically not accessible on equilibrium phase diagrams. These phases can host exotic properties in otherwise convent<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>nal materials and hence may enable novel funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>nality and applicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>ns, but their discovery and access are still in early stages. Using intense terahertz electric field excitat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>n, we found that an ultrafast phase transit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>n into a hidden ferroelectric phase can be dynamically induced in quantum paraelectric strontium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">titan</span></strong>ate (SrT<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong><sub>3</sub>). The induced lowering in crystal symmetry yields substantial changes in the phonon excitat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>n spectra. Our results demonstrate collective coherent control over material structure, in which a single-cycle field drives <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>ns along the microscopic pathway leading directly to their locat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>ns in a new crystalline phase on an ultrafast time scale.</p>

Metastable ferroelectricity in optically strained SrTiO<sub>3</sub>
<p>Fluctuating orders in solids are generally considered high-temperature precursors of broken symmetry phases. However, in some cases, these fluctuat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>ns persist to zero temperature and prevent the emergence of long-range order. Strontium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">titan</span></strong>ate (SrT<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong><sub>3</sub>) is a quantum paraelectric in which dipolar fluctuat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>ns grow upon cooling, although a long-range ferroelectric order never sets in. Here, we show that optical excitat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>n of lattice vibrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>ns can induce polar order. This metastable polar phase, observed up to temperatures exceeding 290 kelvin, persists for hours after the optical pump is interrupted. Furthermore, hardening of a low-frequency vibrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>n points to a photoinduced ferroelectric phase transit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>n, with a spatial domain distribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>n suggestive of a photoflexoelectric coupling.</p>

Giant polarization in super-tetragonal thin films through interphase strain
<p>Strain engineering has emerged as a powerful tool to enhance the performance of known funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>nal materials. Here we demonstrate a general and practical method to obtain super-tetragonality and giant polarizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>n using interphase strain. We use this method to create an out-of-plane–to–in-plane lattice parameter rat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong> of 1.238 in epitaxial composite thin films of tetragonal lead <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">titan</span></strong>ate (PbT<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong><sub>3</sub>), compared to 1.065 in bulk. These thin films with super-tetragonal structure possess a giant remanent polarizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>n, 236.3 microcoulombs per square centimeter, which is almost twice the value of known ferroelectrics. The super-tetragonal phase is stable up to 725°C, compared to the bulk transit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>n temperature of 490°C. The interphase-strain approach could enhance the physical properties of other funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>nal materials.</p>

Metal-free three-dimensional perovskite ferroelectrics
<p>Inorganic perovskite ferroelectrics are widely used in nonvolatile memory elements, capacitors, and sensors because of their excellent ferroelectric and other properties. Organic ferroelectrics are desirable for their mechanical flexibility, low weight, environmentally friendly processing, and low processing temperatures. Although almost a century has passed since the first ferroelectric, Rochelle salt, was discovered, examples of highly desirable organic perovskite ferroelectrics are lacking. We found a family of metal-free organic perovskite ferroelectrics with the characteristic three-dimens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>nal structure, among which MDABCO (<i>N</i>-methyl-<i>N'</i>-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octonium)–ammonium tri<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>dide has a spontaneous polarizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>n of 22 microcoulombs per square centimeter [close to that of barium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">titan</span></strong>ate (BTO)], a high phase transit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>n temperature of 448 kelvins (above that of BTO), and eight possible polarizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>n direct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>ns. These attributes make it attractive for use in flexible devices, soft robotics, b<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>medical devices, and other applicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>ns.</p>

Flexo-photovoltaic effect
<p>It is highly desirable to discover photovoltaic mechanisms that enable enhanced efficiency of solar cells. Here we report that the bulk photovoltaic effect, which is free from the thermodynamic Shockley-Queisser limit but usually manifested only in noncentrosymmetric (piezoelectric or ferroelectric) materials, can be realized in any semiconductor, including silicon, by mediat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>n of flexoelectric effect. We used either an atomic force microscope or a micrometer-scale indentat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>n system to introduce strain gradients, thus creating very large photovoltaic currents from centrosymmetric single crystals of strontium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">titan</span></strong>ate, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">titan</span></strong>ium d<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>xide, and silicon. This strain gradient–induced bulk photovoltaic effect, which we call the flexo-photovoltaic effect, funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>ns in the absence of a p-n junct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>n. This finding may extend present solar cell technologies by boosting the solar energy convers<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>n efficiency from a wide pool of established semiconductors.</p>

An organic-inorganic perovskite ferroelectric with large piezoelectric response
<p>Molecular piezoelectrics are highly desirable for their easy and environment-friendly processing, light weight, low processing temperature, and mechanical flexibility. However, although 136 years have passed since the discovery in 1880 of the piezoelectric effect, molecular piezoelectrics with a piezoelectric coefficient <i>d</i><sub>33</sub> comparable with piezoceramics such as barium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">titan</span></strong>ate (BTO; ~190 picocoulombs per newton) have not been found. We show that trimethylchloromethyl ammonium trichloromanganese(II), an organic-inorganic perovskite ferroelectric crystal processed from aqueous solut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>n, has a large <i>d</i><sub>33</sub> of 185 picocoulombs per newton and a high phase-transit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>n temperature of 406 kelvin (K) (16 K above that of BTO). This makes it a competitive candidate for medical, micromechanical, and b<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>mechanical applicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>ns.</p>

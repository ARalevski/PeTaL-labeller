Prospective Countywide Surveillance and Autopsy Characterization of Sudden Cardiac Death
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Studies of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> (SCD) use emergency medical services records, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> certificates, or definitions that infer cause of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>; thus, the true incidence of SCD is unknown. Over 90% of SCDs occur out-of-hospital; nonforensic autopsies are rarely performed, and therefore causes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> are presumed. We conducted a medical examiner–based investigation to determine the precise incidence and autopsy-defined causes of all SCDs in an entire metropolitan area. We hypothesized that postmortem investigation would identify actual sudden arrhythmic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>s among presumed SCDs.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Between February 1, 2011, and March 1, 2014, we prospectively identified all incident <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>s attributed to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (emergency medical services primary impression, cardiac arrest) between 18 to 90 years of age in San Francisco County for autopsy, toxicology, and histology via medical examiner surveillance of consecutive out-of-hospital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>s, all reported by law. We obtained comprehensive records to determine whether out-of-hospital cardiac arrest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>s met World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for SCD. We reviewed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> certificates filed quarterly for missed SCDs. Autopsy-defined sudden arrhythmic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>s had no extracardiac cause of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> or acute heart failure. A multidisciplinary committee adjudicated final cause.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>All 20 440 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>s were reviewed; 12 671 were unattended and reported to the medical examiner. From these, we identified 912 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>s; 541 (59%) met WHO SCD criteria (mean 62.8 years, 69% male) and 525 (97%) were autopsied. Eighty-nine additional WHO-defined SCDs occurred within 3 weeks of active medical care with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> certificate signed by the attending physician, ineligible for autopsy but included in the countywide WHO-defined SCD incidence of 29.6/100 000 person-years, highest in black men (<i>P</i><0.0001). Of 525 WHO-defined SCDs, 301 (57%) had no cardiac history. Leading causes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> were coronary disease (32%), occult overdose (13.5%), cardiomyopathy (10%), cardiac hypertrophy (8%), and neurological (5.5%). Autopsy-defined sudden arrhythmic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>s were 55.8% (293/525) of overall, 65% (78/120) of witnessed, and 53% (215/405) of unwitnessed WHO-defined SCDs (<i>P</i>=0.024); 286 of 293 (98%) had structural cardiac disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Forty percent of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>s attributed to stated cardiac arrest were not sudden or unexpected, and nearly half of presumed SCDs were not arrhythmic. These findings have implications for the accuracy of SCDs as defined by WHO criteria or emergency medical services records in aggregate mortality data, clinical trials, and cohort studies.</p></sec>

Mortality and Cerebrovascular Events After Heart Rhythm Disorder Management Procedures
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Recognition of rates and causes of hard, patient-centered outcomes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> and cerebrovascular events (CVEs) after heart rhythm disorder management (HRDM) procedures is an essential step for the development of quality improvement programs in electrophysiology laboratories. Our primary aim was to assess and characterize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> and CVEs (stroke or transient ischemic attack) after HRDM procedures over a 17-year period.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed a retrospective cohort study of all patients undergoing HRDM procedures between January 2000 and November 2016 at the Mayo Clinic. Patients from all 3 tertiary academic centers (Rochester, Phoenix, and Jacksonville) were included in the study. All in-hospital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>s and CVEs after HRDM procedures were identified and were further characterized as directly or indirectly related to the HRDM procedure. Subgroup analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> and CVE rates was performed for ablation, device implantation, electrophysiology study, lead extraction, and defibrillation threshold testing procedures.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 48 913 patients (age, 65.7±6.6 years; 64% male) who underwent a total of 62 065 HRDM procedures were included in the study. The overall mortality and CVE rates in the cohort were 0.36% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31–0.42) and 0.12% (95% CI, 0.09–0.16), respectively. Patients undergoing lead extraction had the highest overall mortality rate at 1.9% (95% CI, 1.34–2.61) and CVE rate at 0.62% (95% CI, 0.32–1.07). Among patients undergoing HRDM procedures, 48% of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>s directly related to the HDRM procedure were among patients undergoing device implantation procedures. Overall, cardiac tamponade was the most frequent direct cause of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> (40%), and infection was the most common indirect cause of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> (29%). The overall 30-day mortality rate was 0.76%, with the highest being in lead extraction procedures (3.08%), followed by device implantation procedures (0.94%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Half of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>s directly related to an HRDM procedure were among the patients undergoing device implantation procedures, with cardiac tamponade being the most common cause of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>. This highlights the importance of the development of protocols for the quick identification and management of cardiac tamponade even in procedures typically believed to be lower risk such as device implantation.</p></sec>

Age and Outcomes of Primary Prevention Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators in Patients With Nonischemic Systolic Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The DANISH study (Danish Study to Assess the Efficacy of ICDs [Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators] in Patients With Non-Ischemic Systolic Heart Failure on Mortality) did not demonstrate an overall effect on all-cause mortality with ICD implantation. However, the prespecified subgroup analysis suggested a possible age-dependent association between ICD implantation and mortality with survival benefit seen only in the youngest patients. The nature of this relationship between age and outcome of a primary prevention ICD in patients with nonischemic systolic heart failure warrants further investigation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>All 1116 patients from the DANISH study were included in this prespecified subgroup analysis. We assessed the relationship between ICD implantation and mortality by age, and an optimal age cutoff was estimated nonparametrically with selection impact curves. Modes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> were divided into sudden cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> and nonsudden <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> and compared between patients younger and older than this age cutoff with the use of χ<sup>2</sup> analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Median age of the study population was 63 years (range, 21–84 years). There was a linearly decreasing relationship between ICD and mortality with age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.003–1.06; <i>P</i>=0.03). An optimal age cutoff for ICD implantation was present at ≤70 years. There was an association between reduced all-cause mortality and ICD in patients ≤70 years of age (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.51–0.96; <i>P</i>=0.03) but not in patients >70 years of age (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.68–1.62; <i>P</i>=0.84). For patients ≤70 years old, the sudden cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> rate was 1.8 (95% CI, 1.3–2.5) and nonsudden <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> rate was 2.7 (95% CI, 2.1–3.5) events per 100 patient-years, whereas for patients >70 years old, the sudden cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> rate was 1.6 (95% CI, 0.8–3.2) and nonsudden <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> rate was 5.4 (95% CI, 3.7–7.8) events per 100 patient-years. This difference in modes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> between the 2 age groups was statistically significant (<i>P</i>=0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In patients with systolic heart failure not caused by ischemic heart disease, the association between the ICD and survival decreased linearly with increasing age. In this study population, an age cutoff for ICD implantation at ≤70 years yielded the highest survival for the population as a whole.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Cardiac Implantable Electronic Device Interrogation at Forensic Autopsy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Postmortem interrogations of cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs), recommended at autopsy in suspected cases of sudden cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>, are rarely performed, and data on systematic postmortem CIED analysis in the forensic pathology are missing. The aim of the study was to determine whether nonselective postmortem CIED interrogations and data analysis are useful to the forensic pathologist to determine the cause, mechanism, and time of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> and to detect potential CIED-related safety issues.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>From February 2012 to April 2017, all autopsy subjects in the department of forensic medicine at the University Hospital Charité who had a CIED underwent device removal and interrogation. Over the study period, 5368 autopsies were performed. One hundred fifty subjects had in total 151 CIEDs, including 109 pacemakers, 35 defibrillators, and 7 implantable loop recorders.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In 40 cases (26.7%) time of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> and in 51 cases (34.0%) cause of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> could not be determined by forensic autopsy. Of these, CIED interrogation facilitated the determination of time of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> in 70.0% of the cases and clarified the cause of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> in 60.8%. Device concerns were identified in 9 cases (6.0%), including 3 hardware, 4 programming, and 2 algorithm issues. One CIED was submitted to the manufacturer for a detailed technical analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our data demonstrate the necessity of systematic postmortem CIED interrogation in forensic medicine to determine the cause and timing of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> more accurately. In addition, CIED analysis is an important tool to detect potential CIED-related safety issues.</p></sec>

Lower Risk of Heart Failure and Death in Patients Initiated on Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter-2 Inhibitors Versus Other Glucose-Lowering Drugs
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Reduction in cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> and hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) was recently reported with the sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT-2i) empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. We compared HHF and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> in patients newly initiated on any SGLT-2i versus other glucose-lowering drugs in 6 countries to determine if these benefits are seen in real-world practice and across SGLT-2i class.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data were collected via medical claims, primary care/hospital records, and national registries from the United States, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Propensity score for SGLT-2i initiation was used to match treatment groups. Hazard ratios for HHF, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>, and their combination were estimated by country and pooled to determine weighted effect size. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> data were not available for Germany.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>After propensity matching, there were 309 056 patients newly initiated on either SGLT-2i or other glucose-lowering drugs (154 528 patients in each treatment group). Canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin accounted for 53%, 42%, and 5% of the total exposure time in the SGLT-2i class, respectively. Baseline characteristics were balanced between the 2 groups. There were 961 HHF cases during 190 164 person-years follow-up (incidence rate, 0.51/100 person-years). Of 215 622 patients in the United States, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> occurred in 1334 (incidence rate, 0.87/100 person-years), and HHF or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> in 1983 (incidence rate, 1.38/100 person-years).

Long-Term Outcomes in Patients With Type 2 Myocardial Infarction and Myocardial Injury

We aimed to define long-term outcomes and explore risk stratification in patients with type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We identified consecutive patients (n=2122) with elevated cardiac troponin I concentrations (≥0.05 µg/L) at a tertiary cardiac center. All diagnoses were adjudicated as per the universal definition of myocardial infarction. The primary outcome was all-cause <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>. Secondary outcomes included major adverse cardiovascular events (eg, nonfatal myocardial infarction or cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>) and noncardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>. To explore competing risks, cause-specific hazard ratios were obtained using Cox regression models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The adjudicated index diagnosis was type 1 or 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury in 1171 (55.2%), 429 (20.2%), and 522 (24.6%) patients, respectively. At 5 years, all-cause <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> rates were higher in those with type 2 myocardial infarction (62.5%) or myocardial injury (72.4%) compared with type 1 myocardial infarction (36.7%). The majority of excess <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>s in those with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury were because of noncardiovascular causes (hazard ratio, 2.32; 95% confidence interval, 1.92–2.81 versus type 1 myocardial infarction). Despite this finding, the observed crude major adverse cardiovascular event rates were similar between groups (30.6% versus 32.6%), with differences apparent after adjustment for covariates (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.69–0.96).

The CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex controls Atg7-dependent cell death and heart function
<p>Shortening and removal of the polyadenylate [poly(A)] tail of mRNA, a process called deadenylation, is a key step in mRNA decay that is mediated through the CCR4-NOT (carbon catabolite repression 4–negative on TATA-less) complex. In our investigation of the regulation of mRNA deadenylation in the heart, we found that this complex was required to prevent cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>. Conditional deletion of the CCR4-NOT complex components Cnot1 or Cnot3 resulted in the formation of autophagic vacuoles and cardiomyocyte <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>, leading to lethal heart failure accompanied by long QT intervals. Cnot3 bound to and shortened the poly(A) tail of the mRNA encoding the key autophagy regulator Atg7. In <i>Cnot3</i>-depleted hearts, <i>Atg7</i> expression was posttranscriptionally increased. Genetic ablation of <i>Atg7</i>, but not <i>Atg5</i>, increased survival and partially restored cardiac function of <i>Cnot1</i> or <i>Cnot3</i> knockout mice. We further showed that in <i>Cnot3</i>-depleted hearts, Atg7 interacted with p53 and modulated p53 activity to induce the expression of genes encoding cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>–promoting factors in cardiomyocytes, indicating that defects in deadenylation in the heart aberrantly activated Atg7 and p53 to promote cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>. Thus, mRNA deadenylation mediated by the CCR4-NOT complex is crucial to prevent Atg7-induced cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> and heart failure, suggesting a role for mRNA deadenylation in targeting autophagy genes to maintain normal cardiac homeostasis.</p>

Changing dynamics of the drug overdose epidemic in the United States from 1979 through 2016
<p>Better understanding of the dynamics of the current U.S. overdose epidemic may aid in the development of more effective prevention and control strategies. We analyzed records of 599,255 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>s from 1979 through 2016 from the National Vital Statistics System in which accidental drug poisoning was identified as the main cause of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>. By examining all available data on accidental poisoning <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>s back to 1979 and showing that the overall 38-year curve is exponential, we provide evidence that the current wave of opioid overdose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>s (due to prescription opioids, heroin, and fentanyl) may just be the latest manifestation of a more fundamental longer-term process. The 38+ year smooth exponential curve of total U.S. annual accidental drug poisoning <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>s is a composite of multiple distinctive subepidemics of different drugs (primarily prescription opioids, heroin, methadone, synthetic opioids, cocaine, and methamphetamine), each with its own specific demographic and geographic characteristics.</p>

Singlet Oxygen Plays an Essential Role in the Root’s Response to Osmotic Stress
<p>The high osmotic potentials in plants subjected to drought stress can be mimicked by the application of high molecular weight polyethylene glycol. Here, we quantified the effects of exposure to polyethylene glycol on the growth of the main and lateral roots of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings. The effects on root growth were highly correlated with the appearance of singlet oxygen, as visualized using the singlet oxygen-specific probe singlet oxygen sensor green. The production of singlet oxygen was followed by cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>, as indicated by the intracellular accumulation of propidium iodide due to the loss of membrane integrity. Cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> began in the epidermal region of the root tip and spread in a dynamic manner to meristematic sections. In parallel, gene expression changes specific to the presence of singlet oxygen were observed. The accumulation of other reactive oxygen species, namely hydrogen, peroxide, nitric oxide, and superoxide, did not correlate with cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>. In addition, both the singlet oxygen scavenger His and the lipoxygenase inhibitor salicylhydroxamic acid specifically inhibited singlet oxygen accumulation and cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>. These results suggest a light-independent, type-I source of singlet oxygen production. Serpin-protease interactions were used as a model to assess the possibility of vacuolar-type cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>. Osmotic stress induced the accumulation of complexes between the cytoplasmic serpin AtSERPIN1 and its cognate vacuolar proteases, indicating that vacuolar integrity was compromised. These findings imply that singlet oxygen plays an essential role in conveying the root response to osmotic stress.</p>

Involvement of Adapter Protein Complex 4 in Hypersensitive Cell Death Induced by Avirulent Bacteria<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plant immunity to avirulent bacterial pathogens is associated with subcellular membrane dynamics including fusion between the vacuolar and plasma membranes, resulting in hypersensitive cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>. Here, we report that ADAPTOR PROTEIN COMPLEX-4 (AP-4) subunits are involved in plant immunity associated with hypersensitive cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>. We isolated a mutant with a defect in resistance to an avirulent strain of <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv. <i>tomato</i> (<i>Pto</i>) DC3000 <i>avrRpm1</i> from a vacuolar protein sorting mutant library of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The mutant was identical to <i>gfs4-1</i>, which has a mutation in the gene encoding the AP-4 subunit AP4B. Thus, we focused on AP4B and another subunit, AP4E. All of the mutants (<i>ap4b-3</i>, <i>ap4b-4</i>, <i>ap4e-1</i>, and <i>ap4e-2</i>) were defective in hypersensitive cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> and resistance to <i>Pto</i> DC3000 with the type III effector AvrRpm1 or AvrRpt2, both of which are recognized on the plasma membrane, while they showed slightly enhanced susceptibility to the type-III-secretion-deficient <i>P. syringae</i> strain <i>hrcC</i>. On the other hand, both <i>ap4b-3</i> and <i>ap4b-4</i> showed no defect in resistance to <i>Pto</i> DC3000 with the type III effector AvrRps4, which is recognized in the cytosol and does not induce hypersensitive cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>. Upon infection with <i>Pto</i> DC3000 <i>avrRpt2</i>, the <i>ap4b-3</i> and <i>ap4b-4</i> leaf cells did not show fusion between vacuolar and plasma membranes, whereas the wild-type leaf cells did. These results suggest that AP-4 contributes to cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>-associated immunity, possibly via membrane fusion, after type III effector-recognition on the plasma membrane.</p>

BcXYG1, a Secreted Xyloglucanase from <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>, Triggers Both Cell Death and Plant Immune Responses
<p>In search of <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>-inducing proteins, we found a xyloglucanase (BcXYG1) that induced strong necrosis and a resistance response in dicot plants. Expression of the <i>BcXYG1</i> gene was strongly induced during the first 12 h post inoculation, and analysis of disease dynamics using PathTrack showed that a <i>B. cinerea</i> strain overexpressing <i>BcXYG1</i> produced early local necrosis, supporting a role of BcXYG1 as an early cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>-inducing factor. The xyloglucanase activity of BcXYG1 was not necessary for the induction of necrosis and plant resistance, as a mutant of BcXYG1 lacking the xyloglucanase enzymatic activity retained both functions. Residues in two exposed loops on the surface of BcXYG1 were found to be necessary for the induction of cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> but not to induce plant resistance. Further analyses showed that BcXYG1 is apoplastic and possibly interacts with the proteins of the plant cell membrane and also that the BcXYG1 cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>-promoting signal is mediated by the leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases BAK1 and SOBIR1. Our findings support the role of cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>-inducing proteins in establishing the infection of necrotrophic pathogens and highlight the recognition of fungal apoplastic proteins by the plant immune system as an important mechanism of resistance against this class of pathogens.</p>

Potential Deaths Averted and Serious Adverse Events Incurred From Adoption of the SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) Intensive Blood Pressure Regimen in the United States
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) demonstrated a 27% reduction in all-cause mortality with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) goal of <120 versus <140 mm Hg among US adults at high cardiovascular disease risk but without diabetes mellitus, stroke, or heart failure. To quantify the potential benefits and risks of SPRINT intensive goal implementation, we estimated the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>s prevented and excess serious adverse events incurred if the SPRINT intensive SBP treatment goal were implemented in all eligible US adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>SPRINT eligibility criteria were applied to the 1999 to 2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and linked with the National <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> Index through December 2011. SPRINT eligibility included age ≥50 years, SBP of 130 to 180 mm Hg (depending on the number of antihypertensive medications being taken), and high cardiovascular disease risk. Exclusion criteria were diabetes mellitus, history of stroke, >1 g proteinuria, heart failure, estimated glomerular filtration rate <20 mL·min<sup>−1</sup>·1.73 m<sup>−2</sup>, or dialysis.

The analysis-of-extremes approach indicated that the range of estimated lower- and upper-bound number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>s prevented per year with intensive SBP control was 34 600 to 179 600.

Population-Based Long-Term Cardiac-Specific Mortality Among 34 489 Five-Year Survivors of Childhood Cancer in Great Britain
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Increased risks of cardiac morbidity and mortality among childhood cancer survivors have been described previously. However, little is known about the very long-term risks of cardiac mortality and whether the risk has decreased among those more recently diagnosed. We investigated the risk of long-term cardiac mortality among survivors within the recently extended British Childhood Cancer Survivor Study.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The British Childhood Cancer Survivor Study is a population-based cohort of 34 489 five-year survivors of childhood cancer diagnosed from 1940 to 2006 and followed up until February 28, 2014, and is the largest cohort to date to assess late cardiac mortality. Standardized mortality ratios and absolute excess risks were used to quantify cardiac mortality excess risk. Multivariable Poisson regression models were used to evaluate the simultaneous effect of risk factors. Likelihood ratio tests were used to test for heterogeneity and trends.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, 181 cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>s were observed, which was 3.4 times that expected. Survivors were 2.5 times and 5.9 times more at risk of ischemic heart disease and cardiomyopathy/heart failure <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>, respectively, than expected. Among those >60 years of age, subsequent primary neoplasms, cardiac disease, and other circulatory conditions accounted for 31%, 22%, and 15% of all excess <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>s, respectively, providing clear focus for preventive interventions. The risk of both overall cardiac and cardiomyopathy/heart failure mortality was greatest among those diagnosed from 1980 to 1989. Specifically, for cardiomyopathy/heart failure <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>s, survivors diagnosed from 1980 to 1989 had 28.9 times the excess number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>s observed for survivors diagnosed either before 1970 or from 1990 on.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Excess cardiac mortality among 5-year survivors of childhood cancer remains increased beyond 50 years of age and has clear messages in terms of prevention strategies. However, the fact that the risk was greatest in those diagnosed from 1980 to 1989 suggests that initiatives to reduce cardiotoxicity among those treated more recently may be having a measurable impact.</p></sec>

Inflammation, necrosis, and the kinase RIP3 are key mediators of AAG-dependent alkylation-induced retinal degeneration
<p>DNA-alkylating agents are commonly used to kill cancer cells, but the base excision repair (BER) pathway they trigger can also produce toxic intermediates that cause tissue damage, such as retinal degeneration (RD). Apoptosis, a process of programmed cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>, is assumed to be the main mechanism of this alkylation-induced photoreceptor (PR) cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> in RD. Here, we studied the involvement of necroptosis (another programmed cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> process) and inflammation in alkylation-induced RD. Male mice exposed to a methylating agent exhibited a reduced number of PR cell rows, active gliosis, and cytokine induction and macrophage infiltration in the retina. Dying PRs exhibited a necrotic morphology, increased 8-hydroxyguanosine abundance (an oxidative damage marker), and overexpression of the necroptosis-associated genes <i>Rip1</i> and <i>Rip3</i>. The activity of PARP1, which mediates BER, cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>, and inflammation, was increased in PR cells and associated with the release of proinflammatory chemokine HMGB1 from PR nuclei. Mice lacking the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 exhibited more severe RD, whereas deficiency of RIP3 (also known as RIPK3) conferred partial protection. Female mice were partially protected from alkylation-induced RD, showing reduced necroptosis and inflammation compared to males. PRs in mice lacking the BER-initiating DNA glycosylase AAG did not exhibit alkylation-induced necroptosis or inflammation. Our findings show that AAG-initiated BER at alkylated DNA bases induces sex-dependent RD primarily by triggering necroptosis and activating an inflammatory response that amplifies the original damage and, furthermore, reveal new potential targets to prevent this side effect of chemotherapy.</p>

Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent demethylation of phosphatase PP2Ac promotes glucose deprivation–induced cell death independently of inhibiting glycolysis
<p>Cancer cells increase glucose metabolism to support aerobic glycolysis. However, only some cancer cells are acutely sensitive to glucose withdrawal, and the underlying mechanism of this selective sensitivity is unclear. We showed that glucose deprivation initiates a cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> pathway in cancer cells that is dependent on the kinase RIPK1. Glucose withdrawal triggered rapid plasma membrane depolarization and an influx of extracellular calcium into the cell through the L-type calcium channel Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 (CACNA1D), followed by activation of the kinase CAMK1. CAMK1 and the demethylase PPME1 were required for the subsequent demethylation and inactivation of the catalytic subunit of the phosphatase PP2A (PP2Ac) and the phosphorylation of RIPK1. Plasma membrane depolarization, PP2Ac demethylation, and cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> were prevented by glucose and, unexpectedly, by its nonmetabolizable analog 2-deoxy-<sc>d</sc>-glucose (2-DG), a glycolytic inhibitor. These findings reveal a previously unknown function of glucose as a signaling molecule that protects cells from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> induced by plasma membrane depolarization, independently of its role in glycolysis. Components of this cancer cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> pathway represent potential therapeutic targets against cancer.</p>

SUPPRESSOR OF GAMMA RESPONSE1 Links DNA Damage Response to Organ Regeneration
<p>In Arabidopsis, DNA damage-induced programmed cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> is limited to the meristematic stem cell niche and its early descendants. The significance of this cell-type-specific programmed cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> is unclear. Here, we demonstrate in roots that it is the programmed destruction of the mitotically compromised stem cell niche that triggers its regeneration, enabling growth recovery. In contrast to wild-type plants, <i>sog1</i> plants, which are defective in damage-induced programmed cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>, maintain the cell identities and stereotypical structure of the stem cell niche after irradiation, but these cells fail to undergo cell division, terminating root growth. We propose DNA damage-induced programmed cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> is employed by plants as a developmental response, contrasting with its role as an anticarcinogenic response in animals. This role in plants may have evolved to restore the growth of embryos after the accumulation of DNA damage in seeds.</p>

Risk of early mortality after cemented compared with cementless total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>It has been suggested that cemented fixation of total hip arthroplasty   (THA) is associated with an increased peri-operative mortality compared   with cementless THA. Our aim was to investigate this through a nationwide   matched cohort study adjusting for age, comorbidity, and socioeconomic   background.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 178 784 patients with osteoarthritis who underwent   either cemented or cementless THA from the Swedish Hip Arthroplasty   Register were matched with 862 294 controls from the general population.   Information about the causes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>, comorbidities, and socioeconomic   background was obtained. Mortality within the first 90 days after   the operation was the primary outcome measure.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Patients who underwent cemented THA had an increased risk of   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> during the first 14 days compared with the controls (hazard   ratio (HR) 1.3, confidence interval (CI) 1.11 to 1.44), corresponding   to an absolute increase in risk of five <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>s per 10 000 observations.   No such early increase of risk was seen in those who underwent cementless THA.   Between days 15 and 29 the risk of mortality was decreased for those   with cemented THA (HR 0.7, CI 0.62 to 0.87). Between days 30 and   90 all patients undergoing THA, irrespective of the mode of fixation,   had a lower risk of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> than controls. Patients selected for cementless   fixation were younger, healthier and had a higher level of education   and income than those selected for cemented THA. A supplementary   analysis of 16 556 hybrid THAs indicated that cementation of the   femoral component was associated with a slight increase in mortality   up to 15 days, whereas no such increase in mortality was seen in   those with a cemented acetabular component combined with a cementless   femoral component.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This nationwide matched cohort study indicates that patients   receiving cemented THA have a minimally increased relative risk   of early mortality that is reversed from day 15 and thereafter.   The absolute increase in risk is very small. Our findings lend support   to the idea that cementation of the femoral component is more dangerous   than cementation of the acetabular component.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:37–43.</p></sec>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
Axon degeneration and PGC-1α-mediated protection in a zebrafish model of α-synuclein toxicity
<p>α-synuclein (aSyn) expression is implicated in neurodegenerative processes, including Parkinson’s disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). In animal models of these diseases, axon pathology often precedes cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>, raising the question of whether aSyn has compartment-specific toxic effects that could require early and/or independent therapeutic intervention. The relevance of axonal pathology to degeneration can only be addressed through longitudinal, <i>in vivo</i> monitoring of different neuronal compartments. With current imaging methods, dopaminergic neurons do not readily lend themselves to such a task in any vertebrate system. We therefore expressed human wild-type aSyn in zebrafish peripheral sensory neurons, which project elaborate superficial axons that can be continuously imaged <i>in vivo</i>. Axonal outgrowth was normal in these neurons but, by 2 days post-fertilization (dpf), many aSyn-expressing axons became dystrophic, with focal varicosities or diffuse beading. Approximately 20% of aSyn-expressing cells died by 3 dpf. Time-lapse imaging revealed that focal axonal swelling, but not overt fragmentation, usually preceded cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>. Co-expressing aSyn with a mitochondrial reporter revealed deficits in mitochondrial transport and morphology even when axons appeared overtly normal. The axon-protective protein Wallerian degeneration slow (WldS) delayed axon degeneration but not cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> caused by aSyn. By contrast, the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1α, which has roles in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and reactive-oxygen-species detoxification, abrogated aSyn toxicity in both the axon and the cell body. The rapid onset of axonal pathology in this system, and the relatively moderate degree of cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>, provide a new model for the study of aSyn toxicity and protection. Moreover, the accessibility of peripheral sensory axons will allow effects of aSyn to be studied in different neuronal compartments and might have utility in screening for novel disease-modifying compounds.</p>

Long-Term Outcomes of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Diagnosed During Childhood
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Late survival and symptomatic status of children with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have not been well defined.

Prognostic Value of Follow-Up Hemodynamic Variables After Initial Management in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Hemodynamic variables such as cardiac index and right atrial pressure have consistently been associated with survival in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) at the time of diagnosis. Recent studies have suggested that pulmonary arterial compliance may also predict prognosis in PAH. The prognostic importance of hemodynamic values achieved after treatment initiation is less well established.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Our objective was to evaluate the prognostic importance of clinical and hemodynamic variables during follow-up, including pulmonary arterial compliance, after initial management in PAH. We evaluated incident patients with idiopathic, drug- and toxin-induced, or heritable PAH enrolled in the French pulmonary hypertension registry between 2006 and 2016 who had a follow-up right-sided heart catheterization (RHC). The primary outcome was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> or lung transplantation. We used stepwise Cox regression and the Kaplan-Meier method to assess variables obtained at baseline and at first follow-up RHC.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 981 patients, a primary outcome occurred in 331 patients (33.7%) over a median follow-up duration of 2.8 years (interquartile range, 1.1–4.6 years). In a multivariable model considering only baseline variables, no hemodynamic variables independently predicted prognosis. Median time to first follow-up RHC was 4.6 months (interquartile range, 3.7–7.8 months). At first follow-up RHC (n=763), New York Heart Association functional class, 6-minute walk distance, stroke volume index (SVI), and right atrial pressure were independently associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> or lung transplantation, adjusted for age, sex, and type of PAH. Pulmonary arterial compliance did not independently predict outcomes at baseline or during follow-up. The adjusted hazard ratio for SVI was 1.28 (95% confidence interval, 1.11–1.49; <i>P</i><0.01) per 10-mL/m<sup>2</sup> decrease and for right atrial pressure was 1.05 (95% confidence interval, 1.02–1.09; <i>P</i><0.01) per 1–mm Hg increase. Among patients who had 2 (n=355) or 3 (n=193) low-risk prognostic features at follow-up, including a cardiac index ≥2.5 L·min<sup>−1</sup>·m<sup>−2</sup>, 6-minute walk distance >440 m, and New York Heart Association class I or II functional class, lower SVI was still associated with higher rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> or lung transplantation (<i>P</i><0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>SVI and right atrial pressure were the hemodynamic variables that were independently associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> or lung transplantation at first follow-up RHC after initial PAH treatment.

Transplant-Free Survival and Interventions at 6 Years in the SVR Trial
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In the SVR trial (Single Ventricle Reconstruction), 1-year transplant-free survival was better for the Norwood procedure with right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery shunt (RVPAS) compared with a modified Blalock–Taussig shunt in patients with hypoplastic left heart and related syndromes. At 6 years, we compared transplant-free survival and other outcomes between the groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Medical history was collected annually using medical record review, telephone interviews, and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> index. The cohort included 549 patients randomized and treated in the SVR trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Transplant-free survival for the RVPAS versus modified Blalock–Taussig shunt groups did not differ at 6 years (64% versus 59%, <i>P</i>=0.25) or with all available follow-up of 7.1±1.6 years (log-rank <i>P</i>=0.13). The RVPAS versus modified Blalock–Taussig shunt treatment effect had nonproportional hazards (<i>P</i>=0.009); the hazard ratio (HR) for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> or transplant favored the RVPAS before stage II surgery (HR, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.48–0.92). The effect of shunt type on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> or transplant was not statistically significant between stage II to Fontan surgery (HR, 1.36; 95% confidence interval, 0.86–2.17; <i>P</i>=0.17) or after the Fontan procedure (HR, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.33–1.74; <i>P</i>=0.52). By 6 years, patients with RVPAS had a higher incidence of catheter interventions (0.38 versus 0.23/patient-year, <i>P</i><0.001), primarily because of more interventions between the stage II and Fontan procedures (HR, 1.72; 95% confidence interval, 1.00–3.03).

Atrial Fibrillation and Ventricular Arrhythmias
<p>Sex-specific differences in the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, clinical treatment, and clinical outcomes of atrial fibrillation (AF), sustained ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> are recognized. Sex hormones cause differences in cardiac electrophysiological parameters between men and women that may affect the risk for arrhythmias. The incidence and prevalence of AF is lower in women than in men. However, because women live longer and AF prevalence increases with age, the absolute number of women with AF exceeds that of men. Women with AF are more symptomatic, present with more atypical symptoms, and report worse quality of life in comparison with men. Female sex is an independent risk factor for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> or stroke attributable to AF. Oral anticoagulation therapy for stroke prevention has similar efficacy for men and women, but older women treated with warfarin have a higher residual risk of stroke in comparison with men. Women with AF are less likely to receive rhythm control antiarrhythmic drug therapy, electric cardioversion, or catheter ablation in comparison with men. The incidence and prevalence of sustained ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> are lower in women than in men. Women receiving implantable cardioverter defibrillators for primary prevention of sudden cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> are less likely to experience sustained ventricular arrhythmias in comparison with men. In contrast, women receiving a cardiac resynchronization therapy implantable cardioverter defibrillator for the treatment of heart failure are more likely to benefit than men. Women are less likely to be referred for implantable cardioverter defibrillator therapy despite current guideline recommendations. Women are more likely to experience a significant complication related to implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantation in comparison with men. Whether sex differences in treatment decisions reflect patient preferences or treatment biases requires further study.</p>

Contemporary Assessment of Left Ventricular Diastolic Function in Older Adults
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although age-associated changes in left ventricular diastolic function are well recognized, limited data exist characterizing measures of diastolic function in older adults, including both reference ranges reflecting the older adult population and prognostically relevant values for incident heart failure (HF), as well as their associations with circulating biomarkers of HF risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Among 5801 elderly participants in the ARIC study (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities; age range, 67–90 years; mean age, 76±5 years; 42% male; 21% black), we determined the continuous association of diastolic measures (tissue Doppler imaging [TDI] e’, E/e’, and left atrial size) with concomitant N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide and subsequent HF hospitalization or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>. We also determined sex-specific 10th and 90th percentile limits for these measures using quantile regression in 401 participants free of prevalent cardiovascular disease and risk factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Each measure of diastolic function was robustly associated with N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide and incident HF or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>. ARIC-based reference limits for TDI e’ (4.6 and 5.2 cm/s for septal and lateral TDI e’, respectively) were substantially lower than guideline cut points (7 and 10 cm/s, respectively), whereas E/e’ and left atrial size demonstrated good agreement with guideline cut points. TDI e’ was nonlinearly associated with incident HF or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>, with inflection points for risk supportive of ARIC-based limits. ARIC-based limits for diastolic function improved risk discrimination over guideline-based cut points based on the integrated discrimination improvement (<i>P</i><0.001) and continuous net reclassification improvement (<i>P</i><0.001), reclassifying 42% of the study population as having normal diastolic function. We replicate these findings in the Copenhagen City Heart Study. With these limits, 46% had normal diastolic function and were at low risk of HF hospitalization or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> (1%/y over a mean 1.7-year follow-up), 49% had 1 or 2 abnormal measures and were at intermediate risk (2.4%/y), and all 3 diastolic measures were abnormal in 5% who were at high risk (7.5%/y).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings suggest that left ventricular longitudinal relaxation velocity declines as a part of healthy aging and is largely prognostically benign.

The Potato MAP3K StVIK Is Required for the <i>Phytophthora infestans</i> RXLR Effector Pi17316 to Promote Disease
<p>Plant pathogens deliver effectors to manipulate processes in their hosts, creating a suitable environment for invasion and proliferation. Yet, little is known about the host proteins that are targeted by effectors from filamentous pathogens. Here, we show that stable transgenic expression in potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>) and transient expression in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> of the arginine-any amino acid-leucine-arginine effector Pi17316 enhances leaf colonization by the late blight pathogen <i>Phytophthora infestans</i>. Expression of Pi17316 also attenuates cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> triggered by the pathogen-associated molecular pattern Infestin1 (INF1), indicating that the effector suppresses pattern-triggered immunity. However, this effector does not attenuate cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> triggered by a range of resistance proteins, showing that it specifically suppresses INF1-triggered cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> (ICD). In yeast two-hybrid assays, Pi17316 interacts directly with the potato ortholog of VASCULAR HIGHWAY1-interacting kinase (StVIK), encoding a predicted MEK kinase (MAP3K). Interaction in planta was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and occurs at the plant plasma membrane. Virus-induced gene silencing of <i>VIK</i> in <i>N. benthamiana</i> attenuated <i>P. infestans</i> colonization, whereas transient overexpression of <i>StVIK</i> enhanced colonization, indicating that this host protein acts as a susceptibility factor. Moreover, <i>VIK</i> overexpression specifically attenuated ICD, indicating that it is a negative regulator of immunity. The abilities of Pi17316 to enhance <i>P. infestans</i> colonization or suppress ICD were compromised significantly in <i>NbVIK</i>-silenced plants, demonstrating that the effector activity of Pi17316 is mediated by this MAP3K. Thus, StVIK is exploited by <i>P. infestans</i> as a susceptibility factor to promote late blight disease.</p>

Transcriptional Roadmap to Seasonal Variation in Wood Formation of Norway Spruce
<p>Seasonal cues influence several aspects of the secondary growth of tree stems, including cambial activity, wood chemistry, and transition to latewood formation. We investigated seasonal changes in cambial activity, secondary cell wall formation, and tracheid cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> in woody tissues of Norway spruce (<i>Picea abies</i>) throughout one seasonal cycle. RNA sequencing was performed simultaneously in both the xylem and cambium/phloem tissues of the stem. Principal component analysis revealed gradual shifts in the transcriptomes that followed a chronological order throughout the season. A notable remodeling of the transcriptome was observed in the winter, with many genes having maximal expression during the coldest months of the year. A highly coexpressed set of monolignol biosynthesis genes showed high expression during the period of secondary cell wall formation as well as a second peak in midwinter. This midwinter peak in expression did not trigger lignin deposition, as determined by pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Coexpression consensus network analyses suggested the involvement of transcription factors belonging to the ASYMMETRIC LEAVES2/LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES and MYELOBLASTOSIS-HOMEOBOX families in the seasonal control of secondary cell wall formation of tracheids. Interestingly, the lifetime of the latewood tracheids stretched beyond the winter dormancy period, correlating with a lack of cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>-related gene expression. Our transcriptomic analyses combined with phylogenetic and microscopic analyses also identified the cellulose and lignin biosynthetic genes and putative regulators for latewood formation and tracheid cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> in Norway spruce, providing a toolbox for further physiological and functional assays of these important phase transitions.</p>

The RING-Type E3 Ligase XBAT35.2 Is Involved in Cell Death Induction and Pathogen Response
<p>XBAT35 belongs to a subfamily of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) RING-type E3s that are similar in domain architecture to the rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) XA21 Binding Protein3, a defense protein. The <i>XBAT35</i> transcript undergoes alternative splicing to produce two protein isoforms, XBAT35.1 and XBAT35.2. Here, we demonstrate that XBAT35.2 localizes predominantly to the Golgi and is involved in cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> induction and pathogen response. XBAT35.2, but not XBAT35.1, was found to trigger cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> when overexpressed in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>) leaves and does so in a manner that requires its RING domain. Loss of <i>XBAT35</i> gene function disrupts the plant’s ability to defend against pathogen attack, whereas overexpression of <i>XBAT35.2</i> enhances resistance to pathogens. XBAT35.2 was found to be unstable and promotes its own degradation, suggesting self-regulation. Inoculation with virulent and avirulent strains of the bacterial pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>tomato</i> DC3000 results in a drastic reduction in the levels of ubiquitinated XBAT35.2 and an increase in the abundance of the E3. This implies that pathogen infection prohibits XBAT35.2 self-regulation and stabilizes the E3. In agreement with a role in defending against pathogens, XBAT35.2 interacts with defense-related Accelerated Cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>11 (ACD11) in planta and promotes the proteasome-dependent turnover of ACD11 in cell-free degradation assays. In accordance with regulation by a stabilized XBAT35.2, the levels of ubiquitinated ACD11 increased considerably, and the abundance of ACD11 was reduced following pathogen infection. In addition, treatment of transgenic seedlings with a proteasome inhibitor results in the accumulation of ACD11, confirming proteasome-dependent degradation. Collectively, these results highlight a novel role for XBAT35.2 in cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> induction and defense against pathogens.</p>

Dead or Alive? Using Membrane Failure and Chlorophyll <i>a</i> Fluorescence to Predict Plant Mortality from Drought
<p>Climate models predict widespread increases in both drought intensity and duration in the next decades. Although water deficiency is a significant determinant of plant survival, limited understanding of plant responses to extreme drought impedes forecasts of both forest and crop productivity under increasing aridity. Drought induces a suite of physiological responses; however, we lack an accurate mechanistic description of plant response to lethal drought that would improve predictive understanding of mortality under altered climate conditions. Here, proxies for leaf cellular damage, chlorophyll <i>a</i> fluorescence, and electrolyte leakage were directly associated with failure to recover from drought upon rewatering in <i>Brassica</i> <i>rapa</i> (genotype R500) and thus define the exact timing of drought-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>. We validated our results using a second genotype (imb211) that differs substantially in life history traits. Our study demonstrates that whereas changes in carbon dynamics and water transport are critical indicators of drought stress, they can be unrelated to visible metrics of mortality, i.e. lack of meristematic activity and regrowth. In contrast, membrane failure at the cellular scale is the most proximate cause of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>. This hypothesis was corroborated in two gymnosperms (<i>Picea engelmannii</i> and <i>Pinus contorta</i>) that experienced lethal water stress in the field and in laboratory conditions. We suggest that measurement of chlorophyll <i>a</i> fluorescence can be used to operationally define plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> arising from drought, and improved plant characterization can enhance surface model predictions of drought mortality and its consequences to ecosystem services at a global scale.</p>

The Arabidopsis Mitochondrial Protease FtSH4 Is Involved in Leaf Senescence via Regulation of WRKY-Dependent Salicylic Acid Accumulation and Signaling
<p>Mitochondria and autophagy play important roles in the networks that regulate plant leaf senescence and cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between mitochondrial signaling and autophagy are currently not well understood. This study characterized the function of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mitochondrial AAA-protease gene <i>FtSH4</i> in regulating autophagy and senescence, finding that FtSH4 mediates WRKY-dependent salicylic acid (SA) accumulation and signaling. Knockout of <i>FtSH4</i> in the <i>ftsh4-4</i> mutant resulted in severe leaf senescence, cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>, and high autophagy levels. The level of SA increased dramatically in the <i>ftsh4-4</i> mutant. Expression of <i>nahG</i> in the <i>ftsh4-4</i> mutant led to decreased SA levels and suppressed the leaf senescence and cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> phenotypes. The transcript levels of several SA synthesis and signaling genes, including <i>SALICYLIC ACID</i> <i>INDUCTION DEFICIENT2</i> (<i>SID2</i>), <i>NON-RACE-SPECIFIC DISEASE RESISTANCE1</i> (<i>NDR1</i>), and <i>NONEXPRESSOR OF PATHOGENESIS-RELATED PROTEINS1</i> (<i>NPR1</i>), increased significantly in the <i>ftsh4-4</i> mutants compared with the wild type. Loss of function of <i>SID2</i>, <i>NDR1</i>, or <i>NPR1</i> in the <i>ftsh4-4</i> mutant reversed the <i>ftsh4-4</i> senescence and autophagy phenotypes. Furthermore, <i>ftsh4-4</i> mutants had elevated levels of transcripts of several <i>WRKY</i> genes, including <i>WRKY40</i>, <i>WRKY46</i>, <i>WRKY51</i>, <i>WRKY60</i>, <i>WRKY63</i>, and <i>WRKY75</i>; all of these WRKY proteins can bind to the promoter of <i>SID2</i>. Loss of function of <i>WRKY75</i> in the <i>ftsh4-4</i> mutants decreased the levels of SA and reversed the senescence phenotype. Taken together, these results suggest that the mitochondrial ATP-dependent protease FtSH4 may regulate the expression of <i>WRKY</i> genes by modifying the level of reactive oxygen species and the WRKY transcription factors that control SA synthesis and signaling in autophagy and senescence.</p>

The impact of external fixation on mortality in patients with an unstable pelvic ring fracture
<sec><title>Aim</title><p>There is not adequate evidence to establish whether external   fixation (EF) of pelvic fractures leads to a reduced mortality.

An isolated pelvic   ring fracture was defined by an Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS) for   other injuries of < 3. An unstable pelvic ring fracture was defined   as having an AIS ≥ 4. The primary outcome of this study was mortality.   A subgroup analysis was carried out for patients who required blood   transfusion within 24 hours of arrival in the Emergency Department   and those who had massive blood loss (AIS code: 852610.5). Propensity-score   matching was used to identify a cohort like the EF and non-EF groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>With the use of propensity-score matching using the completed   data, 346 patients were matched. When the propensity-score matching   was adjusted, EF was associated with a significantly lower risk   of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> (p = 0.047). In the subgroup analysis of patients who needed   blood transfusion within 24 hours and those who had massive blood loss,   EF was associated with a significantly lower risk of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> in patients   who needed blood transfusion within 24 hours (p = 0.014) and in   those with massive blood loss (p = 0.016).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The use of EF to treat unstable pelvic ring fractures was associated   with a significantly lower risk of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>, especially in patients   with severe fractures.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:233–41.</p></sec>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
Contribution of neural cell death to depressive phenotypes of streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice
<p>Major depression disorder (MDD) or depression is highly prevalent in individuals with diabetes, and the depressive symptoms are more severe and less responsive to antidepressant therapies in these patients. The underlying mechanism is little understood. We hypothesized that the pathophysiology of comorbid depression was more complex than that proposed for MDD and that neural cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> played a role in the disease severity. To test this hypothesis, we generated streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice. These mice had blood glucose levels threefold above controls and exhibited depressive phenotypes as judged by a battery of behavioral tests, thus confirming the comorbidity in mice. Immunohistological studies showed markedly increased TUNEL-positive cells in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of the comorbid mice, indicating apoptosis. This finding was supported by increased caspase-3 and decreased Bcl-2 proteins in these brain regions. In addition, the serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) level of comorbid mice was reduced compared with controls, further supporting the neurodegenerative change. Mechanistic analyses showed an increased expression of mitochondrial fission genes fission protein 1 (<i>Fis1</i>) and dynamin-related protein 1 (<i>Drp1</i>), and a decreased expression of mitochondrial fusion genes mitofusin 1 (<i>Mfn1</i>), mitofusin 2 (<i>Mfn2</i>) and optical atrophy 1 (<i>Opa1</i>). Representative assessment of the proteins Drp1 and Mfn2 mirrored the mRNA changes. The data demonstrated that neural cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> was associated with the depressive phenotype of comorbid mice and that a fission-dominant expression of genes and proteins mediating mitochondrial dynamics played a role in the hyperglycemia-induced cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>. The study provides new insight into the disease mechanism and could aid the development of novel therapeutics aimed at providing neuroprotection by modulating mitochondrial dynamics to treat comorbid depression with diabetes.</p>

The final model included preexisting coronary artery disease (odds ratio [OR], 2.86; confidence interval [CI], 1.83–4.49; <i>P</i>≤0.001), nonshockable rhythm (OR, 1.75; CI, 1.10–2.77; P=0.017), initial ejection fraction<30% (OR, 2.11; CI, 1.32–3.37; <i>P</i>=0.002), shock at presentation (OR, 2.27; CI, 1.42–3.62; P<0.001), and ischemic time >25 minutes (OR, 1.42; CI, 0.90–2.23; P=0.13). The derivation model area under the curve was 0.73, and Hosmer-Lemeshow test P=0.47. Outcomes were similar in the 318-patient validation cohort (area under the curve 0.68, Hosmer-Lemeshow test P=0.41). When assigned a point for each associated factor in the derivation model, the average predicted versus observed probability of CED with a CREST score (coronary artery disease, initial heart rhythm, low ejection fraction, shock at the time of admission, and ischemic time >25 minutes) of 0 to 5 was: 7.1% versus 10.2%, 9.5% versus 11%, 22.5% versus 19.6%, 32.4% versus 29.6%, 38.5% versus 30%, and 55.7% versus 50%.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The CREST model stratified patients immediately after resuscitation according to risk of a circulatory-etiology <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>.

Primary Myocardial Fibrosis as an Alternative Phenotype Pathway of Inherited Cardiac Structural Disorders
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Myocardial fibrosis is a common postmortem finding among young individuals with sudden cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>. Because there is no known single cause, we tested the hypothesis that some cases of myocardial fibrosis in the absence of identifiable causes (primary myocardial fibrosis [PMF]) are associated with genetic variants.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Tissue was obtained at autopsy from 4031 consecutive individuals with sudden cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> in Northern Finland, among whom PMF was the only structural finding in 145 subjects with sudden cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>. We performed targeted next-generation sequencing using a panel of 174 genes associated with myocardial structure and ion channel function when autopsies did not identify a secondary basis for myocardial fibrosis. All variants with an effect on protein and with a minor allele frequency <0.01 were classified as pathogenic or variants of uncertain significance on the basis of American College of Medical Genetics consensus guidelines.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among the 96 specimens with DNA passing quality control (66%), postmortem genetic tests identified 24 variants of known or uncertain significance in 26 subjects (27%). Ten were pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in 10 subjects (10%), and 14 were variants of uncertain significance in 11 genes among 16 subjects (17%). Five variants were in genes associated with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, 6 in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy–associated genes, and 11 in dilated cardiomyopathy–associated genes; 2 were not associated with these disorders. Four unique variants of uncertain significance cosegregated among multiple unrelated subjects with PMF. No pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants were detected in ion channel–encoding genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>A large proportion of subjects with PMF at autopsy had variants in genes associated with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy without autopsy findings of those diseases, suggesting that PMF can be an alternative phenotypic expression of structural disease–associated genetic variants or that risk-associated fibrosis was expressing before the primary disease. These findings have clinical implications for postmortem genetic testing and family risk profiling.</p></sec>

Importance of Variant Interpretation in Whole-Exome Molecular Autopsy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Potentially lethal cardiac channelopathies/cardiomyopathies may underlie a substantial portion of sudden unexplained <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> in the young (SUDY). The whole-exome molecular autopsy represents the latest approach to postmortem genetic testing for SUDY. However, proper variant adjudication in the setting of SUDY can be challenging.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>From January 2012 through December 2013, 25 consecutive cases of SUDY from 1 to 40 years of age (average age at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> 27±5.7 years; 13 white, 12 black) from Cook County, Illinois, were referred after a negative (n=16) or equivocal (n=9) conventional autopsy. A whole-exome molecular autopsy with analysis of 99 sudden <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>-susceptibility genes was performed. The predicted pathogenicity of ultrarare, nonsynonymous variants was determined using the American College of Medical Genetics guidelines.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, 27 ultrarare nonsynonymous variants were seen in 16/25 (64%) victims of SUDY. Among black individuals, 9/12 (75%) had an ultrarare nonsynonymous variant compared with 7/13 (54%) white individuals. Of the 27 variants, 10 were considered pathogenic or likely pathogenic in 7/25 (28%) individuals in accordance with the American College of Medical Genetics guidelines. Pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants were identified in 5/16 (31%) of autopsy-negative cases and in 2/6 (33%) victims of SUDY with equivocal findings of cardiomyopathy. Overall, 6 pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in 4/25 (16%) cases were congruent with the phenotypic findings at autopsy and therefore considered clinically actionable.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Whole-exome molecular autopsy with gene-specific surveillance is an effective approach for the detection of potential pathogenic variants in SUDY cases. However, systematic variant adjudication is crucial to ensure accurate and proper care for surviving family members.</p></sec>

Ventricular Fibrillation Conversion Testing After Implantation of a Subcutaneous Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Compared with transvenous implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), subcutaneous (S)-ICDs require a higher energy for effective defibrillation. Although ventricular fibrillation conversion testing (CT) is recommended after S-ICD implantation to ensure an adequate margin between the defibrillation threshold and maximum device output (80J), prior work found that adherence to this recommendation is declining.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied first-time recipients of S-ICDs (between September 28, 2012, and April 1, 2016) in the National Cardiovascular Database Registry ICD Registry to determine predictors of use of CT, predictors of an insufficient safety margin (ISM, defined as ventricular fibrillation conversion energy >65J) during testing, and inhospital outcomes associated with use of CT. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to predict use of CT and ISM. Inverse probability weighted logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between use of CT and inhospital adverse events including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>CT testing was performed in 70.7% (n=5624) of 7960 patients with S-ICDs. Although deferral of CT was associated with several patient characteristics (including increased body mass index, increased body surface area, severely reduced ejection fraction, dialysis dependence, warfarin use, anemia, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), the facility effect was comparatively more important (area under the curve for patient level versus generalized linear mixed model: 0.619 versus 0.877). An ISM occurred in 6.9% (n=336) of 4864 patients without a prior ICD and was more common among white patients and those with ventricular pacing on the preimplant ECG, higher preimplant blood pressure, larger body surface area, higher body mass index, and lower ejection fraction. A risk score was able to identify patients at low (<5%), medium (5% to 10%), and high risk (>10%) for ISM. CT testing was not associated with a composite of inhospital complications including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Use of CT testing after S-ICD implantation was driven by facility preference to a greater extent than patient factors and was not associated with a composite of inhospital complications or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>. ISM was relatively uncommon and is associated with several widely available patient characteristics. These data may inform ICD system selection and a targeted approach to CT.</p></sec>

Association of Pediatric Medical Emergency Teams With Hospital Mortality
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Implementation of medical emergency teams has been identified as a potential strategy to reduce hospital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>s, because these teams respond to patients with acute physiological decline in an effort to prevent in-hospital cardiac arrest. However, prior studies of the association between medical emergency teams and hospital mortality have been limited and typically have not accounted for preimplementation mortality trends.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Within the Pediatric Health Information System for freestanding pediatric hospitals, annual risk-adjusted mortality rates were calculated for sites between 2000 and 2015. A random slopes interrupted time series analysis then examined whether implementation of a medical emergency team was associated with lower-than-expected mortality rates based on preimplementation trends.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Across 38 pediatric hospitals, mean annual hospital admission volume was 15 854 (range, 6684–33 024), and there were a total of 1 659 059 hospitalizations preimplementation and 4 392 392 hospitalizations postimplementation. Before medical emergency team implementation, hospital mortality decreased by 6.0% annually (odds ratio [OR], 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.92–0.96) across all hospitals. After medical emergency team implementation, hospital mortality continued to decrease by 6% annually (OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.93–0.95), with no deepening of the mortality slope (ie, not lower OR) in comparison with the preimplementation trend, for the overall cohort (<i>P</i>=0.98) or when analyzed separately within each of the 38 study hospitals. Five years after medical emergency team implementation across study sites, there was no difference between predicted (hospital mean of 6.18 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>s per 1000 admissions based on preimplementation trends) and actual mortality rates (hospital mean of 6.48 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>s per 1000 admissions; <i>P</i>=0.57).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Implementation of medical emergency teams in a large sample of pediatric hospitals in the United States was not associated with a reduction in hospital mortality beyond existing preimplementation trends.</p></sec>

Improving 1-Year Outcomes of Infrainguinal Limb Revascularization

We investigated whether these developments in care have translated to improvements in patient pathways and outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Individual-patient records from Hospital Episode Statistics were used to identify 103 934 patients who underwent endovascular (angioplasty) or surgical (endarterectomy, profundaplasty, or bypass) lower limb revascularization for infrainguinal peripheral artery disease in England between January 2006 and December 2015. Major lower limb amputations and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>s within 1 year after revascularization were ascertained from Hospital Episode Statistics and Office for National Statistics mortality records. Competing risks regression was used to estimate the cumulative incidence of major amputation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>, adjusted for patient age, sex, comorbidity score, indication for the intervention (intermittent claudication, severe limb ischemia without record of tissue loss, severe limb ischemia with a record of ulceration, severe limb ischemia with a record of gangrene/osteomyelitis), and comorbid diabetes mellitus.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The estimated 1-year risk of major amputation decreased from 5.7% (in 2006–2007) to 3.9% (in 2014–2015) following endovascular revascularization, and from 11.2% (2006–2007) to 6.6% (2014–2015) following surgical procedures. The risk of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> after both types of revascularization also decreased.

Cardioprotective Role of Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-Associated Factor 2 by Suppressing Apoptosis and Necroptosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Programmed cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>, including apoptosis, mitochondria-mediated necrosis, and necroptosis, is critically involved in ischemic cardiac injury, pathological cardiac remodeling, and heart failure progression. Whereas apoptosis and mitochondria-mediated necrosis signaling is well established, the regulatory mechanisms of necroptosis and its significance in the pathogenesis of heart failure remain elusive.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We examined the role of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 (Traf2) in regulating myocardial necroptosis and remodeling using genetic mouse models. We also performed molecular and cellular biology studies to elucidate the mechanisms by which Traf2 regulates necroptosis signaling.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We identified a critical role for Traf2 in myocardial survival and homeostasis by suppressing necroptosis. Cardiac-specific deletion of <i>Traf2</i> in mice triggered necroptotic cardiac cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>, pathological remodeling, and heart failure. Plasma tumor necrosis factor α level was significantly elevated in <i>Traf2</i>-deficient mice, and genetic ablation of <i>TNFR1</i> largely abrogated pathological cardiac remodeling and dysfunction associated with Traf2 deletion. Mechanistically, Traf2 critically regulates receptor-interacting proteins 1 and 3 and mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein necroptotic signaling with the adaptor protein tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> domain as an upstream regulator and transforming growth factor β-activated kinase 1 as a downstream effector. It is important to note that genetic deletion of <i>RIP3</i> largely rescued the cardiac phenotype triggered by Traf2 deletion, validating a critical role of necroptosis in regulating pathological remodeling and heart failure propensity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These results identify an important Traf2-mediated, NFκB-independent, prosurvival pathway in the heart by suppressing necroptotic signaling, which may serve as a new therapeutic target for pathological remodeling and heart failure.</p></sec>

Transcription Factor RUNX1 Regulates Platelet <i>PCTP</i> (Phosphatidylcholine Transfer Protein): Implications for Cardiovascular Events
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>PCTP (phosphatidylcholine transfer protein) regulates the intermembrane transfer of phosphatidylcholine. Higher platelet PCTP expression is associated with increased platelet responses on activation of protease-activated receptor 4 thrombin receptors noted in black subjects compared with white subjects. Little is known about the regulation of platelet <i>PCTP</i>. Haplodeficiency of RUNX1, a major hematopoietic transcription factor, is associated with thrombocytopenia and impaired platelet responses on activation. Platelet expression profiling of a patient with a <i>RUNX1</i> loss-of-function mutation revealed a 10-fold downregulation of the <i>PCTP</i> gene compared with healthy controls.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We pursued the hypothesis that <i>PCTP</i> is regulated by RUNX1 and that <i>PCTP</i> expression is correlated with cardiovascular events. We studied RUNX1 binding to the <i>PCTP</i> promoter using DNA-protein binding studies and human erythroleukemia cells and promoter activity using luciferase reporter studies. We assessed the relationship between <i>RUNX1</i> and <i>PCTP</i> in peripheral blood RNA and <i>PCTP</i> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> or myocardial infarction in 2 separate patient cohorts (587 total patients) with cardiovascular disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Platelet PCTP protein in the patient was reduced by ≈50%. DNA-protein binding studies showed RUNX1 binding to consensus sites in ≈1 kB of <i>PCTP</i> promoter. <i>PCTP</i> expression was increased with <i>RUNX1</i> overexpression and reduced with <i>RUNX1</i> knockdown in human erythroleukemia cells, indicating that <i>PCTP</i> is regulated by RUNX1. Studies in 2 cohorts of patients showed that <i>RUNX1</i> expression in blood correlated with <i>PCTP</i> gene expression; <i>PCTP</i> expression was higher in black compared with white subjects and was associated with future <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>/myocardial infarction after adjustment for age, sex, and race (odds ratio, 2.05; 95% confidence interval 1.6–2.7; <i>P</i><0.0001). <i>RUNX1</i> expression is known to initiate at 2 alternative promoters, a distal P1 and a proximal P2 promoter. In patient cohorts, there were differential effects of <i>RUNX1</i> isoforms on <i>PCTP</i> expression with a negative correlation in blood between <i>RUNX1</i> expressed from the P1 promoter and <i>PCTP</i> expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p><i>PCTP</i> is a direct transcriptional target of RUNX1. <i>PCTP</i> expression is associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>/myocardial infarction in patients with cardiovascular disease.

Heart Failure Stages Among Older Adults in the Community

Additionally, the role of contemporary measures of longitudinal strain and diastolic dysfunction in defining HF stages is unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>HF stages were classified in 6118 participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study (67–91 years of age) at the fifth study visit as follows: A (asymptomatic with HF risk factors but no cardiac structural or functional abnormalities), B (asymptomatic with structural abnormalities, defined as left ventricular hypertrophy, dilation or dysfunction, or significant valvular disease), C1 (clinical HF without prior hospitalization), and C2 (clinical HF with earlier hospitalization).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Using the traditional definitions of HF stages, only 5% of examined participants were free of HF risk factors or structural heart disease (Stage 0), 52% were categorized as Stage A, 30% Stage B, 7% Stage C1, and 6% Stage C2. Worse HF stage was associated with a greater risk of incident HF hospitalization or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> at a median follow-up of 608 days. Left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction was preserved in 77% and 65% in Stages C1 and C2, respectively. Incorporation of longitudinal strain and diastolic dysfunction into the Stage B definition reclassified 14% of the sample from Stage A to B and improved the net reclassification index (<i>P</i>=0.028) and integrated discrimination index (<i>P</i>=0.016). Abnormal LV structure, systolic function (based on LV ejection fraction and longitudinal strain), and diastolic function (based on e’, E/e’, and left atrial volume index) were each independently and additively associated with risk of incident HF hospitalization or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> in Stage A and B participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The majority of older adults in the community are at risk for HF (Stages A or B), appreciably more compared with previous reports in younger community-based samples. LV ejection fraction is robustly preserved in at least two-thirds of older adults with prevalent HF (Stage C), highlighting the burden of HF with preserved LV ejection fraction in the elderly.

Individual patient data were provided by the leadership of each trial. The prespecified primary efficacy outcome was cardiovascular mortality within 30 days, and the primary safety outcome was stroke or transient ischemic attack within 30 days.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The 3 eligible randomized trials (TAPAS [Thrombus Aspiration During Percutaneous Coronary Intervention in Acute Myocardial Infarction], TASTE [Thrombus Aspiration in ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction in Scandinavia], and TOTAL [Trial of Routine Aspiration Thrombectomy With PCI Versus PCI Alone in Patients With STEMI]) enrolled 19 047 patients, of whom 18 306 underwent PCI and were included in the primary analysis. Cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> at 30 days occurred in 221 of 9155 patients (2.4%) randomized to thrombus aspiration and 262 of 9151 (2.9%) randomized to PCI alone (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% confidence interval, 0.70–1.01; <i>P</i>=0.06).

There were no significant differences in recurrent myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, heart failure, or target vessel revascularization. In the subgroup with high thrombus burden (TIMI [Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction] thrombus grade ≥3), thrombus aspiration was associated with fewer cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>s (170 [2.5%] versus 205 [3.1%]; hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.65–0.98; <i>P</i>=0.03) and with more strokes or transient ischemic attacks (55 [0.9%] versus 34 [0.5%]; odds ratio, 1.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.02–2.42, <i>P</i>=0.04).

Systolic Blood Pressure Trajectory, Frailty, and All-Cause Mortality >80 Years of Age
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Clinical trials show benefit from lowering systolic blood pressure (SBP) in people ≥80 years of age, but nonrandomized epidemiological studies suggest lower SBP may be associated with higher mortality. This study aimed to evaluate associations of SBP with all-cause mortality by frailty category >80 years of age and to evaluate SBP trajectories before <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A population-based cohort study was conducted using electronic health records of 144 403 participants ≥80 years of age registered with family practices in the United Kingdom from 2001 to 2014. Participants were followed for ≤5 years. Clinical records of SBP were analyzed. Frailty status was classified using the e-Frailty Index into the categories of fit, mild, moderate, and severe. All-cause mortality was evaluated by frailty status and mean SBP in Cox proportional-hazards models. SBP trajectories were evaluated using person months as observations, with mean SBP and antihypertensive treatment status estimated for each person month. Fractional polynomial models were used to estimate SBP trajectories over 5 years before <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>During follow-up, 51 808 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>s occurred. Mortality rates increased with frailty level and were greatest at SBP <110 mm Hg. In fit women, mortality was 7.7 per 100 person years at SBP 120 to 139 mm Hg, 15.2 at SBP 110 to 119 mm Hg, and 22.7 at SBP <110 mm Hg. For women with severe frailty, rates were 16.8, 25.2, and 39.6, respectively. SBP trajectories showed an accelerated decline in the last 2 years of life. The relative odds of SBP <120 mm Hg were higher in the last 3 months of life than 5 years previously in both treated (odds ratio, 6.06; 95% confidence interval, 5.40–6.81) and untreated (odds ratio, 6.31; 95% confidence interval, 5.30–7.52) patients. There was no evidence of intensification of antihypertensive therapy in the final 2 years of life.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>A terminal decline of SBP in the final 2 years of life suggests that nonrandomized epidemiological associations of low SBP with higher mortality may be accounted for by reverse causation if participants with lower blood pressure values are closer, on average, to the end of life.</p></sec>

Temporal Trends in Adverse Events After Everolimus-Eluting Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold Versus Everolimus-Eluting Metallic Stent Implantation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Bioresorbable coronary stents have been introduced into clinical practice to improve the outcomes of patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention. The everolimus-eluting bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BVS) is the most studied of these stent platforms; however, recent trials comparing BVS with everolimus-eluting metallic stents (EES) raised concerns about BVS safety. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of BVS versus EES in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We searched Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, scientific sessions abstracts, and relevant Web sites for randomized trials with a follow-up of ≥2 years investigating percutaneous coronary interventions with BVS versus EES. The primary outcomes of our analysis were definite/probable stent thrombosis (ST) and target lesion failure (TLF; device-oriented composite end point of cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>, target vessel myocardial infarction, or ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization [TLR]). Secondary outcomes were target vessel myocardial infarction, TLR, and cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>. We calculated the risk estimates for main outcomes according to a fixed-effect model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We included 7 trials comprising data for 5583 patients randomized to receive either a BVS (n=3261) or an EES (n=2322). Median follow-up was 24 months (range, 24–36 months). Patients treated with BVS had a higher risk of definite/probable ST compared with patients treated with EES (odds ratio, 3.33; 95% confidence interval, 1.97–5.62; <i>P</i><0.00001). In particular, patients with BVS had a higher risk of subacute, late, and very late ST, whereas the risk of acute ST was similar. Patients treated with BVS compared with EES had a higher risk at 2 years of TLF (odds ratio, 1.47; 95% confidence interval, 1.14–1.90; <i>P</i>=0.003), driven mainly by an increased risk of target vessel myocardial infarction (odds ratio, 1.73; 95% confidence interval, 1.31–2.28; <i>P</i>=0.0001; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup>=0%) and of TLR (odds ratio, 1.27; 95% confidence interval, 1.00–1.62; <i>P</i>=0.05). Of importance, the risk of TLF and TLR for patients with BVS was higher between 1 and 2 years, whereas there was no difference in the first year. Risk of cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> was similar between the 2 groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our meta-analysis of randomized trials with a follow-up of ≥2 years demonstrated a higher risk of ST and of TLF in patients treated with BVS compared with EES. Of note, BVS had a higher risk of subacute, late, and very late ST, whereas the risk of TLF and TLR was higher between 1 and 2 years.</p></sec>

Association Between Midwall Late Gadolinium Enhancement and Sudden Cardiac Death in Patients With Dilated Cardiomyopathy and Mild and Moderate Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Current guidelines only recommend the use of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy for the primary prevention of sudden cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> (SCD) in those with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <35%. However, registries of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests demonstrate that 70% to 80% of such patients have an LVEF >35%. Patients with an LVEF >35% also have low competing risks of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> from nonsudden causes. Therefore, those at high risk of SCD may gain longevity from successful implantable cardioverter defibrillator therapy. We investigated whether late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) cardiovascular magnetic resonance identified patients with dilated cardiomyopathy without severe LV systolic dysfunction at high risk of SCD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We prospectively investigated the association between midwall LGE and the prespecified primary composite outcome of SCD or aborted SCD among consecutive referrals with dilated cardiomyopathy and an LVEF ≥40% to our center between January 2000 and December 2011 who did not have a preexisting indication for implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 399 patients (145 women, median age 50 years, median LVEF 50%, 25.3% with LGE) followed for a median of 4.6 years, 18 of 101 (17.8%) patients with LGE reached the prespecified end point, compared with 7 of 298 (2.3%) without (hazard ratio [HR], 9.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.9–21.8; <i>P</i><0.0001). Nine patients (8.9%) with LGE compared with 6 (2.0%) without (HR, 4.9; 95% CI, 1.8–13.5; <i>P</i>=0.002) died suddenly, whereas 10 patients (9.9%) with LGE compared with 1 patient (0.3%) without (HR, 34.8; 95% CI, 4.6–266.6; <i>P</i><0.001) had aborted SCD. After adjustment, LGE predicted the composite end point (HR, 9.3; 95% CI, 3.9–22.3; <i>P</i><0.0001), SCD (HR, 4.8; 95% CI, 1.7–13.8; <i>P</i>=0.003), and aborted SCD (HR, 35.9; 95% CI, 4.8–271.4; <i>P</i><0.001). Estimated HRs for the primary end point for patients with an LGE extent of 0% to 2.5%, 2.5% to 5%, and >5% compared with those without LGE were 10.6 (95% CI, 3.9–29.4), 4.9 (95% CI, 1.3–18.9), and 11.8 (95% CI, 4.3–32.3), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Midwall LGE identifies a group of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and an LVEF ≥40% at increased risk of SCD and low risk of nonsudden <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> who may benefit from implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantation.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Connection
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC) is a rare form of congenital heart disease. This study describes current surgical treatment strategies and experiences in a cohort of patients from 2 congenital cardiac centers in Shanghai and Guangdong in China.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This retrospective study included 768 patients operated on between 2005 and 2014. Although most patients (n=690) underwent conventional repair, a sutureless technique was used in 10% (n=78) of cases. A multilevel mixed-effects parametric survival model and a competing-risk analysis were used to analyze associated risk factors for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> and recurrent pulmonary venous obstruction (PVO), respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to analyze the overall survival. The Nelson-Aalen cumulative risk curve was used to compare distributions of time with recurrent PVO.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The mean surgical age and weight were 214.9±39.2 days and 5.4±3.6 kg, respectively. Obstructed TAPVC (PVO) was documented in 192 (25%) of the 768 patients. There were 38 intraoperative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>s and 13 late <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>s. A younger age at the time of repair (<i>P</i>=0.001), mixed (<i>P</i>=0.004) and infracardiac (<i>P</i>=0.035) TAPVC, preoperative PVO (<i>P</i>=0.027), prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass time (<i>P</i><0.001), and longer duration of ventilation (<i>P</i>=0.028) were associated with mortality. The median follow-up was 23.2 months (range; 1–112 months). Among the 717 survivors, recurrent PVO was observed in 111 patients (15%). Associated risk factors for recurrent PVO included preoperative PVO (<i>P</i><0.001), infracardiac TAPVC (<i>P</i><0.001), mixed TAPVC (<i>P</i>=0.013), and prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass time (<i>P</i><0.001). Sutureless technique was associated with a lower restenosis rate compared with conventional repair in patients with preoperative PVO (<i>P</i>=0.038), except in newborn patients (<i>P</i>=0.443). Reintervention for restenosis was performed in 24 patients. The function of most survivors (91%) was classified according to the New York Heart Association as functional class I or II.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Surgical correction in patients with TAPVC with a biventricular anatomy can achieve an acceptable outcome. Risk factors such as a younger age at the time of repair, infracardiac and mixed TAPVC, and preoperative PVO were associated with a poorer prognosis.</p></sec>

Predictors of Death in Contemporary Adult Patients With Eisenmenger Syndrome
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Eisenmenger syndrome is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. There is no consensus, however, on mortality risk stratification. We aimed to investigate survival and predictors of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> in a large, contemporary cohort of Eisenmenger syndrome patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a multicenter approach, we identified adults with Eisenmenger syndrome under follow-up between 2000 and 2015. We examined survival and its association with clinical, electrocardiographic, echocardiographic, and laboratory parameters.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We studied 1098 patients (median age, 34.4 years; range, 16.1–84.4 years; 65.1% female; 31.9% with Down syndrome). The majority had a posttricuspid defect (n=643, 58.6%), followed by patients with a complex (n=315, 28.7%) and pretricuspid lesion (n=140, 12.7%). Over a median follow-up of 3.1 years (interquartile range, 1.4–5.9), allowing for 4361.6 patient-years observation, 278 patients died and 6 underwent transplantation. Twelve parameters emerged as significant predictors of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> on univariable analysis. On multivariable Cox regression analysis, only age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.41/10 years; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24–1.59; <i>P</i><0.001), pretricuspid shunt (HR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.02–2.39; <i>P</i>=0.041), oxygen saturation at rest (HR, 0.53/10%; 95% CI, 0.43–0.65; <i>P</i><0.001), presence of sinus rhythm (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.32–0.88; <i>P</i>=0.013), and presence of pericardial effusion (HR, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.59–3.66; <i>P</i><0.001) remained significant predictors of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>There is significant premature mortality among contemporary adults with Eisenmenger syndrome. We report, herewith, a multivariable mortality risk stratification model based on 5 simple, noninvasive predictors of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> in this population.</p></sec>

Sudden Cardiac Death in Patients With Ischemic Heart Failure Undergoing Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The risk of sudden cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong> (SCD) in patients with heart failure after coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) has not been examined in a contemporary clinical trial of surgical revascularization. This analysis describes the incidence, timing, and clinical predictors of SCD after CABG.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients enrolled in the STICH trial (Surgical Treatment of Ischemic Heart Failure) who underwent CABG with or without surgical ventricular reconstruction were included. We excluded patients with prior implantable cardioverter-defibrillator and those randomized only to medical therapy. The primary outcome was SCD as adjudicated by a blinded committee. A Cox model was used to examine and identify predictors of SCD. The Fine and Gray method was used to estimate the incidence of SCD accounting for the competing risk of other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Over a median follow-up of 46 months, 113 of 1411 patients who received CABG without (n = 934) or with (n = 477) surgical ventricular reconstruction had SCD; 311 died of other causes. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction at enrollment was 28±9%. The 5-year cumulative incidence of SCD was 8.5%. Patients who had SCD and those who did not die were younger and had fewer comorbid conditions than did those who died of causes other than SCD. In the first 30 days after CABG, SCD (n=5) accounted for 7% of all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">death</span></strong>s. The numerically greatest monthly rate of SCD was in the 31- to 90-day time period. In a multivariable analysis including baseline demographics, risk factors, coronary anatomy, and left ventricular function, end-systolic volume index and B-type natriuretic peptide were most strongly associated with SCD.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The monthly risk of SCD shortly after CABG among patients with a low left ventricular ejection fraction is highest between the first and third months, suggesting that risk stratification for SCD should occur early in the postoperative period, particularly in patients with increased preoperative end-systolic volume index or B-type natriuretic peptide.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

A sweeter approach to vaccine design
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es have transformed human health. Yet, guided primarily by empiricism for centuries, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e design ultimately met its match in scourges such as HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria, which continue to plague global health. The elusive search for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es against such diseases has driven researchers of diverse expertise to forgo empirical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ology. Instead, they favor a reductionist approach inspired by how pathogens interact with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immune system</span></strong>, which has evolved to distinguish foreign from self by sensing both physical (e.g, size) and chemical (e.g., foreign molecules) features of pathogens. This has guided the rational design of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es that mimic key pathogen properties, including arraying antigens on particles to increase recognition by antibody-producing B cells (<i>1</i>). However, the mechanisms by which multivalent antigen display on nanoparticles—either synthetic or natural—enhances immunity, and how this may influence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e design principles, remain unresolved. On page 649 of this issue, Tokatlian <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) help fill this knowledge gap by demonstrating that engineering nanoparticles with glycans—sugar molecules—is critical to potentiating antibody responses. This might lead to improved next-generation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es against a wide diversity of pathogens.</p>

Ethics of maternal vaccination
<p>Innovations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e science have given us an incredible opportunity to leverage the maternal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immune system</span></strong> to improve maternal, fetal, and infant health outcomes. Maternal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ation reduces the risk of infant infection primarily through the transfer of protective maternal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es to the fetus (<i>1</i>). Although a growing number of countries are adopting maternal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e programs against diseases like influenza and pertussis, and there is an increased focus on including pregnant women in trials for new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es, there is little discussion of the ethical underpinnings of maternal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e programs (<i>2</i>). We see the proposals thus far as being overly paternalistic, founded on a too-limited conception of risk-benefit analyses that has potential to derail the development and use of lifesaving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es. By contrast, an ethical approach focused on mothers' primary interests in protecting themselves and their children could serve as the basis of the ethical framework that guides <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e policies.</p>

Why is the flu vaccine so mediocre?
<p>With flu season around the corner in the United States and Europe, the push has begun once again to encourage people to receive their annual shots. But over the past few years, it's become increasingly clear that the level of protection offered by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e varies widely each flu season, from 10% to 60%. And new research has revealed surprising reasons for its lackluster performance. For decades, it appeared that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e had an efficacy of 70% to 90%, but scientists now know that's because they were using a misleading test—replaced in the 1990s—to assess whether it protected people. The traditional explanation for failure also has been revamped. The flu strains selected for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e change each year based on what's in circulation, and scientists long blamed failure on mutations that occur in the circulating viruses in the 6–8 months that pass between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e being manufactured and used. But these "mismatches" sometimes occur in years when there's solid protection, and some years with lots of failure have good matches. It turns out that other forces at work include mutations in the strain selected for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e during the manufacturing process, which grows the virus in eggs. People's prior exposure to influenza also can bias their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immune system</span></strong> toward a response that undermines that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e-triggered immunity. And the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e strain selection process itself relies heavily on the ferret animal model, which can mislead, too. There's an increasing call now to improve the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e and organize the research community to more collaboratively try to develop a "universal" flu shot that works against many strains and lasts for many years, if not a lifetime. </p>

Universal protection against influenza infection by a multidomain antibody to influenza hemagglutinin
<p>Broadly neutralizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es against highly variable pathogens have stimulated the design of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es and therapeutics. We report the use of diverse camelid single-domain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es to influenza virus hemagglutinin to generate multidomain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es with impressive breadth and potency. Multidomain antibody MD3606 protects mice against influenza A and B infection when administered intravenously or expressed locally from a recombinant adeno-associated virus vector. Crystal and single-particle electron microscopy structures of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es with hemagglutinins from influenza A and B viruses reveal binding to highly conserved epitopes. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that multidomain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es targeting multiple epitopes exhibit enhanced virus cross-reactivity and potency. In combination with adeno-associated virus–mediated gene delivery, they may provide an effective strategy to prevent infection with influenza virus and other highly variable pathogens.</p>

Antibodies to PfSEA-1 block parasite egress from RBCs and protect against malaria infection
<p>Novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es are urgently needed to reduce the burden of severe malaria. Using a differential whole-proteome screening method, we identified <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> schizont egress antigen-1 (PfSEA-1), a 244-kilodalton parasite antigen expressed in schizont-infected red blood cells (RBCs). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es to PfSEA-1 decreased parasite replication by arresting schizont rupture, and conditional disruption of PfSEA-1 resulted in a profound parasite replication defect. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ation of mice with recombinant <i>Plasmodium berghei</i> PbSEA-1 significantly reduced parasitemia and delayed mortality after lethal challenge with the <i>Plasmodium berghei</i> strain ANKA. Tanzanian children with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es to recombinant PfSEA-1A (rPfSEA-1A) did not experience severe malaria, and Kenyan adolescents and adults with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es to rPfSEA-1A had significantly lower parasite densities than individuals without these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
A Synthetic Glycan Microarray Enables Epitope Mapping of Plant Cell Wall Glycan-Directed Antibodies
<p>In the last three decades, more than 200 monoclonal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es have been raised against most classes of plant cell wall polysaccharides by different laboratories worldwide. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es are widely used to identify differences in plant cell wall components in mutants, organ and tissue types, and developmental stages. Despite their importance and broad use, the precise binding epitope has been determined for only a few of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es. Here, we use a plant glycan microarray equipped with 88 synthetic oligosaccharides to comprehensively map the epitopes of plant cell wall glycan-directed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es. Our results reveal the binding epitopes for 78 arabinogalactan-, rhamnogalacturonan-, xylan-, and xyloglucan-directed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es. We demonstrate that, with knowledge of the exact epitopes recognized by individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es, specific glycosyl hydrolases can be implemented into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immunolog</span></strong>ical cell wall analyses, providing a framework to obtain structural information on plant cell wall glycans with unprecedented molecular precision.</p>

Peanut allergen–specific antibodies go public
<p>Changes in the human environment and activities over the past few decades have caused an epidemic of food allergies (<i>1</i>). People suffering from allergies often feel that they live on a cliff edge, as the allergens to which they react are potentially fatal (<i>2</i>). For example, tiny amounts of peanut picked up on skin or contaminating other foods can be dangerous to peanut-sensitized individuals (<i>2</i>–<i>4</i>). Immunoglobulin E (IgE) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es mediate the allergic response. They bind to specific receptors on inflammatory immune cells: mast cells in mucosal tissues lining body surfaces and cavities, and basophils in the circulation. These cells mediate allergic responses triggered by specific antigens (allergens) that are recognized by IgE. B cells expressing IgG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es have long served as the paradigm for the development of B cells into antibody-secreting plasma cells in the immune response. Until recently, the far less abundant IgE-expressing B cells have proved to be elusive. On page 1306 of this issue, Croote <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) have analyzed single B cells from six individuals with peanut allergy, which enabled the identification of the natural Ig heavy- and light-chain pairs from IgE-expressing B cells that are responsible for peanut allergy. With this information they produced recombinant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es, identified the peanut allergen–specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es, and used site-directed mutagenesis to suppress their activity. The mutated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es could be used to treat peanut allergy.</p>

Redemption for self-reactive antibodies
<p>Immunity to pathogens and tolerance to self are cardinal features of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immune system</span></strong>s. Immunological specificity is encoded by receptors expressed on the surface of lymphocytes that are generated through random assembly of variable, diversity, and joining (VDJ) gene segments during B and T lymphocyte development. In addition, B lymphocytes further diversify this initial repertoire through somatic hypermutation of antibody genes in germinal centers (transient structures that form in lymphoid organs in which high-affinity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es arise). On page 223 of this issue, Burnett <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) devise a strategy to track the fate of self-reactive B cells in germinal centers elicited by a foreign antigen that structurally mimics a self-antigen (antigen mimicry). The authors provide evidence that hypermutation of antibody genes in germinal centers can repair self-reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es. These results have implications for how broadly neutralizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es to HIV-1 may be formed.</p>

Genome-wide identification of interferon-sensitive mutations enables influenza vaccine design
<p>In conventional attenuated viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es, immunogenicity is often suboptimal. Here we present a systematic approach for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e development that eliminates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interferon</span></strong> (IFN)–modulating functions genome-wide while maintaining virus replication fitness. We applied a quantitative high-throughput genomics system to influenza A virus that simultaneously measured the replication fitness and IFN sensitivity of mutations across the entire genome. By incorporating eight IFN-sensitive mutations, we generated a hyper–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interferon</span></strong>-sensitive (HIS) virus as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e candidate. HIS virus is highly attenuated in IFN-competent hosts but able to induce transient IFN responses, elicits robust humoral and cellular immune responses, and provides protection against homologous and heterologous viral challenges. Our approach, which attenuates the virus and promotes immune responses concurrently, is broadly applicable for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e development against other pathogens.</p>

Zika rewrites maternal immunization ethics
<p>Pregnant women long have been excluded from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e studies because researchers are wary of causing unintended harm to the highly vulnerable developing fetus. But a new report from a group that represents many disciplines contends that ethics demand pregnant women be included in the trial of experimental Zika <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es, which are designed to protect babies from brain damage and other maladies caused by that mosquito-borne virus. The report is careful to point out that risk/benefit ratios must be weighed for each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e and each trial on a case-by-case basis—and indeed the Zika <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e that has moved furthest in human studies rightly excludes pregnant women, says a co-author of the report. Other experimental maternal immunizations designed to protect babies are also being tested now, and one trial, for a respiratory syncytial virus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e, includes pregnant women. A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e against group B streptococcus has also moved along the development pipeline and may soon enter trials with pregnant women, too.

MAVS-dependent host species range and pathogenicity of human hepatitis A virus

Evaluation of the selectivity and sensitivity of isoform- and mutation-specific RAS antibodies
<p>There is intense interest in developing therapeutic strategies for RAS proteins, the most frequently mutated oncoprotein family in cancer. Development of effective anti-RAS therapies will be aided by the greater appreciation of RAS isoform–specific differences in signaling events that support neoplastic cell growth. However, critical issues that require resolution to facilitate the success of these efforts remain. In particular, the use of well-validated anti-RAS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es is essential for accurate interpretation of experimental data. We evaluated 22 commercially available anti-RAS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es with a set of distinct reagents and cell lines for their specificity and selectivity in recognizing the intended RAS isoforms and mutants. Reliability varied substantially. For example, we found that some pan- or isoform-selective anti-RAS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es did not adequately recognize their intended target or showed greater selectivity for another; some were valid for detecting G12D and G12V mutant RAS proteins in Western blotting, but none were valid for immunofluorescence or immunohistochemical analyses; and some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es recognized nonspecific bands in lysates from “Rasless” cells expressing the oncoprotein BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>. Using our validated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es, we identified RAS isoform–specific siRNAs and shRNAs. Our results may help to ensure the accurate interpretation of future RAS studies.</p>

Targeting TNFR2 with antagonistic antibodies inhibits proliferation of ovarian cancer cells and tumor-associated T<sub>regs</sub>
<p>Major barriers to cancer therapy include the lack of selective inhibitors of regulatory T cells (T<sub>regs</sub>) and the lack of broadly applicable ways to directly target tumors through frequently expressed surface oncogenes. Tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2) is an attractive target protein because of its restricted abundance to highly immunosuppressive T<sub>regs</sub> and oncogenic presence on human tumors. We characterized the effect of TNFR2 inhibition using antagonistic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es. In culture-based assays, we found that two TNFR2 antagonists inhibited T<sub>reg</sub> proliferation, reduced soluble TNFR2 secretion from normal cells, and enabled T effector cell expansion. The antagonistic activity occurred in the presence of added TNF, a natural TNFR2 agonist. These TNFR2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es killed T<sub>regs</sub> isolated from ovarian cancer ascites more potently than it killed T<sub>regs</sub> from healthy donor samples, suggesting that these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es may have specificity for the tumor microenvironment. The TNFR2 antagonists also killed OVCAR3 ovarian cancer cells, which have abundant surface TNFR2. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es stabilized antiparallel dimers in cell surface TNFR2 that rendered the receptor unable to activate the nuclear factor κB pathway and trigger cell proliferation. Our data suggest that, by targeting tumor cells and immunosuppressive tumor-associated T<sub>regs</sub>, antagonistic TNFR2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es may be an effective treatment for cancers positive for TNFR2.</p>

Innate immune recognition of glycans targets HIV nanoparticle immunogens to germinal centers

We compared the fates of two different heavily glycosylated HIV antigens, a gp120-derived mini-protein and a large, stabilized envelope trimer, in protein nanoparticle or “free” forms after primary immunization. Unlike monomeric antigens, nanoparticles were rapidly shuttled to the follicular dendritic cell (FDC) network and then concentrated in germinal centers in a complement-, mannose-binding lectin (MBL)–, and immunogen glycan–dependent manner. Loss of FDC localization in MBL-deficient mice or via immunogen deglycosylation significantly affected antibody responses. These findings identify an innate immune–mediated recognition pathway promoting antibody responses to particulate antigens, with broad implications for humoral immunity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e design.</p>

An autoimmune disease variant of IgG1 modulates B cell activation and differentiation
<p>The maintenance of autoreactive B cells in a quiescent state is crucial for preventing autoimmunity. Here we identify a variant of human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) with a Gly<sup>396</sup>→Arg substitution (hIgG1-G396R), which positively correlates with systemic lupus erythematosus. In induced lupus models, murine homolog Gly<sup>390</sup>→Arg (G390R) knockin mice generate excessive numbers of plasma cells, leading to a burst of broad-spectrum auto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es. This enhanced production of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es is also observed in hapten-immunized G390R mice, as well as in influenza-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ated human G396R homozygous carriers. This variant potentiates the phosphorylation of the IgG1 immunoglobulin tail tyrosine (ITT) motif. This, in turn, alters the availability of phospho-ITT to trigger longer adaptor protein Grb2 dwell times in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immunolog</span></strong>ical synapses, leading to hyper–Grb2–Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (Btk) signaling upon antigen binding. Thus, the hIgG1-G396R variant is important for both lupus pathogenesis and antibody responses after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ation.</p>

Congo rapidly curtails Ebola
<p>An outbreak of Ebola that surfaced in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) on 8 May has petered out and, for the first time, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e may have had a role in containing spread. To date, Ebola has struck 53 people in the DRC's Équateur province, killing 29. Most everyone lived in remote, difficult-to-reach villages, although four cases surfaced in the heavily populated city of Mbandaka, triggering serious concerns of an epidemic exploding. A vigorous, rapid effort to contain spread began immediately, with the DRC's Ministry of Public Health working with international partners to build treatment facilities, conduct surveillance, and trace contacts of cases. On 21 May, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e effort began that focused on creating a "ring" around cases by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ating people they may have come in contact with directly or indirectly. Some 3300 people received the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e, which is still experimental and was given in a clinical trial. But the trial did not have a control group, so it will not be possible to assess the precise role, if any, it played in stopping spread.

Antihomotypic affinity maturation improves human B cell responses against a repetitive epitope
<p>Affinity maturation selects B cells expressing somatically mutated antibody variants with improved antigen-binding properties to protect from invading pathogens. We determined the molecular mechanism underlying the clonal selection and affinity maturation of human B cells expressing protective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es against the circumsporozoite protein of the malaria parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> (PfCSP). We show in molecular detail that the repetitive nature of PfCSP facilitates direct homotypic interactions between two PfCSP repeat-bound monoclonal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es, thereby improving antigen affinity and B cell activation. These data provide a mechanistic explanation for the strong selection of somatic mutations that mediate homotypic antibody interactions after repeated parasite exposure in humans. Our findings demonstrate a different mode of antigen-mediated affinity maturation to improve antibody responses to PfCSP and presumably other repetitive antigens.</p>

Safety concerns derail dengue vaccination program
<p>Efforts to control dengue suffered a major setback in late November when Sanofi Pasteur announced that its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e, the only one on the market, should only be given to those who have already had one infection with the mosquito-borne disease that affects millions of people in the tropics each year. The dengue virus comes in four serotypes. A first infection is usually mild, but a second infection with a different serotype puts the patient at risk of a serious, occasionally life-threatening illness. A retrospective analysis of those who participated in phase III trials in 2011 found that those who had never had a dengue infection at the time of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ation were in rare cases at risk of enhanced disease, although the Dengvaxia <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e did reduce infections and cases of serious illness in those who had previously suffered from dengue. The news caused an uproar in the Philippines, where a mass <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ation campaign was halted. And the incident is likely to lead health officials to carefully scrutinize other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es now in development.</p>

Antibody-dependent enhancement of severe dengue disease in humans
<p>For dengue viruses 1 to 4 (DENV1-4), a specific range of antibody titer has been shown to enhance viral replication in vitro and severe disease in animal models. Although suspected, such antibody-dependent enhancement of severe disease has not been shown to occur in humans. Using multiple statistical approaches to study a long-term pediatric cohort in Nicaragua, we show that risk of severe dengue disease is highest within a narrow range of preexisting anti-DENV antibody titers. By contrast, we observe protection from all symptomatic dengue disease at high antibody titers. Thus, immune correlates of severe dengue must be evaluated separately from correlates of protection against symptomatic disease. These results have implications for studies of dengue pathogenesis and for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e development, because enhancement, not just lack of protection, is of concern.</p>

Life, death, and antibodies
<p>The production of high-affinity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es has fascinated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immunolog</span></strong>ists for many decades. A potent arm of the immune response, these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es are forged in transient tissue structures called germinal centers (GCs) that appear in lymph nodes a few days after an infection is initiated. Over the ensuing days and weeks, the GC witnesses a cellular pantomime that includes rapid bursts of B lymphocyte proliferation and multicellular migratory cycles that have a unique purpose. These B cells are in the act of mutating, reshaping, testing, and improving their antibody specificities. While their antibody is refined, GC B cells are also undergoing further differentiation to be retasked for new, long-term occupations as circulating memory cells in the blood or bone marrow-resident, long-lived plasma cells that will produce high-affinity, protective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es for life. These intense proliferation and selection processes are balanced by an extraordinary rate of programmed cell death (apoptosis), and there is much speculation as to how and why so many B cells are targeted for apoptosis. On page 193 of this issue, Mayer <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) identify the paths leading to B cell apoptosis in the GC reaction.</p>

Mouse models of acute and chronic hepacivirus infection
<p>An estimated 71 million people worldwide are infected with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hepat</span></strong>itis C virus (HCV). The lack of small-animal models has impeded studies of antiviral immune mechanisms. Here we show that an HCV-related hepacivirus discovered in Norway rats can establish high-titer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hepat</span></strong>otropic infections in laboratory mice with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immunolog</span></strong>ical features resembling those seen in human viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hepat</span></strong>itis. Whereas immune-compromised mice developed persistent infection, immune-competent mice cleared the virus within 3 to 5 weeks. Acute clearance was T cell dependent and associated with liver injury. Transient depletion of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells before infection resulted in chronic infection, characterized by high levels of intra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hepat</span></strong>ic regulatory T cells and expression of inhibitory molecules on intra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hepat</span></strong>ic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Natural killer cells controlled early infection but were not essential for viral clearance. This model may provide mechanistic insights into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hepat</span></strong>ic antiviral immunity, a prerequisite for the development of HCV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es.</p>

IRE1α prevents hepatic steatosis by processing and promoting the degradation of select microRNAs
<p>Obesity or a high-fat diet represses the endoribonuclease activity of inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α), a transducer of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in cells under endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. An impaired UPR is associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hepat</span></strong>ic steatosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is caused by lipid accumulation in the liver. We found that IRE1α was critical to maintaining lipid homeostasis in the liver by repressing the biogenesis of microRNAs (miRNAs) that regulate lipid mobilization. In mice fed normal chow, the endoribonuclease function of IRE1α processed a subset of precursor miRNAs in the liver, including those of the miR-200 and miR-34 families, such that IRE1α promoted their degradation through the process of regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD). A high-fat diet in mice or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hepat</span></strong>ic steatosis in patients was associated with the S-nitrosylation of IRE1α and inactivation of its endoribonuclease activity. This resulted in an increased abundance of these miRNA families in the liver and, consequently, a decreased abundance of their targets, which included peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor α (PPARα) and the deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), regulators of fatty acid oxidation and triglyceride lipolysis. IRE1α deficiency exacerbated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hepat</span></strong>ic steatosis in mice. The abundance of the miR-200 and miR-34 families was also increased in cultured, lipid-overloaded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hepat</span></strong>ocytes and in the livers of patients with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hepat</span></strong>ic steatosis. Our findings reveal a mechanism by which IRE1α maintains lipid homeostasis through its regulation of miRNAs, a regulatory pathway distinct from the canonical IRE1α-UPR pathway under acute ER stress.</p>

Blockade of TNFR2 signaling enhances the immunotherapeutic effect of CpG ODN in a mouse model of colon cancer
<p>Through the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor type II (TNFR2), TNF preferentially activates, expands, and promotes the phenotypic stability of CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T (T<sub>reg</sub>) cells. Those T<sub>reg</sub> cells that have a high abundance of TNFR2 have the maximal immunosuppressive capacity. We investigated whether targeting TNFR2 could effectively suppress the activity of T<sub>reg</sub> cells and consequently enhance the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. We found that, relative to a suboptimal dose of the immunostimulatory Toll-like receptor 9 ligand CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN), the combination of the suboptimal dose of CpG ODN with the TNFR2-blocking antibody M861 more markedly inhibited the growth of subcutaneously grafted mouse CT26 colon tumor cells. This resulted in markedly fewer TNFR2<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells and more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interferon</span></strong>-γ–positive (IFN-γ<sup>+</sup>) CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T lymphocytes infiltrating the tumor and improved long-term tumor-free survival in the mouse cohort. Tumor-free mice were resistant to rechallenge by the same but not unrelated (4T1 breast cancer) cells. Treatment with the combination of TNFR2-blocking antibody and a CD25-targeted antibody also resulted in enhanced inhibition of tumor growth in a syngeneic 4T1 mouse model of breast cancer. Thus, the combination of a TNFR2 inhibitor and an immunotherapeutic stimulant may represent a more effective treatment strategy for various cancers.</p>

TRIF-dependent Toll-like receptor signaling suppresses <i>Scd1</i> transcription in hepatocytes and prevents diet-induced hepatic steatosis
<p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) includes a spectrum of diseases that ranges in severity from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hepat</span></strong>ic steatosis to steato<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hepat</span></strong>itis, the latter of which is a major predisposing factor for liver cirrhosis and cancer. Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, which is critical for innate immunity, is generally believed to aggravate disease progression by inducing inflammation. Unexpectedly, we found that deficiency in TIR domain–containing adaptor-inducing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interferon</span></strong>-β (TRIF), a cytosolic adaptor that transduces some TLR signals, worsened <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hepat</span></strong>ic steatosis induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) and that such exacerbation was independent of myeloid cells. The aggravated steatosis in <i>Trif</i><sup><i>−/−</i></sup> mice was due to the increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hepat</span></strong>ocyte transcription of the gene encoding stearoyl–coenzyme A (CoA) desaturase 1 (SCD1), the rate-limiting enzyme for lipogenesis. Activation of the TRIF pathway by polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)] suppressed the increase in SCD1 abundance induced by palmitic acid or an HFD and subsequently prevented lipid accumulation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hepat</span></strong>ocytes. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interferon</span></strong> regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), a transcriptional regulator downstream of TRIF, acted as a transcriptional suppressor by directly binding to the <i>Scd1</i> promoter. These results suggest an unconventional metabolic function for TLR/TRIF signaling that should be taken into consideration when seeking to pharmacologically inhibit this pathway.</p>

Ebola outbreak continues despite powerful vaccine
<p>New data show that an experimental Ebola <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e is "highly effective" and appears to have helped contain a long-lasting outbreak of the deadly disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, but the conflict-ridden region has kept <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e teams from reaching many people who need it. The World Health Organization (WHO) revealed last week that what it called the "<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e efficacy" is 97.5% in people who either directly or indirectly came in contact with one of the 1200-plus cases of the disease. But nearly 20% of these contacts either could not be reached or refused the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e. WHO also for the second time asked an expert committee to decide whether the outbreak, which began in August 2018, should be declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. But the committee again said no, WHO did not need to ring the loudest alarm bell it had, largely because the virus had yet to spread to neighboring countries. WHO's director-general took the committee's advice, but urged the international community to provide more financial support, noting full funding of the response through July would require $104 million more than is now on hand.</p>

B cells, CMV, and stem cell transplant
<p>Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a potentially curative therapy for various malignant and nonmalignant conditions but can be complicated by infections such as reactivation of cytomegalovirus (CMV). CMV is a ubiquitous DNA herpes virus comprising various distinct strains (<i>1</i>). Around 60 to 90% of healthy adults are seropositive, indicating past exposure to the virus, although infections in healthy people are often mild or asymptomatic. After initial acute infection, CMV enters a latent phase, similar to other herpes viruses. It has been suggested that CMV infection may confer an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immunolog</span></strong>ical benefit, perhaps explaining its prevalence, because comparison of seropositive and seronegative individuals has shown that CMV infection results in greater responses to the flu <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e (<i>2</i>). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immune system</span></strong> is essential to control the initial infection and to prevent later CMV reactivation, as demonstrated by the high incidence of CMV reactivation in immunosuppressed patients such as HSCT recipients. Whereas the incidence and severity of CMV transcriptional reactivation and cell-to-cell dissemination after HSCT has substantially diminished since the adoption of prophylactic or preemptive antiviral therapies (<i>3</i>), CMV remains the most important viral infection after HSCT, especially in high-risk patients (such as seropositive recipients of seronegative donors), and can lead to life-threatening CMV disease in ∼10% of HSCT recipients (<i>4</i>). On page 288 of this issue, Martins <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) make the unexpected observation, in mice undergoing bone marrow transplantation (BMT) as a model of HSCT, that strain-specific CMV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es made by host B cells play a crucial role in preventing CMV dissemination after BMT. They propose that passive transfer of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es that are matched to the latent CMV strain in HSCT recipients might constitute a powerful and easy therapeutic approach to prevent CMV disease.</p>

Steep drop in Zika cases undermines vaccine trial
<p>When Zika raced through the Americas in 2016, it caused widespread alarm because the usually mild infection led to brain damage in babies. An intense effort began to develop a Zika <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e, and in March 2017, the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases launched a $110 million trial of its most promising candidate. The trial, now taking place in nine countries in North and South America, has hit a wall: There are too few cases of Zika in the region—largely because vast swaths of populations were infected and now are immune—to assess whether the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e works. As a result, researchers are now planning to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ate people and then intentionally infect them with the Zika virus. This human challenge model, used for decades with other diseases, was dismissed as too risky by an ethics committee just last year, mainly because infected people can sexually transmit the virus to people who are not in the study. But given the drop in transmission, a better understanding about the duration of sexual transmission, and decreasing interest from industry in Zika <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e R&D, the human challenge model now looks like the best way to move the field forward.</p>

Germinal center antibody mutation trajectories are determined by rapid self/foreign discrimination
<p>Antibodies have the specificity to differentiate foreign antigens that mimic self antigens, but it remains unclear how such specificity is acquired. In a mouse model, we generated B cells displaying an antibody that cross-reacts with two related protein antigens expressed on self versus foreign cells. B cell anergy was imposed by self antigen but reversed upon challenge with high-density foreign antigen, leading to germinal center recruitment and antibody gene hypermutation. Single-cell analysis detected rapid selection for mutations that decrease self affinity and slower selection for epistatic mutations that specifically increase foreign affinity. Crystal structures revealed that these mutations exploited subtle topological differences to achieve 5000-fold preferential binding to foreign over self epitopes. Resolution of antigenic mimicry drove the optimal affinity maturation trajectory, highlighting the value of retaining self-reactive clones as substrates for protective antibody responses.</p>

Structural basis for antibody-mediated neutralization of Lassa virus
<p>The arenavirus Lassa causes severe hemorrhagic fever and a significant disease burden in West Africa every year. The glycoprotein, GPC, is the sole antigen expressed on the viral surface and the critical target for antibody-mediated neutralization. Here we present the crystal structure of the trimeric, prefusion ectodomain of Lassa GP bound to a neutralizing antibody from a human survivor at 3.2-angstrom resolution. The antibody extensively anchors two monomers together at the base of the trimer, and biochemical analysis suggests that it neutralizes by inhibiting conformational changes required for entry. This work illuminates pH-driven conformational changes in both receptor-binding and fusion subunits of Lassa virus, illustrates the unique assembly of the arenavirus glycoprotein spike, and provides a much-needed template for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e design against these threats to global health.</p>

Dengue may bring out the worst in Zika
<p>Mice infused against either dengue or West Nile virus became far more susceptible to disease and death from Zika virus, a new study published online in <i>Science</i> shows. The mice, engineered to cripple an immune gene that normally helps suppress Zika virus, of course may not represent what happens in humans. But antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is a well-known phenomenon with dengue, which has four “serotypes” that infect humans. Infection with one dengue serotype typically causes little harm, but the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es produced against it can set a people up for severe and even deadly disease if they subsequently become infected by a different serotype. Dengue, West Nile, and Zika are all from the flavivirus family and the researchers warn that a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e against one could put a person at risk for ADE from a relative. Dengue is closet to Zika, and indeed the mouse experiment showed that dengue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es led to the most severe Zika disease. ADE also led to high levels of virus in mouse testes and spinal cords, which may help explain sexual transmission of Zika in humans and central nervous system diseases like microcephaly in babies and Guillain-Barré Syndrome in adults.</p>

A half-billion-dollar bid to head off emerging diseases

Now, CEPI has attracted nearly a half-billion dollars in funding, as it planned to announce at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, this week.

CEPI also decided to focus initially on three diseases—Lassa, Nipah, and Middle East respiratory syndrome–coronavirus—and it will soon seek proposals from academia and industry to make these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es and conduct early phase trials so that they're at the ready for a real-word efficacy test when these pathogens emerge.</p>

A “Trojan horse” bispecific-antibody strategy for broad protection against ebolaviruses
<p>There is an urgent need for monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapies that broadly protect against Ebola virus and other filoviruses. The conserved, essential interaction between the filovirus glycoprotein, GP, and its entry receptor Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) provides an attractive target for such mAbs but is shielded by multiple mechanisms, including physical sequestration in late endosomes. Here, we describe a bispecific-antibody strategy to target this interaction, in which mAbs specific for NPC1 or the GP receptor–binding site are coupled to a mAb against a conserved, surface-exposed GP epitope. Bispecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es, but not parent mAbs, neutralized all known ebolaviruses by coopting viral particles themselves for endosomal delivery and conferred postexposure protection against multiple ebolaviruses in mice. Such “Trojan horse” bispecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es have potential as broad antifilovirus immunotherapeutics.</p>

<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Currently, no therapies exist for treating and improving outcomes in patients with severe peripheral artery disease (PAD). MicroRNA93 (miR93) has been shown to favorably modulate angiogenesis and to reduce tissue loss in genetic PAD models. However, the cell-specific function, downstream mechanisms, or signaling involved in miR93-mediated ischemic muscle neovascularization is not clear. Macrophages were best known to modulate arteriogenic response in PAD, and the extent of arteriogenic response induced by macrophages is dependent on greater M2 to M1 activation/polarization state. In the present study, we identified a novel mechanism by which miR93 regulates macrophage polarization to promote angiogenesis and arteriogenesis to revascularize ischemic muscle in experimental PAD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In vitro (macrophages, endothelial cells, skeletal muscle cells under normal and hypoxia serum starvation conditions) and in vivo experiments in preclinical PAD models (unilateral femoral artery ligation and resection) were conducted to examine the role of miR93-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interferon</span></strong> regulatory factor-9–immunoresponsive gene-1 (IRG1)–itaconic acid pathway in macrophage polarization, angiogenesis, arteriogenesis, and perfusion recovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In vivo, compared with wild-type controls, miR106b-93-25 cluster–deficient mice (miR106b-93-25<sup>−/−</sup>) showed decreased angiogenesis and arteriogenesis correlating with increased M1-like macrophages after experimental PAD. Intramuscular delivery of miR93 in miR106b-93-25<sup>−/−</sup> PAD mice increased angiogenesis, arteriogenesis, and the extent of perfusion, which correlated with more M2-like macrophages in the proximal and distal hind-limb muscles. In vitro, miR93 promotes and sustains M2-like polarization even under M1-like polarizing conditions (hypoxia serum starvation). Delivery of bone marrow–derived macrophages from miR106b-93-25<sup>−/−</sup> to wild-type ischemic muscle decreased angiogenesis, arteriogenesis, and perfusion, whereas transfer of wild-type macrophages to miR106b-93-25<sup>−/−</sup> had the opposite effect. Systematic analysis of top differentially upregulated genes from RNA sequencing between miR106b-93-25<sup>−/−</sup> and wild-type ischemic muscle showed that miR93 regulates IRG1 function to modulate itaconic acid production and macrophage polarization. The 3′ untranslated region luciferase assays performed to determine whether IRG1 is a direct target of miR93 revealed that IRG1 is not an miR93 target but that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interferon</span></strong> regulatory factor-9, which can regulate IRG1 expression, is an miR93 target. In vitro, increased expression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interferon</span></strong> regulatory factor-9 and IRG1 and itaconic acid treatment significantly decreased endothelial angiogenic potential.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>miR93 inhibits <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interferon</span></strong> regulatory factor-9 to decrease IRG1–itaconic acid production to induce M2-like polarization in ischemic muscle to enhance angiogenesis, arteriogenesis, and perfusion recovery in experimental PAD.</p></sec>

The SCF<sup>β-TRCP</sup> E3 ubiquitin ligase complex targets Lipin1 for ubiquitination and degradation to promote hepatic lipogenesis
<p>The SCF<sup>β-TRCP</sup> E3 ubiquitin ligase complex plays pivotal roles in normal cellular physiology and in pathophysiological conditions. Identification of β-transducin repeat–containing protein (β-TRCP) substrates is therefore critical to understand SCF<sup>β-TRCP</sup> biology and function. We used a β-TRCP–phosphodegron motif–specific antibody in a β-TRCP substrate screen coupled with tandem mass spectrometry and identified multiple β-TRCP substrates. One of these substrates was Lipin1, an enzyme and suppressor of the family of sterol regulatory element–binding protein (SREBP) transcription factors, which activate genes encoding lipogenic factors. We showed that SCF<sup>β-TRCP</sup> specifically interacted with and promoted the polyubiquitination of Lipin1 in a manner that required phosphorylation of Lipin1 by mechanistic target of rapamycin 1 (mTORC1) and casein kinase I (CKI). β-<i>TRCP</i> depletion in HepG2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hepat</span></strong>ocellular carcinoma cells resulted in increased Lipin1 protein abundance, suppression of SREBP-dependent gene expression, and attenuation of triglyceride synthesis. Moreover, β-<i>TRCP1</i> knockout mice showed increased Lipin1 protein abundance and were protected from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hepat</span></strong>ic steatosis induced by a high-fat diet. Together, these data reveal a critical physiological function of β-TRCP in regulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hepat</span></strong>ic lipid metabolic homeostasis in part through modulating Lipin1 stability.</p>

Bacteriophage trigger antiviral immunity and prevent clearance of bacterial infection
<p>Bacteriophage are abundant at sites of bacterial infection, but their effects on mammalian hosts are unclear. We have identified pathogenic roles for filamentous Pf bacteriophage produced by <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> (<i>Pa</i>) in suppression of immunity against bacterial infection. Pf promote <i>Pa</i> wound infection in mice and are associated with chronic human <i>Pa</i> wound infections. Murine and human leukocytes endocytose Pf, and internalization of this single-stranded DNA virus results in phage RNA production. This triggers Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)– and TIR domain–containing adapter-inducing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interferon</span></strong>-β (TRIF)–dependent type I <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interferon</span></strong> production, inhibition of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and the suppression of phagocytosis. Conversely, immunization of mice against Pf prevents <i>Pa</i> wound infection. Thus, Pf triggers maladaptive innate viral pattern-recognition responses, which impair bacterial clearance. Vaccination against phage virions represents a potential strategy to prevent bacterial infection.</p>

Measles epidemic in Ukraine drove troubling European year
<p>Measles cases surged to nearly 83,000 in Europe in 2018—a 21st-century record and more than triple number in 2017, the World Health Organization announced last week. Driving the number was a massive and growing outbreak in Ukraine, where more than 54,000 cases were reported in 2018 and more than 15,000 have been logged already in 2019. Measles is extremely contagious and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e-preventable. Its complications can kill.The Ukranian epidemic stems from a decade of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e resistance and from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e supply disruptions after political upheaval and armed conflict broke out in 2014. In 2016, just 31% of Ukranian 6-year-olds had received the recommended two measles shots—a rate among the lowest in the world. "It's egregious to have people have measles in the 21st century in a European country," says Ulana Suprun, Ukraine's acting minister of health, who is steering an urgent government response to the epidemic.</p>

Antibody-mediated inhibition of MICA and MICB shedding promotes NK cell–driven tumor immunity
<p>MICA and MICB are expressed by many human cancers as a result of cellular stress, and can tag cells for elimination by cytotoxic lymphocytes through natural killer group 2D (NKG2D) receptor activation. However, tumors evade this immune recognition pathway through proteolytic shedding of MICA and MICB proteins. We rationally designed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es targeting the MICA α3 domain, the site of proteolytic shedding, and found that these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es prevented loss of cell surface MICA and MICB by human cancer cells. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es inhibited tumor growth in multiple fully immunocompetent mouse models and reduced human melanoma metastases in a humanized mouse model. Antitumor immunity was mediated mainly by natural killer (NK) cells through activation of NKG2D and CD16 Fc receptors. This approach prevents the loss of important immunostimulatory ligands by human cancers and reactivates antitumor immunity.</p>

Natural polyreactive IgA antibodies coat the intestinal microbiota
<p>Large quantities of immunoglobulin A (IgA) are constitutively secreted by intestinal plasma cells to coat and contain the commensal microbiota, yet the specificity of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es remains elusive. Here we profiled the reactivities of single murine IgA plasma cells by cloning and characterizing large numbers of monoclonal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es. IgAs were not specific to individual bacterial taxa but rather polyreactive, with broad reactivity to a diverse, but defined, subset of microbiota. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es arose at low frequencies among naive B cells and were selected into the IgA repertoire upon recirculation in Peyer’s patches. This selection process occurred independent of microbiota or dietary antigens. Furthermore, although some IgAs acquired somatic mutations, these did not substantially influence their reactivity. These findings reveal an endogenous mechanism driving homeostatic production of polyreactive IgAs with innate specificity to microbiota.</p>

Trispecific broadly neutralizing HIV antibodies mediate potent SHIV protection in macaques
<p>The development of an effective AIDS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e has been challenging because of viral genetic diversity and the difficulty of generating broadly neutralizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es (bnAbs). We engineered trispecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es (Abs) that allow a single molecule to interact with three independent HIV-1 envelope determinants: the CD4 binding site, the membrane-proximal external region (MPER), and the V1V2 glycan site. Trispecific Abs exhibited higher potency and breadth than any previously described single bnAb, showed pharmacokinetics similar to those of human bnAbs, and conferred complete immunity against a mixture of simian-human immunodeficiency viruses (SHIVs) in nonhuman primates, in contrast to single bnAbs. Trispecific Abs thus constitute a platform to engage multiple therapeutic targets through a single protein, and they may be applicable for treatment of diverse diseases, including infections, cancer, and autoimmunity.</p>

India resurrects forgotten leprosy vaccine
<p>India is launching a new assault against an age-old scourge: leprosy. Its weapon is a moderately effective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e created in the early 1990s and then shelved when drug treatment proved successful. Introduction of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e, which contains a killed mycobacterium—a distant relative of the leprosy organism—began early last month in the state of Gujarat in western India, and it will soon be deployed in Bihar state, in the east. The goal is to break the chain of transmission of the debilitating disease, which stubbornly persists in India despite the availability of a drug regimen that can cure it. But some critics, citing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e's modest efficacy in early trials, see it as a costly distraction from the more urgent task of identifying and treating cases as early as possible.</p>

Enhancement of Zika virus pathogenesis by preexisting antiflavivirus immunity
<p>Zika virus (ZIKV) is spreading rapidly into regions around the world where other flaviviruses, such as dengue virus (DENV) and West Nile virus (WNV), are endemic. Antibody-dependent enhancement has been implicated in more severe forms of flavivirus disease, but whether this also applies to ZIKV infection is unclear. Using convalescent plasma from DENV- and WNV-infected individuals, we found substantial enhancement of ZIKV infection in vitro that was mediated through immunoglobulin G engagement of Fcγ receptors. Administration of DENV- or WNV-convalescent plasma into ZIKV-susceptible mice resulted in increased morbidity—including fever, viremia, and viral loads in spinal cord and testes—and increased mortality. Antibody-dependent enhancement may explain the severe disease manifestations associated with recent ZIKV outbreaks and highlights the need to exert great caution when designing flavivirus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es.</p>

Differential radial growth patterns between beech (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i> L.) and oak (<i>Quercus robur</i> L.) on periodically waterlogged soils
<p>Climate scenarios for northern Central Europe project rising temperatures and increasing frequency and intensity of droughts but also a shift in precipitation pattern with more humid winters. This in turn may result in soil waterlogging during the following spring, leading to increasing stress for trees growing on hydric sites. The influence of waterlogging on growth of common beech and pedunculate oak has been studied intensively on seedlings under experimental conditions. However, the question remains whether results of these studies can be transferred to mature trees growing under natural conditions. To test this, we investigated general growth patterns and climate–growth relationships in four mature stands of beech and oak growing on hydromorphic soils (Stagnosols) in northeast Germany using dendro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chronolog</span></strong>ical methods. Our results confirmed the expected tolerance of oak to strong water-level fluctuations. Neither extremely wet conditions during spring nor summer droughts significantly affected its radial growth. Oak growth responded positively to warmer temperatures during previous year October and March of the current year of ring formation. Contrary to our expectations, also beech showed relatively low sensitivity to periods of high soil water saturation. Instead, summer drought turned out to be the main climatic factor influencing ring width of beech even under the specific periodically wet soil conditions of our study. This became evident from general climate–growth correlations over the last century as well as from discontinuous (pointer year) analysis with summer drought being significantly correlated to the occurrence of growth depressions. As ring width of the two species is affected by differing climate parameters, species-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chronolog</span></strong>ies show no coherence in high-frequency variations even for trees growing in close proximity. We assume differences in rooting depth as the main reason for the differing growth patterns and climate correlations of the two species under study. Our results indicate that under the projected future climate scenarios, beech may suffer from increasing drought stress even on hydromorphic soils. Oak might be able to maintain a sufficient hydraulic status during summer droughts by reaching water in deeper soil strata with its root system. Wet phases with waterlogged soil conditions during spring or summer appear to have only a little direct influence on radial growth of both species.</p>

Chronology of the Acheulean to Middle Stone Age transition in eastern Africa
<p>The origin of the Middle Stone Age (MSA) marks the transition from a highly persistent mode of stone toolmaking, the Acheulean, to a period of increasing technological innovation and cultural indicators associated with the evolution of <i>Homo sapiens</i>. We used argon-40/argon-39 and uranium-series dating to calibrate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chronolog</span></strong>y of Acheulean and early MSA artifact–rich sedimentary deposits in the Olorgesailie basin, southern Kenya rift. We determined the age of late Acheulean tool assemblages from 615,000 to 499,000 years ago, after which a large technological and faunal transition occurred, with a definitive MSA lacking Acheulean elements beginning most likely by ~320,000 years ago, but at least by 305,000 years ago. These results establish the oldest repository of MSA artifacts in eastern Africa.</p>

Permanent human occupation of the central Tibetan Plateau in the early Holocene
<p>Current models of the peopling of the higher-elevation zones of the Tibetan Plateau postulate that permanent occupation could only have been facilitated by an agricultural lifeway at ~3.6 thousand calibrated carbon-14 years before present. Here we report a reanalysis of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chronolog</span></strong>y of the Chusang site, located on the central Tibetan Plateau at an elevation of ~4270 meters above sea level. The minimum age of the site is fixed at ~7.4 thousand years (thorium-230/uranium dating), with a maximum age between ~8.20 and 12.67 thousand calibrated carbon-14 years before present (carbon-14 assays). Travel cost modeling and archaeological data suggest that the site was part of an annual, permanent, preagricultural occupation of the central plateau. These findings challenge current models of the occupation of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>

Transcriptional Roadmap to Seasonal Variation in Wood Formation of Norway Spruce
<p>Seasonal cues influence several aspects of the secondary growth of tree stems, including cambial activity, wood chemistry, and transition to latewood formation. We investigated seasonal changes in cambial activity, secondary cell wall formation, and tracheid cell death in woody tissues of Norway spruce (<i>Picea abies</i>) throughout one seasonal cycle. RNA sequencing was performed simultaneously in both the xylem and cambium/phloem tissues of the stem. Principal component analysis revealed gradual shifts in the transcriptomes that followed a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chronolog</span></strong>ical order throughout the season. A notable remodeling of the transcriptome was observed in the winter, with many genes having maximal expression during the coldest months of the year. A highly coexpressed set of monolignol biosynthesis genes showed high expression during the period of secondary cell wall formation as well as a second peak in midwinter. This midwinter peak in expression did not trigger lignin deposition, as determined by pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Coexpression consensus network analyses suggested the involvement of transcription factors belonging to the ASYMMETRIC LEAVES2/LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES and MYELOBLASTOSIS-HOMEOBOX families in the seasonal control of secondary cell wall formation of tracheids. Interestingly, the lifetime of the latewood tracheids stretched beyond the winter dormancy period, correlating with a lack of cell death-related gene expression. Our transcriptomic analyses combined with phylogenetic and microscopic analyses also identified the cellulose and lignin biosynthetic genes and putative regulators for latewood formation and tracheid cell death in Norway spruce, providing a toolbox for further physiological and functional assays of these important phase transitions.</p>

Practice patterns in the care of acute Achilles tendon ruptures
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To determine whether the findings from a landmark Canadian trial   assessing the optimal management of acute rupture of the Achilles   tendon influenced the practice patterns of orthopaedic surgeons   in Ontario, Canada.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Health administrative databases were used to identify Ontario   residents ≥ 18 years of age with an Achilles tendon rupture from   April 2002 to March 2014. The rate of surgical repair (per 100 cases)   was calculated for each calendar quarter. A time-series analysis   was used to determine whether changes in the rate were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chronolog</span></strong>ically   related to the dissemination of results from a landmark trial published   in February 2009. Non-linear spline regression was then used independently   to identify critical time-points of change in the surgical repair   rate to confirm the findings.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 29 531 patients sustained an Achilles tendon rupture   during the study period. Consistently, around 21 out of every 100   cases underwent surgical repair up to the first quarter of 2010.   However, by the first quarter of 2014, only 6.5 cases per 100 had   surgery. A statistically significant decrease in the rate of surgical   repair was observed within one year of the presentation of landmark   trial results in 2009 (p < 0.001). July 2009 was independently identified   as a critical time at which the surgical repair rate began to significantly   decline (p < 0.001). The dissemination of trial results was associated   with a significant drop in the rate of surgical repair at non-teaching   hospitals (p = 0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The current study demonstrates that large, well-designed randomised   trials, have the potential to encourage significant changes in the   practice patterns of orthopaedic surgeons. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1629–36.</p></sec>

The use of the distal radius and ulna classification for the prediction of growth
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We report the use of the distal radius and ulna (DRU) classification   for the prediction of peak growth (PG) and growth cessation (GC)   in 777 patients with idiopathic scoliosis. We compare this classification   with other commonly used parameters of maturity.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The following data were extracted from the patients’ records   and radiographs: <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chronolog</span></strong>ical age, body height (BH), arm span (AS),   date of menarche, Risser sign, DRU grade and status of the phalangeal   and metacarpal physes. The mean rates of growth were recorded according   to each parameter of maturity. PG was defined as the summit of the curve   and GC as the plateau in deceleration of growth. The rates of growth   at PG and GC were used for analysis using receiver operating characteristic   (ROC) curves to determine the strength and cutoff values of the   parameters of growth.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The most specific grades for PG using the DRU classification   were radial grade 6 and ulnar grade 5, and for GC were radial grade   9 and ulnar grade 7. The DRU classification spanned both PG and   GC, enabling better prediction of these clinically relevant stages   than other methods. The rate of PG (≥ 0.7 cm/month) and GC (≤ 0.15   cm/month) was the same for girls and boys, in BH and AS measurements.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This is the first study to note that the DRU classification can   predict both PG and GC, providing evidence that it may aid the management   of patients with idiopathic scoliosis.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2016;98-B:1689–96.</p></sec>

Non-invasive long-term fluorescence live imaging of <i>Tribolium castaneum</i> embryos
<p>Insect development has contributed significantly to our understanding of metazoan development. However, most information has been obtained by analyzing a single species, the fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Embryonic development of the red flour beetle <i>Tribolium castaneum</i> differs fundamentally from that of <i>Drosophila</i> in aspects such as short-germ development, embryonic leg development, extensive extra-embryonic membrane formation and non-involuted head development. Although <i>Tribolium</i> has become the second most important insect model organism, previous live imaging attempts have addressed only specific questions and no long-term live imaging data of <i>Tribolium</i> embryogenesis have been available. By combining light sheet-based fluorescence microscopy with a novel mounting method, we achieved complete, continuous and non-invasive fluorescence live imaging of <i>Tribolium</i> embryogenesis at high spatiotemporal resolution. The embryos survived the 2-day or longer imaging process, developed into adults and produced fertile progeny. Our data document all morphogenetic processes from the rearrangement of the uniform blastoderm to the onset of regular muscular movement in the same embryo and in four orientations, contributing significantly to the understanding of <i>Tribolium</i> development. Furthermore, we created a comprehensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chronolog</span></strong>ical table of <i>Tribolium</i> embryogenesis, integrating most previous work and providing a reference for future studies. Based on our observations, we provide evidence that serosa window closure and serosa opening, although deferred by more than 1 day, are linked. All our long-term imaging datasets are available as a resource for the community. <i>Tribolium</i> is only the second insect species, after <i>Drosophila</i>, for which non-invasive long-term fluorescence live imaging has been achieved.</p>

Random heteropolymers preserve protein function in foreign environments
<p>The successful incorporation of active proteins into synthetic polymers could lead to a new class of materials with functions found only in living systems. However, proteins rarely function under the conditions suitable for polymer processing. On the basis of an analysis of trends in protein sequences and characteristic chemical patterns on protein surfaces, we designed four-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>er random heteropolymers to mimic intrinsically disordered proteins for protein solubilization and stabilization in non-native environments. The heteropolymers, with optimized composition and statistical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>er distribution, enable cell-free synthesis of membrane proteins with proper protein folding for transport and enzyme-containing plastics for toxin bioremediation. Controlling the statistical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>er distribution in a heteropolymer, rather than the specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>er sequence, affords a new strategy to interface with biological systems for protein-based biomaterials.</p>

Probing Exchange Pathways in One-Dimensional Aggregates with Super-Resolution Microscopy
<sec><title>Examining Supramolecular Exchange</title><p>Microtubules are a natural example of a one-dimensional (1D) supramolecular structure. Synthetic examples of 1D fibrils often have <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>ers linked by weak noncovalent interactions that allow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>ers to exchange in and out of the fibrils. <bold>Albertazzi <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 491) used a combination of super-resolution microscopy on individual fibrils and stochastic simulation to study <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>er exchange in fibrils formed from stacked 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxamide motifs. Exchange did not require large-scale depolymerization and repolymerization, or reassembly of fragments, but proceeded through individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>ers exchanging homogeneously throughout the fibrils.</p></sec>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Hydroxystilbenes Are Monomers in Palm Fruit Endocarp Lignins
<p>Lignin, the plant cell wall polymer that binds fibers together but makes processing difficult, is traditionally formed from three <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>ers, the so-called monolignols (<i>p</i>-coumaryl, coniferyl, and sinapyl alcohols). Recently, we discovered, in grass lignins, a phenolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>er that falls outside the canonical lignin biosynthetic pathway, the flavone tricin. As we show here, palm fruit (macaéíéííéíúba [<i>Acrocomia aculeata</i>], carnauba [<i>Copernicia prunifera</i>], and coconut [<i>Cocos nucifera</i>]) endocarps contain lignin polymers derived in part from a previously unconsidered class of lignin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>ers, the hydroxystilbenes, including the valuable compounds piceatannol and resveratrol. Piceatannol could be released from these lignins upon derivatization followed by reductive cleavage, a degradative method that cleaves β-ether bonds, indicating that at least a fraction is incorporated through labile ether bonds. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of products from the copolymerization of piceatannol and monolignols confirms the structures in the natural polymer and demonstrates that piceatannol acts as an authentic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>er participating in coupling and cross-coupling reactions during lignification. Therefore, palm fruit endocarps contain a new class of stilbenolignin polymers, further expanding the definition of lignin and implying that compounds such as piceatannol and resveratrol are potentially available in what is now essentially a waste product.</p>

The Acyl Desaturase CER17 Is Involved in Producing Wax Unsaturated Primary Alcohols and Cutin Monomers
<p>We report <i>n</i>-6 monounsaturated primary alcohols (C<sub>26:1</sub>, C<sub>28:1</sub>, and C<sub>30:1</sub> homologs) in the cuticular waxes of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) inflorescence stem, a class of wax not previously reported in Arabidopsis. The Arabidopsis <i>cer17</i> mutant was completely deficient in these monounsaturated alcohols, and <i>CER17</i> was found to encode a predicted ACYL-COENZYME A DESATURASE LIKE4 (ADS4). Studies of the Arabidopsis <i>cer4</i> mutant and yeast variously expressing <i>CER4</i> (a predicted fatty acyl-CoA reductase) with <i>CER17/ADS4</i>, demonstrated <i>CER4</i>’s principal role in synthesis of these monounsaturated alcohols. Besides unsaturated alcohol deficiency, <i>cer17</i> mutants exhibited a thickened and irregular cuticle ultrastructure and increased amounts of cutin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>ers. Although unsaturated alcohols were absent throughout the <i>cer17</i> stem, the mutation’s effects on cutin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>ers and cuticle ultrastructure were much more severe in distal than basal stems, consistent with observations that the <i>CER17/ADS4</i> transcript was much more abundant in distal than basal stems. Furthermore, distal but not basal stems of a double mutant deficient for both CER17/ADS4 and LONG-CHAIN ACYL-COA SYNTHETASE1 produced even more cutin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>ers and a thicker and more disorganized cuticle ultrastructure and higher cuticle permeability than observed for wild type or either mutant parent, indicating a dramatic genetic interaction on conversion of very long chain acyl-CoA precursors. These results provide evidence that CER17/ADS4 performs <i>n</i>-6 desaturation of very long chain acyl-CoAs in both distal and basal stems and has a major function associated with governing cutin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>er amounts primarily in the distal segments of the inflorescence stem.</p>

Seeded growth of single-crystal two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks
<p>Polymerization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>ers into periodic two-dimensional networks provides structurally precise, layered macromolecular sheets that exhibit desirable mechanical, optoelectronic, and molecular transport properties. Two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) offer broad <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>er scope but are generally isolated as powders comprising aggregated nanometer-scale crystallites. We found that 2D COF formation could be controlled using a two-step procedure in which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>ers are added slowly to preformed nanoparticle seeds. The resulting 2D COFs are isolated as single-crystalline, micrometer-sized particles. Transient absorption spectroscopy of the dispersed COF nanoparticles revealed improvement in signal quality by two to three orders of magnitude relative to polycrystalline powder samples, and suggests exciton diffusion over longer length scales than those obtained through previous approaches. These findings should enable a broad exploration of synthetic 2D polymer structures and properties.</p>

Templated nanofiber synthesis via chemical vapor polymerization into liquid crystalline films
<p>Extrusion, electrospinning, and microdrawing are widely used to create fibrous polymer mats, but these approaches offer limited access to oriented arrays of nanometer-scale fibers with controlled size, shape, and lateral organization. We show that chemical vapor polymerization can be performed on surfaces coated with thin films of liquid crystals to synthesize organized assemblies of end-attached polymer nanofibers. The process uses low concentrations of radical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>ers formed initially in the vapor phase and then diffused into the liquid-crystal template. This minimizes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>er-induced changes to the liquid-crystal phase and enables access to nanofiber arrays with complex yet precisely defined structures and compositions. The nanofiber arrays permit tailoring of a wide range of functional properties, including adhesion that depends on nanofiber chirality.</p>

De novo design of self-assembling helical protein filaments
<p>We describe a general computational approach to designing self-assembling helical filaments from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>eric proteins and use this approach to design proteins that assemble into micrometer-scale filaments with a wide range of geometries in vivo and in vitro. Cryo–electron microscopy structures of six designs are close to the computational design models. The filament building blocks are idealized repeat proteins, and thus the diameter of the filaments can be systematically tuned by varying the number of repeat units. The assembly and disassembly of the filaments can be controlled by engineered anchor and capping units built from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>ers lacking one of the interaction surfaces. The ability to generate dynamic, highly ordered structures that span micrometers from protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>ers opens up possibilities for the fabrication of new multiscale metamaterials.</p>

3D printed polyamide membranes for desalination
<p>Polyamide thickness and roughness have been identified as critical properties that affect thin-film composite membrane performance for reverse osmosis. Conventional formation methodologies lack the ability to control these properties independently with high resolution or precision. An additive approach is presented that uses electrospraying to deposit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>ers directly onto a substrate, where they react to form polyamide. The small droplet size coupled with low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>er concentrations result in polyamide films that are smoother and thinner than conventional polyamides, while the additive nature of the approach allows for control of thickness and roughness. Polyamide films are formed with a thickness that is controllable down to 4-nanometer increments and a roughness as low as 2 nanometers while still exhibiting good permselectivity relative to a commercial benchmarking membrane.</p>

A synthetic polymer system with repeatable chemical recyclability
<p>The development of chemically recyclable polymers offers a solution to the end-of-use issue of polymeric materials and provides a closed-loop approach toward a circular materials economy. However, polymers that can be easily and selectively depolymerized back to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>ers typically require low-temperature polymerization methods and also lack physical properties and mechanical strengths required for practical uses. We introduce a polymer system based on γ-butyrolactone (GBL) with a trans-ring fusion at the α and β positions. Such trans-ring fusion renders the commonly considered as nonpolymerizable GBL ring readily polymerizable at room temperature under solvent-free conditions to yield a high–molecular weight polymer. The polymer has enhanced thermostability and can be repeatedly and quantitatively recycled back to its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>er by thermolysis or chemolysis. Mixing of the two enantiomers of the polymer generates a highly crystalline supramolecular stereocomplex.</p>

Formaldehyde stabilization facilitates lignin monomer production during biomass depolymerization
<p>Practical, high-yield lignin depolymerization methods could greatly increase biorefinery productivity and profitability. However, development of these methods is limited by the presence of interunit carbon-carbon bonds within native lignin, and further by formation of such linkages during lignin extraction. We report that adding formaldehyde during biomass pretreatment produces a soluble lignin fraction that can be converted to guaiacyl and syringyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>ers at near theoretical yields during subsequent hydrogenolysis (47 mole % of Klason lignin for beech and 78 mole % for a high-syringyl transgenic poplar). These yields were three to seven times those obtained without formaldehyde, which prevented lignin condensation by forming 1,3-dioxane structures with lignin side-chain hydroxyl groups. By depolymerizing cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin separately, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>er yields were between 76 and 90 mole % for these three major biomass fractions.</p>

Connecting the Molecular Structure of Cutin to Ultrastructure and Physical Properties of the Cuticle in Petals of Arabidopsis
<p>The plant cuticle is laid down at the cell wall surface of epidermal cells in a wide variety of structures, but the functional significance of this architectural diversity is not yet understood. Here, the structure-function relationship of the petal cuticle of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) was investigated. Applying Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy, the cutin mutants <i>long-chain acyl-coenzyme A synthetase2</i> (<i>lacs2</i>), <i>permeable cuticle1 (pec1)</i>, <i>cyp77a6</i>, <i>glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase6</i> (<i>gpat6</i>), and <i>defective in cuticular ridges</i> (<i>dcr</i>) were grouped in three separate classes based on quantitative differences in the ν(C=O) and ν(C-H) band vibrations. These were associated mainly with the quantity of 10,16-dihydroxy hexadecanoic acid, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>er of the cuticle polyester, cutin. These spectral features were linked to three different types of cuticle organization: a normal cuticle with nanoridges (<i>lacs2</i> and <i>pec1</i> mutants); a broad translucent cuticle (<i>cyp77a6</i> and <i>dcr</i> mutants); and an electron-opaque multilayered cuticle (<i>gpat6</i> mutant). The latter two types did not have typical nanoridges. Transmission electron microscopy revealed considerable variations in cuticle thickness in the <i>dcr</i> mutant. Different double mutant combinations showed that a low amount of C16 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>ers in cutin leads to the appearance of an electron-translucent layer adjacent to the cuticle proper, which is independent of DCR action. We concluded that DCR is not only essential for incorporating 10,16-dihydroxy C16:0 into cutin but also plays a crucial role in the organization of the cuticle, independent of cutin composition. Further characterization of the mutant petals suggested that nanoridge formation and conical cell shape may contribute to the reduction of physical adhesion forces between petals and other floral organs during floral development.</p>

Chemical responses to modified lignin composition in tension wood of hybrid poplar (<i>Populus tremula × Populus alba</i>)
<p>The effect of altering the expression level of the <i>F5H</i> gene was investigated in three wood tissues (normal, opposite and tension wood) in 1-year-old hybrid poplar clone 717 (<i>Populus tremula × Populus alba</i> L.), containing the <i>F5H</i> gene under the control of the <i>C4H</i> promoter. Elevated expression of the <i>F5H</i> gene in poplar has been previously reported to increase the percent syringyl content of lignin. The wild-type and three transgenic lines were inclined 45° for 3 months to induce tension wood formation. Tension and opposite wood from inclined trees, along with normal wood from control trees, were analyzed separately for carbohydrates, lignin, cellulose crystallinity and microfibril angle (MFA). In the wild-type poplar, the lignin in tension wood contained a significantly higher percentage of syringyl than normal wood or opposite wood. However, there was no significant difference in the percent syringyl content of the three wood types within each of the transgenic lines. Increasing the <i>F5H</i> gene expression caused an increase in the percent syringyl content and a slight decrease in the total lignin in normal wood. In tension wood, the addition of a gelatinous layer in the fiber walls resulted in a consistently lower percentage of total lignin in the tissue. Acid-soluble lignin was observed to increase by up to 2.3-fold in the transgenic lines. Compared with normal wood and opposite wood, cell wall crystallinity in tension wood was higher and the MFA was smaller, as expected, with no evidence of an effect from modifying the syringyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>er ratio. Tension wood in all the lines contained consistently higher total sugar and glucose percentages when compared with normal wood within the respective lines. However, both sugar and glucose percentages were lower in the tension wood of transgenic lines when compared with the tension wood of wild-type trees. Evaluating the response of trees with altered syringyl content to gravity will improve our understanding of the changes in cell wall chemistry and ultrastructural properties of normal, opposite and tension wood in plants.</p>

The receptor tyrosine kinase TrkB signals without dimerization at the plasma membrane
<p>Tropomyosin-related tyrosine kinase B (TrkB) is the receptor for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and provides critical signaling that supports the development and function of the mammalian nervous system. Like other receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), TrkB is thought to signal as a dimer. Using cell imaging and biochemical assays, we found that TrkB acted as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>eric receptor at the plasma membrane regardless of its binding to BDNF and initial activation. Dimerization occurred only after the internalization and accumulation of TrkB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>ers within BDNF-containing endosomes. We further showed that dynamin-mediated endocytosis of TrkB-BDNF was required for the effective activation of the kinase AKT but not of the kinase ERK1/2. Thus, we report a previously uncharacterized mode of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>eric signaling for an RTK and a specific role for the endosome in TrkB homodimerization.</p>

Genome-wide identification and characterization of Notch transcription complex–binding sequence-paired sites in leukemia cells

SPSs are conserved and have been linked to the Notch responsiveness of a few genes. To assess the overall contribution of SPSs to Notch-dependent gene regulation, we determined the DNA sequence requirements for NTC dimerization using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay and applied insights from these in vitro studies to Notch-“addicted” T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells. We found that SPSs contributed to the regulation of about a third of direct Notch target genes. Although originally described in promoters, SPSs are present mainly in long-range enhancers, including an enhancer containing a newly described SPS that regulates <i>HES5</i> expression. Our work provides a general method for identifying SPSs in genome-wide data sets and highlights the widespread role of NTC dimerization in Notch-transformed leukemia cells.</p>

Catalyst-controlled stereoselective cationic polymerization of vinyl ethers

We demonstrate that this method is general to vinyl ether substrates, providing access to a range of isotactic poly(vinyl ether)s with high degrees of isotacticity. The obtained materials display the tensile properties of commercial polyolefins but adhere more strongly to polar substrates by an order of magnitude, indicating their promise for next-generation engineering applications.</p>

Mechanoresponsive self-growing hydrogels inspired by muscle training
<p>Living tissues, such as muscle, autonomously grow and remodel themselves to adapt to their surrounding mechanical environment through metabolic processes.

Robust double-network hydrogels provided with a sustained <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>er supply undergo self-growth, and the materials are substantially strengthened under repetitive loading through a structural destruction-reconstruction process. This strategy also endows the hydrogels with tailored functions at desired positions by mechanical stamping.

Nematic-to-columnar mesophase transition by in situ supramolecular polymerization
<p>Disk- and rod-shaped molecules are incompatible in coassembly, as the former tend to stack one-dimensionally whereas the latter tend to align in parallel.

We report that supramolecular polymerization of a disk-shaped chiral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>er in nematic liquid crystals comprising rod-shaped molecules results in order-increasing mesophase transition into a single mesophase with a core-shell columnar geometry. This liquid crystalline material responds quickly to an applied electric field, resulting in unidirectional columnar ordering. Moreover, it can be modularly customized to be optoelectrically responsive simply by using a photoisomerizable rod-shaped module. The modular strategy allows for cooperative integration of different functions into elaborate dynamic architectures.</p>

Exploring cytoskeletal diversity in neurons
<p>Often in biology, form follows function. For example, the ability of neurons to receive, process, and transmit information depends on their polarized organization into axons and dendrites. The cytoskeleton and associated motor proteins shape cells and establish spatial organization. Microtubules (MTs) and actin are core components of the cytoskeleton and are assembled through head-to-tail polymerization of α- and β-tubulin heterodimers and actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>ers, respectively, resulting in asymmetric, polarized polymers with two different ends, called plus and minus ends. The spatially regulated polymerization of MTs and actin can drive morphological transitions, such as local protrusion of the plasma membrane, to drive cell migration or the development of specialized extensions, such as axons or dendrites and their branches. In addition, the structural asymmetry of MTs and actin enables cytoskeletal motor proteins (myosin, kinesin, and dynein) to walk toward a specific end of the fibers. Given the extreme dimensions and functional compartmentalization of neurons, such active transport is critical to sort and distribute cellular cargoes. Recent studies have used advanced microscopy to reveal how the cytoskeleton takes many different forms to facilitate local functions in neurons (see the figure).</p>

Structural principles that enable oligomeric small heat-shock protein paralogs to evolve distinct functions
<p>Oligomeric proteins assemble with exceptional selectivity, even in the presence of closely related proteins, to perform their cellular roles. We show that most proteins related by gene duplication of an oligomeric ancestor have evolved to avoid hetero-oligomerization and that this correlates with their acquisition of distinct functions. We report how coassembly is avoided by two oligomeric small heat-shock protein paralogs. A hierarchy of assembly, involving intermediates that are populated only fleetingly at equilibrium, ensures selective oligomerization. Conformational flexibility at noninterfacial regions in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>ers prevents coassembly, allowing interfaces to remain largely conserved. Homomeric oligomers must overcome the entropic benefit of coassembly and, accordingly, homomeric paralogs comprise fewer subunits than homomers that have no paralogs.</p>

Single polymer growth dynamics

Using magnetic tweezers, we visualized real-time polymer growth at the single-polymer level.

These steps are attributable to the formation and unraveling of conformational entanglements from newly incorporated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>ers, whose key features can be recapitulated with molecular dynamics simulations. The configurations of these entanglements appear to play a key role in determining the polymerization rates and the dispersion among individual polymers.</p>

Here we present the crystal structure of the trimeric, prefusion ectodomain of Lassa GP bound to a neutralizing antibody from a human survivor at 3.2-angstrom resolution. The antibody extensively anchors two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>ers together at the base of the trimer, and biochemical analysis suggests that it neutralizes by inhibiting conformational changes required for entry. This work illuminates pH-driven conformational changes in both receptor-binding and fusion subunits of Lassa virus, illustrates the unique assembly of the arenavirus glycoprotein spike, and provides a much-needed template for vaccine design against these threats to global health.</p>

Pathological α-synuclein transmission initiated by binding lymphocyte-activation gene 3
<p>Emerging evidence indicates that the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD) may be due to cell-to-cell transmission of misfolded preformed fibrils (PFF) of α-synuclein (α-syn). The mechanism by which α-syn PFF spreads from neuron to neuron is not known. Here, we show that LAG3 (lymphocyte-activation gene 3) binds α-syn PFF with high affinity (dissociation constant = 77 nanomolar), whereas the α-syn <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>er exhibited minimal binding. α-Syn-biotin PFF binding to LAG3 initiated α-syn PFF endocytosis, transmission, and toxicity. Lack of LAG3 substantially delayed α-syn PFF–induced loss of dopamine neurons, as well as biochemical and behavioral deficits in vivo. The identification of LAG3 as a receptor that binds α-syn PFF provides a target for developing therapeutics designed to slow the progression of PD and related α-synucleinopathies.</p>

A Multilevel Study of Melon Fruit Reticulation Provides Insight into Skin Ligno-Suberization Hallmarks
<p>The skin of fleshy fruit is typically covered by a thick cuticle. Some fruit species develop different forms of layers directly above their skin. Reticulation, for example, is a specialized suberin-based coating that ornaments some commercially important melon (<i>Cucumis melo</i>) fruit and is an important quality trait. Despite its importance, the structural, molecular, and biochemical features associated with reticulation are not fully understood. Here, we performed a multilevel investigation of structural attributes, chemical composition, and gene expression profiles on a set of reticulated and smooth skin melons. High-resolution microscopy, surface profiling, and histochemical staining assays show that reticulation comprises cells with heavily suberized walls accumulating large amounts of typical suberin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>ers, as well as lignified cells localized underneath the specialized suberized cell layer. Reticulated skin was characterized by induced expression of biosynthetic genes acting in the core phenylpropanoid, suberin, lignin, and lignan pathways. Transcripts of genes associated with lipid polymer assembly, cell wall organization, and loosening were highly enriched in reticulated skin tissue. These signatures were exclusive to reticulated structures and absent in both the smooth surfaces observed in between reticulated regions and in the skin of smooth fruit. Our data provide important insights into the molecular and metabolic bases of reticulation and its tight association with skin ligno-suberization during melon fruit development. Moreover, these insights are likely to contribute to melon breeding programs aimed at improving postharvest qualities associated with fleshy fruit surface layers.</p>

Perception of Sunflecks by the UV-B Photoreceptor UV RESISTANCE LOCUS8
<p>Sunflecks, transient patches of light that penetrate through gaps in the canopy and transiently interrupt shade, are eco-physiologically and agriculturally important sources of energy for carbon gain, but our molecular understanding of how plant organs perceive and respond to sunflecks through photoreceptors remains limited. The UV-B photoreceptor UV RESISTANCE LOCUS8 (UVR8) is a recent addition to the list of plant photosensory receptors, and we have made considerable advances in our understanding of the physiology and molecular mechanisms of action of UVR8 and its signaling pathway. However, the function of UVR8 in the natural environment is poorly understood. Here, we show that the UVR8 dimer/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>er ratio responds quantitatively and reversibly to the intensity of sunflecks that interrupt shade in the field. Sunflecks reduced hypocotyl growth and increased <i>CHALCONE SYNTHASE</i> (<i>CHS</i>) and <i>ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5</i> gene expression and CHS protein abundance in wild-type Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings, but the <i>uvr8</i> mutant was impaired in these responses. UVR8 was also required for normal nuclear dynamics of CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1. We propose that UVR8 plays an important role in the plant perception of and response to sunflecks.</p>

Oxidation of Translation Factor EF-Tu Inhibits the Repair of Photosystem II<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The repair of photosystem II (PSII) is particularly sensitive to oxidative stress and the inhibition of repair is associated with oxidative damage to the translational elongation system in the cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this inhibition are unknown. We previously demonstrated in vitro that EF-Tu, a translation factor that delivers aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosome, is inactivated by reactive oxygen species via oxidation of the Cys residue Cys-82. In this study, we examined the physiological role of the oxidation of EF-Tu in <i>Synechocystis</i>. Under strong light, EF-Tu was rapidly oxidized to yield oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>ers in vivo. We generated a <i>Synechocystis</i> transformant that expressed mutated EF-Tu in which Cys-82 had been replaced with a Ser residue. Under strong light, the de novo synthesis of proteins that are required for PSII repair, such as D1, was enhanced in the transformant and photoinhibition of PSII was alleviated. However, photodamage to PSII, measured in the presence of lincomycin, was similar between the transformant and wild-type cells, suggesting that expression of mutated EF-Tu might enhance the repair of PSII. Alleviating photoinhibition through mutation of EF-Tu did not alter cell growth under strong light, perhaps due to the enhanced production of reactive oxygen species. These observations suggest that the oxidation of EF-Tu under strong light inhibits PSII repair, resulting in the stimulation of photoinhibition.</p>

Arabidopsis β-Amylase2 Is a K<sup>+</sup>-Requiring, Catalytic Tetramer with Sigmoidal Kinetics
<p>The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) genome contains nine β-amylase (<i>BAM</i>) genes, some of which play important roles in starch hydrolysis. However, little is known about BAM2, a plastid-localized enzyme reported to have extremely low catalytic activity. Using conservation of intron positions, we determined that the nine Arabidopsis <i>BAM</i> genes fall into two distinct subfamilies. A similar pattern was found in each major lineage of land plants, suggesting that these subfamilies diverged prior to the origin of land plants. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis indicated that <i>BAM2</i> is the ancestral member of one of these subfamilies. This finding, along with the conservation of amino acids in the active site of BAM2, suggested that it might be catalytically active. We then identified KCl as necessary for BAM2 activity. Unlike BAM1, BAM3, and BAM5, three Arabidopsis BAMs that all exhibited hyperbolic kinetics, BAM2 exhibited sigmoidal kinetics with a Hill coefficient of over 3. Using multi-angle light scattering, we determined that BAM2 was a tetramer, whereas BAM5 was a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>er. Conserved residues from a diverse set of BAM2 orthologs were mapped onto a homology model of the protein, revealing a large, conserved surface away from the active site that we hypothesize is a secondary carbohydrate-binding site. Introduction of bulky methionine for glycine at two points on this surface reduced catalytic activity significantly without disrupting the tetrameric structure. Expression analysis indicated that BAM2 is more closely coexpressed with other starch degradation enzymes than any other BAM, suggesting that BAM2 may play an important role in starch degradation in plants.</p>

Flavan-3-ols Are an Effective Chemical Defense against Rust Infection
<p>Phenolic secondary metabolites are often thought to protect plants against attack by microbes, but their role in defense against pathogen infection in woody plants has not been investigated comprehensively. We studied the biosynthesis, occurrence, and antifungal activity of flavan-3-ols in black poplar (<i>Populus nigra</i>), which include both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>ers, such as catechin, and oligomers, known as proanthocyanidins (PAs). We identified and biochemically characterized three leucoanthocyanidin reductases and two anthocyanidin reductases from <i>P. nigra</i> involved in catalyzing the last steps of flavan-3-ol biosynthesis, leading to the formation of catechin [2,3-trans-(+)-flavan-3-ol] and epicatechin [2,3-cis-(−)-flavan-3-ol], respectively. Poplar trees that were inoculated with the biotrophic rust fungus (<i>Melampsora larici-populina</i>) accumulated higher amounts of catechin and PAs than uninfected trees. The de novo-synthesized catechin and PAs in the rust-infected poplar leaves accumulated significantly at the site of fungal infection in the lower epidermis. In planta concentrations of these compounds strongly inhibited rust spore germination and reduced hyphal growth. Poplar genotypes with constitutively higher levels of catechin and PAs as well as hybrid aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus alba</i>) overexpressing the <i>MYB134</i> transcription factor were more resistant to rust infection. Silencing <i>PnMYB134</i>, on the other hand, decreased flavan-3-ol biosynthesis and increased susceptibility to rust infection. Taken together, our data indicate that catechin and PAs are effective antifungal defenses in poplar against foliar rust infection.</p>

Paralogs of the C-Terminal Domain of the Cyanobacterial Orange Carotenoid Protein Are Carotenoid Donors to Helical Carotenoid Proteins
<p>The photoactive Orange Carotenoid Protein (OCP) photoprotects cyanobacteria cells by quenching singlet oxygen and excess excitation energy. Its N-terminal domain is the active part of the protein, and the C-terminal domain regulates the activity. Recently, the characteristics of a family of soluble carotenoid-binding proteins (Helical Carotenoid Proteins [HCPs]), paralogs of the N-terminal domain of OCP, were described. Bioinformatics studies also revealed the existence of genes coding for homologs of CTD. Here, we show that the latter genes encode carotenoid proteins (CTDHs). This family of proteins contains two subgroups with distinct characteristics. One CTDH of each clade was further characterized, and they proved to be very good singlet oxygen quenchers. When synthesized in <i>Escherichia coli</i> or <i>Synechocystis</i> PCC 6803, CTDHs formed dimers that share a carotenoid molecule and are able to transfer their carotenoid to apo-HCPs and apo-OCP. The CTDHs from clade 2 have a cysteine in position 103. A disulfide bond is easily formed between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>ers of the dimer preventing carotenoid transfer. This suggests that the transfer of the carotenoid could be redox regulated in clade 2 CTDH. We also demonstrate here that apo-OCPs and apo-CTDHs are able to take the carotenoid directly from membranes, while HCPs are unable to do so. HCPs need the presence of CTDH to become holo-proteins. We propose that, in cyanobacteria, the CTDHs are carotenoid donors to HCPs.</p>

Disrupting Flavone Synthase II Alters Lignin and Improves Biomass Digestibility
<p>Lignin, a ubiquitous phenylpropanoid polymer in vascular plant cell walls, is derived primarily from oxidative couplings of monolignols (<i>p</i>-hydroxycinnamyl alcohols). It was discovered recently that a wide range of grasses, including cereals, utilize a member of the flavonoids, tricin (3′,5′-dimethoxyflavone), as a natural co<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>er with monolignols for cell wall lignification. Previously, we established that cytochrome P450 93G1 is a flavone synthase II (OsFNSII) indispensable for the biosynthesis of soluble tricin-derived metabolites in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). Here, our tricin-deficient <i>fnsII</i> mutant was analyzed further with an emphasis on its cell wall structure and properties. The mutant is similar in growth to wild-type control plants with normal vascular morphology. Chemical and nuclear magnetic resonance structural analyses demonstrated that the mutant lignin is completely devoid of tricin, indicating that FNSII activity is essential for the deposition of tricin-bound lignin in rice cell walls. The mutant also showed substantially reduced lignin content with decreased syringyl/guaiacyl lignin unit composition. Interestingly, the loss of tricin in the mutant lignin appears to be partially compensated by incorporating naringenin, which is a preferred substrate of OsFNSII. The <i>fnsII</i> mutant was further revealed to have enhanced enzymatic saccharification efficiency, suggesting that the cell wall recalcitrance of grass biomass may be reduced through the manipulation of the flavonoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>er supply for lignification.</p>

9-cis-Neoxanthin in Light Harvesting Complexes of Photosystem II Regulates the Binding of Violaxanthin and Xanthophyll Cycle
<p>The light-harvesting chlorophyll <i>a/b</i> complex of photosystem II (LHCII) is able to switch to multiple functions under different light conditions (i.e. harvesting solar energy for photosynthesis and dissipating excess excitation energy for photoprotection). The role of the different carotenoids bound to LHCII in regulating the structure and function of the complex is a long-lasting question in photosynthesis research. 9-cis-Neoxanthin (Nx) is one of the important carotenoids, which can only be found in the LHCIIs. High-resolution structural analysis of LHCII shows that Nx is located between different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>eric LHCIIs, with one side protruding into the lipid membrane. In this study, the various functional significances of this unique feature of Nx binding in LHCII are studied with the in vitro reconstituted LHCIIs both with and without Nx and the native complexes isolated either from wild-type Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) or from its mutant <i>aba4-3</i> lacking Nx. Our results reveal that the binding of Nx affects the binding affinity of violaxanthin (Vx) to LHCII significantly. In the absence of Nx, Vx has a much higher binding affinity to trimeric LHCII. The strong coordination between Nx and Vx at the interfaces of adjacent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>ers of LHCII plays an important role both in operating the xanthophyll cycle and in the transient modulation of nonphotochemical quenching.</p>

Chloroplast Preproteins Bind to the Dimer Interface of the Toc159 Receptor during Import
<p>Most chloroplast proteins are synthesized in the cytosol as higher molecular weight preproteins and imported via the translocons in the outer (TOC) and inner (TIC) envelope membranes of chloroplasts. Toc159 functions as a primary receptor and directly binds preproteins through its dimeric GTPase domain. As a first step toward a molecular understanding of how Toc159 mediates preprotein import, we mapped the preprotein-binding regions on the Toc159 GTPase domain (Toc159G) of pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) using cleavage by bound preproteins conjugated with the artificial protease FeBABE and cysteine-cysteine cross-linking. Our results show that residues at the dimer interface and the switch II region of Toc159G are in close proximity to preproteins. The mature portion of preproteins was observed preferentially at the dimer interface, whereas the transit peptide was found at both regions equally. Chloroplasts from transgenic plants expressing engineered Toc159 with a cysteine placed at the dimer interface showed increased cross-linking to bound preproteins. Our data suggest that, during preprotein import, the Toc159G dimer disengages and the dimer interface contacts translocating preproteins, which is consistent with a model in which conformational changes induced by dimer-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>er conversion in Toc159 play a direct role in facilitating preprotein import.</p>

IRREGULAR POLLEN EXINE1 Is a Novel Factor in Anther Cuticle and Pollen Exine Formation
<p>Anther cuticle and pollen exine are protective barriers for pollen development and fertilization. Despite that several regulators have been identified for anther cuticle and pollen exine development in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) and Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), few genes have been characterized in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) and the underlying regulatory mechanism remains elusive. Here, we report a novel male-sterile mutant in maize, <i>irregular pollen exine1</i> (<i>ipe1</i>), which exhibited a glossy outer anther surface, abnormal Ubisch bodies, and defective pollen exine. Using map-based cloning, the <i>IPE1</i> gene was isolated as a putative glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum. Transcripts of <i>IPE1</i> were preferentially accumulated in the tapetum during the tetrad and early uninucleate microspore stage. A biochemical assay indicated that <i>ipe1</i> anthers had altered constituents of wax and a significant reduction of cutin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>ers and fatty acids. RNA sequencing data revealed that genes implicated in wax and flavonoid metabolism, fatty acid synthesis, and elongation were differentially expressed in <i>ipe1</i> mutant anthers. In addition, the analysis of transfer DNA insertional lines of the orthologous gene in Arabidopsis suggested that IPE1 and their orthologs have a partially conserved function in male organ development. Our results showed that IPE1 participates in the putative oxidative pathway of C16/C18 ω-hydroxy fatty acids and controls anther cuticle and pollen exine development together with MALE STERILITY26 and MALE STERILITY45 in maize.</p>

Dirigent Protein Mode of Action Revealed by the Crystal Structure of AtDIR6
<p>Dirigent proteins impart stereoselectivity to phenoxy radical coupling reactions in plants and, thus, play an essential role in the biosynthesis of biologically active natural products. This includes the regioselective and enantioselective coupling and subsequent cyclization of two coniferyl alcohol radicals to pinoresinol as the committed step of lignan biosynthesis. The reaction is controlled by dirigent proteins, which, depending on the species and protein, direct the reaction to either (+)- or (−)-pinoresinol. We present the crystal structure of the (−)-pinoresinol forming DIRIGENT PROTEIN6 (AtDIR6) from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) with data to 1.4 Å resolution. The structure shows AtDIR6 as an eight-stranded antiparallel β-barrel that forms a trimer with spatially well-separated cavities for substrate binding. The binding cavities are two lobed, exhibiting two opposing pockets, each lined with a set of hydrophilic and potentially catalytic residues, including essential aspartic acids. These residues are conserved between (+) and (−)-pinoresinol-forming DIRs and required for activity. The structure supports a model in which two substrate radicals bind to each of the DIR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>ers. With the aromatic rings fixed in the two pockets, the propionyl side chains face each other for radical-radical coupling, and stereoselectivity is determined by the exact positioning of the side chains. Extensive mutational analysis supports a previously unrecognized function for DIRs in catalyzing the cyclization of the bis-quinone methide reaction intermediate to yield (+)- or (−)-pinoresinol.</p>

Primary Metabolism during Biosynthesis of Secondary Wall Polymers of Protoxylem Vessel Elements
<p>Xylem vessels, the water-conducting cells in vascular plants, undergo characteristic secondary wall deposition and programmed cell death. These processes are regulated by the VASCULAR-RELATED NAC-DOMAIN (VND) transcription factors. Here, to identify changes in metabolism that occur during protoxylem vessel element differentiation, we subjected tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) BY-2 suspension culture cells carrying an inducible <i>VND7</i> system to liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based wide-target metabolome analysis and transcriptome analysis. Time-course data for 128 metabolites showed dynamic changes in metabolites related to amino acid biosynthesis. The concentration of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, an important intermediate of the glycolysis pathway, immediately decreased in the initial stages of cell differentiation. As cell differentiation progressed, specific amino acids accumulated, including the shikimate-related amino acids and the translocatable nitrogen-rich amino acid arginine. Transcriptome data indicated that cell differentiation involved the active up-regulation of genes encoding the enzymes catalyzing fructose 6-phosphate biosynthesis from glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate biosynthesis from oxaloacetate, and phenylalanine biosynthesis, which includes shikimate pathway enzymes. Concomitantly, active changes in the amount of fructose 6-phosphate and phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate were detected during cell differentiation. Taken together, our results show that protoxylem vessel element differentiation is associated with changes in primary metabolism, which could facilitate the production of polysaccharides and lignin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>ers and, thus, promote the formation of the secondary cell wall. Also, these metabolic shifts correlate with the active transcriptional regulation of specific enzyme genes. Therefore, our observations indicate that primary metabolism is actively regulated during protoxylem vessel element differentiation to alter the cell’s metabolic activity for the biosynthesis of secondary wall polymers.</p>

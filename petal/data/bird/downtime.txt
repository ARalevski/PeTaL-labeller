Association of Bystander Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Survival According to Ambulance Response Times After Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Bystander-initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) increases patient survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, but it is unknown to what degree bystander CPR remains positively associated with survival with increasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> to potential defibrillation. The main objective was to examine the association of bystander CPR with survival as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> to advanced treatment increases.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied 7623 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients between 2005 and 2011, identified through the nationwide Danish Cardiac Arrest Registry. Multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">logist</span></strong>ic regression analysis was used to examine the association between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> from 911 call to emergency medical service arrival (response <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>) and survival according to whether bystander CPR was provided (yes or no). Reported are 30-day survival chances with 95% bootstrap confidence intervals.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>With increasing response <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>s, adjusted 30-day survival chances decreased for both patients with bystander CPR and those without. However, the contrast between the survival chances of patients with versus without bystander CPR increased over <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>: within 5 minutes, 30-day survival was 14.5% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 12.8–16.4) versus 6.3% (95% CI: 5.1–7.6), corresponding to 2.3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>s higher chances of survival associated with bystander CPR; within 10 minutes, 30-day survival chances were 6.7% (95% CI: 5.4–8.1) versus 2.2% (95% CI: 1.5–3.1), corresponding to 3.0 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>s higher chances of 30-day survival associated with bystander CPR. The contrast in 30-day survival became statistically insignificant when response <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> was >13 minutes (bystander CPR vs no bystander CPR: 3.7% [95% CI: 2.2–5.4] vs 1.5% [95% CI: 0.6–2.7]), but 30-day survival was still 2.5 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>s higher associated with bystander CPR. Based on the model and Danish out-of-hospital cardiac arrest statistics, an additional 233 patients could potentially be saved annually if response <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> was reduced from 10 to 5 minutes and 119 patients if response <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> was reduced from 7 (the median response <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> in this study) to 5 minutes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The absolute survival associated with bystander CPR declined rapidly with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>. Yet bystander CPR while waiting for an ambulance was associated with a more than doubling of 30-day survival even in case of long ambulance response <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>. Decreasing ambulance response <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> by even a few minutes could potentially lead to many additional lives saved every year.</p></sec>

Left Ventricular Assist Device Malfunctions
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Reports of left ventricular assist device (LVAD) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">malfunct</span></strong>ion have focused on pump thrombosis. However, the device consists of the pump, driveline, and peripherals, all of which are potentially subject to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Prospectively collected data were reviewed for all LVAD device <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">malfunct</span></strong>ions (DMs) occurring in rotary LVADs implanted at a single center between April 2004 and May 2016. Durable LVADs included 108 Heartmate II (HM II) and 105 HeartWare VAD (HVAD). DM data were categorized according to device type and into categories related to the component that failed: (1) controller, (2) peripheral components, and (3) implantable blood pump or its integral electric driveline. Pump-related events were analyzed as pump-specific (suspected or confirmed thrombosis) or nonpump-specific (driveline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e). DM rates were reported as events per 1000 patient-days, and Cox proportional hazard models were used for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>-to-event analyses. Cumulative rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">malfunct</span></strong>ion were examined for the main components of each type of LVAD.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Types of DM included controller <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e (30%), battery <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e (19%), or patient cable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e (14%), whereas only 13% were because of pump <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e. DMs were more common in the HM II device (3.73 per 1000 patient-days versus 3.06 per 1000 patient-days for the HVAD, <i>P</i><0.01). A higher rate of pump-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">malfunct</span></strong>ions was discovered in those implanted with an HM II versus an HVAD (0.55 versus 0.39, respectively; <i>P</i><0.01) and peripheral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">malfunct</span></strong>ions (2.32 versus 1.78 for the HM II and HVAD, respectively; <i>P</i><0.01); no difference occurred in the incidence of controller DM between the 2 LVADs. Patients with HVAD were 90% free of a pump-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">malfunct</span></strong>ion at 3 years compared with 56% for the HM II (log-rank <i>P</i><0.003). Only 74% of the patients with HM II were free of pump thrombosis at 3 years compared with 90% of the patients with HVAD. Freedom from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e of the integrated driveline was 79% at 3 years for the HM II but 100% for the HVAD (log-rank <i>P</i><0.02).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Device <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">malfunct</span></strong>ion is much broader than pump <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e alone and occurs for different components at different rates based on the type of LVAD.</p></sec>

Defining modes of failure after joint-preserving surgery of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Joint-preserving surgery of the hip (JPSH) has evolved considerably   and now includes a number of procedures, including arthroscopy,   surgical dislocation, and redirectional osteotomies of the femur   and acetabulum. There are a number of different factors which lead   to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e of JPSH. Consequently, it is of interest to assess the   various modes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e in order to continue to identify best practice   and the indications for these procedures. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Using a retrospective observational study design, we reviewed   1013 patients who had undergone JPSH by a single surgeon between   2005 and 2015. There were 509 men and 504 women with a mean age   of 39 years (16 to 78). Of the 1013 operations, 783 were arthroscopies,   122 surgical dislocations, and 108 peri-acetabular osteotomies (PAO).   We analysed the overall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e rates and modes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e. Re-operations   were categorised into four groups: Mode 1 was arthritis progression   or organ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e leading to total hip arthroplasty (THA); Mode 2   was an Incorrect diagnosis/procedure; Mode 3 resulted from malcorrection   of femur (type A), acetabulum (type B), or labrum (type C) and Mode 4   resulted from an unintended consequence of the initial surgical   intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At a mean follow-up of 2.5 years, there had been 104 re-operations   (10.2%) with a mean patient age of 35.5 years (17 to 64).

Age-Specific Trends in Incidence, Mortality, and Comorbidities of Heart Failure in Denmark, 1995 to 2012
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The cumulative burden and importance of cardiovascular risk factors have changed over the past decades. Specifically, obesity rates have increased among younger people, whereas cardiovascular health has improved in the elderly. Little is known regarding how these changes have impacted the incidence and the mortality rates of heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the age-specific trends in the incidence and 1-year mortality rates following a first-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> diagnosis of heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e in Denmark between 1995 and 2012.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We included all Danish individuals >18 years of age with a first-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> in-hospital diagnosis of heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e. Data were collected from 3 nationwide Danish registries. Annual incidence rates of heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e and 1-year standardized mortality rates were calculated under the assumption of a Poisson distribution.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We identified 210 430 individuals with a first-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> diagnosis of heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e between 1995 and 2012; the annual incidence rates per 10 000 person-years declined among older individuals (rates in 1995 versus 2012: 164 versus 115 in individuals >74 years, 63 versus 35 in individuals 65–74 years, and 20 versus 17 in individuals 55–64 years; <i>P</i><0.0001 for all) but increased among the younger (0.4 versus 0.7 in individuals 18–34 years, 1.3 versus 2.0 in individuals 35–44 years, and 5.0 versus 6.4 in individuals 45–54 years; <i>P</i><0.0001 for all). The proportion of patients with incident heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e ≤50 years of age doubled from 3% in 1995 to 6% in 2012 (<i>P</i><0.0001).

Prolonged, Uninterrupted Sedentary Behavior and Glycemic Biomarkers Among US Hispanic/Latino Adults
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Excessive sedentary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> is ubiquitous in developed nations and is associated with deleterious health outcomes. Few studies have examined whether the manner in which sedentary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> is accrued (in short or long bouts) carries any clinical relevance. The purpose of this study was to examine the association of prolonged, uninterrupted sedentary behavior with glycemic biomarkers in a cohort of US Hispanic/Latino adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied 12 083 participants from the HCHS/SOL (Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos), a population-based study of Hispanic/Latino adults 18 to 74 years of age. Homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance and glycosylated hemoglobin were measured from a fasting blood sample, and 2-hour glucose was measured after an oral glucose tolerance test. Sedentary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> was objectively measured with a hip-mounted accelerometer. Prolonged, uninterrupted sedentariness was expressed as mean sedentary bout length.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>After adjustment for potential confounders and moderate to vigorous physical activity, longer sedentary bout duration was dose-dependently associated with increased homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (<i>P</i> for trend<0.001) and 2-hour glucose levels (<i>P</i> for trend=0.015).

Midbrain dopamine neurons control judgment of time
<p>Our sense of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> is far from constant. For instance, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> flies when we are having fun, and it slows to a trickle when we are bored. Midbrain dopamine neurons have been implicated in variable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> estimation. However, a direct link between signals carried by dopamine neurons and temporal judgments is lacking. We measured and manipulated the activity of dopamine neurons as mice judged the duration of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> intervals. We found that pharmacogenetic suppression of dopamine neurons decreased behavioral sensitivity to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> and that dopamine neurons encoded information about trial-to-trial variability in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> estimates. Last, we found that transient activation or inhibition of dopamine neurons was sufficient to slow down or speed up <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> estimation, respectively. Dopamine neuron activity thus reflects and can directly control the judgment of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>.</p>

Impact of Regionalization of ST-Segment–Elevation Myocardial Infarction Care on Treatment Times and Outcomes for Emergency Medical Services–Transported Patients Presenting to Hospitals With Percutaneous Coronary Intervention
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Regional variations in reperfusion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>s and mortality in patients with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction are influenced by differences in coordinating care between emergency medical services (EMS) and hospitals. Building on the Accelerator-1 Project, we hypothesized that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> to reperfusion could be further reduced with enhanced regional efforts.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Between April 2015 and March 2017, we worked with 12 metropolitan regions across the United States with 132 percutaneous coronary intervention–capable hospitals and 946 EMS agencies. Data were collected in the ACTION (Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Network)-Get With The Guidelines Registry for quarterly Mission: Lifeline reports. The primary end point was the change in the proportion of EMS-transported patients with first medical contact to device <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> ≤90 minutes from baseline to final quarter. We also compared treatment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>s and mortality with patients treated in hospitals not participating in the project during the corresponding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> period.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>During the study period, 10 730 patients were transported to percutaneous coronary intervention–capable hospitals, including 974 in the baseline quarter and 972 in the final quarter who met inclusion criteria. Median age was 61 years; 27% were women, 6% had cardiac arrest, and 6% had shock on admission; 10% were black, 12% were Latino, and 10% were uninsured. By the end of the intervention, all process measures reflecting coordination between EMS and hospitals had improved, including the proportion of patients with a first medical contact to device <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> of ≤90 minutes (67%–74%; <i>P</i><0.002), a first medical contact to device <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> to catheterization laboratory activation of ≤20 minutes (38%–56%; <i>P</i><0.0001), and emergency department dwell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> of ≤20 minutes (33%–43%; <i>P</i><0.0001). Of the 12 regions, 9 regions reduced first medical contact to device <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>, and 8 met or exceeded the national goal of 75% of patients treated in ≤90 minutes. Improvements in treatment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>s corresponded with a significant reduction in mortality (in-hospital death, 4.4%–2.3%; <i>P</i>=0.001) that was not apparent in hospitals not participating in the project during the same <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> period.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Organization of care among EMS and hospitals in 12 regions was associated with significant reductions in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> to reperfusion in patients with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction as well as in in-hospital mortality.

Weight Loss and Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Associations of obesity with incidence of heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e have been observed, but the causality is uncertain.

Mapping the stochastic sequence of individual ligand-receptor binding events to cellular activation: T cells act on the rare events
<p>T cell receptor (TCR) binding to agonist peptide major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) triggers signaling events that initiate T cell responses. This system is remarkably sensitive, requiring only a few binding events to successfully activate a cellular response. On average, activating pMHC ligands exhibit mean dwell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>s of at least a few seconds when bound to the TCR. However, a T cell accumulates pMHC-TCR interactions as a stochastic series of discrete, single-molecule binding events whose individual dwell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>s are broadly distributed. With activation occurring in response to only a handful of such binding events, individual cells are unlikely to experience the average binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>. Here, we mapped the ensemble of pMHC-TCR binding events in space and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> while simultaneously monitoring cellular activation. Our findings revealed that T cell activation hinges on rare, long–dwell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> binding events that are an order of magnitude longer than the average agonist pMHC-TCR dwell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>. Furthermore, we observed that short pMHC-TCR binding events that were spatially correlated and temporally sequential led to cellular activation. These observations indicate that T cell antigen discrimination likely occurs by sensing the tail end of the pMHC-TCR binding dwell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> distribution rather than its average properties.</p>

Genome-Wide Analysis of the Arabidopsis Replication Timing Program
<p>Eukaryotes use a temporally regulated process, known as the replication timing program, to ensure that their genomes are fully and accurately duplicated during S phase. Replication timing programs are predictive of genomic features and activity and are considered to be functional readouts of chromatin organization. Although replication timing programs have been described for yeast and animal systems, much less is known about the temporal regulation of plant DNA replication or its relationship to genome sequence and chromatin structure. We used the thymidine analog, 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine, in combination with flow sorting and Repli-Seq to describe, at high-resolution, the genome-wide replication timing program for Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) Col-0 suspension cells. We identified genomic regions that replicate predominantly during early, mid, and late S phase, and correlated these regions with genomic features and with data for chromatin state, accessibility, and long-distance interaction. Arabidopsis chromosome arms tend to replicate early while pericentromeric regions replicate late. Early and mid-replicating regions are gene-rich and predominantly euchromatic, while late regions are rich in transposable elements and primarily heterochromatic. However, the distribution of chromatin states across the different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>s is complex, with each replication <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> corresponding to a mixture of states. Early and mid-replicating sequences interact with each other and not with late sequences, but early regions are more accessible than mid regions. The replication timing program in Arabidopsis reflects a bipartite genomic organization with early/mid-replicating regions and late regions forming separate, noninteracting compartments. The temporal order of DNA replication within the early/mid compartment may be modulated largely by chromatin accessibility.</p>

Time to Endovascular Treatment and Outcome in Acute Ischemic Stroke
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Randomized, clinical trials in selected acute ischemic stroke patients reported that for every hour delay of endovascular treatment (EVT), chances of functional independence diminish by up to 3.4%. These findings may not be fully generalizable to clinical practice because of strict in- and exclusion criteria in these trials. Therefore, we aim to assess the association of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> to EVT with functional outcome in current, everyday clinical practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The MR CLEAN Registry (Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in The Netherlands) is an ongoing, prospective, observational study in all centers that perform EVT in The Netherlands. Data were analyzed from patients treated between March 2014 and June 2016. In the primary analysis we assessed the association of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> from stroke onset to start of EVT and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> from stroke onset to successful reperfusion with functional outcome (measured with the modified Rankin Scale), by means of ordinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">logist</span></strong>ic regression.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We analyzed 1488 patients with acute ischemic stroke who underwent EVT. An increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> to start of EVT was associated with worse functional outcome (adjusted common odds ratio, 0.83 per hour; 95% confidence interval, 0.77–0.89) and a 2.2% increase in mortality. Every hour increase from stroke onset to EVT start resulted in a 5.3% decreased probability of functional independence (modified Rankin Scale, 0–2). In the 742 patients with successful reperfusion, every hour increase from stroke onset to reperfusion was associated with a 7.7% decreased probability of functional independence.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> to EVT for acute ischemic stroke in current clinical practice is strongly associated with functional outcome. Our data suggest that this association might be even stronger than previously suggested in reports on more selected patient populations from randomized, controlled trials. These findings emphasize that functional outcome of EVT patients can be greatly improved by shortening onset to treatment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>s.</p></sec>

Reversing the Cardiac Effects of Sedentary Aging in Middle Age—A Randomized Controlled Trial
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Poor fitness in middle age is a risk factor for heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e, particularly heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e with a preserved ejection fraction. The development of heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e with a preserved ejection fraction is likely mediated through increased left ventricular (LV) stiffness, a consequence of sedentary aging. In a prospective, parallel group, randomized controlled trial, we examined the effect of 2 years of supervised high-intensity exercise training on LV stiffness.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Sixty-one (48% male) healthy, sedentary, middle-aged participants (53±5 years) were randomly assigned to either 2 years of exercise training (n=34) or attention control (control; n=27). Right heart catheterization and 3-dimensional echocardiography were performed with preload manipulations to define LV end-diastolic pressure-volume relationships and Frank-Starling curves. LV stiffness was calculated by curve fit of the diastolic pressure-volume curve. Maximal oxygen uptake (Vo<sub>2</sub>max) was measured to quantify changes in fitness.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Fifty-three participants completed the study. Adherence to prescribed exercise sessions was 88±11%. Vo<sub>2</sub>max increased by 18% (exercise training: pre 29.0±4.8 to post 34.4±6.4; control: pre 29.5±5.3 to post 28.7±5.4, group×<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> <i>P</i><0.001) and LV stiffness was reduced (right/downward shift in the end-diastolic pressure-volume relationships; preexercise training stiffness constant 0.072±0.037 to postexercise training 0.051±0.0268, <i>P</i>=0.0018), whereas there was no change in controls (group×<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> <i>P</i><0.001; pre stiffness constant 0.0635±0.026 to post 0.062±0.031, <i>P</i>=0.83). Exercise increased LV end-diastolic volume (group×<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> <i>P</i><0.001), whereas pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was unchanged, providing greater stroke volume for any given filling pressure (loading×group×<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> <i>P</i>=0.007).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In previously sedentary healthy middle-aged adults, 2 years of exercise training improved maximal oxygen uptake and decreased cardiac stiffness. Regular exercise training may provide protection against the future risk of heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e with a preserved ejection fraction by preventing the increase in cardiac stiffness attributable to sedentary aging.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Dynamic Edematous Response of the Human Heart to Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Clinical protocols aimed to characterize the post–myocardial infarction (MI) heart by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) need to be standardized to take account of dynamic biological phenomena evolving early after the index ischemic event. Here, we evaluated the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> course of edema reaction in patients with ST-segment–elevation MI by CMR and assessed its implications for myocardium-at-risk (MaR) quantification both in patients and in a large-animal model.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A total of 16 patients with anterior ST-segment–elevation MI successfully treated by primary angioplasty and 16 matched controls were prospectively recruited. In total, 94 clinical CMR examinations were performed: patients with ST-segment–elevation MI were serially scanned (within the first 3 hours after reperfusion and at 1, 4, 7, and 40 days), and controls were scanned only once. T2 relaxation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> in the myocardium (T2 mapping) and the extent of edema on T2-weighted short-tau triple inversion-recovery (ie, CMR-MaR) were evaluated at all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> points. In the experimental study, 20 pigs underwent 40-minute ischemia/reperfusion followed by serial CMR examinations at 120 minutes and 1, 4, and 7 days after reperfusion. Reference MaR was assessed by contrast-multidetector computed tomography during the index coronary occlusion. Generalized linear mixed models were used to take account of repeated measurements.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In humans, T2 relaxation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> in the ischemic myocardium declines significantly from early after reperfusion to 24 hours, and then increases up to day 4, reaching a plateau from which it decreases from day 7. Consequently, edema extent measured by T2-weighted short-tau triple inversion-recovery (CMR-MaR) varied with the timing of the CMR examination. These findings were confirmed in the experimental model by showing that only CMR-MaR values for day 4 and day 7 postreperfusion, coinciding with the deferred edema wave, were similar to values measured by reference contrast-multidetector computed tomography.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Post-MI edema in patients follows a bimodal pattern that affects CMR estimates of MaR. Dynamic changes in post–ST-segment–elevation MI edema highlight the need for standardization of CMR timing to retrospectively delineate MaR and quantify myocardial salvage. According to the present clinical and experimental data, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> window between days 4 and 7 post-MI seems a good compromise solution for standardization. Further studies are needed to study the effect of other factors on these variables.</p></sec>

Optimizing a Drone Network to Deliver Automated External Defibrillators
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Public access defibrillation programs can improve survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, but automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are rarely available for bystander use at the scene. Drones are an emerging technology that can deliver an AED to the scene of an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest for bystander use. We hypothesize that a drone network designed with the aid of a mathematical model combining both optimization and queuing can reduce the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> to AED arrival.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We applied our model to 53 702 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests that occurred in the 8 regions of the Toronto Regional RescuNET between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2014. Our primary analysis quantified the drone network size required to deliver an AED 1, 2, or 3 minutes faster than historical median 911 response <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>s for each region independently. A secondary analysis quantified the reduction in drone resources required if RescuNET was treated as a large coordinated region.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The region-specific analysis determined that 81 bases and 100 drones would be required to deliver an AED ahead of median 911 response <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>s by 3 minutes. In the most urban region, the 90th percentile of the AED arrival <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> was reduced by 6 minutes and 43 seconds relative to historical 911 response <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>s in the region. In the most rural region, the 90th percentile was reduced by 10 minutes and 34 seconds. A single coordinated drone network across all regions required 39.5% fewer bases and 30.0% fewer drones to achieve similar AED delivery <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>An optimized drone network designed with the aid of a novel mathematical model can substantially reduce the AED delivery <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> to an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest event.</p></sec>

Impact of Practice-Based Management of Pulmonary Artery Pressures in 2000 Patients Implanted With the CardioMEMS Sensor
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Elevated pulmonary artery (PA) pressures in patients with heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e are associated with a high risk for hospitalization and mortality. Recent clinical trial evidence demonstrated a direct relationship between lowering remotely monitored PA pressures and heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e hospitalization risk reduction with a novel implantable PA pressure monitoring system (CardioMEMS HF System, St. Jude Medical). This study examines PA pressure changes in the first 2000 US patients implanted in general practice use.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Deidentified data from the remote monitoring Merlin.net (St. Jude Medical) database were used to examine PA pressure trends from the first consecutive 2000 patients with at least 6 months of follow-up. Changes in PA pressures were evaluated with an area under the curve methodology to estimate the total sum increase or decrease in pressures (mm Hg-day) during the follow-up period relative to the baseline pressure. As a reference, the PA pressure trends were compared with the historic CHAMPION clinical trial (CardioMEMS Heart Sensor Allows Monitoring of Pressure to Improve Outcomes in New York Heart Association [NYHA] Functional Class III Heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e Patients). The area under the curve results are presented as mean±2 SE, and <i>P</i> values comparing the area under the curve of the general-use cohort with outcomes in the CHAMPION trial were computed by the <i>t</i> test with equal variance.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Patients were on average 70±12 years old; 60% were male; 34% had preserved ejection fraction; and patients were followed up for an average of 333±125 days.

The general-use patients had an area under the curve of −32.8 mm Hg-day at the 1-month <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> mark, −156.2 mm Hg-day at the 3-month <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> mark, and −434.0 mm Hg-day after 6 months of hemodynamic guided care, which was significantly lower than the treatment group in the CHAMPION trial.

Population-Based Long-Term Cardiac-Specific Mortality Among 34 489 Five-Year Survivors of Childhood Cancer in Great Britain
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Increased risks of cardiac morbidity and mortality among childhood cancer survivors have been described previously.

Standardized mortality ratios and absolute excess risks were used to quantify cardiac mortality excess risk. Multivariable Poisson regression models were used to evaluate the simultaneous effect of risk factors. Likelihood ratio tests were used to test for heterogeneity and trends.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, 181 cardiac deaths were observed, which was 3.4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>s that expected.

Development and Evolution of a Hierarchical Clinical Composite End Point for the Evaluation of Drugs and Devices for Acute and Chronic Heart Failure
<p>Traditional approaches to the assessment of new treatments for heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e have generally evaluated individual components of the syndrome at fixed points in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> or have relied on surrogate physiological measures that are poorly correlated with the clinical status of patients. Conventional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>-to-event trials that focus on morbidity and mortality represent an important methodological advance, but they generally assign undue weight to clinical events of less importance and are insensitive to difference in functional capacity among individuals who do not experience a clinical event during follow-up. Twenty years ago, a hierarchical clinical composite was developed to address these limitations; it aims to assess the clinical course of patients as a physician would in practice by combining a symptomatic assessment of the patient at each visit with an evaluation of the clinical stability of the patient between visits. The composite does not generate a numeric score by summing arbitrarily assigned weights to certain symptoms or events; instead, the composite ranks relevant measures and outcomes according to clinical priority. In doing so, the clinical composite minimizes the biases created by noncompleting patients in the assessment of symptoms or exercise tolerance while expanding the range of patients who contribute to the treatment difference in a typical morbidity and mortality trial. When applied appropriately, the hierarchical clinical composite end point has <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reliabl</span></strong>y distinguished effective from ineffective treatments. The composite may have particular advantages in the evaluation of new devices and transcatheter interventions in chronic heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e and of new drugs for acute heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e. Recent modifications enhance its discriminant characteristics and its ability to accurately assess the efficacy of novel interventions for heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e.</p>

Genetic Architecture of Flowering-Time Variation in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i><xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The transition to reproductive development is a crucial step in the plant life cycle, and the timing of this transition is an important factor in crop yields. Here, we report new insights into the genetic control of natural variation in flowering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>, a nondomesticated pooid grass closely related to cereals such as wheat (<i>Triticum</i> spp.) and barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i> L.). A recombinant inbred line population derived from a cross between the rapid-flowering accession Bd21 and the delayed-flowering accession Bd1-1 were grown in a variety of environmental conditions to enable exploration of the genetic architecture of flowering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>. A genotyping-by-sequencing approach was used to develop SNP markers for genetic map construction, and quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that control differences in flowering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> were identified. Many of the flowering-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> QTLs are detected across a range of photoperiod and vernalization conditions, suggesting that the genetic control of flowering within this population is robust. The two major QTLs identified in undomesticated <i>B. distachyon</i> colocalize with <i>VERNALIZATION1/PHYTOCHROME C</i> and <i>VERNALIZATION2</i>, loci identified as flowering regulators in the domesticated crops wheat and barley. This suggests that variation in flowering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> is controlled in part by a set of genes broadly conserved within pooid grasses.</p>

Natural Variation in <i>Brachypodium</i> Links Vernalization and Flowering Time Loci as Major Flowering Determinants
<p>The domestication of plants is underscored by the selection of agriculturally favorable developmental traits, including flowering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>, which resulted in the creation of varieties with altered growth habits. Research into the pathways underlying these growth habits in cereals has highlighted the role of three main flowering regulators: <i>VERNALIZATION1</i> (<i>VRN1</i>), <i>VRN2</i>, and <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T</i> (<i>FT</i>). Previous reverse genetic studies suggested that the roles of <i>VRN1</i> and <i>FT</i> are conserved in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i> yet identified considerable ambiguity surrounding the role of <i>VRN2</i>. To investigate the natural diversity governing flowering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> pathways in a nondomesticated grass, the reference <i>B. distachyon</i> accession Bd21 was crossed with the vernalization-dependent accession ABR6. Resequencing of ABR6 allowed the creation of a single-nucleotide polymorphism-based genetic map at the F4 stage of the mapping population. Flowering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> was evaluated in F4:5 families in five environmental conditions, and three major loci were found to govern flowering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>. Interestingly, two of these loci colocalize with the <i>B. distachyon</i> homologs of the major flowering pathway genes <i>VRN2</i> and <i>FT</i>, whereas no linkage was observed at <i>VRN1</i>. Characterization of these candidates identified sequence and expression variation between the two parental genotypes, which may explain the contrasting growth habits. However, the identification of additional quantitative trait loci suggests that greater complexity underlies flowering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> in this nondomesticated system. Studying the interaction of these regulators in <i>B. distachyon</i> provides insights into the evolutionary context of flowering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> regulation in the Poaceae as well as elucidates the way humans have utilized the natural variation present in grasses to create modern temperate cereals.</p>

Clinical and Echocardiographic Characteristics and Cardiovascular Outcomes According to Diabetes Status in Patients With Heart Failure and Preserved Ejection Fraction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In patients with heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e and preserved ejection fraction, little is known about the characteristics of, and outcomes in, those with and without diabetes mellitus.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We examined clinical and echocardiographic characteristics and outcomes in the I-Preserve trial (Irbesartan in Heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e With Preserved Ejection Fraction) according to history of diabetes mellitus. Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios for cardiovascular outcomes adjusted for known predictors, including age, sex, natriuretic peptides, and comorbidity. Echocardiographic data were available in 745 patients and were additionally adjusted for in supplementary analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, 1134 of 4128 patients (27%) had diabetes mellitus. Compared with those without diabetes mellitus, they were more likely to have a history of myocardial infarction (28% versus 22%), higher body mass index (31 versus 29 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), worse Minnesota Living With Heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e score (48 versus 40), higher median N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide concentration (403 versus 320 pg/mL; all <i>P</i><0.01), more signs of congestion, but no significant difference in left ventricular ejection fraction. Patients with diabetes mellitus had a greater left ventricular mass and left atrial area than patients without diabetes mellitus. Doppler E-wave velocity (86 versus 76 cm/s; <i>P</i><0.0001) and the E/e’ ratio (11.7 versus 10.4; <i>P</i>=0.010) were higher in patients with diabetes mellitus.

Submillihertz magnetic spectroscopy performed with a nanoscale quantum sensor
<p>Precise <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>keeping is critical to metrology, forming the basis by which standards of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>, length, and fundamental constants are determined. Stable clocks are particularly valuable in spectroscopy because they define the ultimate frequency precision that can be reached. In quantum metrology, the qubit coherence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> defines the clock stability, from which the spectral linewidth and frequency precision are determined. We demonstrate a quantum sensing protocol in which the spectral precision goes beyond the sensor coherence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> and is limited by the stability of a classical clock. Using this technique, we observed a precision in frequency estimation scaling in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> <i>T</i> as <i>T</i><sup>–3/2</sup> for classical oscillating fields. The narrow linewidth magnetometer based on single spins in diamond is used to sense nanoscale magnetic fields with an intrinsic frequency resolution of 607 microhertz, which is eight orders of magnitude narrower than the qubit coherence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>.</p>

Radiation reduction of minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion with localisation system in overweight patients
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (MITLIF)   has been well validated in overweight and obese patients who are   consequently subject to a higher radiation exposure. This prospective   multicentre study aimed to investigate the efficacy of a novel lumbar   localisation system for MITLIF in overweight patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The initial study group consisted of 175 patients. After excluding   49 patients for various reasons, 126 patients were divided into   two groups. Those in Group A were treated using the localisation   system while those in Group B were treated by conventional means.   The primary outcomes were the effective radiation dosage to the   surgeon and the exposure <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were 62 patients in Group A and 64 in Group B.

Atrial Fibrillation Burden in Young Patients With Congenital Heart Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) are assumed to be vulnerable to atrial fibrillation (AF) as a result of residual shunts, anomalous vessel anatomy, progressive valvulopathy, hypertension, and atrial scars from previous heart surgery. However, the risk of developing AF and the complications associated with AF in children and young adults with CHD have not been compared with those in control subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data from the Swedish Patient and Cause of Death registers were used to identify all patients with a diagnosis of CHD who were born from 1970 to 1993. Each patient with CHD was matched by birth year, sex, and county with 10 control subjects from the Total Population Register in Sweden. Follow-up data were collected until 2011.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 21 982 patients (51.6% men) with CHD and 219 816 matched control subjects, 654 and 328 developed AF, respectively.

Pharmacodynamic Effects of Switching From Ticagrelor to Clopidogrel in Patients With Coronary Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Switching between different classes of P2Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitors, including de-escalation from ticagrelor to clopidogrel, commonly occurs in clinical practice. However, the pharmacodynamic profiles of this strategy have been poorly explored.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This was a prospective, randomized, open-label study conducted in patients on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance dosing (MD) of aspirin (81 mg/d) and clopidogrel (75 mg/d). After a 7-day run-in with ticagrelor (180 mg loading dose [LD] followed by 90 mg twice daily MD), patients (n=80) were randomized into 1 of 4 groups: group A, clopidogrel 600 mg LD 24 hours after the last MD of ticagrelor (C-600 mg-24h); group B, clopidogrel 600 mg LD 12 hours after the last MD of ticagrelor (C-600 mg-12h); group C, clopidogrel 75 mg/d MD 24 hours after the last MD of ticagrelor (C-75 mg-24h); and group D, ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily MD (T-90 mg twice daily). MD of the randomized treatment was maintained for 10±3 days. Pharmacodynamic assessments were performed at baseline, after run-in, and at 2, 24, 48, and 72 hours and 10 days with P2Y<sub>12</sub> reaction units by VerifyNow; platelet reactivity index was assessed by vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein; and maximal platelet aggregation was determined by light transmittance aggregometry.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>T-90 mg twice daily led to lower platelet reactivity than any clopidogrel regimen using all assays at all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> points. P2Y<sub>12</sub> reaction unit levels were similar between the C-600 mg-24h (group A) and the C-75 mg-24h (group C) (<i>P</i>=0.29), including at 48 hours (primary end point; least mean difference, −6.9; 95% confidence interval, −38.1 to 24.3; <i>P</i>=0.66). P2Y<sub>12</sub> reaction unit levels were lower with C-600 mg-12h (group B) than with C-75 mg-24h (group C; <i>P</i>=0.024). Maximal platelet aggregation over <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> was lower with both C-600 mg-24h (group A; <i>P</i>=0.041) and C-600 mg-12h (group B; <i>P</i>=0.028) compared with C-75 mg-24h (group C). Platelet reactivity index profiles paralleled those observed with P2Y<sub>12</sub> reaction units. There were no pharmacodynamic differences for all tests between C-600 mg-24h (group A) and C-600 mg-12h (group B). In group C (C-75 mg-24h), platelet reactivity increased compared with baseline as early as 24 hours, reaching statistical significance at 48 and 72 hours and up to 10 days. These pharmacodynamic findings were delayed and blunted in magnitude with the administration of an LD, regardless of the timing of administration.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>De-escalation from ticagrelor to clopidogrel therapy is associated with an increase in platelet reactivity. The use of an LD before the initiation of an MD regimen of clopidogrel mitigates these observations, although this is not affected by the timing of its administration after ticagrelor discontinuation.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Persistent Long-Term Structural, Functional, and Metabolic Changes After Stress-Induced (Takotsubo) Cardiomyopathy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is an increasingly recognized acute heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e syndrome precipitated by intense emotional stress. Although there is an apparent rapid and spontaneous recovery of left ventricular ejection fraction, the long-term clinical and functional consequences of takotsubo cardiomyopathy are ill-defined.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In an observational case-control study, we recruited 37 patients with prior (>12-month) takotsubo cardiomyopathy, and 37 age-, sex-, and comorbidity-matched control subjects. Patients completed the Minnesota Living with Heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e Questionnaire. All participants underwent detailed clinical phenotypic characterization, including serum biomarker analysis, cardiopulmonary exercise testing, echocardiography, and cardiac magnetic resonance including cardiac <sup>31</sup>P-spectroscopy.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Participants were predominantly middle-age (64±11 years) women (97%). Although takotsubo cardiomyopathy occurred 20 (range 13–39) months before the study, the majority (88%) of patients had persisting symptoms compatible with heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e (median of 13 [range 0–76] in the Minnesota Living with Heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e Questionnaire) and cardiac limitation on exercise testing (reduced peak oxygen consumption, 24±1.3 versus 31±1.3 mL/kg/min, <i>P</i><0.001; increased VE/V<sc>co</sc><sub>2</sub> slope, 31±1 versus 26±1, <i>P</i>=0.002).

Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Connection
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC) is a rare form of congenital heart disease. This study describes current surgical treatment strategies and experiences in a cohort of patients from 2 congenital cardiac centers in Shanghai and Guangdong in China.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This retrospective study included 768 patients operated on between 2005 and 2014. Although most patients (n=690) underwent conventional repair, a sutureless technique was used in 10% (n=78) of cases. A multilevel mixed-effects parametric survival model and a competing-risk analysis were used to analyze associated risk factors for death and recurrent pulmonary venous obstruction (PVO), respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to analyze the overall survival. The Nelson-Aalen cumulative risk curve was used to compare distributions of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> with recurrent PVO.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The mean surgical age and weight were 214.9±39.2 days and 5.4±3.6 kg, respectively. Obstructed TAPVC (PVO) was documented in 192 (25%) of the 768 patients. There were 38 intraoperative deaths and 13 late deaths. A younger age at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> of repair (<i>P</i>=0.001), mixed (<i>P</i>=0.004) and infracardiac (<i>P</i>=0.035) TAPVC, preoperative PVO (<i>P</i>=0.027), prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> (<i>P</i><0.001), and longer duration of ventilation (<i>P</i>=0.028) were associated with mortality. The median follow-up was 23.2 months (range; 1–112 months). Among the 717 survivors, recurrent PVO was observed in 111 patients (15%).

Long-Chain Monounsaturated Fatty Acids and Incidence of Congestive Heart Failure in 2 Prospective Cohorts
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Decades-old animal experiments suggested that dietary long-chain monounsaturated fatty acids (LCMUFAs) caused cardiotoxicity, leading, for example, development of Canola oil (Canadian oil low in erucic acid) from rapeseed. However, potential cardiotoxicity in humans and contemporary dietary sources of LCMUFAs are unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We prospectively investigated the associations of plasma phospholipid LCMUFAs (20:1, 22:1, and 24:1), assessed as objective biomarkers of exposure, with incidence congestive heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e in 2 independent cohorts: 3694 older adults (mean age, 75.2±5.2 years) in the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS; 1992–2006) and 3577 middle-aged adults (mean age, 54.1±5.8 years) in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, Minnesota subcohort (ARIC; 1987–2008). We further examined dietary correlates of circulating LCMUFAs in CHS and ARIC and US dietary sources of LCMUFAs in the 2003–2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). In CHS, 997 congestive heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e events occurred during 39 238 person-years; in ARIC, 330 events congestive heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e events occurred during 64 438 person-years. After multivariable adjustment, higher levels of 22:1 and 24:1 were positively associated with greater incident congestive heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e in both CHS and ARIC; hazard ratios were 1.34 (95% confidence interval, 1.02–1.76) and 1.57 (95% confidence interval, 1.11–2.23) for highest versus lowest quintiles of 22:1, respectively, and 1.75 (95% confidence interval, 1.23–2.50) and 1.92 (95% confidence interval, 1.22–3.03) for 24:1, respectively (<i>P</i> for trend ≤0.03 each). A variety of foods were related to circulating LCMUFAs in CHS and ARIC, consistent with food sources of LCMUFAs in NHANES, including fish, poultry, meats, whole grains, and mustard.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Higher circulating levels of 22:1 and 24:1, with apparently diverse dietary sources, were associated with incident congestive heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e in 2 independent cohorts, suggesting possible cardiotoxicity of LCMUFAs in humans.</p></sec>

Is there still a role for osteoarticular allograft reconstruction in musculoskeletal tumour surgery?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To assess complications and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e mechanisms of osteoarticular   allograft reconstructions for primary bone tumours.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We retrospectively evaluated 38 patients (28 men, 74%) who were   treated at our institution with osteoarticular allograft reconstruction   between 1989 and 2010. Median age was 19 years (interquartile range   14 to 32). Median follow-up was 19.5 years (95% confidence interval   (CI) 13.0 to 26.1) when 26 patients (68%) were alive. In addition, we   systematically searched the literature for clinical studies on osteoarticular   allografts, finding 31 studies suitable for analysis.

In the systematic review, 514 reconstructions were analysed (distal   femur, n = 184, 36%; proximal tibia, n = 136, 26%; distal radius,   n = 99, 19%; proximal humerus, n = 95, 18%). Overall rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e, fracture   and infection were 27%, 20%, and 10% respectively. With the distal   femur as the reference, fractures were more common in the humerus   (odds ratio (OR) 4.1, 95% CI 2.2 to 7.7) and tibia (OR 2.2, 95%   CI 1.3 to 4.4); infections occurred more often in the tibia (OR   2.2, 95% CI 1.3 to 4.4) and less often in the radius (OR 0.1, 95%   CI 0.0 to 0.8).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Osteoarticular allograft reconstructions are associated with   high rates of mechanical complications.

A new and reliable classification system for fractures of the navicular and associated injuries to the midfoot
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Fractures of the navicular can occur in isolation but, owing   to the intimate anatomical and biomechanical relationships, are   often associated with other injuries to the neighbouring bones and   joints in the foot. As a result, they can lead to long-term morbidity   and poor function. Our aim in this study was to identify patterns   of injury in a new classification system of traumatic fractures   of the navicular, with consideration being given to the commonly associated   injuries to the midfoot.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We undertook a retrospective review of 285 consecutive patients   presenting over an eight- year period with a fracture of the navicular.   Five common patterns of injury were identified and classified according   to the radiological features. Type 1 fractures are dorsal avulsion   injuries related to the capsule of the talonavicular joint. Type   2 fractures are isolated avulsion injuries to the tuberosity of   the navicular. Type 3 fractures are a variant of tarsometatarsal   fracture/dislocations creating instability of the medial ray. Type   4 fractures involve the body of the navicular with no associated   injury to the lateral column and type 5 fractures occur in conjunction   with disruption of the midtarsal joint with crushing of the medial   or lateral, or both, columns of the foot.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In order to test the reliability and reproducibility of this   new classification, a cohort of 30 patients with a fracture of the   navicular were classified by six independent assessors at two separate   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>s, six months apart. Interobserver reliability and intraobserver   reproducibility both had substantial agreement, with kappa values   of 0.80 and 0.72, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We propose a logical, all-inclusive, and mutually exclusive classification   system for fractures of the navicular that gives associated injuries   involving the lateral column due consideration.

ADHF hospitalizations were validated by standardized physician review and computer algorithm, yielding 40 173 events after accounting for sampling design (unweighted n=8746).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of the ADHF hospitalizations, 50% had reduced ejection fraction, and 39% had preserved EF (HFpEF). HF with reduced ejection fraction was more common in black men and white men, whereas HFpEF was most common in white women. Average age-adjusted rates of ADHF were highest in blacks (38.1 per 1000 black men, 30.5 per 1000 black women), with rates differing by HF type and sex. ADHF rates increased over the 10 years (average annual percentage change: black women +4.3%, black men +3.7%, white women +1.9%, white men +2.6%), mostly reflecting more acute HFpEF. Age-adjusted 28-day and 1-year case fatality proportions were ≈10% and 30%, respectively, similar across race-sex groups and HF types.

Nicotinamide Riboside Preserves Cardiac Function in a Mouse Model of Dilated Cardiomyopathy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Myocardial metabolic impairment is a major feature in chronic heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e. As the major coenzyme in fuel oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation and a substrate for enzymes signaling energy stress and oxidative stress response, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) is emerging as a metabolic target in a number of diseases including heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e. Little is known on the mechanisms regulating homeostasis of NAD<sup>+</sup> in the failing heart.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To explore possible alterations of NAD<sup>+</sup> homeostasis in the failing heart, we quantified the expression of NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthetic enzymes in the human failing heart and in the heart of a mouse model of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) triggered by Serum Response Factor transcription factor depletion in the heart (SRF<sup>HKO</sup>) or of cardiac hypertrophy triggered by transverse aorta constriction. We studied the impact of NAD<sup>+</sup> precursor supplementation on cardiac function in both mouse models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We observed a 30% loss in levels of NAD<sup>+</sup> in the murine failing heart of both DCM and transverse aorta constriction mice that was accompanied by a decrease in expression of the nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase enzyme that recycles the nicotinamide precursor, whereas the nicotinamide riboside kinase 2 (NMRK2) that phosphorylates the nicotinamide riboside precursor is increased, to a higher level in the DCM (40-fold) than in transverse aorta constriction (4-fold). This shift was also observed in human failing heart biopsies in comparison with nonfailing controls. We show that the <i>Nmrk2</i> gene is an AMP-activated protein kinase and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α responsive gene that is activated by energy stress and NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion in isolated rat cardiomyocytes. Nicotinamide riboside efficiently rescues NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis in response to FK866-mediated inhibition of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase and stimulates glycolysis in cardiomyocytes. Accordingly, we show that nicotinamide riboside supplementation in food attenuates the development of heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e in mice, more robustly in DCM, and partially after transverse aorta constriction, by stabilizing myocardial NAD<sup>+</sup> levels in the failing heart. Nicotinamide riboside treatment also robustly increases the myocardial levels of 3 metabolites, nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide, methylnicotinamide, and N1-methyl-4-pyridone-5-carboxamide, that can be used as validation biomarkers for the treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The data show that nicotinamide riboside, the most energy-efficient among NAD precursors, could be useful for treatment of heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e, notably in the context of DCM, a disease with few therapeutic options.</p></sec>

Worsening Renal Function in Patients With Acute Heart Failure Undergoing Aggressive Diuresis Is Not Associated With Tubular Injury
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Worsening renal function (WRF) in the setting of aggressive diuresis for acute heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e treatment may reflect renal tubular injury or simply indicate a hemodynamic or functional change in glomerular filtration. Well-validated tubular injury biomarkers, <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, and kidney injury molecule 1, are now available that can quantify the degree of renal tubular injury. The ROSE-AHF trial (Renal Optimization Strategies Evaluation–Acute Heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e) provides an experimental platform for the study of mechanisms of WRF during aggressive diuresis for acute heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e because the ROSE-AHF protocol dictated high-dose loop diuretic therapy in all patients. We sought to determine whether tubular injury biomarkers are associated with WRF in the setting of aggressive diuresis and its association with prognosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients in the multicenter ROSE-AHF trial with baseline and 72-hour urine tubular injury biomarkers were analyzed (n=283). WRF was defined as a ≥20% decrease in glomerular filtration rate estimated with cystatin C.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Consistent with protocol-driven aggressive dosing of loop diuretics, participants received a median 560 mg IV furosemide equivalents (interquartile range, 300–815 mg), which induced a urine output of 8425 mL (interquartile range, 6341–10 528 mL) over the 72-hour intervention period. Levels of <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase and kidney injury molecule 1 did not change with aggressive diuresis (both <i>P</i>>0.59), whereas levels of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin decreased slightly (−8.7 ng/mg; interquartile range, −169 to 35 ng/mg; <i>P</i><0.001). WRF occurred in 21.2% of the population and was not associated with an increase in any marker of renal tubular injury: neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (<i>P</i>=0.21), <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase (<i>P</i>=0.46), or kidney injury molecule 1 (<i>P</i>=0.22). Increases in neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase, and kidney injury molecule 1 were paradoxically associated with improved survival (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.80 per 10 percentile increase; 95% confidence interval, 0.69–0.91; <i>P</i>=0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Kidney tubular injury does not appear to have an association with WRF in the context of aggressive diuresis of patients with acute heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e. These findings reinforce the notion that the small to moderate deteriorations in renal function commonly encountered with aggressive diuresis are dissimilar from traditional causes of acute kidney injury.</p></sec>

Cardiovascular Outcomes and Risks After Initiation of a Sodium Glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitor
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Clinical trials have shown cardiovascular benefits and potential risks from sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i). Trials may have limited ability to address individual end points or safety concerns.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed a population-based cohort study among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with established cardiovascular disease newly initiated on antihyperglycemic agents within the US Department of Defense Military Health System between April 1, 2013, and December 31, 2016. Incidence rates, hazard ratios (HRs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> to first composite end point of all-cause mortality and hospitalization for heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e event, major adverse cardiovascular events (defined as all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke), and individual end points were evaluated using conditional Cox models comparing new SGLT2i users with other antihyperglycemic agents. The exploratory safety end point was below-knee lower extremity amputation. Intent-to-treat and on-treatment analyses were performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>After propensity matching, 25 258 patients were followed for a median of 1.6 years. Compared with non-SGLT2i, initiation of SGLT2i was associated with a lower rate of all-cause mortality and hospitalization for heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e (1.73 versus 3.01 events per 100 person-years; HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.50–0.65) and major adverse cardiovascular events (2.31 versus 3.45 events per 100 person-years; HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.60–0.75). SGLT2i initiation was also associated with an ≈2-fold higher risk of below-knee lower extremity amputation (0.17 versus 0.09 events per 100 person-years; HR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.12–3.51). Because of the disproportionate canagliflozin exposure in the database, the majority of amputations were observed on canagliflozin. Results were consistent in the on-treatment analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In this high-risk cohort, initiation of SGLT2i was associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality, hospitalization for heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e, and major adverse cardiovascular events and higher risk of below-knee lower extremity amputation. Findings underscore the potential benefit and risks to be aware of when initiating SGLT2i. It remains unclear whether the below-knee lower extremity amputation risk extends across the class of medication, because the study was not powered to make comparisons among individual treatments.</p></sec>

Long-Term Potassium Monitoring and Dynamics in Heart Failure and Risk of Mortality
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The prognostic value of long-term potassium monitoring and dynamics in heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e has not been characterized completely. We sought to determine the association between serum potassium values collected at follow-up with all-cause mortality in a prospective and consecutive cohort of patients discharged from a previous acute heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e admission.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Serum potassium was measured at every physician-patient encounter, including hospital admissions and ambulatory settings. The multivariable-adjusted association of serum potassium with mortality was assessed by using comprehensive state-of-the-art regression methods that can accommodate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong>-dependent exposure modeling.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The study sample included 2164 patients with a total of 16 116 potassium observations. Mean potassium at discharge was 4.3±0.48 mEq/L. Hypokalemia (<3.5 mEq/L), normokalemia (3.5–5.0 mEq/L), and hyperkalemia (>5 mEq/L) were observed at the index admission in 77 (3.6%), 1965 (90.8%), and 122 (5.6%) patients, respectively. At a median follow-up of 2.8 years (range, 0.03–12.8 years), 1090 patients died (50.4%). On a continuous scale, the multivariable-adjusted association of potassium values and mortality revealed a nonlinear association (U-shaped) with higher risk at both ends of its distribution (omnibus <i>P</i>=0.001). Likewise, the adjusted hazard ratios for hypokalemia and hyperkalemia, normokalemia as reference, were 2.35 (95% confidence interval, 1.40–3.93; <i>P</i>=0.001) and 1.55 (95% confidence interval, 1.11–2.16; <i>P</i>=0.011), respectively (omnibus <i>P</i>=0.0003). Furthermore, dynamic changes in potassium were independently associated with substantial differences in mortality risk. Potassium normalization was independently associated with lower mortality risk (<i>P</i>=0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Either modeled continuously or categorically, serum potassium levels during long-term monitoring were independently associated with mortality in patients with heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e. Likewise, persistence of abnormal potassium levels was linked to a higher risk of death in comparison with patients who maintained or returned to normal values.</p></sec>

A Novel α-Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide Analogue Protects Against End-Organ Damage in Experimental Hypertension, Cardiac Hypertrophy, and Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Research into the therapeutic potential of α-calcitonin gene–related peptide (α-CGRP) has been limited because of its peptide nature and short half-life. Here, we evaluate whether a novel potent and long-lasting (<i>t</i><sub>½</sub> ≥7 hours) acylated α-CGRP analogue (αAnalogue) could alleviate and reverse cardiovascular disease in 2 distinct murine models of hypertension and heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e in vivo.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The ability of the αAnalogue to act selectively via the CGRP pathway was shown in skin by using a CGRP receptor antagonist. The effect of the αAnalogue on angiotensin II–induced hypertension was investigated over 14 days. Blood pressure was measured by radiotelemetry. The ability of the αAnalogue to modulate heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e was studied in an abdominal aortic constriction model of murine cardiac hypertrophy and heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e over 5 weeks. Extensive ex vivo analysis was performed via RNA analysis, Western blot, and histology.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The angiotensin II–induced hypertension was attenuated by cotreatment with the αAnalogue (50 nmol·kg<sup>–1</sup>·d<sup>–1</sup>, SC, at a dose selected for lack of long-term hypotensive effects at baseline). The αAnalogue protected against vascular, renal, and cardiac dysfunction, characterized by reduced hypertrophy and biomarkers of fibrosis, remodeling, inflammation, and oxidative stress. In a separate study, the αAnalogue reversed angiotensin II–induced hypertension and associated vascular and cardiac damage. The αAnalogue was effective over 5 weeks in a murine model of cardiac hypertrophy and heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e. It preserved heart function, assessed by echocardiography, while protecting against adverse cardiac remodeling and apoptosis. Moreover, treatment with the αAnalogue was well tolerated with neither signs of desensitization nor behavioral changes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These findings, in 2 distinct models, provide the first evidence for the therapeutic potential of a stabilized αAnalogue, by mediating (1) antihypertensive effects, (2) attenuating cardiac remodeling, and (3) increasing angiogenesis and cell survival to protect against and limit damage associated with the progression of cardiovascular diseases. This indicates the therapeutic potential of the CGRP pathway and the possibility that this injectable CGRP analogue may be effective in cardiac disease.</p></sec>

The Optimal Timing of Stage 2 Palliation for Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In infants requiring 3-stage single-ventricle palliation for hypoplastic left heart syndrome, attrition after the Norwood procedure remains significant. The effect of the timing of stage 2 palliation (S2P), a physician-modifiable factor, on long-term survival is not well understood. We hypothesized that an optimal interval between the Norwood and S2P that both minimizes pre-S2P attrition and maximizes post-S2P survival exists and is associated with individual patient characteristics.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The National Institutes of Health/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Pediatric Heart Network Single Ventricle Reconstruction Trial public data set was used. Transplant-free survival (TFS) was modeled from (1) Norwood to S2P and (2) S2P to 3 years by using parametric hazard analysis. Factors associated with death or heart transplantation were determined for each interval. To account for staged procedures, risk-adjusted, 3-year, post-Norwood TFS (the probability of TFS at 3 years given survival to S2P) was calculated using parametric conditional survival analysis. TFS from the Norwood to S2P was first predicted. TFS after S2P to 3 years was then predicted and adjusted for attrition before S2P by multiplying by the estimate of TFS to S2P. The optimal timing of S2P was determined by generating nomograms of risk-adjusted, 3-year, post-Norwood, TFS versus the interval from the Norwood to S2P.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 547 included patients, 399 survived to S2P (73%). Of the survivors to S2P, 349 (87%) survived to 3-year follow-up. The median interval from the Norwood to S2P was 5.1 (interquartile range, 4.1–6.0) months. The risk-adjusted, 3-year, TFS was 68±7%. A Norwood-S2P interval of 3 to 6 months was associated with greatest 3-year TFS overall and in patients with few risk factors. In patients with multiple risk factors, TFS was severely compromised, regardless of the timing of S2P and most severely when S2P was performed early. No difference in the optimal timing of S2P existed when stratified by shunt type.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In infants with few risk factors, progressing to S2P at 3 to 6 months after the Norwood procedure was associated with maximal TFS. Early S2P did not rescue patients with greater risk factor burdens. Instead, referral for heart transplantation may offer their best chance at long-term survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

High-Resolution Mapping of Chromatin Conformation in Cardiac Myocytes Reveals Structural Remodeling of the Epigenome in Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiovascular disease is associated with epigenomic changes in the heart; however, the endogenous structure of cardiac myocyte chromatin has never been determined.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To investigate the mechanisms of epigenomic function in the heart, genome-wide chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) and DNA sequencing were performed in adult cardiac myocytes following development of pressure overload–induced hypertrophy. Mice with cardiac-specific deletion of CTCF (a ubiquitous chromatin structural protein) were generated to explore the role of this protein in chromatin structure and cardiac phenotype. Transcriptome analyses by RNA-seq were conducted as a functional readout of the epigenomic structural changes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Depletion of CTCF was sufficient to induce heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e in mice, and human patients with heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e receiving mechanical unloading via left ventricular assist devices show increased CTCF abundance. Chromatin structural analyses revealed interactions within the cardiac myocyte genome at 5-kb resolution, enabling examination of intra- and interchromosomal events, and providing a resource for future cardiac epigenomic investigations. Pressure overload or CTCF depletion selectively altered boundary strength between topologically associating domains and A/B compartmentalization, measurements of genome accessibility. Heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e involved decreased stability of chromatin interactions around disease-causing genes. In addition, pressure overload or CTCF depletion remodeled long-range interactions of cardiac enhancers, resulting in a significant decrease in local chromatin interactions around these functional elements.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These findings provide a high-resolution chromatin architecture resource for cardiac epigenomic investigations and demonstrate that global structural remodeling of chromatin underpins heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e. The newly identified principles of endogenous chromatin structure have key implications for epigenetic therapy.</p></sec>

Prognostic Value of N-Terminal Pro-B-Type Natriuretic Peptide, Troponin-T, and Growth-Differentiation Factor 15 in Adult Congenital Heart Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The number of patients with adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) is rapidly increasing. To optimize patient management, there is a great need to accurately identify high-risk patients. Still, no biomarker has been firmly established as a clinically useful prognostic tool in this group. We studied the association of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), high-sensitive troponin-T, and growth-differentiation factor 15 with cardiovascular events in ACHD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Clinically stable patients with ACHD who routinely visited the outpatient clinic between April 2011 and April 2013 underwent clinical assessment, electrocardiography, echocardiography, and biomarker measurement (NT-proBNP, high-sensitive troponin-T, and growth-differentiation factor 15) at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">time</span></strong> of study inclusion. Patients were prospectively followed for the occurrence of cardiovascular events (death, heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e, hospitalization, arrhythmia, thromboembolic events, and reintervention). Survival curves were derived by the Kaplan-Meier method, and Cox regression was performed to investigate the relation between biomarkers and events with adjustment for multiple clinical and echocardiographic variables.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In total, 595 patients were included (median age, 33 years; interquartile range, 25–41 years; 58% male; 90% New York Heart Association class I). Patients were followed during a median of 42 (interquartile range, 37–46) months. Of the 3 evaluated biomarkers, NT-proBNP in the upper quartile (>33.3 pmol/L) was most strongly associated with cardiovascular events (n=165, adjusted hazard ratio, 9.05 [3.24–25.3], <i>P</i><0.001) and with death or heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e (n=50, adjusted hazard ratio, 16.0 [2.04–126], <i>P</i><0.001). When NT-proBNP was analyzed as a continuous variable, similar findings were retrieved. The cumulative proportion of patients with death and heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e was only 1% in the lowest 2 NT-proBNP quartiles. Elevated NT-proBNP (>14 pmol/L), elevated high-sensitive troponin-T (>14 ng/L), and elevated growth-differentiation factor 15 (>1109 ng/L) identified those patients at highest risk of cardiovascular events (log-rank <i>P</i><0.0001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>NT-proBNP provides prognostic information beyond a conventional risk marker model in patients with ACHD and can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reliabl</span></strong>y exclude the risk of death and heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e. Elevated levels of NT-proBNP, high-sensitive troponin-T, and growth-differentiation factor 15 identify patients at highest risk of cardiovascular events. These biomarkers therefore may play an important role in the monitoring and management of patients with ACHD.</p></sec>

Ethane/ethylene separation in a metal-organic framework with iron-peroxo sites
<p>The separation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>e from its corresponding ethylene is an important, challenging, and energy-intensive process in the chemical industry. Here we report a microporous metal-organic framework, iron(III) peroxide 2,5-dioxido-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate [Fe<sub>2</sub>(O<sub>2</sub>)(dobdc) (dobdc<sup>4−</sup>: 2,5-dioxido-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate)], with iron (Fe)–peroxo sites for the preferential binding of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>e over ethylene and thus highly selective separation of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>/C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>. Neutron powder diffraction studies and theoretical calculations demonstrate the key role of Fe-peroxo sites for the recognition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>e. The high performance of Fe<sub>2</sub>(O<sub>2</sub>)(dobdc) for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>e/ethylene separation has been validated by gas sorption isotherms, ideal adsorbed solution theory calculations, and simulated and experimental breakthrough curves. Through a fixed-bed column packed with this porous material, polymer-grade ethylene (99.99% pure) can be straightforwardly produced from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>e/ethylene mixtures during the first adsorption cycle, demonstrating the potential of Fe<sub>2</sub>(O<sub>2</sub>)(dobdc) for this important industrial separation with a low energy cost under ambient conditions.</p>

Selective functionalization of methane, ethane, and higher alkanes by cerium photocatalysis
<p>With the recent soaring production of natural gas, the use of m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>e and other light hydrocarbon feedstocks as starting materials in synthetic transformations is becoming increasingly economically attractive, although it remains chemically challenging. We report the development of photocatalytic C–H amination, alkylation, and arylation of m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>e, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>e, and higher alkanes under visible light irradiation at ambient temperature. High catalytic efficiency (turnover numbers up to 2900 for m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>e and 9700 for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>e) and selectivity were achieved using abundant, inexpensive cerium salts as photocatalysts. Ligand-to-metal charge transfer excitation generated alkoxy radicals from simple alcohols that in turn acted as hydrogen atom transfer catalysts. The mixed-phase gas/liquid reaction was adapted to continuous flow, enabling the efficient use of gaseous feedstocks in scalable photocatalytic transformations.</p>

Low-temperature activation of methane on the IrO<sub>2</sub>(110) surface
<p>M<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>e undergoes highly facile C–H bond cleavage on the stoichiometric IrO<sub>2</sub>(110) surface. From temperature-programmed reaction spectroscopy experiments, we found that m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>e molecularly adsorbed as a strongly bound σ complex on IrO<sub>2</sub>(110) and that a large fraction of the adsorbed complexes underwent C–H bond cleavage at temperatures as low as 150 kelvin (K). The initial dissociation probability of m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>e on IrO<sub>2</sub>(110) decreased from 80 to 20% with increasing surface temperature from 175 to 300 K. We estimate that the activation energy for m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>e C–H bond cleavage is 9.5 kilojoule per mole (kJ/mol) lower than the binding energy of the adsorbed precursor on IrO<sub>2</sub>(110), and equal to a value of ~28.5 kJ/mol. Low-temperature activation may avoid unwanted side reactions in the development of catalytic processes to selectively convert m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>e to value-added products.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Cuticle Biosynthesis in Tomato Leaves Is Developmentally Regulated by Abscisic Acid
<p>The expansion of aerial organs in plants is coupled with the synthesis and deposition of a hydrophobic cuticle, composed of cutin and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wax</span></strong>es, which is critically important in limiting water loss. While the abiotic stress-related hormone abscisic acid (ABA) is known to up-regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wax</span></strong> accumulation in response to drought, the hormonal regulation of cuticle biosynthesis during organ ontogeny is poorly understood. To address the hypothesis that ABA also mediates cuticle formation during organ development, we assessed the effect of ABA deficiency on cuticle formation in three ABA biosynthesis-impaired tomato mutants. The mutant leaf cuticles were thinner, had structural abnormalities, and had a substantial reduction in levels of cutin. ABA deficiency also consistently resulted in differences in the composition of leaf cutin and cuticular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wax</span></strong>es. Exogenous application of ABA partially rescued these phenotypes, confirming that they were a consequence of reduced ABA levels. The ABA mutants also showed reduced expression of genes involved in cutin or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wax</span></strong> formation. This difference was again countered by exogenous ABA, further indicating regulation of cuticle biosynthesis by ABA. The fruit cuticles were affected differently by the ABA-associated mutations, but in general were thicker. However, no structural abnormalities were observed, and the cutin and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wax</span></strong> compositions were less affected than in leaf cuticles, suggesting that ABA action influences cuticle formation in an organ-dependent manner. These results suggest dual roles for ABA in regulating leaf cuticle formation: one that is fundamentally associated with leaf expansion, independent of abiotic stress, and another that is drought induced.</p>

A <i>β</i>-Ketoacyl-CoA Synthase Is Involved in Rice Leaf Cuticular Wax Synthesis and Requires a CER2-LIKE Protein as a Cofactor
<p>Cuticular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wax</span></strong>es are complex mixtures of very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) and their derivatives, forming a natural barrier on aerial surfaces of terrestrial plants against biotic and abiotic stresses. In VLCFA biosynthesis, β-ketoacyl-CoA synthase (KCS) is the key enzyme, catalyzing the first reaction in fatty acid elongation and determining substrate specificity. We isolated a rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wax</span></strong> crystal-sparse leaf 4</i> (<i>WSL4</i>) gene using a map-based cloning strategy. <i>WSL4</i> is predicted to encode a KCS, a homolog of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) CER6. Complementation of the mutant <i>wsl4-1</i> with <i>WSL4</i> genomic DNA rescued the cuticular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wax</span></strong>-deficient phenotype, confirming the function of <i>WSL4</i>. The load of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wax</span></strong> components longer than 30 carbons (C30) and C28 were reduced markedly in <i>wsl4-1</i> and <i>wsl4-2</i> mutants, respectively. Overexpression of <i>WSL4</i> increased the cuticular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wax</span></strong> load in rice leaves. We further isolated a cofactor of WSL4, OsCER2, a homolog of Arabidopsis CER2, by coimmunoprecipitation and confirmed their physical interaction by split-ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid experiments. Expression of <i>WSL4</i> alone in <i>elo3</i> yeast cells resulted in increased C24 but did not produce VLCFAs of greater length, whereas expressing <i>OsCER2</i> alone showed no effect. Coexpression of <i>WSL4</i> and <i>OsCER2</i> in <i>elo3</i> yeast cells yielded fatty acids up to C30. OsCER2 with a mutated HxxxD motif (H172E, D176A, and D176H) interrupted its interaction with WSL4 and failed to elongate VLCFAs past C24 when expressed with WSL4 in <i>elo3</i> yeast cells. These results demonstrated that WSL4 was involved in VLCFA elongation beyond C22 and that elongation beyond C24 required the participation of OsCER2.</p>

Particulate methane monooxygenase contains only mononuclear copper centers
<p>Bacteria that oxidize m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>e to m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>ol are central to mitigating emissions of m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>e, a potent greenhouse gas. The nature of the copper active site in the primary metabolic enzyme of these bacteria, particulate m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>e monooxygenase (pMMO), has been controversial owing to seemingly contradictory biochemical, spectroscopic, and crystallographic results. We present biochemical and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopic characterization most consistent with two monocopper sites within pMMO: one in the soluble PmoB subunit at the previously assigned active site (Cu<sub>B</sub>) and one ~2 nanometers away in the membrane-bound PmoC subunit (Cu<sub>C</sub>). On the basis of these results, we propose that a monocopper site is able to catalyze m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>e oxidation in pMMO.</p>

Aqueous Au-Pd colloids catalyze selective CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation to CH<sub>3</sub>OH with O<sub>2</sub> under mild conditions
<p>The selective oxidation of m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>e, the primary component of natural gas, remains an important challenge in catalysis. We used colloidal gold-palladium nanoparticles, rather than the same nanoparticles supported on titanium oxide, to oxidize m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>e to m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>ol with high selectivity (92%) in aqueous solution at mild temperatures. Then, using isotopically labeled oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) as an oxidant in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)<sub>,</sub> we demonstrated that the resulting m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>ol incorporated a substantial fraction (70%) of gas-phase O<sub>2</sub>. More oxygenated products were formed than the amount of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> consumed, suggesting that the controlled breakdown of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> activates m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>e, which subsequently incorporates molecular oxygen through a radical process. If a source of methyl radicals can be established, then the selective oxidation of m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>e to m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>ol using molecular oxygen is possible.</p>

Selective anaerobic oxidation of methane enables direct synthesis of methanol

The activation in helium at 673 kelvin (K), followed by consecutive catalyst exposures to 7 bars of m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>e and then water at 473 K, consistently produced 0.204 mole of CH<sub>3</sub>OH per mole of copper in zeolite. Isotopic labeling confirmed water as the source of oxygen to regenerate the zeolite active centers and renders m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>ol desorption energetically favorable. On the basis of in situ x-ray absorption spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations, we propose a mechanism involving m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>e oxidation at Cu<sup>II</sup> oxide active centers, followed by Cu<sup>I</sup> reoxidation by water with concurrent formation of hydrogen.</p>

Methane production from coal by a single methanogen
<p>Coal-bed m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>e is one of the largest unconventional natural gas resources. Although microbial activity may greatly contribute to coal-bed m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>e formation, it is unclear whether the complex aromatic organic compounds present in coal can be used for m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>ogenesis. We show that deep subsurface–derived <i>Methermicoccus</i> m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>ogens can produce m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>e from more than 30 types of methoxylated aromatic compounds (MACs) as well as from coals containing MACs. In contrast to known m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>ogenesis pathways involving one- and two-carbon compounds, this “methoxydotrophic” mode of m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>ogenesis couples <i>O</i>-demethylation, CO<sub>2</sub> reduction, and possibly acetyl–coenzyme A metabolism. Because MACs derived from lignin may occur widely in subsurface sediments, methoxydotrophic m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>ogenesis would play an important role in the formation of natural gas not limited to coal-bed m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>e and in the global carbon cycle.</p>

Background levels of methane in Mars’ atmosphere show strong seasonal variations
<p>Variable levels of m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>e in the martian atmosphere have eluded explanation partly because the measurements are not repeatable in time or location.

This variation is greater than that predicted from either ultraviolet degradation of impact-delivered organics on the surface or from the annual surface pressure cycle. The large seasonal variation in the background and occurrences of higher temporary spikes (~7 ppbv) are consistent with small localized sources of m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>e released from martian surface or subsurface reservoirs.</p>

Catalytic molten metals for the direct conversion of methane to hydrogen and separable carbon

Massive blow-out craters formed by hydrate-controlled methane expulsion from the Arctic seafloor
<p>Widespread m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>e release from thawing Arctic gas hydrates is a major concern, yet the processes, sources, and fluxes involved remain unconstrained. We present geophysical data documenting a cluster of kilometer-wide craters and mounds from the Barents Sea floor associated with large-scale m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>e expulsion. Combined with ice sheet/gas hydrate modeling, our results indicate that during glaciation, natural gas migrated from underlying hydrocarbon reservoirs and was sequestered extensively as subglacial gas hydrates. Upon ice sheet retreat, m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>e from this hydrate reservoir concentrated in massive mounds before being abruptly released to form craters. We propose that these processes were likely widespread across past glaciated petroleum provinces and that they also provide an analog for the potential future destabilization of subglacial gas hydrate reservoirs beneath contemporary ice sheets.</p>

Assessment of methane emissions from the U.S. oil and gas supply chain
<p>M<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>e emissions from the U.S. oil and natural gas supply chain were estimated by using ground-based, facility-scale measurements and validated with aircraft observations in areas accounting for ~30% of U.S. gas production. When scaled up nationally, our facility-based estimate of 2015 supply chain emissions is 13 ± 2 teragrams per year, equivalent to 2.3% of gross U.S. gas production. This value is ~60% higher than the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency inventory estimate, likely because existing inventory methods miss emissions released during abnormal operating conditions. M<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>e emissions of this magnitude, per unit of natural gas consumed, produce radiative forcing over a 20-year time horizon comparable to the CO<sub>2</sub> from natural gas combustion. Substantial emission reductions are feasible through rapid detection of the root causes of high emissions and deployment of less failure-prone systems.</p>

Next, a primitive homolog of nitrogenase mediates a six-electron reduction and γ-lactamization reaction before a Mur ligase homolog forms the six-membered carbocyclic ring in the final step of the pathway.

The Arabidopsis <i>cer17</i> mutant was completely deficient in these monounsaturated alcohols, and <i>CER17</i> was found to encode a predicted ACYL-COENZYME A DESATURASE LIKE4 (ADS4). Studies of the Arabidopsis <i>cer4</i> mutant and yeast variously expressing <i>CER4</i> (a predicted fatty acyl-CoA reductase) with <i>CER17/ADS4</i>, demonstrated <i>CER4</i>’s principal role in synthesis of these monounsaturated alcohols. Besides unsaturated alcohol deficiency, <i>cer17</i> mutants exhibited a thickened and irregular cuticle ultrastructure and increased amounts of cutin monomers. Although unsaturated alcohols were absent throughout the <i>cer17</i> stem, the mutation’s effects on cutin monomers and cuticle ultrastructure were much more severe in distal than basal stems, consistent with observations that the <i>CER17/ADS4</i> transcript was much more abundant in distal than basal stems. Furthermore, distal but not basal stems of a double mutant deficient for both CER17/ADS4 and LONG-CHAIN ACYL-COA SYNTHETASE1 produced even more cutin monomers and a thicker and more disorganized cuticle ultrastructure and higher cuticle permeability than observed for wild type or either mutant parent, indicating a dramatic genetic interaction on conversion of very long chain acyl-CoA precursors. These results provide evidence that CER17/ADS4 performs <i>n</i>-6 desaturation of very long chain acyl-CoAs in both distal and basal stems and has a major function associated with governing cutin monomer amounts primarily in the distal segments of the inflorescence stem.</p>

IRREGULAR POLLEN EXINE1 Is a Novel Factor in Anther Cuticle and Pollen Exine Formation

Transcripts of <i>IPE1</i> were preferentially accumulated in the tapetum during the tetrad and early uninucleate microspore stage. A biochemical assay indicated that <i>ipe1</i> anthers had altered constituents of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wax</span></strong> and a significant reduction of cutin monomers and fatty acids. RNA sequencing data revealed that genes implicated in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wax</span></strong> and flavonoid metabolism, fatty acid synthesis, and elongation were differentially expressed in <i>ipe1</i> mutant anthers. In addition, the analysis of transfer DNA insertional lines of the orthologous gene in Arabidopsis suggested that IPE1 and their orthologs have a partially conserved function in male organ development. Our results showed that IPE1 participates in the putative oxidative pathway of C16/C18 ω-hydroxy fatty acids and controls anther cuticle and pollen exine development together with MALE STERILITY26 and MALE STERILITY45 in maize.</p>

Electrified methane reforming: A compact approach to greener industrial hydrogen production
<p>Electrification of conventionally fired chemical reactors has the potential to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and provide flexible and compact heat generation. Here, we describe a disruptive approach to a fundamental process by integrating an electrically heated catalytic structure directly into a steam-m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>e–reforming (SMR) reactor for hydrogen production. Intimate contact between the electric heat source and the reaction site drives the reaction close to thermal equilibrium, increases catalyst utilization, and limits unwanted byproduct formation. The integrated design with small characteristic length scales allows compact reactor designs, potentially 100 times smaller than current reformer platforms. Electrification of SMR offers a strong platform for new reactor design, scale, and implementation opportunities. Implemented on a global scale, this could correspond to a reduction of nearly 1% of all CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>

Design and control of gas diffusion process in a nanoporous soft crystal
<p>Design of the gas-diffusion process in a porous material is challenging because a contracted pore aperture is a prerequisite, whereas the channel traffic of guest molecules is regulated by the flexible and dynamic motions of nanochannels. Here, we present the rational design of a diffusion-regulatory system in a porous coordination polymer (PCP) in which flip-flop molecular motions within the framework structure provide kinetic gate functions that enable efficient gas separation and storage. The PCP shows substantial temperature-responsive adsorption in which the adsorbate molecules are differentiated by each gate-admission temperature, facilitating kinetics-based gas separations of oxygen/argon and ethylene/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>e with high selectivities of ~350 and ~75, respectively. Additionally, we demonstrate the long-lasting physical encapsulation of ethylene at ambient conditions, owing to strongly impeded diffusion in distinctive nanochannels.</p>

Neonicotinoid exposure disrupts bumblebee nest behavior, social networks, and thermoregulation
<p>Neonicotinoid pesticides can negatively affect bee colonies, but the behavioral mechanisms by which these compounds impair colony growth remain unclear. Here, we investigate imidacloprid’s effects on bumblebee worker behavior within the nest, using an automated, robotic platform for continuous, multicolony monitoring of uniquely identified workers. We find that exposure to field-realistic levels of imidacloprid impairs nursing and alters social and spatial dynamics within nests, but that these effects vary substantially with time of day. In the field, imidacloprid impairs colony thermoregulation, including the construction of an insulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wax</span></strong> canopy. Our results show that neonicotinoids induce widespread disruption of within-nest worker behavior that may contribute to impaired growth, highlighting the potential of automated techniques for characterizing the multifaceted, dynamic impacts of stressors on behavior in bee colonies.</p>

Chemical interactions between Saturn’s atmosphere and its rings
<p>The Pioneer and Voyager spacecraft made close-up measurements of Saturn’s ionosphere and upper atmosphere in the 1970s and 1980s that suggested a chemical interaction between the rings and atmosphere. Exploring this interaction provides information on ring composition and the influence on Saturn’s atmosphere from infalling material. The Cassini Ion Neutral Mass Spectrometer sampled in situ the region between the D ring and Saturn during the spacecraft’s Grand Finale phase. We used these measurements to characterize the atmospheric structure and material influx from the rings. The atmospheric He/H<sub>2</sub> ratio is 10 to 16%. Volatile compounds from the rings (m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>e; carbon monoxide and/or molecular nitrogen), as well as larger organic-bearing grains, are flowing inward at a rate of 4800 to 45,000 kilograms per second.</p>

Zeolitic imidazolate framework membranes made by ligand-induced permselectivation
<p>Zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) membranes are emerging as a promising energy-efficient separation technology. However, their reliable and scalable manufacturing remains a challenge. We demonstrate the fabrication of ZIF nanocomposite membranes by means of an all-vapor-phase processing method based on atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZnO in a porous support followed by ligand-vapor treatment. After ALD, the obtained nanocomposite exhibits low flux and is not selective, whereas after ligand-vapor (2-methylimidazole) treatment, it is partially transformed to ZIF and shows stable performance with high mixture separation factor for propylene over <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">propan</span></strong>e (an energy-intensive high-volume separation) and high propylene flux. Membrane synthesis through ligand-induced permselectivation of a nonselective and impermeable deposit is shown to be simple and highly reproducible and holds promise for scalability.</p>

Dunes on Pluto
<p>The surface of Pluto is more geologically diverse and dynamic than had been expected, but the role of its tenuous atmosphere in shaping the landscape remains unclear. We describe observations from the New Horizons spacecraft of regularly spaced, linear ridges whose morphology, distribution, and orientation are consistent with being transverse dunes. These are located close to mountainous regions and are orthogonal to nearby wind streaks. We demonstrate that the wavelength of the dunes (~0.4 to 1 kilometer) is best explained by the deposition of sand-sized (~200 to ~300 micrometer) particles of m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>e ice in moderate winds (<10 meters per second). The undisturbed morphology of the dunes, and relationships with the underlying convective glacial ice, imply that the dunes have formed in the very recent geological past.</p>

Cobalt-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of enamides enabled by single-electron reduction
<p>Identifying catalyst activation modes that exploit one-electron chemistry and overcome associated deactivation pathways will be transformative for developing first-row transition metal catalysts with performance equal or, ideally, superior to precious metals. Here we describe a zinc-activation method compatible with high-throughput reaction discovery that identified scores of cobalt-phosphine combinations for the asymmetric hydrogenation of functionalized alkenes. An optimized catalyst prepared from (<i>R</i>,<i>R</i>)-Ph-BPE {Ph-BPE, 1,2-bis[(2<i>R</i>,5<i>R</i>)-2,5-diphenylphospholano]<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>e} and cobalt chloride [CoCl<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O] exhibited high activity and enantioselectivity in protic media and enabled the asymmetric synthesis of the epilepsy medication levetiracetam at 200-gram scale with 0.08 mole % catalyst loading. Stoichiometric studies established that the cobalt (II) catalyst precursor (<i>R</i>,<i>R</i>)-Ph-BPECoCl<sub>2</sub> underwent ligand displacement by m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>ol, and zinc promoted facile one-electron reduction to cobalt (I), which more stably bound the phosphine.</p>

Making room for new memories
<p>What are our memories made of? Plato suggested imagining a block of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wax</span></strong> in our soul, where perceptions and thoughts leave impressions that we can remember as long as they have not been erased. This historic metaphor captures the transience of some memories and the stability of others, and it illustrates the brain's plasticity. The mechanisms of memory formation and retention remain a key question in neuroscience. Groundbreaking work on the rodent hippocampus (a network in the temporal lobe) revealed that certain neurons form transiently stable representations of places (<i>1</i>). Hence, this brain region has become an important focus for studying spatial memory (or engram) formation. It also serves as an experimentally accessible proxy for declarative (knowledge) and episodic (experience) memory in humans, which involves the same brain structures and mechanisms. However, how can we remember an almost infinite number of items with the limited storage capacity of the hippocampus? There is good evidence that relevant representations are transferred to neocortical networks before forming long-lasting engrams. The hippocampus is then reset for acquisition of new memories. Studies in animals (<i>2</i>) and humans (<i>3</i>) show that neuronal activity during sleep plays a major role in these processes. The underlying mechanisms, however, have remained mostly enigmatic. On page 1524 of this issue, Norimoto <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) show how sleep-associated activity patterns induce “negative” neuronal plasticity in the hippocampus, erasing remote memories. A previous, related paper by Khodagholy <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) reveals similar activity patterns in the neocortex, which, hence, may mediate long-term consolidation of transient engrams at their final location.</p>

Methanogenic heterodisulfide reductase (HdrABC-MvhAGD) uses two noncubane [4Fe-4S] clusters for reduction
<p>In m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>ogenic archaea, the carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) fixation and m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>e-forming steps are linked through the heterodisulfide reductase (HdrABC)–[NiFe]-hydrogenase (MvhAGD) complex that uses flavin-based electron bifurcation to reduce ferredoxin and the heterodisulfide of coenzymes M and B. Here, we present the structure of the native heterododecameric HdrABC-MvhAGD complex at 2.15-angstrom resolution. HdrB contains two noncubane [4Fe-4S] clusters composed of fused [3Fe-4S]-[2Fe-2S] units sharing 1 iron (Fe) and 1 sulfur (S), which were coordinated at the CCG motifs. Soaking experiments showed that the heterodisulfide is clamped between the two noncubane [4Fe-4S] clusters and homolytically cleaved, forming coenzyme M and B bound to each iron. Coenzymes are consecutively released upon one-by-one electron transfer. The HdrABC-MvhAGD atomic model serves as a structural template for numerous HdrABC homologs involved in diverse microbial metabolic pathways.</p>

Cassini finds molecular hydrogen in the Enceladus plume: Evidence for hydrothermal processes
<p>Saturn’s moon Enceladus has an ice-covered ocean; a plume of material erupts from cracks in the ice. The plume contains chemical signatures of water-rock interaction between the ocean and a rocky core. We used the Ion Neutral Mass Spectrometer onboard the Cassini spacecraft to detect molecular hydrogen in the plume. By using the instrument’s open-source mode, background processes of hydrogen production in the instrument were minimized and quantified, enabling the identification of a statistically significant signal of hydrogen native to Enceladus. We find that the most plausible source of this hydrogen is ongoing hydrothermal reactions of rock containing reduced minerals and organic materials. The relatively high hydrogen abundance in the plume signals thermodynamic disequilibrium that favors the formation of m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>e from CO<sub>2</sub> in Enceladus’ ocean.</p>

Arylation of hydrocarbons enabled by organosilicon reagents and weakly coordinating anions
<p>Over the past 80 years, phenyl cation intermediates have been implicated in a variety of C–H arylation reactions. Although these examples have inspired several theoretical and mechanistic studies, aryl cation equivalents have received limited attention in organic methodology. Their high-energy, promiscuous reactivity profiles have hampered applications in selective intermolecular processes. We report a reaction design that overcomes these challenges. Specifically, we found that β-silicon–stabilized aryl cation equivalents, generated via silylium-mediated fluoride activation, undergo insertion into sp<sup>3</sup> and sp<sup>2</sup> C–H bonds. This reaction manifold provides a framework for the catalytic arylation of hydrocarbons, including simple alkanes such as m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>e. This process uses low loadings of Earth-abundant initiators (1 to 5 mole percent) and occurs under mild conditions (30° to 100°C).</p>

Volcanic tremor and plume height hysteresis from Pavlof Volcano, Alaska
<p>The March 2016 eruption of Pavlof Volcano, Alaska, produced an ash plume that caused the cancellation of more than 100 flights in North America. The eruption generated strong tremor that was recorded by seismic and remote low-frequency acoustic (infrasound) stations, including the EarthScope Transportable Array. The relationship between the tremor amplitudes and plume height changes considerably between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wax</span></strong>ing and waning portions of the eruption. Similar hysteresis has been observed between seismic river noise and discharge during storms, suggesting that flow and erosional processes in both rivers and volcanoes can produce irreversible structural changes that are detectable in geophysical data. We propose that the time-varying relationship at Pavlof arose from changes in the tremor source related to volcanic vent erosion. This relationship may improve estimates of volcanic emissions and characterization of eruption size and intensity.</p>

Large gem diamonds from metallic liquid in Earth’s deep mantle
<p>The redox state of Earth’s convecting mantle, masked by the lithospheric plates and basaltic magmatism of plate tectonics, is a key unknown in the evolutionary history of our planet. Here we report that large, exceptional gem diamonds like the Cullinan, Constellation, and Koh-i-Noor carry direct evidence of crystallization from a redox-sensitive metallic liquid phase in the deep mantle. These sublithospheric diamonds contain inclusions of solidified iron-nickel-carbon-sulfur melt, accompanied by a thin fluid layer of m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>e ± hydrogen, and sometimes majoritic garnet or former calcium silicate perovskite. The metal-dominated mineral assemblages and reduced volatiles in large gem diamonds indicate formation under metal-saturated conditions. We verify previous predictions that Earth has highly reducing deep mantle regions capable of precipitating a metallic iron phase that contains dissolved carbon and hydrogen.</p>

The methanogenic CO<sub>2</sub> reducing-and-fixing enzyme is bifunctional and contains 46 [4Fe-4S] clusters
<p>Biological m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>e formation starts with a challenging adenosine triphosphate (ATP)–independent carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) fixation process. We explored this enzymatic process by solving the x-ray crystal structure of formyl-m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>ofuran dehydrogenase, determined here as Fwd(ABCDFG)<sub>2</sub> and Fwd(ABCDFG)<sub>4</sub> complexes, from <i>M<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>othermobacter wolfeii</i>. The latter 800-kilodalton apparatus consists of four peripheral catalytic sections and an electron-supplying core with 46 electronically coupled [4Fe-4S] clusters. Catalysis is separately performed by subunits FwdBD (FwdB and FwdD), which are related to tungsten-containing formate dehydrogenase, and subunit FwdA, a binuclear metal center carrying amidohydrolase. CO<sub>2</sub> is first reduced to formate in FwdBD, which then diffuses through a 43-angstrom-long tunnel to FwdA, where it condenses with m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>ofuran to formyl-m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethan</span></strong>ofuran. The arrangement of [4Fe-4S] clusters functions as an electron relay but potentially also couples the four tungstopterin active sites over 206 angstroms.</p>

<i>Defective Pollen Wall 2</i> (<i>DPW2</i>) Encodes an Acyl Transferase Required for Rice Pollen Development
<p>Aliphatic and aromatic lipids are both essential structural components of the plant cuticle, an important interface between the plant and environment. Although cross links between aromatic and aliphatic or other moieties are known to be associated with the formation of leaf cutin and root and seed suberin, the contribution of aromatic lipids to the biosynthesis of anther cuticles and pollen walls remains elusive. In this study, we characterized the rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) male sterile mutant, <i>defective pollen wall 2</i> (<i>dpw2</i>), which showed an abnormal anther cuticle, a defective pollen wall, and complete male sterility. Compared with the wild type, <i>dpw2</i> anthers have increased amounts of cutin and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wax</span></strong>es and decreased levels of lipidic and phenolic compounds. <i>DPW2</i> encodes a cytoplasmically localized BAHD acyltransferase. In vitro assays demonstrated that recombinant DPW2 specifically transfers hydroxycinnamic acid moieties, using ω-hydroxy fatty acids as acyl acceptors and hydroxycinnamoyl-CoAs as acyl donors. Thus, The cytoplasmic hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:ω-hydroxy fatty acid transferase DPW2 plays a fundamental role in male reproduction via the biosynthesis of key components of the anther cuticle and pollen wall.</p>

The Nonspecific Lipid Transfer Protein AtLtpI-4 Is Involved in Suberin Formation of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> Crown Galls
<p>Nonspecific lipid transfer proteins reversibly bind different types of lipid molecules in a hydrophobic cavity. They facilitate phospholipid transfer between membranes in vitro, play a role in cuticle and possibly in suberin formation, and might be involved in plant pathogen defense signaling. This study focuses on the role of the lipid transfer protein <i>AtLTPI-4</i> in crown gall development. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) crown gall tumors, which develop upon infection with the virulent <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i> strain C58, highly expressed <i>AtLTPI-4</i>. Crown galls of the <i>atltpI-4</i> loss-of-function mutant were much smaller compared with those of wild-type plants. The gene expression pattern and localization of the protein to the plasma membrane pointed to a function of AtLTPI-4 in cell wall suberization. Since Arabidopsis crown galls are covered by a suberin-containing periderm instead of a cuticle, we analyzed the suberin composition of crown galls and found a reduction in the amounts of long-chain fatty acids (C<sub>18:0</sub>) in the <i>atltpI-4</i> mutant. To demonstrate the impact of AtLtpI-4 on extracellular lipid composition, we expressed the protein in Arabidopsis epidermis cells. This led to a significant increase in the very-long-chain fatty acids C<sub>24</sub> and C<sub>26</sub> in the cuticular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wax</span></strong> fraction. Homology modeling and lipid-protein-overlay assays showed that AtLtpI-4 protein can bind these very-long-chain fatty acids. Thus, AtLtpI-4 protein may facilitate the transfer of long-chain as well as very-long-chain fatty acids into the apoplast, depending on the cell type in which it is expressed. In crown galls, which endogenously express AtLtpI-4, it is involved in suberin formation.</p>

Histopathology reveals correlative and unique phenotypes in a high-throughput mouse phenotyping screen
<p>The Mouse Genetics Project (MGP) at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute aims to generate and phenotype over 800 genetically modified mouse lines over the next 5 years to gain a better understanding of mammalian gene function and provide an invaluable resource to the scientific community for follow-up studies. Phenotyping includes the generation of a standardized biobank of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">paraffin</span></strong>-embedded tissues for each mouse line, but histopathology is not routinely performed. In collaboration with the Pathology Core of the Centre for Modeling Human Disease (CMHD) we report the utility of histopathology in a high-throughput primary phenotyping screen. Histopathology was assessed in an unbiased selection of 50 mouse lines with (<i>n</i>=30) or without (<i>n</i>=20) clinical phenotypes detected by the standard MGP primary phenotyping screen. Our findings revealed that histopathology added correlating morphological data in 19 of 30 lines (63.3%) in which the primary screen detected a phenotype. In addition, seven of the 50 lines (14%) presented significant histopathology findings that were not associated with or predicted by the standard primary screen. Three of these seven lines had no clinical phenotype detected by the standard primary screen. Incidental and strain-associated background lesions were present in all mutant lines with good concordance to wild-type controls. These findings demonstrate the complementary and unique contribution of histopathology to high-throughput primary phenotyping of mutant mice.</p>

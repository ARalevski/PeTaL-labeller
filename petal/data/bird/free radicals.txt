Coherent single-atom superradiance
<p>Superradiance is a quantum phenomenon emerging in macroscopic systems whereby correlated single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s cooperatively emit photons. Demonstrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of controlled collective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>-field interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s has resulted from the ability to directly imprint correlat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s with an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic ensemble. Here we report cavity-mediated coherent single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> superradiance: Single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s with predefined correlat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> traverse a high–quality factor cavity one by one, emitting photons cooperatively with the <i>N</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s that have already gone through the cavity (<i>N</i> represents the number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s). Enhanced collective photoemiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <i>N</i>-squared dependence was observed even when the intracavity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> number was less than unity. The correlat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> among single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s was achieved by nanometer-precis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> posit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> control and phase-aligned state manipulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s by using a nanohole-array aperture. Our results demonstrate a platform for phase-controlled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>-field interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s.</p>

Hyperfine interaction of individual atoms on a surface
<p>Taking advantage of nuclear spins for electronic structure analysis, magnetic resonance imaging, and quantum devices hinges on knowledge and control of the surrounding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic-scale environment. We measured and manipulated the hyperfine interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of individual iron and titanium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s placed on a magnesium oxide surface by using spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy in combinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> with single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> electron spin resonance. Using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> manipulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to move single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s, we found that the hyperfine interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> strongly depended on the binding configurat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>. We could extract <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>- and posit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>-dependent informat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> about the electronic ground state, the state mixing with neighboring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s, and properties of the nuclear spin. Thus, the hyperfine spectrum becomes a powerful probe of the chemical environment of individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s and nanostructures.</p>

Creation of a Bose-condensed gas of <sup>87</sup>Rb by laser cooling
<p>Protocols for attaining quantum degeneracy in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic gases almost exclusively rely on evaporative cooling, a time-consuming final step associated with substantial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> loss. We demonstrate direct laser cooling of a gas of rubidium-87 (<sup>87</sup>Rb) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s to quantum degeneracy. The method is fast and induces little <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> loss. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s are trapped in a two-dimens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al optical lattice that enables cycles of compress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to increase the density, followed by Raman sideband cooling to decrease the temperature. From a starting number of 2000 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s, 1400 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s reach quantum degeneracy in 300 milliseconds, as confirmed by a bimodal velocity distribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. The method should be broadly applicable to many bosonic and ferm<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ic species and to systems where evaporative cooling is not possible.</p>

Atom-by-atom assembly of defect-free one-dimensional cold atom arrays
<p>The realizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of large-scale fully controllable quantum systems is an exciting frontier in modern physical science. We use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>-by-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> assembly to implement a platform for the deterministic preparat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of regular one-dimens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al arrays of individually controlled cold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s. In our approach, a measurement and feedback procedure eliminates the entropy associated with probabilistic trap occupat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and results in defect-free arrays of more than 50 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s in less than 400 milliseconds. The technique is based on fast, real-time control of 100 optical tweezers, which we use to arrange <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s in desired geometric patterns and to maintain these configurat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s by replacing lost <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s with surplus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s from a reservoir. This bottom-up approach may enable controlled engineering of scalable many-body systems for quantum informat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> processing, quantum simulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, and precis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> measurements.</p>

Mid-term changes in blood metal ion levels after Articular Surface Replacement arthroplasty of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Our first aim was to determine whether there are significant   changes in the level of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in the blood at mid-term follow-up,   in patients with an Articular Surface Replacement (ASR) arthroplasty.   Secondly, we sought to identify risk factors for any increases.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The study involved 435 patients who underwent unilateral, metal-on-metal   (MoM) hip resurfacing (HRA) or total hip arthroplasty (THA). These   patients all had one measurement of the level of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in the   blood before seven years had passed post-operatively (early evaluat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>)   and one after seven years had passed post-operatively (mid-term evaluat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>).   Changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> levels were tested using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test.   We identified subgroups at the highest risk of increase using a   multivariable linear logistic regress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were significant increases in the levels of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s   for patients who underwent both MoM HRA (Chromium (Cr): 0.5 parts   per bill<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (ppb); Cobalt (Co): 1.1 ppb) and MoM THA (Cr: 0.5 ppb;   Co: 0.7 ppb). In a multivariable model considering MoM HRAs, the   change in the levels of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s was influenced by female gender   (Co: Odds Ratio (OR) 1.42; p = 0.002 and Cr: OR 1.08; p = 0.006).   The change was found to be irrespective of the initial level for   the MoM HRAs, whereas there was a negative relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship between   the initial level and the change in the level for those with a MoM   THA (Co: OR -0.43; p < 0.001 and Cr: OR -0.14; p = 0.033).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong></title><p>The levels of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in the blood increase significantly   over the period until mid-term follow-up in patients with both a   MoM HRA and those with a MoM THA.

Room-temperature cycling of metal fluoride electrodes: Liquid electrolytes for high-energy fluoride ion cells
<p>Fluoride <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> batteries are potential “next-generat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>” electrochemical storage devices that offer high energy density. At present, such batteries are limited to operat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> at high temperatures because suitable fluoride <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>–conducting electrolytes are known only in the solid state. We report a liquid fluoride <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>–conducting electrolyte with high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ic conductivity, wide operating voltage, and robust chemical stability based on dry tetraalkylammonium fluoride salts in ether solvents. Pairing this liquid electrolyte with a copper–lanthanum trifluoride (Cu@LaF<sub>3</sub>) core-shell cathode, we demonstrate reversible fluorinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and defluorinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in a fluoride <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> electrochemical cell cycled at room temperature.

Organometallic and radical intermediates reveal mechanism of diphthamide biosynthesis
<p>Diphthamide biosynthesis involves a carbon-carbon bond-forming react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> catalyzed by a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radic</span></strong>al S-adenosylmeth<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ine (SAM) enzyme that cleaves a carbon-sulfur (C–S) bond in SAM to generate a 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl (ACP) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radic</span></strong>al. Using rapid freezing, we have captured an organometallic intermediate with an iron-carbon (Fe–C) bond between ACP and the enzyme’s [4Fe-4S] cluster. In the presence of the substrate protein, elongat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> factor 2, this intermediate converts to an organic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radic</span></strong>al, formed by addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the ACP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radic</span></strong>al to a histidine side chain. Crystal structures of archaeal diphthamide biosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radic</span></strong>al SAM enzymes reveal that the carbon of the SAM C–S bond being cleaved is posit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ed near the unique cluster Fe, able to react with the cluster. Our results explain how selective C–S bond cleavage is achieved in this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radic</span></strong>al SAM enzyme.</p>

Dynamic multinuclear sites formed by mobilized copper ions in NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> selective catalytic reduction
<p>Copper <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s exchanged into zeolites are active for the selective catalytic reduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (SCR) of nitrogen oxides (NO<i><sub>x</sub></i>) with ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>), but the low-temperature rate dependence on copper (Cu) volumetric density is inconsistent with react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> at single sites. We combine steady-state and transient kinetic measurements, x-ray absorpt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> spectroscopy, and first-principles calculat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s to demonstrate that under react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, mobilized Cu <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s can travel through zeolite windows and form transient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> pairs that participate in an oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>)–mediated Cu<sup>I</sup>→Cu<sup>II</sup> redox step integral to SCR. Electrostatic tethering to framework aluminum centers limits the volume that each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> can explore and thus its capacity to form an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> pair. The dynamic, reversible format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of multinuclear sites from mobilized single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s represents a distinct phenomenon that falls outside the convent<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al boundaries of a heterogeneous or homogeneous catalyst.</p>

Risk factors for wear-related failures after hip resurfacing in patients with a low contact patch to rim distance

Ketyl radical reactivity via atom transfer catalysis
<p>Single-electron reduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of a carbonyl to a ketyl enables access to a polarity-reversed platform of reactivity for this cornerstone funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al group. However, the synthetic utility of the ketyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radic</span></strong>al is hindered by the strong reductants necessary for its generat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, which also limit its reactivity to net reductive mechanisms. We report a strategy for net redox-neutral generat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of ketyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radic</span></strong>als.

An evolutionarily conserved gene family encodes proton-selective ion channels
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels form the basis for cellular electrical signaling. Despite the scores of genetically identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels selective for other mon<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, only one type of proton-selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel has been found in eukaryotic cells. By comparative transcriptome analysis of mouse taste receptor cells, we identified Otopetrin1 (OTOP1), a protein required for development of gravity-sensing otoconia in the vestibular system, as forming a proton-selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel. We found that murine OTOP1 is enriched in acid-detecting taste receptor cells and is required for their zinc-sensitive proton conductance. Two related murine genes, <i>Otop2</i> and <i>Otop3</i>, and a <i>Drosophila</i> ortholog also encode proton channels. Evolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ary conservat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the gene family and its widespread tissue distribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> suggest a broad role for proton channels in physiology and pathophysiology.</p>

Size effect in ion transport through angstrom-scale slits
<p>In the field of nanofluidics, it has been an ultimate but seemingly distant goal to controllably fabricate capillaries with dimens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s approaching the size of small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and water molecules. We report <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> transport through ultimately narrow slits that are fabricated by effectively removing a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic plane from a bulk crystal. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ically flat angstrom-scale slits exhibit little surface charge, allowing elucidat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the role of steric effects. We find that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s with hydrated diameters larger than the slit size can still permeate through, albeit with reduced mobility. The confinement also leads to a notable asymmetry between an<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of the same diameter. Our results provide a platform for studying the effects of angstrom-scale confinement, which is important for the development of nanofluidics, molecular separat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, and other nanoscale technologies.</p>

Synthesis of FeH<sub>5</sub>: A layered structure with atomic hydrogen slabs
<p>High pressure promotes the format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of polyhydrides with unusually high hydrogen-to-metal ratios.

We synthesized iron pentahydride (FeH<sub>5</sub>) by a direct react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> between iron and H<sub>2</sub> above 130 gigapascals in a laser-heated diamond anvil cell. FeH<sub>5</sub> exhibits a structure built of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic hydrogen only.

Quantized thermal transport in single-atom junctions
<p>Thermal transport in individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic junct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and chains is of great fundamental interest because of the distinctive quantum effects expected to arise in them. By using novel, custom-fabricated, picowatt-resolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> calorimetric scanning probes, we measured the thermal conductance of gold and platinum metallic wires down to single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> junct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. Our work reveals that the thermal conductance of gold single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> junct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s is quantized at room temperature and shows that the Wiedemann-Franz law relating thermal and electrical conductance is satisfied even in single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> contacts. Furthermore, we quantitatively explain our experimental results within the Landauer framework for quantum thermal transport. The experimental techniques reported here will enable thermal transport studies in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic and molecular chains, which will be key to investigating numerous fundamental issues that thus far have remained experimentally inaccessible.</p>

Radical-polar crossover reactions of vinylboron ate complexes
<p>Vinyl boronic esters are valuable substrates for Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. However, boron-substituted alkenes have drawn little attent<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radic</span></strong>al acceptors, and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radic</span></strong>al chemistry of vinylboron ate complexes is underexplored. We show here that carbon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radic</span></strong>als add efficiently to vinylboron ate complexes and that their adduct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radic</span></strong>al an<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s undergo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radic</span></strong>al-polar crossover: A 1,2-alkyl/aryl shift from boron to the α-carbon sp<sup>2</sup> center provides secondary or tertiary alkyl boronic esters. In contrast to the Suzuki-Miyaura coupling, a transit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> metal is not required, and two carbon-carbon bonds are formed. The valuable boronic ester moiety remains in the product and can be used in follow-up chemistry, enlarging the chemical space of the method. The cascade uses commercial starting materials and provides access to perfluoroalkylated alcohols, γ-lactones, γ-hydroxy alkylnitriles, and compounds bearing quaternary carbon centers.</p>

<p>Large arrays of individually controlled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s trapped in optical tweezers are a very promising platform for quantum engineering applicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. However, deterministic loading of the traps is experimentally challenging. We demonstrate the preparat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of fully loaded two-dimens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al arrays of up to ~50 microtraps, each containing a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> and arranged in arbitrary geometries. Starting from initially larger, half-filled matrices of randomly loaded traps, we obtain user-defined target arrays at unit filling. This is achieved with a real-time control system and a moving optical tweezers, which together enable a sequence of rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> moves depending on the initial distribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s in the arrays. These results open exciting prospects for quantum engineering with neutral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s in tunable two-dimens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al geometries.</p>

Dirigent Protein Mode of Action Revealed by the Crystal Structure of AtDIR6
<p>Dirigent proteins impart stereoselectivity to phenoxy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radic</span></strong>al coupling react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in plants and, thus, play an essential role in the biosynthesis of biologically active natural products. This includes the regioselective and enantioselective coupling and subsequent cyclizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of two coniferyl alcohol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radic</span></strong>als to pinoresinol as the committed step of lignan biosynthesis. The react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is controlled by dirigent proteins, which, depending on the species and protein, direct the react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to either (+)- or (−)-pinoresinol. We present the crystal structure of the (−)-pinoresinol forming DIRIGENT PROTEIN6 (AtDIR6) from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) with data to 1.4 Å resolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. The structure shows AtDIR6 as an eight-stranded antiparallel β-barrel that forms a trimer with spatially well-separated cavities for substrate binding. The binding cavities are two lobed, exhibiting two opposing pockets, each lined with a set of hydrophilic and potentially catalytic residues, including essential aspartic acids. These residues are conserved between (+) and (−)-pinoresinol-forming DIRs and required for activity. The structure supports a model in which two substrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radic</span></strong>als bind to each of the DIR monomers. With the aromatic rings fixed in the two pockets, the prop<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>yl side chains face each other for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radic</span></strong>al-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radic</span></strong>al coupling, and stereoselectivity is determined by the exact posit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ing of the side chains. Extensive mutat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al analysis supports a previously unrecognized funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> for DIRs in catalyzing the cyclizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the bis-quinone methide react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> intermediate to yield (+)- or (−)-pinoresinol.</p>

The ion channel TRPM7 is required for B cell lymphopoiesis
<p>The transient receptor potential (TRP) family is a large family of widely expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels that regulate the intracellular concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and metals and respond to various chemical and physical stimuli. TRP subfamily M member 7 (TRPM7) is unusual in that it contains both an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel and a kinase domain. TRPM7 is a divalent cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel with preference for Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>. It is required for the survival of DT40 cells, a B cell line; however, delet<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of TRPM7 in T cells does not impair their development. We found that express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of TRPM7 was required for B cell development in mice. Mice that lacked TRPM7 in B cells failed to generate peripheral B cells because of a developmental block at the pro-B cell stage. The loss of TRPM7 kinase activity alone did not affect the proport<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of peripheral mature B cells or the development of B cells in the bone marrow. However, supplementat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> with a high concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> partially rescued the development of TRPM7-deficient B cells in vitro. Thus, our findings identify a critical role for TRPM7 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel activity in B cell development.</p>

Large-area graphene-nanomesh/carbon-nanotube hybrid membranes for ionic and molecular nanofiltration
<p>Nanoporous two-dimens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al materials are attractive for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ic and molecular nanofiltrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> but limited by insufficient mechanical strength over large areas. We report a large-area graphene-nanomesh/single-walled carbon nanotube (GNM/SWNT) hybrid membrane with excellent mechanical strength while fully capturing the merit of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ically thin membranes. The monolayer GNM features high-density, subnanometer pores for efficient transport of water molecules while blocking solute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s or molecules to enable size-selective separat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. The SWNT network physically separates the GNM into microsized islands and acts as the microscopic framework to support the GNM, thus ensuring the structural integrity of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ically thin GNM. The resulting GNM/SWNT membranes show high water permeance and a high reject<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> ratio for salt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s or organic molecules, and they retain stable separat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> performance in tubular modules.</p>

Observation of magnetically tunable Feshbach resonances in ultracold <sup>23</sup>Na<sup>40</sup>K + <sup>40</sup>K collisions
<p>Resonances in ultracold collis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s involving heavy molecules are difficult to simulate theoretically and have proven challenging to detect. Here we report the observat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of magnetically tunable Feshbach resonances in ultracold collis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s between potassium-40 (<sup>40</sup>K) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s and sodium-23–potassium-40 (<sup>23</sup>Na<sup>40</sup>K) molecules in the rovibrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al ground state. We prepare the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s and molecules in various hyperfine levels of their ground states and observe the loss of molecules as a funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the magnetic field. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>-molecule Feshbach resonances are identified by observing an enhancement of the loss. We have observed 11 resonances in the magnetic field range of 43 to 120 gauss. The observed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>-molecule Feshbach resonances at ultralow temperatures probe the three-body potential energy surface with except<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al resolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and will help to improve understanding of ultracold collis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s.</p>

Complete steric exclusion of ions and proton transport through confined monolayer water
<p>It has long been an aspirat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al goal to create artificial structures that allow fast permeat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of water but reject even the smallest hydrated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, replicating the feat achieved by nature in protein channels (e.g., aquaporins). Despite recent progress in creating nanoscale pores and capillaries, these structures still remain distinctly larger than protein channels. We report capillaries made by effectively extracting one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic plane from bulk crystals, which leaves a two-dimens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al slit of a few angstroms in height. Water moves through these capillaries with little resistance, whereas no permeat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> could be detected even for such small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s as Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>−</sup>. Only protons (H<sup>+</sup>) can diffuse through monolayer water inside the capillaries.

Resonance-stabilized hydrocarbon-radical chain reactions may explain soot inception and growth
<p>Mystery surrounds the transit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> from gas-phase hydrocarbon precursors to terrestrial soot and interstellar dust, which are carbonaceous particles formed under similar condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. Although polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are known precursors to high-temperature carbonaceous-particle format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, the molecular pathways that initiate particle format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> are unknown. We present experimental and theoretical evidence for rapid molecular clustering–react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> pathways involving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radic</span></strong>als with extended conjugat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radic</span></strong>als react with other hydrocarbon species to form covalently bound complexes that promote further growth and clustering by regenerating resonance-stabilized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radic</span></strong>als through low-barrier hydrogen-abstract<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and hydrogen-eject<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s.

Angular momentum–induced delays in solid-state photoemission enhanced by intra-atomic interactions
<p>Attosecond time-resolved photoemiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> spectroscopy reveals that photoemiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> from solids is not yet fully understood. The relative emiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> delays between four photoemiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels measured for the van der Waals crystal tungsten diselenide (WSe<sub>2</sub>) can only be explained by accounting for both propagat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic delays. The intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic delay depends on the angular momentum of the initial localized state and is determined by intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. For the studied case of WSe<sub>2</sub>, the photoemiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> events are time ordered with rising initial-state angular momentum. Including intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic electron-electron interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and angular momentum of the initial localized state yields excellent agreement between theory and experiment. This has required a revis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of existing models for solid-state photoemiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, and thus, attosecond time-resolved photoemiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> from solids provides important benchmarks for improved future photoemiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> models.</p>

Hydrogen positions in single nanocrystals revealed by electron diffraction

Single-molecule optomechanics in “picocavities”
<p>Trapping light with noble metal nanostructures overcomes the diffract<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> limit and can confine light to volumes typically on the order of 30 cubic nanometers. We found that individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic features inside the gap of a plasmonic nanoassembly can localize light to volumes well below 1 cubic nanometer (“picocavities”), enabling optical experiments on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic scale. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic features are dynamically formed and disassembled by laser irradiat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Although unstable at room temperature, picocavities can be stabilized at cryogenic temperatures, allowing single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic cavities to be probed for many minutes. Unlike tradit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al optomechanical resonators, such extreme optical confinement yields a factor of 10<sup>6</sup> enhancement of optomechanical coupling between the picocavity field and vibrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of individual molecular bonds. This work sets the basis for developing nanoscale nonlinear quantum optics on the single-molecule level.</p>

Edge Nonlinear Optics on a MoS<sub>2</sub> Atomic Monolayer

Rapid cold hardening improves recovery of ion homeostasis and chill coma recovery time in the migratory locust, <i>Locusta migratoria</i>
<p>Chill tolerance of insects is defined as the ability to tolerate low temperature under circumstances not involving freezing of intracellular or extracellular fluids. For many insects chill tolerance is crucial for their ability to persist in cold environments and mounting evidence indicates that chill tolerance is associated with the ability to maintain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and water homeostasis, thereby ensuring muscular funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and preventing chill injury at low temperature. The present study describes the relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship between muscle and haemolymph <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis and time to regain posture following cold shock (CS, 2 h at −4°C) in the chill-susceptible locust <i>Locusta migratoria</i>. This relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship was examined in animals with and without a prior rapid cold-hardening treatment (RCH, 2 h at 0°C) to investigate the physiological underpinnings of RCH. CS elicited a doubling of haemolymph [K<sup>+</sup>] and this disturbance was greater in locusts pre-exposed to RCH. Recovery of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis was, however, markedly faster in RCH-treated animals, which correlated well with whole-organism performance as hardened individuals regained posture faster than non-hardened individuals following CS. The present study indicates that loss and recovery of muscular funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> are associated with the resting membrane potential of excitable membranes as attested by the changes in the equilibrium potential for K<sup>+</sup> (<i>E</i><sub>K</sub>) following CS. Both hardened and non-hardened animals regained movement once K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis had recovered to a fixed level (<i>E</i><sub>K</sub>≈−41 mV). RCH is therefore not associated with altered sensitivity to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> disturbance but instead is correlated to a faster recovery of haemolymph [K<sup>+</sup>].</p>

Laser cooling of ions in a neutral plasma

Photonic crystals for nano-light in moiré graphene superlattices
<p>Graphene is an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ically thin plasmonic medium that supports highly confined plasmon polaritons, or nano-light, with very low loss. Electronic properties of graphene can be drastically altered when it is laid upon another graphene layer, resulting in a moiré superlattice. The relative twist angle between the two layers is a key tuning parameter of the interlayer coupling in thus-obtained twisted bilayer graphene (TBG). We studied the propagat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of plasmon polaritons in TBG by infrared nano-imaging. We discovered that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic reconstruct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> occurring at small twist angles transforms the TBG into a natural plasmon photonic crystal for propagating nano-light.

<p>Magnetic multilayer devices that exploit magnetoresistance are the backbone of magnetic sensing and data storage technologies. Here, we report multiple-spin-filter magnetic tunnel junct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s (sf-MTJs) based on van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures in which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ically thin chromium triiodide (CrI<sub>3</sub>) acts as a spin-filter tunnel barrier sandwiched between graphene contacts. We demonstrate tunneling magnetoresistance that is drastically enhanced with increasing CrI<sub>3</sub> layer thickness, reaching a record 19,000% for magnetic multilayer structures using four-layer sf-MTJs at low temperatures. Using magnetic circular dichroism measurements, we attribute these effects to the intrinsic layer-by-layer antiferromagnetic ordering of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ically thin CrI<sub>3</sub>. Our work reveals the possibility to push magnetic informat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> storage to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ically thin limit and highlights CrI<sub>3</sub> as a superlative magnetic tunnel barrier for vdW heterostructure spintronic devices.</p>

A radical approach to the copper oxidative addition problem: Trifluoromethylation of bromoarenes
<p>Transit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> metal–catalyzed arene funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>alizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> has been widely used for molecular synthesis over the past century. In this arena, copper catalysis has long been considered a privileged platform due to the propensity of high-valent copper to undergo reductive eliminat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> with a wide variety of coupling fragments. However, the sluggish nature of oxidative addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> has limited copper’s capacity to broadly facilitate haloarene coupling protocols. Here, we demonstrate that this copper oxidative addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> problem can be overcome with an aryl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radic</span></strong>al–capture mechanism, wherein the aryl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radic</span></strong>al is generated through a silyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radic</span></strong>al halogen abstract<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. This strategy was applied to a general trifluoromethylat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of aryl bromides through dual copper-photoredox catalysis. Mechanistic studies support the format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of an open-shell aryl species.</p>

Building one molecule from a reservoir of two atoms
<p>Chemical react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s typically proceed via stochastic encounters between reactants. Going beyond this paradigm, we combined exactly two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s in a single, controlled react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. The experimental apparatus traps two individual laser-cooled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s [one sodium (Na) and one cesium (Cs)] in separate optical tweezers and then merges them into one optical dipole trap. Subsequently, photoassociat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> forms an excited-state NaCs molecule. The discovery of previously unseen resonances near the molecular dissociat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> threshold and measurement of collis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> rates are enabled by the tightly trapped ultracold sample of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s. As laser-cooling and trapping capabilities are extended to more elements, the technique will enable the study of more diverse, and eventually more complex, molecules in an isolated environment, as well as synthesis of designer molecules for qubits.</p>

Toward an optically controlled brain
<p>Neurons can be modified with light-gated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels, which cause them to become excited upon illuminat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). This discovery has given rise to the field of optogenetics, with impressive examples such as triggering the beat of a heart with light (<i>3</i>). There is, however, one technical limitat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>: Light-gated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels are typically stimulated with blue-green light, which is heavily scattered by tissue. Thus, deep brain stimulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, focused on small reg<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, is a major challenge. On page 679 of this issue, Chen <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) use transgenic mice implanted with upconverting nanoparticles (NPs) to locally activate light-gated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels and modulate neuronal activity, even deep inside the brain. This method might eventually lead the way for clinical applicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s to optically control neuronal dysfunct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, such as Parkinson's disease or even paralysis.</p>

A Fermi-degenerate three-dimensional optical lattice clock
<p>Strontium optical lattice clocks have the potential to simultaneously interrogate mill<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s with a high spectroscopic quality factor of 4 × 10<sup>17</sup>. Previously, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s have forced a compromise between clock stability, which benefits from a large number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s, and accuracy, which suffers from density-dependent frequency shifts. Here we demonstrate a scalable solut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> that takes advantage of the high, correlated density of a degenerate Fermi gas in a three-dimens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al (3D) optical lattice to guard against on-site interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> shifts. We show that contact interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s are resolved so that their contribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to clock shifts is orders of magnitude lower than in previous experiments. A synchronous clock comparison between two reg<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of the 3D lattice yields a measurement precis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of 5 × 10<sup>–19</sup> in 1 hour of averaging time.</p>

The Rydberg constant and proton size from atomic hydrogen
<p>At the core of the “proton radius puzzle” is a four–standard deviat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> discrepancy between the proton root-mean-square charge radii (<i>r</i><sub>p</sub>) determined from the regular hydrogen (H) and the muonic hydrogen (µp) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s. Using a cryogenic beam of H <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s, we measured the 2S-4P transit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> frequency in H, yielding the values of the Rydberg constant <i>R</i><sub>∞</sub> = 10973731.568076(96) per meter<sup></sup>and <i>r</i><sub>p</sub> = 0.8335(95) femtometer. Our <i>r</i><sub>p</sub> value is 3.3 combined standard deviat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s smaller than the previous H world data, but in good agreement with the µp value. We motivate an asymmetric fit funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, which eliminates line shifts from quantum interference of neighboring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic resonances.</p>

Observation of the Wigner-Huntington transition to metallic hydrogen
<p>Producing metallic hydrogen has been a great challenge in condensed matter physics. Metallic hydrogen may be a room-temperature superconductor and metastable when the pressure is released and could have an important impact on energy and rocketry. We have studied solid molecular hydrogen under pressure at low temperatures. At a pressure of 495 gigapascals, hydrogen becomes metallic, with reflectivity as high as 0.91. We fit the reflectance using a Drude free-electron model to determine the plasma frequency of 32.5 ± 2.1 electron volts at a temperature of 5.5 kelvin, with a corresponding electron carrier density of 7.7 ± 1.1 × 10<sup>23</sup> particles per cubic centimeter, which is consistent with theoretical estimates of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic density. The properties are those of an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic metal. We have produced the Wigner-Huntington dissociative transit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic metallic hydrogen in the laboratory.</p>

Magnetic resonance spectroscopy of an atomically thin material using a single-spin qubit
<p>Two-dimens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al (2D) materials offer a promising platform for exploring condensed matter phenomena and developing technological applicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. However, the reduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of material dimens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic scale poses a challenge for tradit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al measurement and interfacing techniques that typically couple to macroscopic observables. We demonstrate a method for probing the properties of 2D materials via nanometer-scale nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) spectroscopy using individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>like impurities in diamond. Coherent manipulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of shallow nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers enables the probing of nanoscale ensembles down to approximately 30 nuclear spins in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ically thin hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN).

A peptide hormone required for Casparian strip diffusion barrier formation in <i>Arabidopsis</i> roots
<p>Plants achieve mineral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis by means of a hydrophobic barrier on endodermal cells called the Casparian strip, which restricts lateral diffus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s between the root vascular bundles and the soil. We identified a family of sulfated peptides required for contiguous Casparian strip format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in <i>Arabidopsis</i> roots. These peptide hormones, which we named Casparian strip integrity factor 1 (CIF1) and CIF2, are expressed in the root stele and specifically bind the endodermis-expressed leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase GASSHO1 (GSO1)/SCHENGEN3 and its homolog, GSO2. A mutant devoid of CIF peptides is defective in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis in the xylem. <i>CIF</i> genes are environmentally responsive. Casparian strip regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is not merely a passive process driven by root developmental cues; it also serves as an active strategy to cope with adverse soil condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s.</p>

Quantum optical circulator controlled by a single chirally coupled atom
<p>Integrated nonreciprocal optical components, which have an inherent asymmetry between their forward and backward propagat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> direct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, are key for routing signals in photonic circuits. Here, we demonstrate a fiber-integrated quantum optical circulator operated by a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>. Its nonreciprocal behavior arises from the chiral interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> and the transversally confined light. We demonstrate that the internal quantum state of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> controls the operat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> direct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the circulator and that it features a strongly nonlinear response at the single-photon level. This enables, for example, photon number–dependent routing and novel quantum simulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> protocols. Furthermore, such a circulator can in principle be prepared in a coherent superposit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of its operat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al states and may become a key element for quantum informat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> processing in scalable integrated optical circuits.</p>

Synthesis of resveratrol tetramers via a stereoconvergent radical equilibrium

Global atmospheric particle formation from CERN CLOUD measurements
<p>Fundamental quest<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s remain about the origin of newly formed atmospheric aerosol particles because data from laboratory measurements have been insufficient to build global models. In contrast, gas-phase chemistry models have been based on laboratory kinetics measurements for decades. We built a global model of aerosol format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> by using extensive laboratory measurements of rates of nucleat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> involving sulfuric acid, ammonia, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, and organic compounds conducted in the CERN CLOUD (Cosmics Leaving Outdoor Droplets) chamber. The simulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and a comparison with atmospheric observat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s show that nearly all nucleat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> throughout the present-day atmosphere involves ammonia or biogenic organic compounds, in addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to sulfuric acid. A considerable fract<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of nucleat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> involves <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, but the relatively weak dependence on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s indicates that for the processes studied, variat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in cosmic ray intensity do not appreciably affect climate through nucleat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in the present-day atmosphere.</p>

An artificial metalloenzyme with the kinetics of native enzymes
<p>Natural enzymes contain highly evolved active sites that lead to fast rates and high selectivities. Although artificial metalloenzymes have been developed that catalyze abiological transformat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s with high stereoselectivity, the activities of these artificial enzymes are much lower than those of natural enzymes. Here, we report a reconstituted artificial metalloenzyme containing an iridium porphyrin that exhibits kinetic parameters similar to those of natural enzymes. In particular, variants of the P450 enzyme CYP119 containing iridium in place of iron catalyze insert<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carben</span></strong>es into C–H bonds with up to 98% enantiomeric excess, 35,000 turnovers, and 2550 hours<sup>−1</sup> turnover frequency.

Chemoattractant concentration–dependent tuning of ERK signaling dynamics in migrating neutrophils
<p>The directed migration (chemotaxis) of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong>s toward the bacterial peptide <i>N</i>-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (<i>f</i>MLP) is a crucial process in immune defense against invading bacteria. While navigating through a gradient of increasing concentrations of <i>f</i>MLP, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong>-like HL-60 cells switch from exhibiting directional migration at low <i>f</i>MLP concentrations to exhibiting circuitous migration at high <i>f</i>MLP concentrations. The extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) pathway is implicated in balancing this <i>f</i>MLP concentration–dependent switch in migration modes. We investigated the role and regulation of ERK signaling through single-cell analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong> migration in response to different <i>f</i>MLP concentrations over time. We found that ERK exhibited gradated, rather than all-or-none, responses to <i>f</i>MLP concentration. Maximal ERK activation occurred in response to about 100 nM <i>f</i>MLP, and ERK inactivation was promoted by p38. Furthermore, we found that directional migration of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong>s reached a maximal extent at about 100 nM <i>f</i>MLP and that ERK, but not p38, was required for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong> migration. Thus, our data suggest that, in chemotactic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong>s responding to <i>f</i>MLP, ERK displays gradated activation and p38-dependent inhibition and that these ERK dynamics promote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong> migration.</p>

Rac signal adaptation controls neutrophil mobilization from the bone marrow
<p>Mobilization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong>s from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone marrow</span></strong> determines <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong> blood counts and thus is medically important. Balanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong> mobilization from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone marrow</span></strong> depends on the retention-promoting chemokine CXCL12 and its receptor CXCR4 and the egression-promoting chemokine CXCL2 and its receptor CXCR2. Both pathways activate the small guanosine triphosphatase Rac, leaving the role of this signaling event in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong> retention and egression ambiguous. On the assumption that active Rac determines persistent directional cell migration, we generated a mathematical model to link chemokine-mediated Rac modulation to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong> egression time. Our computer simulation indicated that, in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone marrow</span></strong>, where the retention signal predominated, egression time strictly depended on the time it took Rac to return to its basal activity (namely, adaptation). This prediction was validated in mice lacking the Rac inhibitor ArhGAP15. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong>s in these mice showed prolonged Rac adaptation and cell-autonomous retention in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone marrow</span></strong>. Our model thus demonstrates that mobilization in the presence of two spatially defined opposing chemotactic cues strictly depends on inhibitors shaping the time course of signal adaptation. Furthermore, our findings might help to find new modes of intervention to treat conditions characterized by excessively low or high circulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong>s.</p>

The phytosphingosine-CD300b interaction promotes zymosan-induced, nitric oxide–dependent neutrophil recruitment
<p>Zymosan is a glucan that is a component of the yeast cell wall. Here, we determined the mechanisms underlying the zymosan-induced accumulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong>s in mice. Loss of the receptor CD300b reduced the number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong>s recruited to dorsal air pouches in response to zymosan, but not in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a bacterial membrane component recognized by Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). An inhibitor of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis reduced the number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong>s in the zymosan-treated air pouches of wild-type mice to an amount comparable to that in <i>CD300b<sup>−/−</sup></i> mice. Treatment with clodronate liposomes decreased the number of NO-producing, CD300b<sup>+</sup> inflammatory dendritic cells (DCs) in wild-type mice, thus decreasing NO production and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong> recruitment. Similarly, CD300b deficiency decreased the NO-dependent recruitment of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong>s to zymosan-treated joint cavities, thus ameliorating subsequent arthritis. We identified phytosphingosine, a lipid component of zymosan, as a potential ligand of CD300b. Phytosphingosine stimulated NO production in inflammatory DCs and promoted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong> recruitment in a CD300b-dependent manner. Together, these results suggest that the phytosphingosine-CD300b interaction promotes zymosan-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong> accumulation by inducing NO production by inflammatory DCs and that CD300b may contribute to antifungal immunity.</p>

Aging impairs both primary and secondary RIG-I signaling for interferon induction in human monocytes
<p>Adults older than 65 account for most of the deaths caused by respiratory influenza A virus (IAV) infections, but the underlying mechanisms for this susceptibility are poorly understood. IAV RNA is detected by the cytosolic sensor retinoic acid–inducible gene I (RIG-I), which induces the production of type I interferons (IFNs) that curtail the spread of the virus and promote the elimination of infected cells. We have previously identified a marked defect in the IAV-inducible secretion of type I IFNs, but not proinflammatory cytokines, in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>es from older (>65 years) healthy human donors. We found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>es from older adults exhibited decreased abundance of the adaptor protein TRAF3 (tumor necrosis factor receptor–associated factor 3) because of its increased proteasomal degradation with age, thereby impairing the primary RIG-I signaling pathway for the induction of type I IFNs. We determined that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>es from older adults also failed to effectively stimulate the production of the IFN regulatory transcription factor IRF8, which compromised IFN induction through secondary RIG-I signaling. IRF8 played a central role in IFN induction in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>es, because knocking down IRF8 in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>es from younger adults was sufficient to replicate the IFN defects observed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>es from older adults, whereas restoring IRF8 expression in older adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>es was sufficient to restore RIG-I–induced IFN responses. Aging thus compromises both the primary and secondary RIG-I signaling pathways that govern expression of type I IFN genes, thereby impairing antiviral resistance to IAV.</p>

The kinase TPL2 activates ERK and p38 signaling to promote neutrophilic inflammation
<p>Tumor progression locus 2 (TPL2; also known as MAP3K8) is a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase kinase (MAP3K) that phosphorylates the MAPK kinases MEK1 and MEK2 (MEK1/2), which, in turn, activate the MAPKs extracellular signal–regulated kinase 1 (ERK1) and ERK2 (ERK1/2) in macrophages stimulated through the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interleukin</span></strong>-1 receptor (IL-1R), Toll-like receptors (TLRs), or the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR). We describe a conserved and critical role for TPL2 in mediating the effector functions of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong>s through the activation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. Gene expression profiling and functional studies of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>es revealed a MEK1/2-independent branch point downstream of TPL2 in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong>s. Biochemical analyses identified the MAPK kinases MEK3 and MEK6 and the MAPKs p38α and p38δ as downstream effectors of TPL2 in these cells. Genetic ablation of the catalytic activity of TPL2 or therapeutic intervention with a TPL2-specific inhibitor reduced the production of inflammatory mediators by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong>s in response to stimulation with the TLR4 agonist lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in vitro, as well as in rodent models of inflammatory disease. Together, these data suggest that TPL2 is a drug target that activates not only MEK1/2-dependent but also MEK3/6-dependent signaling to promote inflammatory responses.</p>

Escaping the traps of your own hunters
<p>During the first days of an infection, protection is almost entirely provided by innate immunity, a large part of which consists of one type of immune cell—the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong>. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong>s form the largest group of immune cells in the body [humans produce ∼10<sup>11</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong>s daily (<i>1</i>)], and they carry out a number of defense mechanisms, including pathogen ingestion (phagocytosis) and the production of toxic chemicals that kill intruders directly. They can also cause severe hyperinflammatory diseases, such as lethal influenza-associated lung destruction (<i>2</i>, <i>3</i>). In 2004, another <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong> defense system was discovered. In a final act of protection, dying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong>s mix their nuclear DNA with toxic components from their cytosolic granules and release it explosively to form a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong> extracellular trap (NET) in the surrounding environment. This process is called NETosis (<i>4</i>). In addition to carrying genetic information, DNA is a very long (each nucleus contains ∼2 m of DNA) and sticky polyanionic molecule. Hence, DNA binds to surfaces such as bacterial cell walls by means of charge interactions (<i>5</i>). Through this immobilization on NETs, pathogens are brought into direct contact with cytotoxic molecules on the NET-DNA complex. However, free extracellular DNA is also a potent trigger of severe side effects in the body, for example, by forming immune complexes with anti nuclear antibodies (antibodies that can bind to DNA) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (<i>6</i>) or by directly clogging blood vessels and establishing vessel-blocking thrombi (<i>7</i>). Consequently, finding mechanisms that mediate the degradation of NETs has been a matter of intense research. On page 1202 of this issue, Jiménez-Alcéázar <i>et al.</i> (<i>8</i>) describe two deoxyribonucleases (DNases) [DNase1 and DNase1-like 3 (DNase1L3)], which cleave DNA and together degrade freshly formed NETs. By doing so, they inhibit otherwise lethal immunopathologies such as thrombus-mediated organ failure.</p>

The analysis of synovial fluid in total knee arthroplasties with flexion instability
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Patients with flexion instability after total knee arthroplasty   (TKA) often present with a recurrent effusion, which may be a haemarthrosis.   While the radiographic factors contributing to flexion instability   have been elucidated, the clinical diagnosis remains challenging.   Our aim, in this study, was to determine the mean white cell count   and differential profile in pre-operative aspirations of synovial   fluid in a consecutive series of patients undergoing revision TKA   for flexion instability.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between 2000 and 2010, 60 patients undergoing aseptic revision   TKA for flexion instability were identified. The results of the   pre-operative aspiration of synovial fluid were available for 53   patients (88%). These patients were 1:2 matched to 106 patients   who underwent aseptic TKA for indications other than flexion instability.   The mean age of the patients at revision TKA was 65 years (44 to   82) and 55% were women. The mean follow-up was 4.3 years (2 to 10.2).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In the flexion instability group, the median total cell count   was 312 cells/µL (interquartile range (IQR) 104 to 624), with a   mean distribution of 45% macrophages (2% to 90%), 30% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lymphocyt</span></strong>es   (1% to 69%), 18% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong>s (0% to 80%), 0.5% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eosinophil</span></strong>s (0% to   6%) and 7% other cells (0% to 42%; mainly synovial cells).

Cardioprotective Role of Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells in Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a heterogeneous population of cells that expand in cancer, inflammation, and infection and negatively regulate inflammation and the immune response. Heart failure (HF) is a complex clinical syndrome wherein inflammation induction and incomplete resolution can potentially contribute to HF development and progression. However, the role of MDSCs in HF remains unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The percentage of MDSCs in patients with HF and in mice with pressure overload–induced HF using isoproterenol infusion or transverse aortic constriction (TAC) was detected by flow cytometry. The effects of MDSCs on isoproterenol- or TAC-induced HF were observed on depleting MDSCs with 5-fluorouracil (50 mg/kg) or gemcitabine (120 mg/kg), transferring purified MDSCs, or enhancing endogenous MDSCs with rapamycin (2 mg·kg<sup>−1</sup>·d<sup>−1</sup>). Hypertrophic markers and inflammatory factors were detected by ELISA, real-time polymerase chain reaction, or Western blot. Cardiac functions were determined by echocardiography and hemodynamic analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The percentage of human leukocyte antigen-D–related (HLA-DR)<sup>−</sup>CD33<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> MDSCs in the blood of patients with HF was significantly increased and positively correlated with disease severity and increased plasma levels of cytokines, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interleukin</span></strong>-6, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interleukin</span></strong>-10, and transforming growth factor–β. Furthermore, MDSCs derived from patients with HF inhibited T-cell proliferation and interferon-γ secretion. Similar results were observed in TAC- and isoproterenol-induced HF in mice. Pharmaceutical depletion of MDSCs significantly exacerbated isoproterenol- and TAC-induced pathological cardiac remodeling and inflammation, whereas adoptive transfer of MDSCs prominently rescued isoproterenol- and TAC-induced HF. Consistently, administration of rapamycin significantly increased endogenous MDSCs by suppressing their differentiation and improved isoproterenol- and TAC-induced HF, but MDSC depletion mostly blocked beneficial rapamycin-mediated effects. Mechanistically, MDSC-secreted molecules suppressed isoproterenol-induced hypertrophy and proinflammatory gene expression in cardiomyocytes in a coculture system. Neutralization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interleukin</span></strong>-10 blunted both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>ic MDSC- and granulocytic MDSC–mediated anti-inflammatory and antihypertrophic effects, but treatment with a nitric oxide inhibitor only partially blocked the antihypertrophic effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>ic MDSCs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings revealed a cardioprotective role of MDSCs in HF by their antihypertrophic effects on cardiomyocytes and anti-inflammatory effects through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interleukin</span></strong>-10 and nitric oxide.

Upregulation of Human Endogenous Retrovirus-K Is Linked to Immunity and Inflammation in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Immune dysregulation has been linked to occlusive vascular remodeling in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) that is hereditary, idiopathic, or associated with other conditions. Circulating autoantibodies, lung perivascular lymphoid tissue, and elevated cytokines have been related to PAH pathogenesis but without a clear understanding of how these abnormalities are initiated, perpetuated, and connected in the progression of disease. We therefore set out to identify specific target antigens in PAH lung immune complexes as a starting point toward resolving these issues to better inform future application of immunomodulatory therapies.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Lung immune complexes were isolated and PAH target antigens were identified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and localized by confocal microscopy. One PAH antigen linked to immunity and inflammation was pursued and a link to PAH pathophysiology was investigated by next-generation sequencing, functional studies in cultured <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>es and endothelial cells, and hemodynamic and lung studies in a rat.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>SAM domain and HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1), an innate immune factor that suppresses HIV replication, was identified and confirmed as highly expressed in immune complexes from 16 hereditary and idiopathic PAH versus 12 control lungs. Elevated SAMHD1 was localized to endothelial cells, perivascular dendritic cells, and macrophages, and SAMHD1 antibodies were prevalent in tertiary lymphoid tissue. An unbiased screen using metagenomic sequencing related SAMHD1 to increased expression of human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K) in PAH versus control lungs (n=4). HERV-K envelope and deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase mRNAs were elevated in PAH versus control lungs (n=10), and proteins were localized to macrophages. HERV-K deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase induced SAMHD1 and proinflammatory cytokines (eg, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interleukin</span></strong> 6, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interleukin</span></strong> 1β, and tumor necrosis factor α) in circulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>es, pulmonary arterial endothelial cells, and also activated B cells. Vulnerability of pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (PAEC) to apoptosis was increased by HERV-K deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase in an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interleukin</span></strong> 6-independent manner.

Extension of chemotactic pseudopods by nonadherent human neutrophils does not require or cause calcium bursts
<p>Global bursts in free intracellular calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) are among the most conspicuous signaling events in immune cells. To test the common view that Ca<sup>2+</sup> bursts mediate rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton in response to the activation of G protein–coupled receptors, we combined single-cell manipulation with fluorescence imaging and monitored the Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in individual human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong>s during complement-mediated chemotaxis. By decoupling purely chemotactic pseudopod formation from cell-substrate adhesion, we showed that physiological concentrations of anaphylatoxins, such as C5a, induced nonadherent human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong>s to form chemotactic pseudopods but did not elicit Ca<sup>2+</sup> bursts. By contrast, pathological or supraphysiological concentrations of C5a often triggered Ca<sup>2+</sup> bursts, but pseudopod protrusion stalled or reversed in such cases, effectively halting chemotaxis, similar to sepsis-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong> paralysis. The maximum increase in cell surface area during pseudopod extension in pure chemotaxis was much smaller—by a factor of 8—than the known capacity of adherent human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong>s to expand their surface. Because the measured rise in cortical tension was not sufficient to account for this difference, we attribute the limited deformability to a reduced ability of the cytoskeleton to generate protrusive force in the absence of cell adhesion. Thus, we hypothesize that Ca<sup>2+</sup> bursts in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong>s control a mechanistic switch between two distinct modes of cytoskeletal organization and dynamics. A key element of this switch appears to be the expedient coordination of adhesion-dependent lock or release events of cytoskeletal membrane anchors.</p>

RhoB controls the Rab11-mediated recycling and surface reappearance of LFA-1 in migrating T lymphocytes
<p>The regulation of cell adhesion and motility is complex and requires the intracellular trafficking of integrins to and from sites of cell adhesion, especially in fast-moving cells such as leukocytes. The Rab family of guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) is essential for vesicle transport, and vesicles mediate intracellular integrin trafficking. We showed that RhoB regulates the vesicular transport of the integrin LFA-1 along the microtubule network in migrating T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lymphocyt</span></strong>es. Impairment in RhoB function resulted in the accumulation of both LFA-1 and the recycling endosomal marker Rab11 at the rear of migrating T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lymphocyt</span></strong>es and decreased the association between these molecules. T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lymphocyt</span></strong>es lacking functional RhoB exhibited impaired recycling and subsequently decreased surface amounts of LFA-1, leading to reduced T cell adhesion and migration mediated by the cell adhesion molecule ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule–1). We propose that vesicle-associated RhoB is a regulator of the Rab11-mediated recycling of LFA-1 to the cell surface, an event that is necessary for T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lymphocyt</span></strong>e motility.</p>

Redemption for self-reactive antibodies

<p>Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are innate counterparts of adaptive T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lymphocyt</span></strong>es, contributing to host defense, tissue repair, metabolic homeostasis, and inflammatory diseases. ILCs have been considered to be tissue-resident cells, but whether ILCs move between tissue sites during infection has been unclear. We show here that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interleukin</span></strong>-25– or helminth-induced inflammatory ILC2s are circulating cells that arise from resting ILC2s residing in intestinal lamina propria. They migrate to diverse tissues based on sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P)–mediated chemotaxis that promotes lymphatic entry, blood circulation, and accumulation in peripheral sites, including the lung, where they contribute to anti-helminth defense and tissue repair. This ILC2 expansion and migration is a behavioral parallel to the antigen-driven proliferation and migration of adaptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lymphocyt</span></strong>es to effector sites and indicates that ILCs complement adaptive immunity by providing both local and distant tissue protection during infection.</p>

Osteoblasts remotely supply lung tumors with cancer-promoting SiglecF<sup>high</sup> neutrophils
<p>Bone marrow–derived myeloid cells can accumulate within tumors and foster cancer outgrowth. Local immune-neoplastic interactions have been intensively investigated, but the contribution of the systemic host environment to tumor growth remains poorly understood. Here, we show in mice and cancer patients (<i>n</i> = 70) that lung adenocarcinomas increase bone stromal activity in the absence of bone metastasis. Animal studies reveal that the cancer-induced bone phenotype involves bone-resident osteocalcin-expressing (Ocn<sup>+</sup>) osteoblastic cells. These cells promote cancer by remotely supplying a distinct subset of tumor-infiltrating SiglecF<sup>high</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong>s, which exhibit cancer-promoting properties. Experimentally reducing Ocn<sup>+</sup> cell numbers suppresses the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong> response and lung tumor outgrowth. These observations posit osteoblasts as remote regulators of lung cancer and identify SiglecF<sup>high</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong>s as myeloid cell effectors of the osteoblast-driven protumoral response.</p>

mTOR regulates metabolic adaptation of APCs in the lung and controls the outcome of allergic inflammation
<p>Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) occupy diverse anatomical tissues, but their tissue-restricted homeostasis remains poorly understood. Here, working with mouse models of inflammation, we found that mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)–dependent metabolic adaptation was required at discrete locations. mTOR was dispensable for dendritic cell (DC) homeostasis in secondary lymphoid tissues but necessary to regulate cellular metabolism and accumulation of CD103<sup>+</sup> DCs and alveolar macrophages in lung. Moreover, while numbers of mTOR-deficient lung CD11b<sup>+</sup> DCs were not changed, they were metabolically reprogrammed to skew allergic inflammation from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eosinophil</span></strong>ic T helper cell 2 (T<sub>H</sub>2) to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong>ic T<sub>H</sub>17 polarity. The mechanism for this change was independent of translational control but dependent on inflammatory DCs, which produced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interleukin</span></strong>-23 and increased fatty acid oxidation. mTOR therefore mediates metabolic adaptation of APCs in distinct tissues, influencing the immunological character of allergic inflammation.</p>

CD301b/MGL2<sup>+</sup> Mononuclear Phagocytes Orchestrate Autoimmune Cardiac Valve Inflammation and Fibrosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Valvular heart disease is common and affects the mitral valve (MV) most frequently. Despite the prevalence of MV disease (MVD), the cellular and molecular pathways that initiate and perpetuate it are not well understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>K/B.g7 T-cell receptor transgenic mice spontaneously develop systemic autoantibody-associated autoimmunity, leading to fully penetrant fibroinflammatory MVD and arthritis. We used multiparameter flow cytometry, intracellular cytokine staining, and immunofluorescent staining to characterize the cells in inflamed K/B.g7 MVs. We used genetic approaches to study the contribution of mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) to MVD in this model. Specifically, we generated K/B.g7 mice in which either CX3CR1 or CD301b/macrophage galactose <i>N</i>-acetylgalactosamine–specific lectin 2 (MGL2)–expressing MNPs were ablated. Using K/B.g7 mice expressing <i>Cx3Cr1</i>-Cre, we conditionally deleted critical inflammatory molecules from MNPs, including the Fc-receptor signal-transducing tyrosine kinase Syk and the cell adhesion molecule very late antigen–4. We performed complementary studies using monoclonal antibodies to block key inflammatory molecules. We generated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone marrow</span></strong> chimeric mice to define the origin of the inflammatory cells present in the MV and to determine which valve cells respond to the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Finally, we examined specimens from patients with rheumatic heart disease to correlate our findings to human pathology.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>MNPs comprised the vast majority of MV-infiltrating cells; these MNPs expressed CX3CR1 and CD301b/MGL2. Analogous cells were present in human rheumatic heart disease valves. K/B.g7 mice lacking CX3CR1 or in which CD301b/MGL2-expressing MNPs were ablated were protected from MVD. The valve-infiltrating CD301b/MGL2<sup>+</sup> MNPs expressed tissue-reparative molecules including arginase-1 and resistin-like molecule α. These MNPs also expressed the proinflammatory cytokines TNF and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interleukin</span></strong>-6, and antibody blockade of these cytokines prevented MVD. Deleting Syk from CX3CR1-expressing MNPs reduced their TNF and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interleukin</span></strong>-6 production and also prevented MVD. TNF acted through TNF receptor–1 expressed on valve-resident cells to increase the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule–1. Conditionally deleting the vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ligand very late antigen–4 from CX3CR1-expressing MNPs prevented MVD.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>CD301b/MGL2<sup>+</sup> MNPs are key drivers of autoimmune MVD in K/B.g7 mice and are also present in human rheumatic heart disease. We define key inflammatory molecules that drive MVD in this model, including Syk, TNF, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interleukin</span></strong>-6, very late antigen–4, and vascular cell adhesion molecule–1.</p></sec>

Worsening Renal Function in Patients With Acute Heart Failure Undergoing Aggressive Diuresis Is Not Associated With Tubular Injury
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Worsening renal function (WRF) in the setting of aggressive diuresis for acute heart failure treatment may reflect renal tubular injury or simply indicate a hemodynamic or functional change in glomerular filtration. Well-validated tubular injury biomarkers, <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong> gelatinase-associated lipocalin, and kidney injury molecule 1, are now available that can quantify the degree of renal tubular injury. The ROSE-AHF trial (Renal Optimization Strategies Evaluation–Acute Heart Failure) provides an experimental platform for the study of mechanisms of WRF during aggressive diuresis for acute heart failure because the ROSE-AHF protocol dictated high-dose loop diuretic therapy in all patients. We sought to determine whether tubular injury biomarkers are associated with WRF in the setting of aggressive diuresis and its association with prognosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients in the multicenter ROSE-AHF trial with baseline and 72-hour urine tubular injury biomarkers were analyzed (n=283). WRF was defined as a ≥20% decrease in glomerular filtration rate estimated with cystatin C.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Consistent with protocol-driven aggressive dosing of loop diuretics, participants received a median 560 mg IV furosemide equivalents (interquartile range, 300–815 mg), which induced a urine output of 8425 mL (interquartile range, 6341–10 528 mL) over the 72-hour intervention period. Levels of <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase and kidney injury molecule 1 did not change with aggressive diuresis (both <i>P</i>>0.59), whereas levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong> gelatinase-associated lipocalin decreased slightly (−8.7 ng/mg; interquartile range, −169 to 35 ng/mg; <i>P</i><0.001).

Increases in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong> gelatinase-associated lipocalin, <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase, and kidney injury molecule 1 were paradoxically associated with improved survival (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.80 per 10 percentile increase; 95% confidence interval, 0.69–0.91; <i>P</i>=0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Kidney tubular injury does not appear to have an association with WRF in the context of aggressive diuresis of patients with acute heart failure. These findings reinforce the notion that the small to moderate deteriorations in renal function commonly encountered with aggressive diuresis are dissimilar from traditional causes of acute kidney injury.</p></sec>

CD73 on T Cells Orchestrates Cardiac Wound Healing After Myocardial Infarction by Purinergic Metabolic Reprogramming
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>T cells are required for proper healing after myocardial infarction. The mechanism of their beneficial action, however, is unknown. The proinflammatory danger signal ATP, released from damaged cells, is degraded by the ectonucleotidases CD39 and CD73 to the anti-inflammatory mediator adenosine. Here, we investigate the contribution of CD73-derived adenosine produced by T cells to cardiac remodeling after ischemia/reperfusion and define its mechanism of action.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Myocardial ischemia (50 minutes followed by reperfusion) was induced in global CD73<sup>−/−</sup> and CD4-CD73<sup>−</sup><sup>/−</sup> mice. Tissue injury, T-cell purinergic signaling, cytokines, and cardiac function (magnetic resonance tomography at 9.4 T over 4 weeks) were analyzed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Changes in functional parameters of CD4-CD73<sup>−/−</sup> mice were identical to those in global CD73 knockouts (KOs). T cells infiltrating the injured heart significantly upregulated at the gene (quantitative polymerase chain reaction) and protein (enzymatic activity) levels critical transporters and enzymes (connexin43, connexin37, pannexin-1, equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1, CD39, CD73, ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterases 1 and 3, CD157, CD38) for the accelerated release and hydrolysis of ATP, cAMP, AMP, and NAD to adenosine. It is surprising that a lack of CD39 on T cells (from CD39<sup>−/−</sup> mice) did not alter ATP hydrolysis and very likely involves pyrophosphatases (ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterases 1 and 3). Circulating T cells predominantly expressed A<sub>2a</sub> receptor (A<sub>2a</sub>R) transcripts. After myocardial infarction, A<sub>2b</sub> receptor (A<sub>2b</sub>R) transcription was induced in both T cells and myeloid cells in the heart. Thus, A<sub>2a</sub>R and A<sub>2b</sub>R signaling may contribute to myocardial responses after myocardial infarction. In the case of T cells, this was associated with an accelerated secretion of proinflammatory and profibrotic cytokines (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interleukin</span></strong>-2, interferon-γ, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interleukin</span></strong>-17) when CD73 was lacking. Cytokine production by T cells from peripheral lymph nodes was inhibited by A<sub>2a</sub>R activation (CGS-21680). The A<sub>2b</sub>R agonist BAY 60-6583 showed off-target effects. The adenosine receptor agonist NECA inhibited interferon-γ and stimulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interleukin</span></strong>-6 production, each of which was antagonized by a specific A<sub>2b</sub>R antagonist (PSB-603).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This work demonstrates that CD73 on T cells plays a crucial role in the cardiac wound healing process after myocardial infarction. The underlying mechanism involves a profound increase in the hydrolysis of ATP/NAD and AMP, resulting primarily from the upregulation of pyrophosphatases and CD73. We also define A<sub>2b</sub>R/A<sub>2a</sub>R–mediated autacoid feedback inhibition of proinflammatory/profibrotic cytokines by T cell–derived CD73.</p></sec>

The pseudokinase MLKL activates PAD4-dependent NET formation in necroptotic neutrophils
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong> extracellular trap (NET) formation can generate short-term, functional anucleate cytoplasts and trigger loss of cell viability. We demonstrated that the necroptotic cell death effector mixed lineage kinase domain–like (MLKL) translocated from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane and stimulated downstream NADPH oxidase–independent ROS production, loss of cytoplasmic granules, breakdown of the nuclear membrane, chromatin decondensation, histone hypercitrullination, and extrusion of bacteriostatic NETs. This process was coordinated by receptor-interacting protein kinase-1 (RIPK1), which activated the caspase-8–dependent apoptotic or RIPK3/MLKL-dependent necroptotic death of mouse and human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong>s. Genetic deficiency of RIPK3 and MLKL prevented NET formation but did not prevent cell death, which was because of residual caspase-8–dependent activity. Peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) was activated downstream of RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL and was required for maximal histone hypercitrullination and NET extrusion. This work defines a distinct signaling network that activates PAD4-dependent NET release for the control of methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA) infection.</p>

Interleukin-2 shapes the cytotoxic T cell proteome and immune environment–sensing programs
<p>Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and Janus kinases (JAKs) regulate transcriptional programs and protein synthesis to promote the differentiation of effector CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lymphocyt</span></strong>es (CTLs). Using high-resolution mass spectrometry, we generated an in-depth characterization of how IL-2 and JAKs configure the CTL proteome to control CTL function. We found that IL-2 signaling through JAK1 and JAK3 (JAK1/3) increased the abundance of a key subset of proteins to induce the accumulation of critical cytokines and effector molecules in T cells. Moreover, IL-2 maintained the concentration of proteins that support core metabolic processes essential for cellular fitness. One fundamental insight was the dominant role for IL-2 in stimulating effector T cells to detect microenvironmental cues. IL-2–JAK1/3 signaling pathways thus increased the abundance of nutrient transporters, nutrient sensors, and critical oxygen-sensing molecules. These data provide key insights into how IL-2 promotes T cell function and highlight signaling mechanisms and transcription factors that integrate oxygen sensing to transcriptional control of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation.</p>

Altered homeostasis and development of regulatory T cell subsets represent an IL-2R–dependent risk for diabetes in NOD mice
<p>The cytokine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interleukin</span></strong>-2 (IL-2) is critical for the functions of regulatory T cells (T<sub>regs</sub>). The contribution of polymorphisms in the gene encoding the IL-2 receptor α subunit (<i>IL2RA</i>), which are associated with type 1 diabetes, is difficult to determine because autoimmunity depends on variations in multiple genes, where the contribution of any one gene product is small. We investigated the mechanisms whereby a modest reduction in IL-2R signaling selectively in T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lymphocyt</span></strong>es influenced the development of diabetes in the NOD mouse model. The sensitivity of IL-2R signaling was reduced by about two- to threefold in T<sub>regs</sub> from mice that coexpressed wild-type IL-2Rβ and a mutant subunit (IL-2Rβ<sup>Y3</sup>) with reduced signaling (designated NOD-Y3). Male and female NOD-Y3 mice exhibited accelerated diabetes onset due to intrinsic effects on multiple activities in T<sub>regs</sub>. Bone marrow chimera and adoptive transfer experiments demonstrated that IL-2Rβ<sup>Y3</sup> T<sub>regs</sub> resulted in impaired homeostasis of lymphoid-residing central T<sub>regs</sub> and inefficient development of highly activated effector T<sub>regs</sub> and that they were less suppressive. Pancreatic IL-2Rβ<sup>Y3</sup> T<sub>regs</sub> showed impaired development into IL-10–secreting effector T<sub>regs</sub>. The pancreatic lymph nodes and pancreases of NOD-Y3 mice had increased numbers of antigen-experienced CD4<sup>+</sup> effector T cells, which was largely due to impaired T<sub>regs</sub>, because adoptively transferred pancreatic autoantigen–specific CD4<sup>+</sup> Foxp3<sup>−</sup> T cells from NOD-Y3 mice did not accelerate diabetes in NOD.SCID recipients. Our study indicates that the primary defect associated with chronic, mildly reduced IL-2R signaling is due to impaired T<sub>regs</sub> that cannot effectively produce and maintain highly functional tissue-seeking effector T<sub>reg</sub> subsets.</p>

A cluster of immunoresolvents links coagulation to innate host defense in human blood
<p>Blood coagulation is a protective response that prevents excessive bleeding upon blood vessel injury. We investigated the relationship between coagulation and the resolution of inflammation and infection by lipid mediators (LMs) through metabololipidomics-based profiling of human whole blood (WB) during coagulation. We identified temporal clusters of endogenously produced prothrombotic and proinflammatory LMs (eicosanoids), as well as specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs). In addition to eicosanoids, a specific SPM cluster was identified that consisted of resolvin E1 (RvE1), RvD1, RvD5, lipoxin B<sub>4</sub>, and maresin 1, each of which was present at bioactive concentrations (0.1 to 1 nM). Removal of adenosine from the coagulating blood markedly enhanced the amounts of SPMs produced and further increased the biosynthesis of RvD3, RvD4, and RvD6. The cyclooxygenase inhibitors celecoxib and indomethacin, which block the production of thromboxanes and prostanoids, did not block the production of clot-driven SPMs. Unbiased mass cytometry analysis demonstrated that the SPM cluster produced in human blood targeted leukocytes at the single-cell level, directly activating ERK and CREB signaling in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong>s and CD14<sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>es. Treatment of human WB with the components of this SPM cluster enhanced both the phagocytosis and killing of <i>Escherichia coli</i> by leukocytes. Together, these data identify a proresolving LM circuit, including endogenous molecular brakes and accelerators, which promoted host defense. These temporal LM-SPM clusters can provide accessible metabolomic profiles for precision and personalized medicine.</p>

PI3Kγ activity in leukocytes promotes adipose tissue inflammation and early-onset insulin resistance during obesity
<p>The phosphoinositide 3-kinase γ (PI3Kγ) plays a major role in leukocyte recruitment during acute inflammation and has been proposed to inhibit classical macrophage activation by driving immunosuppressive gene expression. PI3Kγ plays an important role in diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. In seeking to determine the underlying molecular mechanisms, we showed that PI3Kγ action in high-fat diet–induced inflammation and insulin resistance depended largely on its role in the control of adiposity, which was due to PI3Kγ activity in a nonhematopoietic cell type. However, PI3Kγ activity in leukocytes was required for efficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong> recruitment to adipose tissue. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong> recruitment was correlated with proinflammatory gene expression in macrophages in adipose tissue, which triggered insulin resistance early during the development of obesity.

Key determinants of selective binding and activation by the monocyte chemoattractant proteins at the chemokine receptor CCR2
<p>Chemokines and their receptors collectively orchestrate the trafficking of leukocytes in normal immune function and inflammatory diseases. Different chemokines can induce distinct responses at the same receptor. In comparison to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>e chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1; also known as CCL2), the chemokines MCP-2 (CCL8) and MCP-3 (CCL7) are partial agonists of their shared receptor CCR2, a key regulator of the trafficking of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>es and macrophages that contribute to the pathology of atherosclerosis, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. Through experiments with chimeras of MCP-1 and MCP-3, we identified the chemokine amino-terminal region as being the primary determinant of both the binding and signaling selectivity of these two chemokines at CCR2. Analysis of CCR2 mutants showed that the chemokine amino terminus interacts with the major subpocket in the transmembrane helical bundle of CCR2, which is distinct from the interactions of some other chemokines with the minor subpockets of their receptors. These results suggest the major subpocket as a target for the development of small-molecule inhibitors of CCR2.</p>

Choline acetyltransferase–expressing T cells are required to control chronic viral infection
<p>Although widely studied as a neurotransmitter, T cell–derived acetylcholine (ACh) has recently been reported to play an important role in regulating immunity. However, the role of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lymphocyt</span></strong>e-derived ACh in viral infection is unknown.

Chronic TLR7 and TLR9 signaling drives anemia via differentiation of specialized hemophagocytes

We show that specialized phagocytes that internalize red <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood cel</span></strong>ls develop in Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7)–driven inflammation. TLR7 signaling caused the development of inflammatory hemophagocytes (iHPCs), which resemble splenic red pulp macrophages but are a distinct population derived from Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>es. iHPCs were responsible for anemia and thrombocytopenia in TLR7-overexpressing mice, which have a macrophage activation syndrome (MAS)–like disease. Interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5), associated with MAS, participated in TLR7-driven iHPC differentiation. We also found iHPCs during experimental malarial anemia, in which they required endosomal TLR and MyD88 signaling for differentiation. Our findings uncover a mechanism by which TLR7 and TLR9 specify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>e fate and identify a specialized population of phagocytes responsible for anemia and thrombocytopenia associated with inflammation and infection.</p>

Commensal-specific T cell plasticity promotes rapid tissue adaptation to injury
<p>Barrier tissues are primary targets of environmental stressors and are home to the largest number of antigen-experienced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lymphocyt</span></strong>es in the body, including commensal-specific T cells.

Thus, in the context of injury and exposure to inflammatory mediators such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interleukin</span></strong>-18, these cells rapidly release type 2 cytokines, thereby acquiring contextual functions. Such acquisition of a type 2 effector program promotes tissue repair. Aberrant type 2 responses can also be unleashed in the context of local defects in immunoregulation. Thus, commensal-specific T cells co-opt tissue residency and cell-intrinsic flexibility as a means to promote both local immunity and tissue adaptation to injury.</p>

In contrast to <i>Batf3</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice, <i>Wdfy4</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice displayed normal lymphoid and nonlymphoid cDC1 populations that produce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interleukin</span></strong>-12 and protect against <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> infection. However, similar to <i>Batf3</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice, <i>Wdfy4</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice failed to prime virus-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in vivo or induce tumor rejection, revealing a critical role for cross-presentation in antiviral and antitumor immunity.</p>

Neutrophil extracellular traps produced during inflammation awaken dormant cancer cells in mice
<p>Cancer cells from a primary tumor can disseminate to other tissues, remaining dormant and clinically undetectable for many years. Little is known about the cues that cause these dormant cells to awaken, resume proliferating, and develop into metastases. Studying mouse models, we found that sustained lung inflammation caused by tobacco smoke exposure or nasal instillation of lipopolysaccharide converted disseminated, dormant cancer cells to aggressively growing metastases. Sustained inflammation induced the formation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong> extracellular traps (NETs), and these were required for awakening dormant cancer. Mechanistic analysis revealed that two NET-associated proteases, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong> elastase and matrix metalloproteinase 9, sequentially cleaved laminin. The proteolytically remodeled laminin induced proliferation of dormant cancer cells by activating integrin α3β1 signaling. Antibodies against NET-remodeled laminin prevented awakening of dormant cells. Therapies aimed at preventing dormant cell awakening could potentially prolong the survival of cancer patients.</p>

Astrocyte-derived interleukin-33 promotes microglial synapse engulfment and neural circuit development
<p>Neuronal synapse formation and remodeling are essential to central nervous system (CNS) development and are dysfunctional in neurodevelopmental diseases. Innate immune signals regulate tissue remodeling in the periphery, but how this affects CNS synapses is largely unknown. Here, we show that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interleukin</span></strong>-1 family cytokine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interleukin</span></strong>-33 (IL-33) is produced by developing astrocytes and is developmentally required for normal synapse numbers and neural circuit function in the spinal cord and thalamus. We find that IL-33 signals primarily to microglia under physiologic conditions, that it promotes microglial synapse engulfment, and that it can drive microglial-dependent synapse depletion in vivo. These data reveal a cytokine-mediated mechanism required to maintain synapse homeostasis during CNS development.</p>

Gut microbiome influences efficacy of PD-1–based immunotherapy against epithelial tumors
<p>Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis induce sustained clinical responses in a sizable minority of cancer patients. We found that primary resistance to ICIs can be attributed to abnormal gut microbiome composition. Antibiotics inhibited the clinical benefit of ICIs in patients with advanced cancer. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from cancer patients who responded to ICIs into germ-free or antibiotic-treated mice ameliorated the antitumor effects of PD-1 blockade, whereas FMT from nonresponding patients failed to do so. Metagenomics of patient stool samples at diagnosis revealed correlations between clinical responses to ICIs and the relative abundance of <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i>. Oral supplementation with <i>A. muciniphila</i> after FMT with nonresponder feces restored the efficacy of PD-1 blockade in an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interleukin</span></strong>-12–dependent manner by increasing the recruitment of CCR9<sup>+</sup>CXCR3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lymphocyt</span></strong>es into mouse tumor beds.</p>

Host DNases prevent vascular occlusion by neutrophil extracellular traps
<p>Platelet and fibrin clots occlude blood vessels in hemostasis and thrombosis. Here we report a noncanonical mechanism for vascular occlusion based on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong> extracellular traps (NETs), DNA fibers released by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong>s during inflammation. We investigated which host factors control NETs in vivo and found that two deoxyribonucleases (DNases), DNase1 and DNase1-like 3, degraded NETs in circulation during sterile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong>ia and septicemia. In the absence of both DNases, intravascular NETs formed clots that obstructed blood vessels and caused organ damage. Vascular occlusions in patients with severe bacterial infections were associated with a defect to degrade NETs ex vivo and the formation of intravascular NET clots. DNase1 and DNase1-like 3 are independently expressed and thus provide dual host protection against deleterious effects of intravascular NETs.</p>

Single-cell RNA-seq reveals new types of human blood dendritic cells, monocytes, and progenitors
<p>Dendritic cells (DCs) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>es play a central role in pathogen sensing, phagocytosis, and antigen presentation and consist of multiple specialized subtypes. However, their identities and interrelationships are not fully understood. Using unbiased single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of ~2400 cells, we identified six human DCs and four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>e subtypes in human blood. Our study reveals a new DC subset that shares properties with plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) but potently activates T cells, thus redefining pDCs; a new subdivision within the CD1C<sup>+</sup> subset of DCs; the relationship between blastic plasmacytoid DC neoplasia cells and healthy DCs; and circulating progenitor of conventional DCs (cDCs). Our revised taxonomy will enable more accurate functional and developmental analyses as well as immune monitoring in health and disease.</p>

Synovial calprotectin
<sec><title>Aims </title><p>Recently, several synovial biomarkers have been introduced into   the algorithm for the diagnosis of a prosthetic joint infection   (PJI). Alpha defensin is a promising biomarker, with a high sensitivity   and specificity, but it is expensive. Calprotectin is a protein   that is present in the cytoplasm of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong>s, is released upon   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong> activation and exhibits anti-microbial activity. Our   aim, in this study, was to determine the diagnostic potential of   synovial calprotectin in the diagnosis of a PJI.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>In this pilot study, we prospectively collected synovial fluid   from the hip, knee, shoulder and elbow of 19 patients with a proven   PJI and from a control group of 42 patients who underwent revision   surgery without a PJI.</p><p>PJI was diagnosed according to the current diagnostic criteria   of the Musculoskeletal Infection Society. Synovial fluid was centrifuged   and the supernatant was used to measure the level of calprotectin   after applying a lateral flow immunoassay. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The median synovial calprotectin level was 991 mg/L (interquartile   range (IQR) 154 to 1787) in those with a PJI and 11 mg/L (IQR 3   to 29) in the control group (p < 0.0001). Using a cut-off value   of 50 mg/L, this level showed an excellent diagnostic accuracy,   with an area under the curve of 0.94. The overall sensitivity, specificity,   positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV)   was 89%, 90%, 81% and 95% respectively. The NPV was 97% in the nine   patients with a chronic PJI. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion </title><p>Synovial calprotectin may be a valuable biomarker in the diagnosis   of a PJI, especially in the exclusion of an infection. With a lateral   flow immunoassay, a relatively rapid quantitative diagnosis can   be made.

An entirely automated method to score DSS-induced colitis in mice by digital image analysis of pathology slides
<p>The DSS (dextran sulfate sodium) model of colitis is a mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease. Microscopic symptoms include loss of crypt cells from the gut lining and infiltration of inflammatory cells into the colon. An experienced pathologist requires several hours per study to score histological changes in selected regions of the mouse gut. In order to increase the efficiency of scoring, Definiens Developer software was used to devise an entirely automated method to quantify histological changes in the whole H&E slide. When the algorithm was applied to slides from historical drug-discovery studies, automated scores classified 88% of drug candidates in the same way as pathologists’ scores. In addition, another automated image analysis method was developed to quantify colon-infiltrating macrophages, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong>s, B cells and T cells in immunohistochemical stains of serial sections of the H&E slides. The timing of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrophil</span></strong> and macrophage infiltration had the highest correlation to pathological changes, whereas T and B cell infiltration occurred later. Thus, automated image analysis enables quantitative comparisons between tissue morphology changes and cell-infiltration dynamics.</p>

EphA2 Expression Regulates Inflammation and Fibroproliferative Remodeling in Atherosclerosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Atherosclerotic plaque formation results from chronic inflammation and fibroproliferative remodeling in the vascular wall. We previously demonstrated that both human and mouse atherosclerotic plaques show elevated expression of EphA2, a guidance molecule involved in cell-cell interactions and tumorigenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Here, we assessed the role of EphA2 in atherosclerosis by deleting EphA2 in a mouse model of atherosclerosis (Apoe<sup>−</sup><sup>/−</sup>) and by assessing EphA2 function in multiple vascular cell culture models. After 8 to 16 weeks on a Western diet, male and female mice were assessed for atherosclerotic burden in the large vessels, and plasma lipid levels were analyzed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Despite enhanced weight gain and plasma lipid levels compared with Apoe<sup>−/−</sup> controls, EphA2<sup>−/−</sup>Apoe<sup>−/−</sup> knockout mice show diminished atherosclerotic plaque formation, characterized by reduced proinflammatory gene expression and plaque macrophage content. Although plaque macrophages express EphA2, EphA2 deletion does not affect macrophage phenotype, inflammatory responses, and lipid uptake, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone marrow</span></strong> chimeras suggest that hematopoietic EphA2 deletion does not affect plaque formation. In contrast, endothelial EphA2 knockdown significantly reduces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>e firm adhesion under flow. In addition, EphA2<sup>−/−</sup>Apoe<sup>−/−</sup> mice show reduced progression to advanced atherosclerotic plaques with diminished smooth muscle and collagen content. Consistent with this phenotype, EphA2 shows enhanced expression after smooth muscle transition to a synthetic phenotype, and EphA2 depletion reduces smooth muscle proliferation, mitogenic signaling, and extracellular matrix deposition both in atherosclerotic plaques and in vascular smooth muscle cells in culture.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Together, these data identify a novel role for EphA2 in atherosclerosis, regulating both plaque inflammation and progression to advanced atherosclerotic lesions. Cell culture studies suggest that endothelial EphA2 contributes to atherosclerotic inflammation by promoting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>e firm adhesion, whereas smooth muscle EphA2 expression may regulate the progression to advanced atherosclerosis by regulating smooth muscle proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition.</p></sec>

Human Plasma Thioredoxin-80 Increases With Age and in ApoE<sup>−/−</sup> Mice Induces Inflammation, Angiogenesis, and Atherosclerosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Thioredoxin (TRX)-1, a ubiquitous 12-kDa protein, exerts antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. In contrast, the truncated form, called TRX80, produced by macrophages induces upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines. TRX80 also promotes the differentiation of mouse peritoneal and human macrophages toward a proinflammatory M1 phenotype.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>TRX1 and TRX80 plasma levels were determined with a specific ELISA. A disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein (ADAM)-10, ADAM-17, and ADAM-10 activities were measured with SensoLyte 520 ADAM10 Activity Assay Kit, Fluorimetric, and InnoZyme TACE Activity Kit, respectively. Western immunoblots were performed with specific antibodies to ADAM-10 or ADAM-17. Angiogenesis study was evaluated in vitro with human microvascular endothelial cells-1 and in vivo with the Matrigel plug angiogenesis assay in mice. The expression of macrophage phenotype markers was investigated with real-time polymerase chain reaction. Phosphorylation of Akt, mechanistic target of rapamycin, and 70S6K was determined with specific antibodies. The effect of TRX80 on NLRP3 inflammasome activity was evaluated by measuring the level of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interleukin</span></strong>-1β and -18 in the supernatants of activated macrophages with ELISA. Hearts were used for lesion surface evaluation and immunohistochemical studies, and whole descending aorta were stained with Oil Red O. For transgenic mice generation, the human scavenger receptor (SR-A) promoter/enhancer was used to drive macrophage-specific expression of human TRX80 in mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In this study, we observed a significant increase of plasma levels of TRX80 in old subjects compared with healthy young subjects. In parallel, an increase in expression and activity of ADAM-10 and ADAM-17 in old peripheral blood mononuclear cells compared with those of young subjects was observed. Furthermore, TRX80 was found to colocalize with tumor necrosis factor-α, a macrophage M1 marker, in human atherosclerotic plaque. In addition, TRX80 induced the expression of murine M1 macrophage markers through Akt2/mechanistic target of rapamycin–C1/70S6K pathway and activated the inflammasome NLRP3, leading to the release of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interleukin</span></strong>-1β and -18, potent atherogenic cytokines. Moreover, TRX80 exerts a powerful angiogenic effect in both in vitro and in vivo mouse studies. Finally, transgenic mice that overexpress human TRX80 specifically in macrophages of apoE<sup>−/−</sup> mice have a significant increase of aortic atherosclerotic lesions.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>TRX80 showed an age-dependent increase in human plasma. In mouse models, TRX80 was associated with a proinflammatory status and increased atherosclerosis.</p></sec>

EMC10 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Membrane Protein Complex Subunit 10) Is a Bone Marrow–Derived Angiogenic Growth Factor Promoting Tissue Repair After Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Clinical trials of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone marrow</span></strong> cell–based therapies after acute myocardial infarction (MI) have produced mostly neutral results. Treatment with specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone marrow</span></strong> cell–derived secreted proteins may provide an alternative biological approach to improving tissue repair and heart function after MI. We recently performed a bioinformatic secretome analysis in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone marrow</span></strong> cells from patients with acute MI and discovered a poorly characterized secreted protein, EMC10 (endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein complex subunit 10), showing activity in an angiogenic screen.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We investigated the angiogenic potential of EMC10 and its mouse homolog (Emc10) in cultured endothelial cells and infarcted heart explants. We defined the cellular sources and function of Emc10 after MI using wild-type, <i>Emc10</i>-deficient, and <i>Emc10</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone marrow</span></strong>–chimeric mice subjected to transient coronary artery ligation. Furthermore, we explored the therapeutic potential of recombinant Emc10 delivered by osmotic minipumps after MI in heart failure–prone FVB/N mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Emc10 signaled through small GTPases, p21-activated kinase, and the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)–MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2) pathway to promote actin polymerization and endothelial cell migration. Confirming the importance of these signaling events in the context of acute MI, Emc10 stimulated endothelial cell outgrowth from infarcted mouse heart explants via p38 MAPK-MK2. Emc10 protein abundance was increased in the infarcted region of the left ventricle and in the circulation of wild-type mice after MI. Emc10 expression was also increased in left ventricular tissue samples from patients with acute MI. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone marrow</span></strong>–derived <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>es and macrophages were the predominant sources of Emc10 in the infarcted murine heart. <i>Emc10</i> KO mice showed no cardiovascular phenotype at baseline. After MI, however, capillarization of the infarct border zone was impaired in KO mice, and the animals developed larger infarct scars and more pronounced left ventricular remodeling compared with wild-type mice. Transplanting KO mice with wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone marrow</span></strong> cells rescued the angiogenic defect and ameliorated left ventricular remodeling. Treating FVB/N mice with recombinant Emc10 enhanced infarct border-zone capillarization and exerted a sustained beneficial effect on left ventricular remodeling.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We have identified Emc10 as a previously unknown angiogenic growth factor that is produced by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone marrow</span></strong>–derived <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>es and macrophages as part of an endogenous adaptive response that can be enhanced therapeutically to repair the heart after MI.</p></sec>

In Vivo Functional Selection Identifies Cardiotrophin-1 as a Cardiac Engraftment Factor for Mesenchymal Stromal Cells
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Transplantation of cells into the infarcted heart has significant potential to improve myocardial recovery; however, low efficacy of cell engraftment still limits therapeutic benefit. Here, we describe a method for the unbiased, in vivo selection of cytokines that improve mesenchymal stromal cell engraftment into the heart both in normal conditions and after myocardial infarction.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>An arrayed library of 80 secreted factors, including most of the currently known <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interleukin</span></strong>s and chemokines, were individually cloned into adeno-associated viral vectors. Pools from this library were then used for the batch transduction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone marrow</span></strong>–derived mesenchymal stromal cells ex vivo, followed by intramyocardial cell administration in normal and infarcted mice. Three weeks after injection, vector genomes were recovered from the few persisting cells and identified by sequencing DNA barcodes uniquely labeling each of the tested cytokines.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The most effective molecule identified by this competitive engraftment screening was cardiotrophin-1, a member of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interleukin</span></strong>-6 family. Intracardiac injection of mesenchymal stromal cells transiently preconditioned with cardiotrophin-1 preserved cardiac function and reduced infarct size, parallel to the persistence of the transplanted cells in the healing hearts for at least 2 months after injection. Engraftment of cardiotrophin-1–treated mesenchymal stromal cells was consequent to signal transducer and activator of transcription 3–mediated activation of the focal adhesion kinase and its associated focal adhesion complex and the consequent acquisition of adhesive properties by the cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These results support the feasibility of selecting molecules in vivo for their functional properties with adeno-associated viral vector libraries and identify cardiotrophin-1 as a powerful cytokine promoting cell engraftment and thus improving cell therapy of the infarcted myocardium.</p></sec>

Acting as a ligand for liver X receptor (LXR), but an inhibitor of SREBP2 (sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2), 25-hydroxycholesterol, and its catalyzing enzyme cholesterol-25-hydroxylase (Ch25h) are important in regulating cellular inflammatory status and cholesterol biosynthesis in both ECs and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>es/macrophages.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Bioinformatic analyses were used to investigate RNA-sequencing data to identify cholesterol oxidation and efflux genes regulated by Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4).

SOX17 Regulates Conversion of Human Fibroblasts Into Endothelial Cells and Erythroblasts by Dedifferentiation Into CD34<sup>+</sup> Progenitor Cells
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The mechanisms underlying the dedifferentiation and lineage conversion of adult human fibroblasts into functional endothelial cells have not yet been fully defined. Furthermore, it is not known whether fibroblast dedifferentiation recapitulates the generation of multipotent progenitors during embryonic development, which give rise to endothelial and hematopoietic cell lineages. Here we established the role of the developmental transcription factor SOX17 in regulating the bilineage conversion of fibroblasts by the generation of intermediate progenitors.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>CD34<sup>+</sup> progenitors were generated after the dedifferentiation of human adult dermal fibroblasts by overexpression of pluripotency transcription factors. Sorted CD34<sup>+</sup> cells were transdifferentiated into induced endothelial cells and induced erythroblasts using lineage-specific growth factors. The therapeutic potential of the generated cells was assessed in an experimental model of myocardial infarction.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Induced endothelial cells expressed specific endothelial cell surface markers and also exhibited the capacity for cell proliferation and neovascularization. Induced erythroblasts expressed erythroid surface markers and formed erythroid colonies. Endothelial lineage conversion was dependent on the upregulation of the developmental transcription factor SOX17, whereas suppression of SOX17 instead directed the cells toward an erythroid fate. Implantation of these human bipotential CD34<sup>+</sup> progenitors into nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD-SCID) mice resulted in the formation of microvessels derived from human fibroblasts perfused with mouse and human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">erythrocyt</span></strong>es. Endothelial cells generated from human fibroblasts also showed upregulation of telomerase. Cell implantation markedly improved vascularity and cardiac function after myocardial infarction without any evidence of teratoma formation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Dedifferentiation of fibroblasts to intermediate CD34<sup>+</sup> progenitors gives rise to endothelial cells and erythroblasts in a SOX17-dependent manner. These findings identify the intermediate CD34<sup>+</sup> progenitor state as a critical bifurcation point, which can be tuned to generate functional blood vessels or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">erythrocyt</span></strong>es and salvage ischemic tissue.</p></sec>

Augmentation of Muscle Blood Flow by Ultrasound Cavitation Is Mediated by ATP and Purinergic Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Augmentation of tissue blood flow by therapeutic ultrasound is thought to rely on convective shear. Microbubble contrast agents that undergo ultrasound-mediated cavitation markedly amplify these effects. We hypothesized that purinergic signaling is responsible for shear-dependent increases in muscle perfusion during therapeutic cavitation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Unilateral exposure of the proximal hindlimb of mice (with or without ischemia produced by iliac ligation) to therapeutic ultrasound (1.3 MHz, mechanical index 1.3) was performed for 10 minutes after intravenous injection of 2×10<sup>8</sup> lipid microbubbles. Microvascular perfusion was evaluated by low-power contrast ultrasound perfusion imaging. In vivo muscle ATP release and in vitro ATP release from endothelial cells or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">erythrocyt</span></strong>es were assessed by a luciferin-luciferase assay. Purinergic signaling pathways were assessed by studying interventions that (1) accelerated ATP degradation; (2) inhibited P2Y receptors, adenosine receptors, or K<sub>ATP</sub> channels; or (3) inhibited downstream signaling pathways involving endothelial nitric oxide synthase or prostanoid production (indomethacin). Augmentation in muscle perfusion by ultrasound cavitation was assessed in a proof-of-concept clinical trial in 12 subjects with stable sickle cell disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Therapeutic ultrasound cavitation increased muscle perfusion by 7-fold in normal mice, reversed tissue ischemia for up to 24 hours in the murine model of peripheral artery disease, and doubled muscle perfusion in patients with sickle cell disease. Augmentation in flow extended well beyond the region of ultrasound exposure. Ultrasound cavitation produced an ≈40-fold focal and sustained increase in ATP, the source of which included both endothelial cells and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">erythrocyt</span></strong>es. Inhibitory studies indicated that ATP was a critical mediator of flow augmentation that acts primarily through either P2Y receptors or adenosine produced by ectonucleotidase activity. Combined indomethacin and inhibition of endothelial nitric oxide synthase abolished the effects of therapeutic ultrasound, indicating downstream signaling through both nitric oxide and prostaglandins.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Therapeutic ultrasound using microbubble cavitation to increase muscle perfusion relies on shear-dependent increases in ATP, which can act through a diverse portfolio of purinergic signaling pathways. These events can reverse hindlimb ischemia in mice for >24 hours and increase muscle blood flow in patients with sickle cell disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

CD4<sup>+</sup> T Cells Promote the Transition From Hypertrophy to Heart Failure During Chronic Pressure Overload
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>The mechanisms by which the heart adapts to chronic pressure overload, producing compensated hypertrophy and eventually heart failure (HF), are still not well defined. We aimed to investigate the involvement of T cells in the progression to HF using a transverse aortic constriction (TAC) model.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Chronic HF was associated with accumulation of T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lymphocyt</span></strong>es and activated/effector CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells within cardiac tissue. After TAC, enlarged heart mediastinal draining lymph nodes showed a high density of both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell subsets. To investigate the role of T cells in HF, TAC was performed on mice deficient for recombination activating gene 2 expression (RAG2KO) lacking B and T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lymphocyt</span></strong>es. Compared with wild-type TAC mice, RAG2KO mice did not develop cardiac dilation and showed improved contractile function and blunted adverse remodeling. Reconstitution of the T-cell compartment into RAG2KO mice before TAC enhanced contractile dysfunction, fibrosis, collagen accumulation, and cross-linking. To determine the involvement of a specific T-cell subset, we performed TAC on mice lacking CD4<sup>+</sup> (MHCIIKO) and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell subsets (CD8KO). In contrast to CD8KO mice, MHCIIKO mice did not develop ventricular dilation and dysfunction. MHCIIKO mice also displayed very low fibrosis, collagen accumulation, and cross-linking within cardiac tissue.

Blockade of Chronic Type I Interferon Signaling to Control Persistent LCMV Infection
<sec><title>INTERFER(ON)ing Persistence</title><p>During persistent viral infections, a dysregulated immune response fails to control the infection. <bold>Wilson <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 202) and <bold>Teijaro <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 207; see the Perspective by <bold>Odorizzi and Wherry</bold>) show this occurs because type I interferons (IFN I), critical for early responses to viral infection, contribute to the altered immunity seen during persistent infection. Antibody blockade of IFN I signaling during chronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lymphocyt</span></strong>ic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) in mice resulted in reduced viral titers at later stages of infection, reduced expression of inhibitory immune molecules and prevented the disruptions to secondary lymphoid organs typically observed during persistent infection with LCMV. Whether type I IFNs are also detrimental to persistent viral infection humans, such as HIV and hepatitis C virus, remains to be determined.</p></sec>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
An Arabidopsis TIR-Lectin Two-Domain Protein Confers Defense Properties against <i>Tetranychus urticae</i>
<p>Plant immunity depends on fast and specific transcriptional reprogramming triggered by the perception of biotic stresses. Numerous studies have been conducted to better understand the response of plants to the generalist herbivore two-spotted spider mite (<i>Tetranychus urticae</i>). However, how plants perceive mites and how this perception is translated into changes in gene expression are largely unknown. In this work, we identified a gene induced in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) upon spider mite attack that encodes a two-domain protein containing predicted lectin and Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor domains. The gene, previously named <i>PP2-A5</i>, belongs to the Phloem Protein2 family. Biotic assays showed that PP2-A5 confers tolerance to <i>T. urticae</i>. Overexpression or knockout of <i>PP2-A5</i> leads to transcriptional reprogramming that alters the balance of hormone accumulation and corresponding signaling pathways. The nucleocytoplasmic location of this protein supports a direct interaction with regulators of gene transcription, suggesting that the combination of two putative signaling domains in a single protein may provide a novel mechanism for regulating gene expression. Together, our results suggest that PP2-A5 improves the ability to defend against <i>T. urticae</i> by participating in the tight regulation of hormonal cross talk upon mite feeding. Further research is needed to determine the mechanism by which this two-domain protein functions and to clarify its molecular role in signaling following a spider mite attack.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Genome-Wide Analysis of Selection on the Malaria Parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> in West African Populations of Differing Infection Endemicity
<p>Locally varying selection on pathogens may be due to differences in drug pressure, host immunity, transmission opportunities between hosts, or the intensity of between-genotype competition within hosts. Highly recombining populations of the human malaria parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> throughout West Africa are closely related, as gene flow is relatively unrestricted in this endemic region, but markedly varying ecology and transmission intensity should cause distinct local selective pressures. Genome-wide analysis of sequence variation was undertaken on a sample of 100 <i>P. falciparum</i> clinical isolates from a highly endemic region of the Republic of Guinea where transmission occurs for most of each year and compared with data from 52 clinical isolates from a previously sampled population from The Gambia, where there is relatively limited seasonal malaria transmission. Paired-end short-read sequences were mapped against the 3D7 <i>P. falciparum</i> reference genome sequence, and data on 136,144 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were obtained. Within-population analyses identifying loci showing evidence of recent positive directional selection and balancing selection confirm that antimalarial drugs and host immunity have been major selective agents. Many of the signatures of recent directional selection reflected by standardized integrated haplotype scores were population specific, including differences at drug resistance loci due to historically different antimalarial use between the countries. In contrast, both populations showed a similar set of loci likely to be under balancing selection as indicated by very high Tajima’s <i>D</i> values, including a significant overrepresentation of genes expressed at the merozoite stage that invades <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">erythrocyt</span></strong>es and several previously validated targets of acquired immunity. Between-population <i>F</i><sub>ST</sub> analysis identified exceptional differentiation of allele frequencies at a small number of loci, most markedly for five SNPs covering a 15-kb region within and flanking the <i>gdv1</i> gene that regulates the early stages of gametocyte development, which is likely related to the extreme differences in mosquito vector abundance and seasonality that determine the transmission opportunities for the sexual stage of the parasite.</p>

Networks of enzymatically oxidized membrane lipids support calcium-dependent coagulation factor binding to maintain hemostasis
<p>Blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coagul</span></strong>ation functions as part of the innate immune system by preventing bacterial invasion, and it is critical to stopping blood loss (hemostasis). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coagul</span></strong>ation involves the external membrane surface of activated platelets and leukocytes. Using lipidomic, genetic, biochemical, and mathematical modeling approaches, we found that enzymatically oxidized phospholipids (eoxPLs) generated by the activity of leukocyte or platelet lipoxygenases (LOXs) were required for normal hemostasis and promoted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coagul</span></strong>ation factor activities in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and phosphatidylserine (PS)–dependent manner. In wild-type mice, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid–phospholipids (HETE-PLs) enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coagul</span></strong>ation and restored normal hemostasis in clotting-deficient animals genetically lacking p12-LOX or 12/15-LOX activity. Murine platelets generated 22 eoxPL species, all of which were missing in the absence of p12-LOX. Humans with the thrombotic disorder antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) had statistically significantly increased HETE-PLs in platelets and leukocytes, as well as greater HETE-PL immunoreactivity, than healthy controls. HETE-PLs enhanced membrane binding of the serum protein β2GP1 (β2-glycoprotein 1), an event considered central to the autoimmune reactivity responsible for APS symptoms. Correlation network analysis of 47 platelet eoxPL species in platelets from APS and control subjects identified their enzymatic origin and revealed a complex network of regulation, with the abundance of 31 p12-LOX–derived eoxPL molecules substantially increased in APS. In summary, circulating blood cells generate networks of eoxPL molecules, including HETE-PLs, which change membrane properties to enhance blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coagul</span></strong>ation and contribute to the excessive clotting and immunoreactivity of patients with APS.</p>

Supracellular contraction at the rear of neural crest cell groups drives collective chemotaxis
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ive cell chemotaxis, the directed migration of cell groups along gradients of soluble chemical cues, underlies various developmental and pathological processes. We use neural crest cells, a migratory embryonic stem cell population whose behavior has been likened to malignant invasion, to study <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ive chemotaxis in vivo. Studying <i>Xenopus</i> and zebrafish, we have shown that the neural crest exhibits a tensile actomyosin ring at the edge of the migratory cell group that contracts in a supracellular fashion. This contractility is polarized during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ive cell chemotaxis: It is inhibited at the front but persists at the rear of the cell cluster. The differential contractility drives directed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ive cell migration ex vivo and in vivo through the intercalation of rear cells. Thus, in neural crest cells, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ive chemotaxis works by rear-wheel drive.</p>

A cluster of immunoresolvents links coagulation to innate host defense in human blood
<p>Blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coagul</span></strong>ation is a protective response that prevents excessive bleeding upon blood vessel injury. We investigated the relationship between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coagul</span></strong>ation and the resolution of inflammation and infection by lipid mediators (LMs) through metabololipidomics-based profiling of human whole blood (WB) during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coagul</span></strong>ation. We identified temporal clusters of endogenously produced prothrombotic and proinflammatory LMs (eicosanoids), as well as specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs). In addition to eicosanoids, a specific SPM cluster was identified that consisted of resolvin E1 (RvE1), RvD1, RvD5, lipoxin B<sub>4</sub>, and maresin 1, each of which was present at bioactive concentrations (0.1 to 1 nM). Removal of adenosine from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coagul</span></strong>ating blood markedly enhanced the amounts of SPMs produced and further increased the biosynthesis of RvD3, RvD4, and RvD6. The cyclooxygenase inhibitors celecoxib and indomethacin, which block the production of thromboxanes and prostanoids, did not block the production of clot-driven SPMs. Unbiased mass cytometry analysis demonstrated that the SPM cluster produced in human blood targeted leukocytes at the single-cell level, directly activating ERK and CREB signaling in neutrophils and CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes. Treatment of human WB with the components of this SPM cluster enhanced both the phagocytosis and killing of <i>Escherichia coli</i> by leukocytes. Together, these data identify a proresolving LM circuit, including endogenous molecular brakes and accelerators, which promoted host defense. These temporal LM-SPM clusters can provide accessible metabolomic profiles for precision and personalized medicine.</p>

Supracellular contractions propel migration
<p>Constructing multicellular bodies, starting from a single-cell zygote, often requires the movement of cells across considerable distances, which is achieved through cell migration. During embryonic development, as well as in healing and regeneration, cells travel across diverse terrains, which dictates the character of navigation (<i>1</i>). Cancer cells metastasize and migrate into healthy organs, and knowledge of their migration strategies could be important to identify targets to treat advanced disease (<i>2</i>). Some migratory cells cover large distances individually (<i>3</i>), whereas others migrate in groups, with leaders and followers being directed by chemical signals (chemotaxis) (<i>4</i>, <i>5</i>). The exchange of information and resulting motility of such groups has been enigmatic. Moreover, the driving force of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ive cell migration has been considered a sum of migratory and signaling activities of individually participating cells. However, according to a study on page 339 of this issue by Shellard <i>et al.</i> (<i>6</i>), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ive cell migration requires formation of cytoskeletal structures that span through adjoining cells at the rear of a cell group to coordinate, orient, and propel the entire group. This mechanism of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ive cell migration could be applicable to cancer metastasis and wound healing and might change our understanding of developmental migration.</p>

Induction of CD4 T cell memory by local cellular collectivity
<p>Cell differentiation is directed by signals driving progenitors into specialized cell types. This process can involve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ive decision-making, when differentiating cells determine their lineage choice by interacting with each other. We used live-cell imaging in microwell arrays to study <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ive processes affecting differentiation of naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells into memory precursors. We found that differentiation of precursor memory T cells sharply increases above a threshold number of locally interacting cells. These homotypic interactions involve the cytokines interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-6, which affect memory differentiation orthogonal to their effect on proliferation and survival. Mathematical modeling suggests that the differentiation rate is continuously modulated by the instantaneous number of locally interacting cells. This cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ivity can prioritize allocation of immune memory to stronger responses.</p>

Generation of a Collection of Mutant Tomato Lines Using Pooled CRISPR Libraries
<p>The high efficiency of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-mediated mutagenesis in plants enables the development of high-throughput mutagenesis strategies. By transforming pooled CRISPR libraries into tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ions of mutant lines were generated with minimal transformation attempts and in a relatively short period of time. Identification of the targeted gene(s) was easily determined by sequencing the incorporated guide RNA(s) in the primary transgenic events. From a single transformation with a CRISPR library targeting the immunity-associated leucine-rich repeat subfamily XII genes, heritable mutations were recovered in 15 of the 54 genes targeted. To increase throughput, a second CRISPR library was made containing three guide RNAs per construct to target 18 putative transporter genes. This resulted in stable mutations in 15 of the 18 targeted genes, with some primary transgenic plants having as many as five mutated genes. Furthermore, the redundancy in this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ion of plants allowed for the association of aberrant T0 phenotypes with the underlying targeted genes. Plants with mutations in a homolog of an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) boron efflux transporter displayed boron deficiency phenotypes. The strategy described here provides a technically simple yet high-throughput approach for generating a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ion of lines with targeted mutations and should be applicable to any plant transformation system.</p>

Association Between Urinary Sodium and Potassium Excretion and Blood Pressure Among Adults in the United States
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Higher levels of sodium and lower levels of potassium intake are associated with higher blood pressure. However, the shape and magnitude of these associations can vary by study participant characteristics or intake assessment method. Twenty-four–hour urinary excretion of sodium and potassium are unaffected by recall errors and represent all sources of intake, and were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ed for the first time in a nationally representative US survey. Our objective was to assess the associations of blood pressure and hypertension with 24-hour urinary excretion of sodium and potassium among US adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Cross-sectional data were obtained from 766 participants age 20 to 69 years with complete blood pressure and 24-hour urine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ions in the 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a nationally representative survey of the US noninstitutionalized population. Usual 24-hour urinary electrolyte excretion (sodium, potassium, and their ratio) was estimated from ≤2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ions on nonconsecutive days, adjusting for day-to-day variability in excretion. Outcomes included systolic and diastolic blood pressure from the average of 3 measures and hypertension status, based on average blood pressure ≥140/90 and antihypertensive medication use.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>After multivariable adjustment, each 1000-mg difference in usual 24-hour sodium excretion was directly associated with systolic (4.58 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.64–6.51) and diastolic (2.25 mm Hg; 95% CI, 0.83–3.67) blood pressures. Each 1000-mg difference in potassium excretion was inversely associated with systolic blood pressure (–3.72 mm Hg; 95% CI, –6.01 to –1.42). Each 0.5 U difference in sodium-to-potassium ratio was directly associated with systolic blood pressure (1.72 mm Hg; 95% CI, 0.76–2.68). Hypertension was linearly associated with progressively higher sodium and lower potassium excretion; in comparison with the lowest quartile of excretion, the adjusted odds of hypertension for the highest quartile was 4.22 (95% CI, 1.36–13.15) for sodium, and 0.38 (95% CI, 0.17–0.87) for potassium (<i>P</i><0.01 for trends).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These cross-sectional results show a strong dose-response association between urinary sodium excretion and blood pressure, and an inverse association between urinary potassium excretion and blood pressure, in a nationally representative sample of US adults.</p></sec>

Use of a Single Baseline Versus Multiyear 24-Hour Urine Collection for Estimation of Long-Term Sodium Intake and Associated Cardiovascular and Renal Risk
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>A decrease in sodium intake has been shown to lower blood pressure, but data from cohort studies on the association with cardiovascular and renal outcomes are inconsistent. In these studies, sodium intake was often estimated with a single baseline measurement, which may be inaccurate considering day-to-day changes in sodium intake and sodium excretion. We compared the effects of single versus repetitive follow-up 24-hour urine samples on the relation between sodium intake and long-term cardiorenal outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We selected adult subjects with an estimated glomerular filtration rate >60 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>, an outpatient 24-hour urine sample between 1998 and 1999, and at least 1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ion during a 17-year follow-up.

We used Cox regression analysis and the landmark approach to investigate the relation between sodium intake and cardiovascular (cardiovascular events or mortality) and renal (end-stage renal disease: dialysis, transplantation, and/or >60% estimated glomerular filtration rate decline, or mortality) outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We included 574 subjects with 9776 twenty-four–hour urine samples. Average age was 47 years, and 46% were male. Median follow-up was 16.2 years. Average 24-hour sodium excretion, ranging from 3.8 to 3.9 g (165–170 mmol), was equal among all methods (<i>P</i>=0.88). However, relative to a single baseline measurement, 50% of the subjects had a >0.8-g (>34-mmol) difference in sodium intake with long-term estimations. As a result, 45%, 49%, and 50% of all subjects switched between tertiles of sodium intake when the 1-, 5-, or 15-year average was used, respectively. Consequently, hazard ratios for cardiorenal outcome changed up to 85% with the use of sodium intake estimations from short-term (1-year) and long-term (5-year) follow-up instead of baseline estimations.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Relative to a single baseline 24-hour sodium measurement, the use of subsequent 24-hour urine samples resulted in different estimations of an individual’s sodium intake, whereas population averages remained similar.

Terahertz field–induced ferroelectricity in quantum paraelectric SrTiO<sub>3</sub>
<p>“Hidden phases” are metastable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ive states of matter that are typically not accessible on equilibrium phase diagrams. These phases can host exotic properties in otherwise conventional materials and hence may enable novel functionality and applications, but their discovery and access are still in early stages. Using intense terahertz electric field excitation, we found that an ultrafast phase transition into a hidden ferroelectric phase can be dynamically induced in quantum paraelectric strontium titanate (SrTiO<sub>3</sub>). The induced lowering in crystal symmetry yields substantial changes in the phonon excitation spectra. Our results demonstrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ive coherent control over material structure, in which a single-cycle field drives ions along the microscopic pathway leading directly to their locations in a new crystalline phase on an ultrafast time scale.</p>

The tumor as organizer model
<p>In 1924, Hans Spemann and Hilde Mangold reported that a small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ion of cells taken from a gastrulating newt embryo could, when transplanted into a separate embryo, coax the newly adjacent cells to form a second embryonic axis (<i>1</i>). This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ion of embryonic cells came to be called the “organizer,” and its identification codified the concept of induction—that cells influence their neighbors to change fate, often in dramatic fashion. Importantly, the organizer does not actually “organize” the embryo; rather, it initiates a cascade of sequential induction events that ultimately give the embryo its shape. In the decades since this landmark observation, it has become clear that induction plays a ubiquitous role in both embryonic and adult tissues, and that secreted and/or membrane-associated factors mediate the process. How does the embryonic organizer model apply to the various features of malignant progression, including stroma formation, metastatic spread, and tumor heterogeneity?</p>

Collective clog control: Optimizing traffic flow in confined biological and robophysical excavation
<p>Groups of interacting active particles, insects, or humans can form clusters that hinder the goals of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ive; therefore, development of robust strategies for control of such clogs is essential, particularly in confined environments. Our biological and robophysical excavation experiments, supported by computational and theoretical models, reveal that digging performance can be robustly optimized within the constraints of narrow tunnels by individual idleness and retreating. Tools from the study of dense particulate ensembles elucidate how idleness reduces the frequency of flow-stopping clogs and how selective retreating reduces cluster dissolution time for the rare clusters that still occur. Our results point to strategies by which dense active matter and swarms can become task capable without sophisticated sensing, planning, and global control of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ive.</p>

From local collective behavior to global migratory patterns in white storks
<p>Soaring migrant birds exploit columns of rising air (thermals) to cover large distances with minimal energy. Using social information while locating thermals may benefit such birds, but examining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ive movements in wild migrants has been a major challenge for researchers. We investigated the group movements of a flock of 27 naturally migrating juvenile white storks by using high-resolution GPS and accelerometers. Analyzing individual and group movements on multiple scales revealed that a small number of leaders navigated to and explored thermals, whereas followers benefited from their movements. Despite this benefit, followers often left thermals earlier and at lower height, and consequently they had to flap considerably more. Followers also migrated less far annually than did leaders. We provide insights into the interactions between freely flying social migrants and the costs and benefits of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ive movement in natural populations.</p>

Coherent single-atom superradiance
<p>Superradiance is a quantum phenomenon emerging in macroscopic systems whereby correlated single atoms cooperatively emit photons.

Biosynthesis of Diterpenoids in <i>Tripterygium</i> Adventitious Root Cultures

An analysis of publicly available transcriptome data sets <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ed with <i>T. regelii</i> roots and root cultures indicated the presence of a large gene family (with 20 members) for terpene synthases (TPSs). Nine candidate diterpene synthase genes were selected for follow-up functional evaluation, of which two belonged to the TPS-c, three to the TPS-e/f, and four to the TPS-b subfamilies. These genes were characterized by heterologous expression in a modular metabolic engineering system in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. Members of the TPS-c subfamily were characterized as copalyl diphosphate (diterpene) synthases, and those belonging to the TPS-e/f subfamily catalyzed the formation of precursors of kaurane diterpenoids. The TPS-b subfamily encompassed genes coding for enzymes involved in abietane diterpenoid biosynthesis and others with activities as monoterpene synthases. The structural characterization of diterpenoids accumulating in the medium of <i>T. regelii</i> adventitious root cultures, facilitated by searching the Spektraris online spectral database, enabled us to formulate a biosynthetic pathway for the biosynthesis of triptolide, a diterpenoid with pharmaceutical potential. Considering the significant enrichment of diterpenoids in the culture medium, fast-growing adventitious root cultures may hold promise as a sustainable resource for the large-scale production of triptolide.</p>

Ultrafast Approximation for Phylogenetic Bootstrap
<p>Nonparametric bootstrap has been a widely used tool in phylogenetic analysis to assess the clade support of phylogenetic trees. However, with the rapidly growing amount of data, this task remains a computational bottleneck. Recently, approximation methods such as the RAxML rapid bootstrap (RBS) and the Shimodaira–Hasegawa-like approximate likelihood ratio test have been introduced to speed up the bootstrap. Here, we suggest an ultrafast bootstrap approximation approach (UFBoot) to compute the support of phylogenetic groups in maximum likelihood (ML) based trees. To achieve this, we combine the resampling estimated log-likelihood method with a simple but effective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ion scheme of candidate trees. We also propose a stopping rule that assesses the convergence of branch support values to automatically determine when to stop <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ing candidate trees. UFBoot achieves a median speed up of 3.1 (range: 0.66–33.3) to 10.2 (range: 1.32–41.4) compared with RAxML RBS for real DNA and amino acid alignments, respectively. Moreover, our extensive simulations show that UFBoot is robust against moderate model violations and the support values obtained appear to be relatively unbiased compared with the conservative standard bootstrap. This provides a more direct interpretation of the bootstrap support. We offer an efficient and easy-to-use software (available at <ext-link>http://www.cibiv.at/software/iqtree</ext-link>) to perform the UFBoot analysis with ML tree inference.</p>

<i>In vivo</i> cranial bone strain and bite force in the agamid lizard <i>Uromastyx geyri</i>

Principal and shear strain magnitudes in <i>Uromastyx geyri</i> were lower than cranial bone strains recorded in <i>Alligator mississippiensis</i>, but higher than those reported from herbivorous mammals. Our results suggest that variations in principal strain orientations in the facial skeleton are largely due to differences in feeding behavior and bite location, whereas food type has little impact on strain orientations. Furthermore, mean principal strain orientations differ between male and female <i>Uromastyx</i> during feeding, potentially because of sexual dimorphism in skull morphology.</p>

The secreted <i>AdamTS-A</i> metalloprotease is required for collective cell migration
<p>Members of the ADAMTS family of secreted metalloproteases play crucial roles in modulating the extracellular matrix (ECM) in development and disease. Here, we show that ADAMTS-A, the <i>Drosophila</i> ortholog of human ADAMTS 9 and ADAMTS 20, and of <i>C. elegans</i> GON-1, is required for cell migration during embryogenesis. <i>AdamTS-A</i> is expressed in multiple migratory cell types, including hemocytes, caudal visceral mesoderm (CVM), the visceral branch of the trachea (VBs) and the secretory portion of the salivary gland (SG). Loss of <i>AdamTS-A</i> causes defects in germ cell, CVM and VB migration and, depending on the tissue, <i>AdamTS-A</i> functions both autonomously and non-autonomously. In the highly polarized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ive of the SG epithelium, loss of <i>AdamTS-A</i> causes apical surface irregularities and cell elongation defects. We provide evidence that ADAMTS-A is secreted into the SG lumen where it functions to release cells from the apical ECM, consistent with the defects observed in <i>AdamTS-A</i> mutant SGs. We show that loss of the apically localized protocadherin <i>Cad99C</i> rescues the SG defects, suggesting that Cad99C serves as a link between the SG apical membrane and the secreted apical ECM component(s) cleaved by ADAMTS-A. Our analysis of <i>AdamTS-A</i> function in the SG suggests a novel role for ADAMTS proteins in detaching cells from the apical ECM, facilitating tube elongation during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ive cell migration.</p>

There was a high correlation between body mass index in MESA and HealthLNK (0.94; <i>P</i><0.0001). HealthLNK underestimated body mass index by 0.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (95% confidence interval, –0.4 to –0.1). With the use of <i>International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision</i> codes and clinical data, the sensitivity and specificity of HealthLNK queries for hypertension were 82.4% and 59.4%, for obesity were 73.0% and 89.8%, and for diabetes mellitus were 79.8% and 93.3%. In comparison with adjudicated cardiovascular events in MESA, the concordance rates for myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure were, respectively, 41.7% (5/12), 61.5% (8/13), and 62.5% (10/16).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These findings illustrate the limitations and strengths of electronic data repositories in comparison with information <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ed by traditional standardized epidemiological approaches for the ascertainment of cardiovascular risk factors and events.</p></sec>

Sources of Sodium in US Adults From 3 Geographic Regions
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Most US adults consume excess sodium. Knowledge about the dietary sources of sodium intake is critical to the development of effective reduction strategies.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A total of 450 adults were recruited from 3 geographic locations: Birmingham, AL (n=150); Palo Alto, CA (n=150); and the Minneapolis–St. Paul, MN (n=150), metropolitan areas. Equal numbers of women and men from each of 4 race/ethnic groups (blacks, Asians, Hispanics, and non-Hispanic whites) were targeted for recruitment. Four record-assisted 24-hour dietary recalls were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ed from each participant with special procedures, which included the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ion of duplicate samples of salt added to food at the table and in home food preparation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Sodium added to food outside the home was the leading source of sodium, accounting for more than two thirds (70.9%) of total sodium intake in the sample. Although the proportion of sodium from this source was smaller in some subgroups, it was the leading contributor for all subgroups. Contribution ranged from 66.3% for those with a high school level of education or less to 75.0% for those 18 to 29 years of age. Sodium inherent to food was the next highest contributor (14.2%), followed by salt added in home food preparation (5.6%) and salt added to food at the table (4.9%). Home tap water consumed as a beverage and dietary supplement and nonprescription antacids contributed minimally to sodium intake (<0.5% each).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Sodium added to food outside the home accounted for ≈70% of dietary sodium intake. This finding is consistent with the 2010 Institute of Medicine recommendation for reduction of sodium in commercially processed foods as the primary strategy to reduce sodium intake in the United States.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

FAK–Src signalling is important to renal collecting duct morphogenesis: discovery using a hierarchical screening technique
<p>This report describes a hierarchical screening technique for identification of pathways that control the morphogenesis of the renal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ing duct system. The multi-step screen involves a first round using a 2-dimensional, cell-line-based scrape-healing assay, then a second round using a 3-dimensional tubulogenesis assay; both of these rounds use new cell lines described in this report. The final stage is <i>ex vivo</i> organ culture. We demonstrate the utility of the screen by using it to identify the FAK–Src-pathway signalling as being important for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ing duct development, specifically for the cell proliferation on which this development depends.</p>

Unconstrained metacarpophalangeal joint arthroplasties
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We performed a systematic review of the current literature regarding   the outcomes of unconstrained metacarpophalangeal joint (MCPJ) arthroplasty.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We initially identified 1305 studies, and 406 were found to be   duplicates. After exclusion criteria were applied, seven studies   were included. Outcomes extracted included pre- and post-operative   pain visual analogue scores, range of movement (ROM), strength of   pinch and grip, satisfaction and patient reported outcome measures   (PROMs). Clinical and radiological complications were recorded.   The results are presented in three groups based on the design of   the arthroplasty and the aetiology (pyrocarbon-osteoarthritis (pyro-OA),   pyrocarbon-inflammatory arthritis (pyro-IA), metal-on-polyethylene   (MoP)).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Results show that pyrocarbon implants provide an 85% reduction   in pain, 144% increase of pinch grip and 13° improvements in ROM   for both OA and IA combined. Patients receiving MoP arthroplasties   had a reduction in pinch strength. Satisfaction rates were 91% and   92% for pyrocarbon-OA and pyrocarbon-IA groups, respectively. There were   nine failures in 87 joints (10.3%) over a mean follow-up of 5.5   years (1.0 to 14.3) for pyro-OA. There were 18 failures in 149 joints   (12.1%) over a mean period of 6.6 years (1.0 to 16.0) for pyro-IA.   Meta-analysis was not possible due to the heterogeneity of the studies   and the limited presentation of data.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We would recommend prospective data <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ion for small joint   arthroplasties of the hand consisting of PROMs that would allow   clinicians to come to stronger conclusions about the impact on function   of replacing the MCPJs.

Minimally invasive surgery for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to report a retrospective, consecutive   series of patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) who   were treated with posterior minimally invasive surgery (MIS) with   a mean follow-up of two years (<sc>sd</sc> 1.4; 0.9 to 0 3.7). Our   objectives were to measure the correction of the deformity and record   the peri-operative morbidity. Special attention was paid to the   operating time (ORT), estimated blood loss (EBL), length of stay   (LOS) and further complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We prospectively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ed the data of 70 consecutive patients   with AIS treated with MIS using three incisions and a muscle-splitting   approach by a single surgeon between June 2013 and February 2016   and these were retrospectively reviewed. There were eight male and   62 female patients with a mean age of 15 years (<sc>sd</sc> 4.5   ) with a mean body mass index of 19.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (<sc>sd</sc> 5.4).   The curves were classified according to Lenke; 40 curves were type   1, 15 were type 2, three were type 3, two were type 4, eight were   type 5 and two were type 6.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean primary Cobb angle was corrected from 58.9° (<sc>sd</sc> 12.6°)   pre-operatively to 17.7° (<sc>sd</sc> 10.2°) post-operatively with   a mean correction of 69% (<sc>sd</sc> 20%, p < 0.001). The mean   kyphosis at T5 to T12 increased from 24.2° (<sc>sd</sc> 12.2°) pre-operatively   to 30.1° (<sc>sd</sc> 9.6°,    p < 0.001) post-operatively. Peri-operative (30 days) complications   occurred in three patients(4.2%): one subcutaneous haematoma, one   deep venous thrombosis and one pulmonary complication. Five additional complications   occurred in five patients (7.1%): one superficial wound infection,   one suture granuloma and three delayed deep surgical site infections.   The mean ORT was 337.1 mins (<sc>sd</sc> 121.3); the mean EBL was   345.7 ml (<sc>sd</sc> 175.1) and the mean LOS was 4.6 days (<sc>sd</sc> 0.8).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The use of MIS for patients with AIS results in a significant   correction of spinal deformity in both the frontal and sagittal   planes, with a low EBL and a short LOS. The rate of peri-operative   complications compares well with that following a routine open technique.   The longer term safety and benefit of MIS in these patients needs   to be evaluated with further follow-up of a larger cohort of patients.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1651–7.</p></sec>

A positive bacterial culture during re-implantation is associated with a poor outcome in two-stage exchange arthroplasty for deep infection
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to identify the incidence of positive   cultures during the second stage of a two-stage revision arthroplasty   and to analyse the association between positive cultures and an   infection-free outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This single-centre retrospective review of prospectively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ed   data included patients with a periprosthetic joint infection (PJI)   of either the hip or the knee between 2013 and 2015, who were treated   using a standardised diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm with two-stage   exchange. Failure of treatment was assessed according to a definition   determined by a Delphi-based consensus. Logistic regression analysis   was performed to assess the predictors of positive culture and risk   factors for failure. The mean follow-up was 33 months (24 to 48).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 163 two-stage revision arthroplasties involving 84   total hip arthroplasties (THAs) and 79 total knee arthroplasties   (TKAs) were reviewed.

The same initially infecting organism was isolated at re-implantation   in nine of 27 patients (33.3%). The organism causing re-infection   in none of the patients was the same as that isolated at re-implantation.   The risk of the failure of treatment was significantly higher in   patients with a positive culture (odds ratio (OR) 1.7; 95% confidence   interval (CI) 1.0 to 3.0; p = 0.049) and in patients with a higher   Charlson Comorbidity Index (OR 1.5; 95% CI 1.6 to 1.8; p = 0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Positive culture at re-implantation was independently associated   with subsequent failure.

Tuberculosis of the spine with severe angular kyphosis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To address the natural history of severe post-tuberculous (TB)   kyphosis, with focus upon the long-term neurological outcome, occurrence   of restrictive lung disease, and the effect on life expectancy. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This is a retrospective clinical review of prospectively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ed   imaging data based at a single institute. A total of 24 patients   of Southern Chinese origin who presented with spinal TB with a mean   of 113° of kyphosis (65° to 159°) who fulfilled inclusion criteria   were reviewed. Plain radiographs were used to assess the degree   of spinal deformity. Myelography, CT and MRI were used when available   to assess the integrity of the spinal cord and canal. Patient demographics,   age of onset of spinal TB and interventions, types of surgical procedure,   intra- and post-operative complications, and neurological status   were assessed. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>All except one of the 24 patients were treated with anti-TB chemotherapy   when they were first diagnosed with spinal TB. They subsequently   received surgery either for neurological deterioration, or deformity   correction in later life. The mean follow-up was 34 years (11 to   59) since these surgical interventions. Some 16 patients (66.7%) suffered   from late neurological deterioration at a mean of 26 years (8 to   49) after the initial drug treatment. The causes of neurological   deterioration were healed disease in nine patients (56.2%),    re-activation in six patients (37.5%) and adjacent level spinal   stenosis in one patient (6.3%). The result of surgery was worse   in healed disease. Eight patients without neurological deterioration   received surgery to correct the kyphosis. The mean correction ranged   from 97° to 72°. Three patients who were clinically quiescent with   no neurological deterioration were found to have active TB of the   spine. Solid fusion was achieved in all cases and no patient suffered   from neurological deterioration after 42 years of follow-up. On   final follow-up, six patients were noted to have deceased (age range:   47 years to 75 years).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study presents one of the longest assessments of spinal TB   with severe kyphosis. Severe post-TB kyphosis may lead to significant   health problems many years following the initial drug treatment.   Early surgical correction of the kyphosis, solid fusion and regular   surveillance may avoid late complications. Paraplegia, restrictive   lung disease and early onset kyphosis might relate to early death.   Clinically quiescent disease does not mean cure. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1381–8.</p></sec>

Three groups of dissatisfied patients exist after total knee arthroplasty: early, persistent, and late
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The primary aim of this study was to assess whether patient satisfaction   one year after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) changed with longer   follow-up. The secondary aims were to identify predictors of satisfaction   at one year, persistence of patient dissatisfaction, and late onset   dissatisfaction in patients that were originally satisfied at one year.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A retrospective cohort consisting of 1369 patients undergoing   a primary TKA for osteoarthritis that had not undergone revision   were identified from an established arthroplasty database. Patient   demographics, comorbidities, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities   Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) scores, and Short Form 12 (SF-12) questionnaire   scores were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ed preoperatively, and one and five years postoperatively.   In addition, patient satisfaction was assessed at one and five years   postoperatively. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify   independent predictors of satisfaction at one and five years.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The overall rate of satisfaction did not change from one (91.7%,   n = 1255) to five (90.1%, n = 1234) years (p = 0.16). Approximately   half (n = 53/114) of the patients who were dissatisfied at one year   became satisfied with their TKA at five years, whereas 6% (n = 74/1255)   of those who were satisfied at one year became dissatisfied at five   years. At one year, patients with lung disease (p = 0.04), with   depression (p = 0.001), with back pain (p < 0.001), undergoing unilateral   TKA (p = 0.001), or with a worse preoperative WOMAC pain score (p = 0.04)   were more likely to be dissatisfied. Patients with gastric ulceration   (p = 0.04) and a worse WOMAC stiffness score (p = 0.047) were at increased   risk of persistent dissatisfaction at five years. In contrast, a   worse WOMAC pain score (p = 0.01) at one year was a predictor of   dissatisfaction in previously satisfied patients at five years.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Three groups of dissatisfied patients exist after TKA: ‘early’   dissatisfaction at one year, ‘persistent’ dissatisfaction with longer   follow-up, and ‘late’ dissatisfaction developing in previously satisfied   patients at one year.

Intra-operative digital imaging
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aims of this study were to examine the rate at which the   positioning of the acetabular component, leg length discrepancy   and femoral offset are outside an acceptable range in total hip   arthroplasties (THAs) which either do or do not involve the use   of intra-operative digital imaging.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A retrospective case-control study was undertaken with 50 patients   before and 50 patients after the integration of an intra-operative   digital imaging system in THA. The demographics of the two groups   were comparable for body mass index, age, laterality and the indication   for surgery. The digital imaging group had more men than the group without.   Surgical data and radiographic parameters, including the inclination   and anteversion of the acetabular component, leg length discrepancy,   and the difference in femoral offset compared with the contralateral   hip were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ed and compared, as well as the incidence of altering   the position of a component based on the intra-operative image.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Digital imaging took a mean of five minutes (2.3 to 14.6) to   perform.

Reconstruction of the hip after resection of periacetabular oncological lesions
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Reconstruction of the acetabulum after resection of a periacetabular   malignancy is technically challenging and many different techniques   have been used with varying success. Our aim was to prepare a systematic   review of the literature dealing with these techniques in order   to clarify the management, the rate of complications and the outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A search of PubMed and MEDLINE was conducted for English language   articles published between January 1990 and February 2017 with combinations   of key search terms to identify studies dealing with periacetabular   resection with reconstruction in patients with a malignancy. Studies   in English that reported radiographic or clinical outcomes were   included. Data <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ed from each study included: the number and   type of reconstructions, the pathological diagnosis of the lesions,   the mean age and follow-up, gender distribution, implant survivorship, complications,   functional outcome, and mortality. The results from individual studies   were combined for the general analysis, and then grouped according   to the type of reconstruction. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 57 studies met the inclusion criteria and included   1700 patients. Most lesions were metastatic (41%), followed by chondrosarcoma   (29%), osteosarcoma (10%), Ewing’s sarcoma (7%), and multiple myeloma   (2%). The techniques of reconstruction were divided into seven types   for analysis: those involving a Harrington reconstruction, a saddle   prosthesis, an allograft and allograft prosthesis composite, a pasteurised   autograft, a porous tantalum implant, a custom-made prosthesis and   a modular hemipelvic reconstruction. The rate of complications was   50%, with infection (14%) and instability (8%) being the most common.   Mortality data were available for 1427 patients (84%); 50% had died   of disease progression, 23% were alive with disease, and 27% had no   evidence of disease at a mean follow-up of 3.4 years (0 to 34). </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Both the rate of complications and mortality are high following   resection of oncological periacetabular lesions and reconstruction.   Many types of reconstruction have been used with unique challenges   and complications for each technique. Newer prostheses, including   custom-made prostheses and porous tantalum implants and augments, have   shown promising early functional and radiographic outcomes. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B(1   Supple A):22–30.</p></sec>

A pilot randomized trial of meniscal allograft transplantation versus personalized physiotherapy for patients with a symptomatic meniscal deficient knee compartment
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Meniscal allograft transplantation is undertaken to improve pain   and function in patients with a symptomatic meniscal deficient knee   compartment. While case series have shown improvements in patient   reported outcome measures (PROMs), its efficacy has not been rigorously   evaluated. This study aimed to compare PROMs in patients having   meniscal transplantation with those having personalized physiotherapy   at 12 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A single-centre assessor-blinded, comprehensive cohort study,   incorporating a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) was performed   on patients with a symptomatic compartment of the knee in which   a (sub)total meniscectomy had previously been performed. They were   randomized to be treated either with a meniscal allograft transplantation   or personalized physiotherapy, and stratified for malalignment of   the limb. They entered the preference groups if they were not willing   to be randomized. The Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS),   International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score and Lysholm   score and complications were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ed at baseline and at four,   eight and 12 months following the interventions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 36 patients entered the study; 21 were randomized   and 15 chose their treatments. Their mean age was 28 years (range   17 to 46). The outcomes were similar in the randomized and preference   groups, allowing pooling of data. At 12 months, the KOOS<sub>4</sub> composite   score (mean difference 12, p = 0.03) and KOOS subscales of pain   (mean difference 15, p = 0.02) and activities of daily living (mean   difference 18, p = 0.005) were significantly superior in the meniscal   transplantation group.

Metal-on-metal total hip arthroplasty is not associated with cardiac disease
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Many case reports and small studies have suggested that cobalt   ions are a potential cause of cardiac complications, specifically   cardiomyopathy, after metal-on-metal (MoM) total hip arthroplasty   (THA). The impact of metal ions on the incidence of cardiac disease   after MoM THA has not been evaluated in large studies. The aim of   this study was to compare the rate of onset of new cardiac symptoms   in patients who have undergone MoM THA with those who have undergone   metal-on-polyethylene (MoP) THA.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Data were extracted from the Standard Analytics Files database   for patients who underwent MoM THA between 2005 and 2012. Bearing   surface was selected using International Classification of Diseases   ninth revision codes. Patients with a minimum five-year follow-up   were selected. An age and gender-matched cohort of patients who underwent   MoP THA served as a comparison group. New diagnoses of cardiac disease   were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ed during the follow-up period. Comorbidities and demographics   were identified and routine descriptive statistics were used.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We identified 29 483 patients who underwent MoM THA and 24 175   matched patients who underwent MoP THA. Both groups had a mean Charlson   comorbidity index score of 4. There were no statistically significant   differences in 30 of 31 pre-existing comorbidities. Patients undergoing   MoM THA had a slightly lower incidence of cardiac failure compared   with those undergoing MoP THA at three years (6.60% <i>versus</i> 7.06%,   odds ratio (OR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87 to 0.99)   and four years (8.73% <i>versus</i> 9.49%, OR 0.91, 95%   CI 0.86 to 0.97) postoperatively, with no difference in the incidence   of new cardiac failure in between the groups at five years. There   was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of   arrhythmia, myocardial infarction and cardiomyopathy at any time   between the two groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>MoM THA is not associated with cardiac complications. Initial   reports may have represented individual instances of cardiac disease   in patients with a failing MoM articulation rather than an emerging   epidemiological trend.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:28–32.</p></sec>

Cross-species analysis of genetically engineered mouse models of MAPK-driven colorectal cancer identifies hallmarks of the human disease
<p>Effective treatment options for advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) are limited, survival rates are poor and this disease continues to be a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Despite being a highly heterogeneous disease, a large subset of individuals with sporadic CRC typically harbor relatively few established ‘driver’ lesions. Here, we describe a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ion of genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of sporadic CRC that combine lesions frequently altered in human patients, including well-characterized tumor suppressors and activators of MAPK signaling. Primary tumors from these models were profiled, and individual GEMM tumors segregated into groups based on their genotypes. Unique allelic and genotypic expression signatures were generated from these GEMMs and applied to clinically annotated human CRC patient samples. We provide evidence that a <i>Kras</i> signature derived from these GEMMs is capable of distinguishing human tumors harboring <i>KRAS</i> mutation, and tracks with poor prognosis in two independent human patient cohorts. Furthermore, the analysis of a panel of human CRC cell lines suggests that high expression of the GEMM <i>Kras</i> signature correlates with sensitivity to targeted pathway inhibitors. Together, these findings implicate GEMMs as powerful preclinical tools with the capacity to recapitulate relevant human disease biology, and support the use of genetic signatures generated in these models to facilitate future drug discovery and validation efforts.</p>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
A necrotic stimulus is required to maximize matrix-mediated myogenesis in mice
<p>Biomaterials that are similar to skeletal muscle extracellular matrix have been shown to augment regeneration in ischemic muscle. In this study, treatment with a collagen-based matrix stimulated molecular myogenesis in an <i>mdx</i> murine model of necrosis. Matrix-treated animals ran ≥40% further, demonstrating functional regeneration, and expressed increased levels of myogenic transcripts. By contrast, matrix treatment was unable to induce transcriptional or functional changes in an <i>MLC/SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></i> atrophic mouse model. <i>In vitro</i>, satellite cells were cultured under standard conditions, on matrix, in the presence of myocyte debris (to simulate a necrotic-like environment) or with both matrix and necrotic stimuli. Exposure to both matrix and necrotic stimuli induced the greatest increases in <i>mef2c</i>, <i>myf5</i>, <i>myoD</i> and myogenin transcripts. Furthermore, conditioned medium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ed from satellite cells cultured with both stimuli contained elevated levels of factors that modulate satellite cell activation and proliferation, such as FGF-2, HGF and SDF-1. Application of the conditioned medium to C2C12 myoblasts accelerated maturation, as demonstrated by increased <i>mef2c</i>, <i>myf5</i> and myogenin transcripts and fusion indexes. In summary, the collagen matrix required a necrotic stimulus to enhance the maturation of satellite cells and their secretion of a myogenic cocktail. Considering that matrix treatment supports myogenesis only in <i>in vivo</i> models that exhibit necrosis, this study demonstrates that a necrotic environment is required to maximize matrix-mediated myogenesis.</p>

Dynamics of thymus organogenesis and colonization in early human development
<p>The thymus is the central site of T-cell development and thus is of fundamental importance to the immune system, but little information exists regarding molecular regulation of thymus development in humans. Here we demonstrate, via spatial and temporal expression analyses, that the genetic mechanisms known to regulate mouse thymus organogenesis are conserved in humans. In addition, we provide molecular evidence that the human thymic epithelium derives solely from the third pharyngeal pouch, as in the mouse, in contrast to previous suggestions. Finally, we define the timing of onset of hematopoietic cell colonization and epithelial cell differentiation in the human thymic primordium, showing, unexpectedly, that the first colonizing hematopoietic cells are CD45<sup>+</sup>CD34<sup>int/-</sup>. Collectively, our data provide essential information for translation of principles established in the mouse to the human, and are of particular relevance to development of improved strategies for enhancing immune reconstitution in patients.</p>

<i>ATML1</i> promotes epidermal cell differentiation in <i>Arabidopsis</i> shoots
<p>Molecular mechanisms that generate distinct tissue layers in plant shoots are not well understood. <i>ATML1</i>, an <i>Arabidopsis</i> homeobox gene, is expressed in the outermost cell layer, beginning at an early stage of development. The promoters of many epidermis-specific genes, including <i>ATML1</i>, contain an ATML1-binding site called an L1 box, suggesting that ATML1 regulates epidermal cell fate. Here, we show that overexpression of <i>ATML1</i> was sufficient to activate the expression of epidermal genes and to induce epidermis-related traits such as the formation of stomatal guard cells and trichome-like cells in non-epidermal seedling tissues. Detailed observation of the division planes of these ectopic stomatal cells suggested that a near-surface position, as well as epidermal cell identity, were required for regular anticlinal cell division, as seen in wild-type epidermis. Moreover, analyses of a loss-of-function mutant and overexpressors implied that differentiation of epidermal cells was associated with repression of mesophyll cell fate. Collectively, our studies contribute new information about the molecular basis of cell fate determination in different layers of plant aerial organs.</p>

Atrial Fibrillation Burden in Young Patients With Congenital Heart Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) are assumed to be vulnerable to atrial fibrillation (AF) as a result of residual shunts, anomalous vessel anatomy, progressive valvulopathy, hypertension, and atrial scars from previous heart surgery. However, the risk of developing AF and the complications associated with AF in children and young adults with CHD have not been compared with those in control subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data from the Swedish Patient and Cause of Death registers were used to identify all patients with a diagnosis of CHD who were born from 1970 to 1993. Each patient with CHD was matched by birth year, sex, and county with 10 control subjects from the Total Population Register in Sweden. Follow-up data were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ed until 2011.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 21 982 patients (51.6% men) with CHD and 219 816 matched control subjects, 654 and 328 developed AF, respectively. The mean follow-up was 27 years. The risk of developing AF was 21.99 times higher (95% confidence interval, 19.26–25.12) in patients with CHD than control subjects. According to a hierarchical CHD classification, patients with conotruncal defects had the highest risk (hazard ratio, 84.27; 95% confidence interval, 56.86–124.89). At the age of 42 years, 8.3% of all patients with CHD had a recorded diagnosis of AF. Heart failure was the quantitatively most important complication in patients with CHD and AF, with a 10.7% (70 of 654) recorded diagnosis of heart failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The risk of AF in children and young adults with CHD was 22 times higher than that in matched control subjects. Up to the age of 42 years, 1 of 12 patients with CHD had developed AF, and 1 of 10 patients with CHD with AF had developed heart failure. The patient groups with the most complex congenital defects carried the greatest risk of AF and could be considered for targeted monitoring.</p></sec>

Sex Differences in the Presentation and Perception of Symptoms Among Young Patients With Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Some studies report that women are less likely to present with chest pain for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Information on symptom presentation, perception of symptoms, and care-seeking behaviors is limited for young patients with AMI.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We interviewed 2009 women and 976 men aged 18 to 55 years hospitalized for AMI at 103 US hospitals participating in the VIRGO study (Variation in Recovery: Role of Gender on Outcomes of Young AMI Patients). Structured patient interviews during the index AMI hospitalization were used to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong> information on symptom presentation, perception of symptoms, and care-seeking behaviors. We compared patient characteristics and presentation information by sex. Multivariable hierarchical logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between sex and symptom presentation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The majority of women (87.0%) and men (89.5%) presented with chest pain (defined as pain, pressure, tightness, or discomfort). Women were more likely to present with ≥3 associated symptoms than men (eg, epigastric symptoms, palpitations, and pain or discomfort in the jaw, neck, arms, or between the shoulder blades; 61.9% for women versus 54.8% for men, <i>P</i><0.001). In adjusted analyses, women with an ST-segment–elevation AMI were more likely than men to present without chest pain (odds ratio, 1.51; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–2.22). In comparison with men, women were more likely to perceive symptoms as stress/anxiety (20.9% versus 11.8%, <i>P</i><0.001) but less likely to attribute symptoms to muscle pain (15.4% versus 21.2%, <i>P</i>=0.029). Approximately 29.5% of women and 22.1% of men sought medical care for similar symptoms before their hospitalization (<i>P</i><0.001); however, 53% of women reported that their provider did not think these symptoms were heart-related in comparison with 37% of men (<i>P</i><0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The presentation of AMI symptoms was similar for young women and men, with chest pain as the predominant symptom for both sexes.

Impact of Regionalization of ST-Segment–Elevation Myocardial Infarction Care on Treatment Times and Outcomes for Emergency Medical Services–Transported Patients Presenting to Hospitals With Percutaneous Coronary Intervention
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Regional variations in reperfusion times and mortality in patients with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction are influenced by differences in coordinating care between emergency medical services (EMS) and hospitals. Building on the Accelerator-1 Project, we hypothesized that time to reperfusion could be further reduced with enhanced regional efforts.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Between April 2015 and March 2017, we worked with 12 metropolitan regions across the United States with 132 percutaneous coronary intervention–capable hospitals and 946 EMS agencies. Data were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ed in the ACTION (Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Network)-Get With The Guidelines Registry for quarterly Mission: Lifeline reports. The primary end point was the change in the proportion of EMS-transported patients with first medical contact to device time ≤90 minutes from baseline to final quarter. We also compared treatment times and mortality with patients treated in hospitals not participating in the project during the corresponding time period.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>During the study period, 10 730 patients were transported to percutaneous coronary intervention–capable hospitals, including 974 in the baseline quarter and 972 in the final quarter who met inclusion criteria. Median age was 61 years; 27% were women, 6% had cardiac arrest, and 6% had shock on admission; 10% were black, 12% were Latino, and 10% were uninsured. By the end of the intervention, all process measures reflecting coordination between EMS and hospitals had improved, including the proportion of patients with a first medical contact to device time of ≤90 minutes (67%–74%; <i>P</i><0.002), a first medical contact to device time to catheterization laboratory activation of ≤20 minutes (38%–56%; <i>P</i><0.0001), and emergency department dwell time of ≤20 minutes (33%–43%; <i>P</i><0.0001). Of the 12 regions, 9 regions reduced first medical contact to device time, and 8 met or exceeded the national goal of 75% of patients treated in ≤90 minutes. Improvements in treatment times corresponded with a significant reduction in mortality (in-hospital death, 4.4%–2.3%; <i>P</i>=0.001) that was not apparent in hospitals not participating in the project during the same time period.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Organization of care among EMS and hospitals in 12 regions was associated with significant reductions in time to reperfusion in patients with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction as well as in in-hospital mortality. These findings support a more intensive regional approach to emergency care for patients with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction.</p></sec>

Transplant-Free Survival and Interventions at 6 Years in the SVR Trial
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In the SVR trial (Single Ventricle Reconstruction), 1-year transplant-free survival was better for the Norwood procedure with right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery shunt (RVPAS) compared with a modified Blalock–Taussig shunt in patients with hypoplastic left heart and related syndromes. At 6 years, we compared transplant-free survival and other outcomes between the groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Medical history was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collect</span></strong>ed annually using medical record review, telephone interviews, and the death index. The cohort included 549 patients randomized and treated in the SVR trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Transplant-free survival for the RVPAS versus modified Blalock–Taussig shunt groups did not differ at 6 years (64% versus 59%, <i>P</i>=0.25) or with all available follow-up of 7.1±1.6 years (log-rank <i>P</i>=0.13). The RVPAS versus modified Blalock–Taussig shunt treatment effect had nonproportional hazards (<i>P</i>=0.009); the hazard ratio (HR) for death or transplant favored the RVPAS before stage II surgery (HR, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.48–0.92). The effect of shunt type on death or transplant was not statistically significant between stage II to Fontan surgery (HR, 1.36; 95% confidence interval, 0.86–2.17; <i>P</i>=0.17) or after the Fontan procedure (HR, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.33–1.74; <i>P</i>=0.52). By 6 years, patients with RVPAS had a higher incidence of catheter interventions (0.38 versus 0.23/patient-year, <i>P</i><0.001), primarily because of more interventions between the stage II and Fontan procedures (HR, 1.72; 95% confidence interval, 1.00–3.03). Complications did not differ by shunt type; by 6 years, 1 in 5 patients had had a thrombotic event, and 1 in 6 had had seizures.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>By 6 years, the hazards of death or transplant and catheter interventions were not different between the RVPAS versus modified Blalock–Taussig shunt groups. Children assigned to the RVPAS group had 5% higher transplant-free survival, but the difference did not reach statistical significance, and they required more catheter interventions.
